0,MartinHafer,"Amazing in the 60s, today it seems awfully overrated",6,7 October 2008,"THE GRADUATE is well into the top 250 Best Films on IMDb, yet I think it is highly overrated. That's because I think it scores so highly due to its impact when it was released and innovation, though today the movie seems, to me, flawed but interesting.Dustin Hoffman stars in one of his earliest films as a young college graduate who is extremely insecure and adrift emotionally. Into this aimlessness comes the very seductive friend of the family, Mrs. Robinson, who does practically everything a woman can do to seduce him. Eventually, Hoffman takes the ""forbidden fruit"" and begins an affair that is based only on sex. Heck, even after they become intimate, he continues calling her ""Mrs. Robinson"" and this continues for several months.Later, when the Robinsons' daughter (played by Katharine Ross) comes home from college to visit her parents, Hoffman is encouraged by all (except, of course, Mrs. Robinson) to date Ross. Despite only going on one date, Hoffman falls hopelessly in love and naturally chaos ensues when the truth is revealed.The film is very creative in many ways, such as with its sexual imagery and creative film shots. Examples are the creative cutting of scenes as well as images of the womb and several phallic references--all done in a rather subtle manner. I really liked how Hoffman's mother was deliberately made up to look like Mrs. Robinson--what a great Freudian device. Audiences of the day were obviously very shocked yet intrigued by all this sexual innuendo and blatant disregard for traditional values. Because its very amoral message was such a huge slap in the face of traditions during the same time that society was questioning itself in the 60s, it certainly doesn't seem surprising that the film was one of the biggest hits in film history. However, some creative shots, a very unusual script and the moral questions alone don't make for a movie that deserves to be rated so highly--that is unless the rating is simply for movies that have a huge impact on the film world (which this obviously did).What bothered me was not just that the message was morally questionable (at best) but that some of the movie was actually pretty poor and deserves a re-examination. First, much of the film was filmed like a music video and was perhaps the first film to do this. So, instead of a lot of speaking, often huge portions of the movie were dialog-free and consisted of very loud Simon & Garfunkle songs as montages filled the screen. A little of this went a long way, but the film used this technique repeatedly. Second, and this is by far me biggest complaint, is that the script really has some holes (though considering the film made a bazillion dollars, no one seemed to mind). Hoffman only dates Ross one time and decides to tell about his affair with the mother. While this is hard to believe, when he then stalks Ross incessantly and she finally agrees to marry Hoffman, it just strained believability to the breaking point. After all, she already was engaged to a man she knew very well AND this particular fiancé hadn't had sex with Mrs. Robinson!! Yet we are expected to believe that somehow it all works out in the end?! Overall, a very good and innovative film that comes with a really lousy and completely unbelievable ending. On top of all that (great choice of words), the film is very offensive to many out there--not just because of the sexuality but the way religion seems to be mocked at the end of the film as well as all the swearing. For me, a real mixed bag. I wanted to like it and there was some real creativity here, but 41 years later it really hasn't aged well.",The Graduate
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Wonderful, and one of Dustin Hoffmann's best roles",10,3 October 2010,"Much has been said about how good The Graduate is. I have one word really to say, Amen! This film is wonderful in every way, from the cinematography, to the acting to the soundtrack.ACTING- The acting is really quite excellent in The Graduate. In his first major role, Dustin Hoffmann(a great actor) is sensational as the innocent college graduate, while Anne Bancroft is also excellent as the older woman who seduces him. And Katherine Ross was surprisingly effective as the daughter Hoffmann's character falls for.DIRECTION- Mike Nichols' direction is very, very good, easily one of his best directing jobs. He ensures flawlessly that there isn't a single wasted scene while watching The Graduate. And in my opinion, he thoroughly deserved the best director Oscar.SCREENPLAY- I don't know when to start when saying how good The Graduate's script is. The humour is sophisticated and has the bite of a dry martini.CINEMATOGRAPHY- The Graduate also benefits hugely from having beautiful cinematography, and it is quite innovative too. It also has a sense of visual irony about it, especially in the scene where Hoffmann runs to the church.SOUNDTRACK- Maybe I am biased because I am very fond of Simon and Gunfunkel. In The Graduate, the soundtrack is so moving and beautiful, perfectly captures the mood of disaffected youth seething beneath the laid-back exteriors of the 1960s.STORY- The Graduate works brilliantly as a satire, and the story is never less than engaging and thoughtful.So all in all, The Graduate is a wonderful film on every level, one of my personal favourites of the 1960s that's for sure. 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Graduate
2,bkoganbing,Cougar On The Prowl,6,25 April 2010,"I finally got to see The Graduate having never seen it when it came out in 1967. At the time this film purportedly spoke to the young folks of The Sixties. If in fact it, it doesn't say a whole lot for my generation.We've got a name now for what Anne Bancroft is, we call those predatory older woman looking for young sex partners cougars. She and husband Murray Hamilton haven't been having much of a sex life for many years and she's not getting any younger. The question is asked by more than a few reviewers why would she choose the sexually inexperienced Dustin Hoffman, son of a couple that she and Hamilton socialize with. To me the answer is that part of her component is control. She doesn't want some young lady killing stud around who might just abruptly leave because there are other fish in the sea. Bancroft wants to control and dominate the situation.In the meantime Hoffman is having problems with his own parents, William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson. Daniels wants Hoffman to start job hunting and soon, we really don't know just how long Hoffman has been The Graduate so Daniels might just have a point. Wilson thinks it would really be nice if Dustin would find a nice girl and she's got the answer. She thinks that Dustin and Katharine Ross who is the daughter of Bancroft and Hamilton would make a proper wife. Here's where I have a problem with the film. Bancroft is one possessive woman and she ain't sharing Hoffman with her daughter. She's right though for the wrong reasons. Things like that tawdry affair that she and Hoffman have been having have a way of slipping out and that would just get too freakish for one family. Of course Hoffman being the dunce he is and feeling full of sexual confidence says he'll have her come what may. What may does come indeed.I don't want to reveal any more, but I think the ending that Mike Nichols has for this film is highly unrealistic, even if you just take the characters as generational symbols.The Graduate was a big hit back in the day and is considered a classic by many. It got Mike Nichols an Oscar for Best Director and nominations came for Dustin Hoffman for Best Actor, Anne Bancroft for Best Actress, Katharine Ross for Best Supporting Actress, Best Picture, and a few others. No one would argue that The Graduate isn't a well made film, I'm just not crazy about the message it sends.",The Graduate
3,Leofwine_draca,Cultural zeitgeist,5,13 January 2020,"THE GRADUATE is one of the classic movies of the late '60s, memorable for capturing the cultural zeitgeist of the era while at the same time launching the screen career of the one and only Dustin Hoffman. I found it an oddly unaffecting affair, let down by having a cast of largely unlikeable characters, all of whom seem to be out for themselves. Anne Bancroft gives the best turn as the alcoholic and desperate mother but the script doesn't treat her well, particularly in the latter stages. Mike Nichols' direction is so-so and the diving imagery didn't really work out too well for me. However, the Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack is wonderful and the best thing about this.",The Graduate
4,SnoopyStyle,great uncomfortable giggles,8,6 December 2014,"Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) returns home to Pasadena, California after recently graduating college. His parents throw him a party but he rather be alone contemplating his future. He drives Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) home which leads to an affair while he falls for her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross).Director Mike Nichols captures perfectly the daunting emptiness of impending future. Dustin Hoffman's performance is pitch perfect. He isn't the traditional leading man. He is flustered, lost and then angry. Anne Bancroft is a great cougar. There is an uncomfortableness to it all. Even the resolution isn't actually settled in the end. The brilliance of this movie is the shaky nature of everything that puts the audience on edge. It is loads of funny nervous giggles. Oh and there are the great Simon & Garfunkel songs.",The Graduate
5,Hitchcoc,The Voice of the Sixties,10,19 January 2015,"So much has been written about this film. Enter Dustin Hoffman into the world of cinema with Benjamin Braddock, ready to enter adulthood. Out of college and feeling cut loose from the womb, he begins to live. Unfortunately, he is disenfranchised by his own ennui. His parents begin to worry about him and he lapses into withdrawal. To the rescue comes the inimitable Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his next door neighbor. The affair that follows is one of the most comedic in cinema history. There are some great lines and a kind of sexual byplay that is absolutely captivating. Anne Bancroft is sensational as the neighborhood vamp. Enter Katherine Ross, the nubile daughter of the aforementioned Mrs. Robinson, and Benjamin realizes that this is his true love. Throw in all that great music by Simon and Garfunkel and a series of amazing images (outstanding cinematography) and you have a film for the ages.",The Graduate
6,Horst_In_Translation,Please Mrs. Robinson...,6,6 August 2017,"""The Graduate"" is an American English-language film from 1967, so it has its 50th anniversary this year and this is also the reason why it came back to theaters this year because it is a very special occasion. The film won recently deceased director Mike Nichols his only Oscar back then and it was also the only Oscar the movie won back then, but that sounds a bit derogative. That is quite a success obviously, especially as the film also scored many more nominations, including one for lead actor Dustin Hoffman and this film was his big breakthrough. Several other nods (and 2 wins) followed. His female co-lead Anne Bancroft probably had a better shot at winning and she was already an Oscar winner at that point. Add to that nominations for Supporting Actress, Cinematography, Screenplay and of course Best Picture. This is the story of a young man who ends up in a relationship with a much older woman before hopelessly falling in love with the woman's daughter. Hoffman was around the age of 30 in here and he clearly did not look like 20 as his character was supposed to be. But they had to make him that young because Bancroft was also younger than her character, the age difference between the actors was not that big. At one point they say she could have been his mother. Anyway, Mrs. Robinson is still considered among the greatest cougars / milfs in film history and the popularity of Bancroft's performance has turned the film into a classic really, even if overall this is a really personal story without any significance for society or the masses really. As a consequence, it is fitting the film competed as a comedy at the Golden Globes and was very triumphant there. I would call it a mix of comedy and drama and I would also add the romance genre that is missing here on IMDb for this title. You could maybe call it a lighter, less serious ""Love Story"".Anyway, I enjoyed watching these 105 minutes quite a bit. Good job from everybody involved in the production. The ending was somewhat cute too and did not feel too forced. Maybe the biggest thing the film tells us from a historic perspective is how different marriage is perceived today compared to back then. Ross' character ends up talking marriage with one guy while marrying another and hardly had any romantic (not to mention sexual) involvement with either really. And that was social standard back then. Very odd from today's perspective. The overacting was not existent with one exception perhaps, when Hoffman's character's mother finds out about his son's potential wedding. The first half of the film belongs to Bancroft, the second to Hoffman and I personally struggled to see Hoffman's character's clumsiness as realistic compared to his success (with women) about which we find out early. But yeah, maybe he was a bit of a nerd too, nut just a heart-throb. Bancroft is of course also lead in here. No Mrs. Robinson, no conflict at all in this movie as really both Hoffman's and Ross' characters' actions are constantly related to Mrs. Robinson. The music is amazing in this film. ""Mrs. Robinson"" and ""Sound of Silence"" are instant classics, the third song did not do too much for me. But this film reminded me again how much I love Simon (and Garfunkel). Finally, a personal note on the story: Throughout the entire film from the moment she tells him not to date her daughter, I expected Mrs. Robinson to carry a dark secret with her, namely that she had an affair with Hoffman's character's dad 20 years ago and that the girl is actually the protagonist's half-sister. The references to her pregnancy/marriage, to a blood test later on, her infidelity now and 2 or 3 other moments really made me sure we would get this revelation later on that she wanted to avoid incest between the kids. But apparently not. Quite surprising to me I must admit. Seems it was all just jealousy and the fear of losing her young lover to a younger version of herself. Okay, that is all I believe. I liked this film and I give it a thumbs-up. I'd maybe not call it a classic, but I sure recommend watching this pretty entertaining film.",The Graduate
7,Prismark10,The Graduate,9,18 September 2021,"Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) represents all the gawky young graduates who have left university and trying to figure out what is next for them in the big bad world.Back home in Pasadena, California his parents friends tell Benjamin that the future is his and it's in plastics.One middle aged sexually frustrated housewife knows just what Benjamin needs. One night Mrs Robinson (Anne Bancroft) asks Benjamin to drive her home and attempts to seduce Benjamin who is shocked.Having a casual fling with Mrs Robinson gives Benjamin some sexual confidence. His father is concerned that Benjamin is too lax about his future.Benjamin thinks he has found what he really desires when he takes Elaine Robinson (Katherine Ross) out one night. Mrs Robinson is horrified that the young man she seduced is now seeing her daughter.The shocking thing about The Graduate is that it won only one Oscar, Best Director for Mike Nicholls.It is another movie that represents the counterculture of the late 1960s. It takes a satirical swipe at the mores of middle aged wasps of post war America.Benjamin is not a revolutionary. He is shy, naive, sexually inexperienced and just wants some 'me; time. You sense that when he bursts in to tell his parents that he is going to marry Elaine.They are elated at first until they realise that Elaine has not been asked yet for her hand in marriage.The movie is filled with iconic scenes and elevated by the renowned songs from Simon & Garfunkel. The highlight being The Sound of Silence.The weak points are that Elaine and Benjamin's love affair is too rushed and feels underdeveloped. A political dimension is also missing. While Benjamin is sunning himself in the pool, there were young man being shipped off to Vietnam. It is only in the zoo scenes you glimpse some naval sailors.",The Graduate
8,claudio_carvalho,Unforgettable Movie for People of My Generation,8,10 February 2015,"After graduating in college, the twenty-year old Benjamin ""Ben"" Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) returns home and his parents give a party for him. The uptight and clumsy Ben feels uncomfortable and the wife of his father's business partner Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) asks a ride home to him. Soon she seduces the unexperienced Ben and they have a love affair. When Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine Robinson (Katharine Ross) returns home, Mrs. Robinson makes Ben to promise that will never date her. But soon Ben and Elaine fall in love with each other affecting the Robinson family.""The Graduate"" is an unforgettable movie for people of my generation. The story is dramatic and funny and Anne Bancroft is perfect in the role of the unbalanced Mrs. Robinson. Despite his actual age (30), Dustin Hoffman is hilarious and convinces in the role of an unexperienced young man seduced by the alcoholic wife of his father's partner. And Katharine Ross is extremely beautiful in the role of Elaine. The wonderful soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel fits perfectly to this great movie. The rushed conclusion is silly but adequate for those years, with the couple in a bus without knowing their destination in the bus and in life. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Primeira Noite de um Homem"" (""The First Night of a Man"")",The Graduate
9,classicsoncall,"""Well I would say that I'm just drifting...""",8,12 February 2011,"Whenever I hear the word 'Plastics' I think of this movie. It doesn't matter the context or what the conversation might otherwise be about. 'Plastics' represents all the hypocrisy and phoniness of people who have spent their adult lives in a systematic collection of stuff that ultimately has no value. It can be a career, money, awards or a big house and car. Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) surveys the life ahead of him and can only sense disillusionment and disappointment, because all of it is plastic.Everyone easily associates the 'Mrs. Robinson' song with this picture for the obvious reasons, but I had forgotten how ubiquitous 'Sounds of Silence' was as the story's connecting thread. It's there at the opening, a few times throughout the story, and at the finale. There's also repeat performances of 'Scarborough Faire' along with a nicely placed rendition of 'April Come She Will'. With today's viewing, I couldn't help think that the picture was intended to be a showcase for Simon & Garfunkel's musical catalog, thereby distracting somewhat from the message of the story. I even got sidetracked into wondering why they hadn't put 'At the Zoo' in the soundtrack for that scene where Elaine goes to meet Carl Smith, but that would have been too decidedly upbeat for the picture. Besides, I think it came out a couple of years later.If you like your pictures with happy endings, I'm not so sure this is going to work out so well for you beyond the closing credits. What appears to be a glorious reunion between Ben and Elaine (Katharine Ross) at the finale winds up dissolving into one of those question marks about 'Where do we go from here'? With the same vantage point as the other riders on the bus, the viewer is left watching a couple with no sense of who they are and no clear destination. Not exactly the way one would want to spend the rest of his or her life.",The Graduate
10,gavin6942,A Film That Stands The Test of Time,8,15 August 2009,"Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) is seduced by his parents' friend, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft). If that's not bad enough, Ben soon falls for her daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross), and life around Ben begins to collapse. Where is he to turn? Now, I could heap praise on this film. Sure, why not? AFI likes it, the IMDb likes it, everyone more or less knows it's a classic, parodied by Will Ferrell, ""Wayne's World"" and Jon Secada, among others. So, I'm not going to talk about the stellar acting or directing (Mike Nichols does few films, but has some amazing ones)... because everyone does that.What I want to ask is this: who is the hero of this film? Roger Ebert reviewed this film twice -- once in 1967 and again in 1997. Originally, he sided with Ben Braddock, but upon reflection understood that the interesting character is Mrs. Robinson. I have to wonder, is anyone in this film worth rooting for? Ben is a shiftless, lazy homebody who takes a college career and squanders it. When confronted with the offer of a sexual liaison, despite knowing it's a bad idea, allows it to consume him. He goes on to fall in love with a girl who he has, as near as I can tell, only taken on one date, and chooses to marry her rather than pursue school, a job or other women. He then brings shame on the entire Robinson family.Mrs. Robinson, who has no first name and thus no identity apart from being a wife, is a cultured woman who fell into the trap of marriage. We can sympathize with her for this, but where she takes it seems foolish and spiteful. If she wanted an affair, other men would have made more rational choices. She tears apart her family, pits the Braddocks against the Robinsons, and rather than help set up her daughter with Ben, prematurely ruins their chances.Elaine Robinson is odd. College educated, she comes off as daft. She dates and nearly marries a man, then just as quickly flees him. Like her mother, she seems to throw away education and freedom for married life. She tends to be attracted to Ben, even after knowing about his affair, which would normally be a deal breaker. She appears the victim in all this, but is not really a deep enough character to really identity with.In short, this is a tragedy disguised as a comedy. There are darkly humorous moments and a light-hearted ending, but things seem to end poorly for everyone involved -- even Ben and Elaine are unlikely to find true love once they finally set about together. What a mess.",The Graduate
11,lee_eisenberg,"Here's to you, Anne Bancroft!",10,2 July 2005,"Anne Bancroft's recent passing brings ""The Graduate"" back into our minds. It was of course one of my parents' generations favorite movies. Some people may just think of it as a story about young Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) stuck in a weird relationship with the much older Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), but it really is more than that. It embodies America's move away from the innocent, prudish mindset that had held sway for so long. Obviously, Ben is learning about sex from Mrs. Robinson, and then gets interested in her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross). The movie also makes an interesting use of telling us things without anyone talking: in one scene, Ben unbuttons his shirt, which says as much as any words could have. As IMDb.com noted, none of the adults had first names, a reference to the ubiquitous generation gap. Anyway, 1967 was certainly the year in which American movies made a giant step into the new mold, with ""The Graduate"", ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""In the Heat of the Night"" (some people might also include ""To Sir with Love"" and ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner""). ""Sound of Silence"" may have been ""The Graduate""'s theme song, but the movie itself will never go silent.Oh, and one more thing. It appears that two ""Bewitched"" cast members appeared in ""The Graduate"": Alice Ghostley (Esmerelda) and Marion Lorne (Aunt Clara). Although they never appeared together in any ""Bewitched"" episodes on account of Lorne dying before Ghostley joined the cast, I now have to imagine Esmerelda and Aunt Clara telling Samantha of a strange young man's relationship with an older woman. Well...",The Graduate
12,jboothmillard,The Graduate,8,15 August 2006,"It may be odd to think nowadays that this film changed opinions of sex in films, but then again, you can see how with the premise, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe director Mike Nichols (The Birdcage, Closer). Basically confused 21-year-old Benjamin Braddock (BAFTA and Golden Globe - and nominated, and Oscar nominated Dustin Hoffman, in his debut role) has just graduated from college, and his parents expect him to do great things. At his ""Homecoming"" party, the wife of his father's business partner, Mrs. Robinson (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Anne Bancroft) seems like she is trying to seduce Ben, which she denies, but she gets him to drive her home, and a glimpse of her naked body (very quick flashes). Ben does give in to her desire for him, and so starts an affair at a hotel, and continues many times after, but things will get complicated when he finds himself falling for Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine (Golden Globe nominated, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Katharine Ross). Ben does tell Elaine he was sleeping with an older woman, and she is traumatised when she realises it's her own mother, and she therefore goes ahead with a wedding to guy she doesn't truly love as much. In the end, a great ending I might add, Ben tracks Elaine's church down, and he rushes to it to get his true love back, and even though she has got married, she still knows Ben is the right guy, and they both run out catching the bus. Also starring William Daniels as Mr. Braddock, Jaws' Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robinson and Elizabeth Wilson as Mrs. Braddock. Hoffman is very good in his first leading role, Bancroft adds sauciness to the story, the story itself is nothing but fantastic, and the film is accompanied by some good songs by (Paul) Simon and (Art) Garfunkel, a very good classic satirical comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Film Editing and Best Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay.

13,ccthemovieman-1,One Giant Leap For Immorality,2,5 November 2005,"This is the beginning of what I would call ""popular or glossy sleaze"" in which morally bankrupt people are given credence and credibility, where doing the wrong things is glamorized in American films.That is done either through having attractive-looking actors whom people like to see, humor in the story masking the bad messages, nice photography or the film is done by a popular director or producer, thus giving it further credence. In this film, it's all of the above.This is the year profanity entered American movies and Dustin Hoffman wastes no time abusing Jesus' name. Anne Bancroft tries to make a little thing out of adultery. Katherine Ross shows no commitment to marriage and the wedding ceremony, and the rest of the adults here are pictured as very superficial, stupid, materialistic clowns....but that's not all bad, according to filmmakers, most of whom exhibit the same ""qualities.""This movie set the tone for the rest of garbage that has followed since. This overrated ""classic"" is just one big soap opera. It caused quite a stir for its time with some daring sex.

14,Tweekums,A classic film about two very different relationships,9,26 August 2012,"It is hard to believe that this film is almost forty five years old; obviously some scenes are of that time but the story itself is timeless. A young Dustin Hoffman plays Ben Braddock; a young man who has just graduated and returned home to California. After a party to celebrate his homecoming family friend Mrs. Robinson asks Ben to drive him home; once there she starts flirting with him. He understandably feels very awkward; on the one hand she is an attractive woman; on the other she is considerably older than him, married and a friend of his parents. Nothing happens that night but it isn't long before an affair begins; there is nothing romantic about it though; they barely talk and don't do anything apart from have sex. Things get more awkward when Mr Robinson suggests that Ben should invite his daughter Elaine out... something Mrs Robinson has absolutely forbidden him to do. Eventually he gives in to pressure and takes her out on a deliberately bad date; something unexpected happens though; he falls in love with her. Clearly Benjamin's life is going to get even more complicated now!This film is rightly considered a classic; the scenes between Ben and Mrs Robinson are delightfully awkward in a way that can make the viewer feel mildly uncomfortable in the way that Ben obviously does. Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft are great in the roles... it is unusual to see characters involved in an affair having so little chemistry between them... to such a degree that Ben never calls her anything but Mrs Robinson. That can't be said about the relationship between Ben an Elaine, played by the beautiful Katharine Ross; here there is an obvious chemistry and it is obvious that Ben is obsessed by her and is determined to marry her... even when he is sure she can't stand him! While there is much drama in the film there are also some nice unexpected laughs; the final scene in the church is both surprising and very funny!

15,moonspinner55,Rebelliousness and reality...,8,8 October 2005,"I'm not sure why evil, decadent Mrs. Robinson sets her sights on dazed and shy college grad Benjamin Braddock, son of the middle-aged couple she and her husband socialize with; it's never really explained, and neither is Benjamin's sexual past (it's hinted that he's a virgin when they end up in a hotel room together). It's also not explained why Mrs. Robinson definitely does not want Benjamin to get to know her daughter (she's angrily adamant about it, even willing to expose her own affair to prevent the two kids from going out for a drive!). Despite the gaps in the narrative and the lapses in logic (and taste, some might say), ""The Graduate"" is still a landmark film, crystallizing the helplessness of the '60s. Surprisingly, the ultimate theme of the movie is love--an impulsive, rebellious kind of love, but still the rather old-fashioned notion of love conquering all. And yet this brings up another question: is Benjamin really in love with sweet college girl Elaine or is she just a conquest? Or maybe the best thorn he can stick in Mrs. Robinson's side? Benjmain is told he cannot see her, he cannot have her, and that surely fuels his desire to marry her. The film presents love as the answer, but then (with an amusing, sobering final shot) second-guesses itself. ""The Graduate"" doesn't dig too deeply, it's lightweight (even with Dustin Hoffman's outburst in the church--the only time the movie gets some fury going), but it does take chances; it wasn't ahead of its time, it just came along at the right time and is still a relevant, glossy modern comedy. ***1/2 from ****",The Graduate
16,Quinoa1984,"A film that still holds up thirty-six years later, though not to the fullest extent it's hyped to be",10,5 August 2003,"The Graduate, when released in 1967 (i.e. Summer of Love 1967), was a stirring, hugely entertaining event for the generation that embraced sex, drugs, rock and roll, more sex, more drugs, and then, for the most part, became what the parents wanted Benjamin to be.  That's the only reason The Graduate doesn't hold up like Easy Rider, Bonnie and Clyde, or Five Easy Pieces- Dustin Hoffman's Benjamin Braddock, while as keen and funny an uneasy and unsure young man can get, isn't exactly a representation of a time capsule of the angst, rebellion, and freedom of characters like Wyatt and Billy or Robert Dupea.  He's more of a representation of the common suburbanite male , who feels all the pressure of parents and their friends, and is in the conflicts of love, lust, and livelihood.  It's questionable whether or not Benjamin would leave the comfort of the pool he dwells in for free-love concerts and LSD.And yet, Oscar winning director Mike Nichols realizes that the story of the torn young man is prime for certain experimentation, not only in the dialog and mannerisms of his actors (which, especially from Hoffman, are hilarious), but from the techniques he uses in Robert Surtees' camera-work and Sam O'Steen's editing tricks.  Most notable of these techniques are the following: the subliminal nudity when Mrs. Robinson first ""reveals"" herself to Benjamin, the mis-en-scene/positions of the characters in certain scenes and moments (i.e. when Elaine finds out about the affair and Mrs. Robinson says ""Goodbye, Benjamin"", look how the camera pulls back on her and how she's a complete 180 from how she was in the first seduction); a jump cut from a swim in the pool to a moment in bed that's up there on the list with the bone turning into the ship in 2001; the way the over-head shots on Benjamin when he's at the college how he seems dwarfed among the rest of the world; and one of the finest climaxes of the sixties with the quick close ups of the attendees mouthing their curses and slander at the frantic Benjamin on the window.  As a film in and of itself, there's much to look for in repeat viewings that give extra hints on some emotions or intentions from the director or writer.And then there are the performances.  Hoffman, as mentioned, is splendid in how he balances between stingy and awkward, scared and determined, and that he's the center-point in a largely first person (late) coming of age tale. And his counterpart for nearly half of the movie, Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson, has a balancing act of her own- she can be alluring, demanding, sweet (with a vodka in hand), and sour, and in that sense she's the most fascinating character of the film.  She has the persona of a stern mother who's wanting to feel a little rebellious herself, and finds moments of relief with the son of her best friends.  The one performance that doesn't work today or back in the day for that matter, however, is Katharine Ross' Elaine Robinson.  While she's not like her mother, she is at her will before and after she finds out about a secret she's been hiding.  She's set to marry a blonde jock, and, until the climax, is like a puppet.  It's the least convincing character and performance of the lot, and a certain scream she has in a scene is a little too scathing for comfort.  Murray Hamilton (of Jaws fame), for the short amount of time he's on screen, is near impecable.So, would I reccommend The Graduate for younger audiences?  Yes I would, it has the classic comedy-of-manners that is instantly recognizable, in particular as an influence on the American Pie movies (coincidentally, Jason Biggs portrayed Benjamin on Broadway), and is a good starter for those who have an interest in what the old man and old lady were watching when cool was solid.  Would I reccommend it for those from the generation that cherished it and made it part of American film history?  Hard to say and here's why, some may wonder why they enjoyed it so much when the characters may have lost their ""edge"", and others will love it as much as they did when it first premiered.  I'd say it's worth the view, if only for the wedding scene, and for those three little diddies by Simon and Garfunkel.  Grade: A (like a 93 or 94)",The Graduate

19,sunwarrior13,The Graduate Is A Classic,10,9 September 2012,"The Graduate is a comedy-drama film directed by Mike Nichols.It is based on the novel,The Graduate by Charles Webb. The screenplay was by Buck Henry and Calder Willingham. The film tells the story of Benjamin Braddock,played by Dustin Hoffman, a recent university graduate with no well-defined aim in life, who is seduced by an older woman, Mrs. Robinson,portrayed by Anne Bancroft, and then proceeds to fall in love with her daughter Elaine,played by Katharine Ross.Mentally adrift the summer after graduating from college, suburbanite Benjamin Braddock would rather float in his parents' pool than follow adult advice about his future. But the exhortation of family friend Mr. Robinson to seize every possible opportunity inspires Ben to accept an offer of sex from icily feline Mrs. Robinson. The affair and the pool are all well and good until Ben is pushed to go out with the Robinsons' daughter Elaine and he falls in love with her. Mrs. Robinson sabotages the relationship and an understandably disgusted Elaine runs back to college. Determined not to let Elaine get away, Ben follows her to school and then disrupts her family-sanctioned wedding. None too happy about her pre-determined destiny, Elaine flees with Ben -- but to what?This film at once reflected the generation gap and also widened it, giving youths a clear voice, indigenous music, all adults portrayed as villains, and a sympathetic anti-hero, played to perfection by Dustin Hoffman in a career-making turn. Also,it remains relevant at present especially with new graduates who experience post-college burnout feeling as exposed in this film.Also,it provides a comedy of tragedy in which a man's youthful idealism is dealt its inevitable deathblow.That is why it is a classic.",The Graduate

I understood the conflict Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) was going through.  Now 20 years later, I STILL love it!  If anything, I understand it more this time!  The acting, direction, soundtrack are all superb.  This is one those rarities--a movie that doesn't date at all.  A must-see!  TRy to see it letterboxed--the full screen version doesn't capture the incredible direction (and renders a few scenes incomprehensible).",The Graduate
21,LeonLouisRicci,Delightfully Dry,8,1 March 2013,"A Film Comedy that at its wits is as dry as a Martini and as a Film Romance it is as plastic as the lifestyle of those it criticizes. A sharp looking and creatively edited piece of the 1960's newly emerging, anti-establishmentarianism. This was a ""new"" way to use Cinema, breaking taboos and pandering to the moral shattering of its ""hip"" audience riding the New Wave of Artistic expression. A timepiece to be sure, its basic storyline of intergenerational sex and rebelliousness without a cause is not as easily approached today as it was in 1967.The second half and the unfortunately contrived ending are nowhere as good as the first half, but it isn't so bad that it ruins the rest. It just is a bit of a letdown and seems forced and faked. A shame because the best of this is not at all that. It is naturally quirky and overplayed somewhat to give it a biting, surreal feel.The songs, inventively intersected for the day, now seem overused, if not completely overdone. The performances are spot on and along with the innovative Director have made this a reflection of its time and should be embraced for its fresh, seductive style.

Personally I was glad to see the likes of Norman Fell, Murry Hamilton, William Daniels etc not to mention an uncredited Richard Dreyfus.

24,Boba_Fett1138,"A really enjoyable movie, above all things.",8,10 September 2011,"When people think of this movie they often seem to forget that this actually a comedy. And a pretty good one it is! It's a very simple movie, in about every way imaginable. It was a very cheap film to make, with a very simple and straightforward story in it but none of this is a downside really, since the movie actually is all more about being subtle with its approach and its storytelling.Its simplicity actually makes this a very honest and sweet little film. It makes the characters human and believable ones and all of the emotions and actions within this movie sensible and easy to identify with.But like I said, people foremost shouldn't forget that this is actually being a comedy. It's so easy to see or remember this movie as a drama, with perhaps some thriller elements in it, since the premise of the movie actually make it seem that way. It's also not really a comedy that tries to force its comedy upon you. Just like the entire movie; the comedy is subtle. It's also not the sort of stuff that will make you laugh at loud but it does occasional put on smile on your face and its approach makes the movie a very pleasant one to follow. You could really thank director Mike Nichols for this, since its a style and approach that he has mastered and has put to use in some of his other movies. Pretty surprising from a guy who prior to this had only directed one movie, which was a completely different one as well, namely; ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"".The story does at times looses some of its focus though and we just have to assume- and take for granted a lot of things within the movie. This isn't always really working but it in no way ever makes the movie a bad one to watch, just a not perfect one, which is no big shame of course really.The movie is also being made really better by its actors. It actually made me realize once more what a great comedy actor Dustin Hoffman actually is. His delivery and timing is absolutely spot on at times. It actually was one of his first real movie roles, which makes his achievement ever more impressive. Also a fun fact hat he only was only 6 years Anne Bancroft's junior, even though in the story she was supposed to be twice the age of the Hoffman character.It's a (deliberatly) minimalistic made movie but that is really not saying anything about the quality of this movie, which is simply very high. Just take the Robert Surtees cinematography for instance, which was simply superb. It got also nominated for an Oscar and really should had won as well, in my opinion. The movie was further more nominated in 6 more categories but it strangely enough only won in the best director category. I say strangely enough, since it is quite unusual for a movie to only receive an Oscar for the best director and win nothing else. But Mike Nichols still of course deserved it though. It's a really well made and directed movie by him! It also was the only Oscar he has won, till date.A really good but above all things also a really enjoyable movie to watch! Even after all those years it hasn't lost any of its power.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Graduate
25,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,It's almost unreal how good it is,10,22 November 2009,"The fact that this remains so relevant, when it so perfectly satirized everything wrong with the 60's, is equal parts unnerving and a credit to how thoroughly it nails numerous of the darker aspects of us as a species. Every young person can relate to Ben, played flawlessly by a young and already talented Dustin Hoffman, whose troubles simply seem to keep piling up. More than a mere love story, this captures that sense of an uncertain yet steadily approaching future, not to mention the obnoxious situations that our lead finds himself in. The comedy that comes from most of them tends to be great, if it can be a tad annoying here and there. It never tries too hard, and it usually feels natural, getting laughs from stuff we can relate to. Bancroft is deliciously seductive and playful in her performance, without the character degenerating into nothing other than a sex object. Nichols the master directs it all brilliantly. The editing(as seen in the famous sequence that has been parodied and referenced countless times) and cinematography are amazing, with subtlety and smart camera angles and cuts. Superficiality, hollow values and the problems the generation gap causes, all far too prevalent at the time this was made in the environment that it depicts, are torn apart. The music by Simon & Garfunkel is beautiful and poetic, and the rest of the tunes are marvelous, as well. There is a little nudity and some potentially disturbing content in this. I recommend this to any and all fans of drama. 10/10",The Graduate

27,evanston_dad,Thank You Mr. Nichols,10,11 January 2007,"Thank you, Mike Nichols, for giving us ""The Graduate,"" because it, along with the superb ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" finally blew the cobwebs off of the Hollywood film and gave movie audiences something immediate and relevant. Because of the audacity of directors like Nichols and Penn (and Peckinpah and Hopper and Schlesinger and Kubrick) the 1960s are now known as the decade that ushered in a movie renaissance when they could have been known instead as the decade that gave us ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Cleopatra."" ""The Graduate"" just has a different feel to it as compared to many of its contemporaries that's hard to explain if you can't see it. Like ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" it's about restless characters, and the movie feels restless too. It's quick, jittery, fast paced. The camera moves and does original things. Actors seem to be occupying real three-dimensional space rather than manufactured studio sets. And then there's that fantastic Simon and Garfunkel score, the first time a pop soundtrack was so integral a part of a film narrative (and its marketing). While studios were still trying to churn out big-budget, ponderous Biblical and historical epics, or antiquated musicals that felt like products made especially for grandma and grandpa, ""The Graduate"" feels like a product aimed squarely at the youth market, and reassures young people that film has something to say to them. And let's not forget that the movie also introduced audiences to Dustin Hoffman, who would be such a major player in said film renaissance in the upcoming decade.Grade: A+",The Graduate
28,ferguson-6,Completely Baked,10,9 August 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's the 45th anniversary of this film's release and it was awarded a limited theatrical re-release, which I took advantage of last evening. Unlike so many films, the big screen doesn't really bring anything special here, but then, it really doesn't require any assistance. I fall into the category of those who consider this one of the all-time best films. Not only is it off-the-charts entertaining, the dialogue is brilliant, the performances are pitch perfect, and the camera work and soundtrack are highly complimentary.As my number of viewings have increased over the years, I have become a true admirer of the performance of Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson. It is heart-breaking and emotional. The first glimpse of her always makes me smile ... she is in the background as Ben (Dustin Hoffman) pinballs through the party trying to avoid the clutches of his parents' friends. Her scene in bed when she tells Ben about her college background in art and how her dreams came crashing down, her voice and facial features are filled with pain. Watch the movie from Mrs. Robinson's point of view and my guess is you too will have a renewed understanding.Of course, the age differences of the lead actors breaks all of my ""movie pet peeve"" rules. Dustin Hoffman was 30 at the time and he is playing a soon to turn 21 year old Ben. Anne Bancroft has a line to Ben where she says she is ""twice your age"". Actually, she was only 36 at the time, and Katharine Ross (Elaine) was 27. Also, William Daniels who plays Ben's dad, was only 10 years older than Hoffman.The movie is based on the Charles Webb novel and the screenplay was written by Buck Henry, who also plays the hotel clerk with whom Ben has an ongoing dialogue. Calder Willingham is also credited thanks to a lawsuit brought after the fact. The director, Mike Nichols has had a terrific career, and was also a co-founder of Chicago's Second City Improv. He is also one of only 12 EGOT's: winners of an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony. One of Mr. Nichols' most famous collaborators is Elaine May, who plays the roommate who delivers the note to Ben ... and is the target of a most interesting camera angle.There are so many iconic moments and shots from the film. Everyone is aware of Mr. McGuire's ""Plastics"" advice to Ben, and we see Norman Fell as Ben's landlord who has no appreciation for ""agitators"". It's also fun to note that we see a glimpse of a young Richard Dreyfuss who says he'll ""get the cops"", and Mike Farrell (from MASH) makes his film debut as a bellhop at the hotel. It's also the final screen performance for Alice Ghostley, who many know from ""Bewitched"". One of the most famous film posters in history shows Dustin Hoffman photographed through the leg of Mrs. Robinson. Actually, that leg belongs to Linda Gray, who went on to fame as Sue Ellen Ewing in the ""Dallas"" TV series. It should also be noted that the pivotal Taft Hotel in the film is actually the very famous Ambassador Hotel, which of course, is where Presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy was assassinated in 1968. The hotel was later demolished in 2005.On a personal note, some of my favorite moments in the film include the shot of Mr Robinson reflected in the glass top table as she arrives for her first night with Ben. Also, director Nichols allows the camera to linger on a furious and disgusted Bancroft as Hoffman shows up for his date with Elaine. And yes, it should be mentioned that Katharine Ross became the ""dream girl"" of the 1960's thanks to this role and her role in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. As for the Simon and Garfunkel music, the most interesting piece is the unfinished ""Mrs. Robinson"" song that Nichols selected, even though Paul Simon presented it to him as ""Mrs. Roosevelt"" (as in Eleanor). Singing only the chorus and relying on acoustic guitar and an endless supply of Di-di-di's, the unfinished version is a perfect fit for Ben's pursuit of Elaine. One of my guilty pleasures from the film is courtesy of Murray Hamilton who seems to just choke on his lines as he spits them out to Ben - in both of their key scenes together. Hamilton went on to be Mayor of Amity in Jaws, but his career peak was in not shaking hands with Ben.Though it's not technically the final shot, the faces of Elaine and Ben on the bus is one of the most memorable endings in movie history ... the cherry on top for one of my absolute favorite films.

29,HotToastyRag,It's just not likable,5,19 September 2020,"I know The Graduate is a total classic that everybody feels they have to watch and subsequently praise, but I find the story very unenjoyable. I'm not a feminist, but it's so textbook ""every man's fantasy"" it's sickening. The protagonist is a floundering college graduate who feels the weight of the world's problems when he doesn't have any. That type of character gets under my skin; I don't find him easy to root for. Having an affair with a sexy, older woman who can show him the ropes is enough of a fantasy, but when he also romances her daughter, it becomes too offensive to like. In real life, he would be looked at as a despicable person. But, since he's in a movie, he becomes glorified?If you've never seen this movie, then you've obviously never been to film school. I saw it for the second time when my university screened it in the big theater. For the second time, I thought Anne Bancroft was beautiful, and I vowed to get a gray streak in my hair when I was older, but I still didn't like Dustin Hoffman's character. If you've never seen it and you feel you should, go ahead and rent it. I prefer the spinoff, Rumor Has It.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

So what's not to like? For a film that reacts negatively to the word ""plastic"", that's just how I feel about the characters and setting. Nothing about this film feels particularly real, certainly not the affair of Ben and Mrs. Robinson(Anne Bancroft) which not only isn't believable, it doesn't make sense, feels utterly manufactured and wrong. Katharine Ross as his girlfriend reacts to the news believably, but the ending will leave the viewer up in the air, since it, while dramatically staged, feels forced and unsatisfying.

31,Sylviastel,Unforgettable!,10,12 May 2007,"I still remember the way that the camera had focused on Bancroft's legs as she was putting on pantyhose or stockings as Ben Braddock played by a younger Dustin Hoffman was talking to her. The odd couple of mature, sensual, Mrs. Robinson and the college graduate, Benjamin Braddock. Who could forget the first time that Mrs. Robinson was completely naked and offered her assistance in helping Ben with sexual liberation. Of course, the two get together at hotels. It isn't until Mrs. Robinson's daughter played by the beautiful Katharine Ross comes into the picture and Ben falls for her just as she had for him. Sadly, Mrs. Robinson is not amused with the romance and losing Ben to her own daughter. It sounds like an episode of Jerry Springer just not in a trailer park but in a lovely Southern Californian development. The rest of the cast is magnificent featuring William Daniels, Murray Hamilton, Alice Ghostley, Buck Henry, Elizabeth Wilson, and others. It's a great film!",The Graduate
32,Mr-Fusion,"Undoubtedly a product of its time, and that ain't a bad thing.",8,3 March 2014,"I can't say this without a hint of shame, but my first exposure to ""The Graduate"" was that scene in ""Wayne's World 2"" (""Sorry! Wrong wedding!""). So I came into this movie thinking it was some kind of underdog thing for Dustin Hoffman's character. But there's an appropriate ugliness to this film that disabuses one of that notion very quickly. He's not a character to root for, at all. And there's a sadness to the film's outcome when all is said and done because these are not smart people. That said, Anne Bancroft can seduce any man with that voice. She ends up pretty hateful in the end, but man, she worked her sultry magic. And Katherine Ross, though she's not playing the sharpest knife in the drawer, does a terrific job in such a thankless role. And this is the funniest performance I've ever seen from Dustin Hoffman, suffering in his terrified awkwardness in the face of a classic '60s cougar (damn if Bancroft didn't pioneer that culture). ""The Graduate""'s a classic for good reason; great soundtrack (relying on only three songs), great characters, and indeed a well-photographed movie. And it leaves us with some nice ambiguity by the end credits (not a happy ending, personally). It's a well-made film.",The Graduate
33,christopher-underwood,full of ambiguities and contradictions,8,5 May 2019,"I've always had something of a problem with this film. At the time of its theatrical release I was the same age as Dustin Hoffman was playing in the film (even though he was actually ten years older) and I had just got married. Also, and certainly at the time more importantly, there was the music. I had been a great fan of Paul Simon's and this soundtrack seemed overly sweetened with the use of Garfunkel's voice. However that is all a long time ago now and I found much pleasure in watching this on Blu-ray. Hoffman still seems a bit old for a college kid rebelling against his parents, Anne Bancroft still doesn't strike me as sexy and the whole setting seems so awfully privileged and stifling, whilst, of course, at the same time allowing these 'kids' to motor around in sports cars and to give no thought to work. However, the film is well put together, the performances are uniformly good and Buck Henry's script seems spot on. Even if Hoffman's character does seem rather spoiled there is enough believable angst to have some sympathy and to enjoy the very end. Here, also though, I know notice, nothing is anything like as clear cut as seemed a few minutes earlier, which is good. The film is full of ambiguities and contradictions and it is why, in the end, it works so well.",The Graduate

35,JamesHitchcock,A Sound of Silence,10,17 October 2006,"When I reviewed ""Rebel Without a Cause"" I said that it was probably the best film ever about coming of age. I still hold that view, but ""The Graduate"" is its closest rival. The central character Benjamin Braddock, although older than Jim Stark in the earlier film, is another ""rebel without a cause"". He is, admittedly, an unlikely rebel, this being the late sixties when there were plenty of rebels with causes they passionately believed in. He has no political views, does not take drugs, wears his hair short, dresses smartly and has remained a virgin throughout the era of free love.Benjamin has recently graduated, probably from a prestigious East Coast university, and returns to his parents' house in an upper-class suburb of Los Angeles where he receives a triumphant welcome. Benjamin's problem is one that affects many university graduates. He does not know what to do with the rest of his life. His academic life, and accompanying sporting and extracurricular activities, have provided him with such a sense of intellectual and emotional satisfaction that anything else is likely to seem an anti-climax. His degree is a triumph which nothing in the rest of his life seems likely to equal. The idea of settling down into a routine job (in one famous scene a friend of his father advises him to get into plastics) does not appeal to him, but he cannot think of anything else to do with this life. (He tells his father that he wants his future to be ""different"").Benjamin drifts into an affair with Mrs Robinson, the wife of his father's business partner. (We never learn her Christian name). She is happy to use Benjamin for sex, although he is looking for a more committed relationship. The two have little in common, and Benjamin's attempts to engage Mrs Robinson in conversation fall disastrously flat. Eventually his parents, supported by Mr Robinson (who at this stage knows nothing of his wife's affair), engineer a date between him and the Robinsons' daughter Elaine. Benjamin and Elaine find themselves falling for one another, but Mrs Robinson is furious at this development and, prompted by a complex mixture of emotions (partly jealousy, partly the feeling that an aimless drifter who sleeps with a married woman is not a suitable match for her daughter), does everything she can to frustrate the romance, even threatening to tell her husband the whole truth if Benjamin dates Elaine.I was surprised to read Roger Ebert's recent review in which he recanted his youthful enthusiasm for ""The Graduate"" and concluded that it was merely a sixties period piece. Surprised, because my own experience was very different- I fell in love with the film when I first saw it in my student days more than twenty years ago and still love it today. (I feel- although the Academy clearly disagreed- that it should have won the ""Best Picture"" Oscar in 1968). Why do I love it? Well, let me count the ways. Firstly, I love it because I love Simon and Garfunkel (in my view up there with the Beatles) who provide the soundtrack with some of their finest songs, ""The Sound of Silence"", ""Scarborough Fair"" and, of course, ""Mrs Robinson"". All of these have some relevance to the plot; ""Scarborough Fair"" is about lost love and ""The Sound of Silence"" (among other things) about the difficulty of communicating with words.Secondly, I love the film for its well-written and often witty dialogue- the ""plastics"" scene and lines such as ""Mrs Robinson, I think you're trying to seduce me"" have remained with me ever since my first viewing. Thirdly, there is the famous ending, among the most memorable and emotionally satisfying endings of any movie.Then there is the acting, above all two performances of a lifetime from Anne Bancroft and Dustin Hoffman. Much has been made of the fact that, although there is supposed to be about twenty years difference between the ages of Mrs Robinson and Benjamin, Bancroft was only six years older than Hoffman. In my view, however, that does not affect the quality of their acting at all. Hoffman is completely believable as Benjamin- shy, gauche, confused and lacking in self-confidence, but possessed of an inner decency and integrity. In a distinguished acting career he has made a number of great films- ""Tootsie"", ""Death of a Salesman"" and ""Rain Man"" all come to mind- but this is still my favourite. As for Anne Bancroft, although she made many films, when she died last year ""The Graduate"" was the one mentioned in all the obituaries. Her Mrs Robinson is in her late thirties or early forties, beautiful, seductive and sophisticated. She is also deeply unhappy- an alcoholic, bored with her marriage and with life in general. Although she behaves badly towards Benjamin, Bancroft makes her a character with whom we can sympathise. Her life took a wrong turning when she became pregnant as a student and was forced into a shotgun marriage, and has found herself trapped ever since.Finally, I love ""The Graduate"" for the timeless way it deals with the generation gap. Hoffman and Mike Nichols could have made Benjamin into a typical sixties rebel- long-haired, free-loving, drug-taking and full of righteous indignation about Vietnam and the Bomb. Had they done so, the film would today indeed look like what Ebert called it, something out of a time capsule. Instead, ""The Graduate"" both comes out of its era and transcends it. Nichols realised that the real generation gap is based on something far wider than differing tastes in clothes and music, wider than differing opinions about sex and drugs and Vietnam. The true generation gap is the inevitable disparity in outlook between those like Benjamin and Elaine whose adult life is just beginning and those like their parents whose life is half-over. When these two groups try to discuss their differences, the result is often a sound of silence. 10/10",The Graduate
36,StevePulaski,"A remarkable film that shows teenage sensibilities, subtle aesthetic attributes, wickedly-funny humor, and deeply-contemplative drama",10,6 April 2014,"It is not uncommon for an adolescent male to be attracted to an older, more mature woman, potentially as old, or even older, than his own mother. While there's the obvious, sexual attraction that is shown in film in a much more juvenile sense, there's also the undermined reason of being attracted to an older woman because of her charm, her wisdom, and her maturity, as well as her experience and refined sensibilities, like the personification of an aged wine. It is, however, quite uncommon for an adolescent male to have a relationship with an older woman and fall into the line of events similar to those in Mike Nichols' The Graduate, a wickedly funny film with serious dramatic undertones, beautifully underplayed subtleties, and some truly contemplative insights inside the rigorous and constantly-moving mind of a teenage boy. Dustin Hoffman assumes the role of twenty-year-old Benjamin Braddock, who has just graduated college a confused and uncertain soul. We can see just by the way he walks around his own graduation party that he is neurotic and uncomfortable, only moreso when he runs into Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), the attractive wife of his dad's business partner, who invites herself into his bedroom and requests a ride home. When they finally arrive at Mrs. Robinson's lavish home, Benjamin is immediately pampered with music and a glass of bourbon by a heavily-seductive and clearly aroused Mrs. Robinson, who requests that Benjamin sleep with her and stick around before the return of her husband.Benjamin is made only more uncomfortable by this madness, and after refusing numerous times to this offer, Mrs. Robinson states that she'd like him to visit whenever he is lonely or bored. Eventually, Benjamin takes up that offer, several times managing to sleep with her and making it a constant passtime. Mrs. Robinson, however, is a fragile soul, once an alcoholic and now mercifully protective of her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross), who is Benjamin's age. Push comes to shove when Benjamin's parents, disillusioned that he's taking it too easy after graduation and not even thinking about career plans or graduate school, set him up on a date with Elaine, who he comes to fall in love with, much to the disgust of Mrs. Robinson. Now, Benjamin must juggle a jealous and unstable Mrs. Robinson, a wonderful but ignorant Elaine, and his own potentially unstable self.Nichols' Graduate is a masterclass of subtle filmmaking, with editing, shot structure, and little serene moments inside the film that give it all the character it needs. For example, there's the iconic shot where Nichols' camera is positioned underneath the arc of Mrs. Robinson's outstretched leg, showing a nervous but chummy Benjamin when he'd utter the now famous line of, ""Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me. Aren't you?,"" nicely portraying lust, anxiety, and ruthless temptation.Continuing on, there's also the cold, frigid stare of Mrs. Robinson's Nichols chooses to close the scene just before Benjamin and Elaine venture out on their date. Rarely does a stare or a facial expression stay so much, and Bancroft, who is forced to have to go from sexy, to sexually adventurous, to angry, to passive-aggressive so quickly, nails this look perfectly in a scene that illustrates disgust, disappointment, neglect, and jealousy tremendously.The list goes on with the minor things The Graduate does right, but what it does is give us an entertaining story that miraculously avoids the shortcomings and pitfalls of a daytime soap-opera thanks to its acting and its narrative layers. This is a film that nicely, if unconventionally, details the tumultuous life of a teenager. Speaking as one myself at this moment in time, there are numerous forces that are poking and prodding us at all times, be them academic, parental, authoritative, seductive, temptation, whatever. Because of this, and of our inherent naivete and inexperienced nature, it's so easy for us to make a misstep and ""choose incorrectly,"" causing a whirlwind of things to spiral out of control and into a pit of despair. While there is definitely debate to the conscious, decision-making, and even mental-state of our lead character Benjamin, The Graduate is effective at showing how a man's poor decision-making can have dire consequences on many, even if he never meant it in the first place. Theoretically, Nichols and writers Calder Willingham and Buck Henry could've chosen practically anyone - a forty-year-old man, a business executive, a woman, etc - but instead he chooses on a young man, new to the realms of adulthood and burdened by insecurity, neurotic tendencies, and the loud voices of many forces.It's truly amazing how The Graduate has gone on to still secure a rather solid reputation in the present, given its admittedly silly and often goofy nature. Yet, as Monte Hellman stated when discussing his film Two-Lane Blacktop, two films in the sixties had a hand in shaping the student/teenager culture and they were The Graduate and Easy Rider. Both films, he states, prompted reactions and unforeseen perspectives on their audiences, as well as providing people, mainly square adults who still carried the still carried the fifties sensibilities of commonality and cheesy togetherness, that teenagers indeed have darker, rebellious, and sexual feelings they need to express and The Graduate is a film that does that, even with its over-the-top nature and sometimes artificial ""sixties proper"" dialog.The final thing to comment on with the film is the ending, which is handled splendidly, much like the rest of the picture. Without spoiling it, for the few people that seriously need to get going and watch this picture, it excellently communicates a ""now what?"" idea, with two characters whose smiles fade, return, then fade again as they realize they spent the last several days wanting something. Now they have it; there's nothing left to want. Time to lead the boring life of their square parents, it seems.",The Graduate

And may I say it lived up to it's reviews and even higher for me. ""The Graduate"" is a great film that should be watched by everyone. And Dustin Hoffman is a great performer in the film. I loved the whole seduction scene with him and Mrs. Robbinson. They were both brilliant together. The way Ben reacted to her was very funny. And the marriage scene, how many parodies have I seen? This is a film that should be watched by everyone. I'm not kidding. I would highly recommend it to anyone. One of the best films to come out of the 60's.10/10",The Graduate
38,blanbrn,Sexy and fun entertainment. Mike Nichols has a timeless classic story of the coming of age of a young man.,8,29 October 2007,"It's amazing how well ""The Graduate"" stills holds up well today after 4 decades, it's a film that doesn't seem to age from the way Mike Nichols done it, the story could be relevant in any time frame. Dustin Hoffman in one of his earliest roles is Ben Braddock a shy and anxiety like introverted young man who's just graduated from college. Upon graduation he returns home to his cultured and sophisticated overprotective parents(William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson) in Los Angeles, California, and upon arrival the parties and social meetings of his parents friends make Ben feel uncomfortable, because he already feels pressure about his future. The film then gradually changes it's course when Ben upon the gathering at his parents house meets one of his father's friends wife that the very sexy and attractive yet aggressive and extroverted Mrs. Robinson(played gracefully and wonderfully by Anne Bancroft). Ben is then completely lost and caught up in his own little world as for the first time it's time for him to relax and have fun and for once feel like a rebellious youth of his counter culture generation. At first Ben is nervous and hesitant, yet slowly and surely he gives into the seduction of Mrs. Robinson. It clearly is a coming of manhood for Ben as he gets to explore his sides of lust, pleasure, and feel good nature. The scene of him and Mrs. Robinson together are so memorable they stick with a viewer for their fun and sexy wit nature, plus Anne Bancroft was a sexy knockout choice for this role very memorable of her scene when Ben unzips her and she's wearing that black colored leopard dotted strapless bra. For the 1960's Anne sure was the sex symbol of the day. Only soon Ben feels the guilt and entrapment, yet that will change when he meets a younger college girl named Elaine(Katharine Ross) only to find out that she is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson! Now talk about a dilemma for a young man. As Ben knows Elaine is his only escape and likely true love, he must still face the fact that Mrs. Robinson wants them separated forever! Ben now shows his manhood by being at his best to stop everything and escape with Elaine. Really a great film at it's time that's held up due to it's story and Nichols done a great job to show that it's thru life experiences that one comes of age and learns how to make decisions and find what's right for them just like the Ben character did as after getting pleasure experience he finds what is right. Also the songs by Simon and Garfunkel relate and move the film so well. Clearly Nichols directed a gem here that's a timeless coming of age classic that a viewer can find meaningful anytime.",The Graduate
39,MovieAddict2016,The Defining Film of a Generation...and it has lost its relevance.,6,23 February 2006,"When ""The Graduate"" was first released in 1967 everyone went to go see it. The college crowds devoured it hungrily, as it was the first of its kind  a film that proposed adults were emotional sell-outs who thrived on superficiality and materialism.It earned Mike Nichols a Best Director Academy Award as well as solidifying itself as one of the biggest and most important films of the 1960s, a motion picture whose influence would extend effortlessly into the generations to come.But is ""The Graduate"" really a great movie, or were moviegoers simply too caught up in the moment to realize what they were watching was nothing more than an exploit of the times? This is clearly an anti-bourgeois film, one with a liberal message of hippie politics; it was a drug culture movie, the defining motion picture of a generation of free love, school drop-outs and loners who sat around drinking beer all day moaning about how awful life was.Perhaps I sound overly critical of a film whose purpose is to examine (or more appropriately define) an era? Surely it is not the fault of this movie that it is about an unlikable person? No, its fault is that it tries to sympathize with him  Benjamin is a spoiled rich kid, and it's hard to feel empathetic towards him when he wallows about drinking beer poolside, staring into his aquarium and ignoring everyone around him: A self-absorbed cynical.Yes, Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) is going through an awkward change in his life. He's an East Coast graduate who returns home to his parents' estate in an upper-class suburb and finds it hard to adjust to life again.The opening scenes are promising  Benjamin is unable to interact with the adults, finding solace in his bedroom, where he stares at his aquarium, contemplating whatever it is gloomy college graduates contemplate.A friend of his parents, named Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), tries to seduce Benjamin after he gives her a lift home  inviting him in for a drink and then undressing in front of him, blocking his exit.Benjamin resists at first, but the temptation is too much to bear and he begins an ill-fated sexual relationship with the older married woman  driving to a nearby hotel every few nights to meet her.Benjamin's parents don't seem to catch on at first, although his mother has suspicions that he's seeing someone. Benjamin shrugs her off and ignores his father altogether. When they set him up on a date with Mrs. Robinson's daughter (Katharine Ross), he feels extremely uncomfortable and takes her out to an unsuitable place for the evening as a way of making sure she never wants to see him again. However, much to his surprise, Benjamin finds himself falling for her anyway.Here ends the first half of the movie  the second half is more serious, moody and focused on Benjamin and his new love interest. And of course the anger of her mother, who threatens to reveal the truth to everyone if he continues to date her daughter.""The Graduate"" uses some cheap tricks to force us into seeing things Benjamin's way  for example, before having sex Benjamin wants to talk like a normal person, and have a conversation with Mrs. Robinson. We're meant to stop a moment and reconsider Benjamin's morality  when in fact it's just a way of Benjamin trying to make himself feel better about what he is doing; justifying the basic animal instincts by twisting them into formality. By holding a reasonable discussion, the depravity of the casual sex is lessened. It all benefits Benjamin, no one else.Furthermore the characters have little depth. Benjamin falls in love with Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, in what seems an instant. Their abrupt decision at the end of the picture (which I won't spoil) is now laughable, because in 1967 it offered an optimistic, endless adventure for the wide-eyed teens, I suppose; but now it just leads to foreseeable misery, and comes across as juvenile and ridiculous.The film has influenced a wide array of modern directors, most noticeably Wes Anderson, whose style of film-making is based around similar themes of contempt, quirky humor and oddball characters, typically led by a cynic. (For example, Bill Murray in ""Rushmore"" or ""The Life Aquatic."") Its cultural impact is phenomenal, being referenced in such popular entertainment as ""The Simpsons"" and an endless array of movies. (Perhaps most memorable of all, the extensive spoof in ""Wayne's World 2."") And whom do you know that wouldn't recognize the line, ""Mrs. Robinson, I think you're trying to seduce me""? Indeed, the cultural impact of ""The Graduate"" is unarguable  this is a milestone movie and few others have had such a diverse effect on how we live. Like ""The Terminator"" and ""Star Wars,"" most people would recognize the material itself even if they haven't seen the movie. Hum the first few notes of the ""Jaws"" theme song and see how many people can guess what it is.Similar is ""The Graduate"" in its appeal and popularity. It continues to endure, remaining a key word amongst film buffs and college crowds. But as a film it is just good, not great. It is not expertly crafted and is actually quite awkward. This is essentially a snapshot of the era and little else  the characters aren't likable and we're forced into feeling false admiration for them; the direction is somewhat clumsy, the script is often unbelievable and the movie's two halves  its drastic change from comedy to drama -- never really form a satisfying whole.Like Benjamin, ""The Graduate"" just kind of sits there, staring at you bored, self-absorbed, and lazy. This movie has no soul, no heart  and after forty years of sulking, that is what proves to be clearest of all.",The Graduate
40,DKosty123,"Great Soundtrack, Fine Film, Coming of Age in 1960's Defined",7,29 April 2006,"This film has one of the better sound tracks of any film in Hollywood history. Simon & Garfunkel's music sets the perfect moods throughout the picture. Mike Nichol's Direction is excellent & a lot of the photography & camera angles are excellent but Nichols never gave credit where credit is do much on this film.A major professional film maker who consulted on this film was Harold Lloyd, the early King of Silent Romantic Comedies & it shows through out the film. A lot of the best comedic moments in the film are pure Harold Lloyd, including the sequence when Dustin Hoffman takes Katherine Ross (aka Elaine Robinson, Mrs. Robinson's Daughter) into the hotel where he has been taking (literally) her mom (Anne Bancroft) for months. The ending, if you really want to see it done more comically is borrowed completely from Lloyds 1924 film GIRL SHY. To me, while this is a coming of age comedy, the comedy in this is slow paced & lighter than GIRL SHY & in 1967 they got away with more adult themes & scenes than Lloyd could have dared to try in 1924. The plot itself is quite adult & I am sure some of the good work in the script came from Buck Henry who helped convert the book.A lot of the supporting players in this either went on the bigger roles or major television work later which doesn't hurt the main players. Without this film, Dustin Hoffman might have spent a lot of his career unemployed. This is a very good film in many many ways though not for the kiddies even though this material from the 1960's is tamer than films made after it.",The Graduate
41,Red-Barracuda,Highly influential and challenging film that helped usher in the New Hollywood age,9,13 April 2014,"The Graduate was one of the first films from the late 1960's that indicated the changing face of American cinema. While it was a Hollywood film, it displayed a huge influence of the European New Wave. Not only this but it also tapped into the concerns of the counter-culture, with its story about the generation gap from a youth-oriented perspective. As it turned out, it was a huge commercial success and led in a large part to the brief but significant age of New Hollywood, a time when the American studios systematically turned out challenging, left-field movies. The story has a young man, Benjamin, arrive back into the folds of the family home from college after graduating. Immediately he finds himself lost and alienated by what's expected of him by the older generation. One of his parent's friends Mrs. Robinson soon ensnares him into a sexual relationship, one that is emotionless but which becomes extremely acrimonious when Benjamin falls in love with Elaine, Mrs. Robinson's daughter.Aside from the reasons I mentioned above, The Graduate was important for the idea of having a romantic leading man as unconventional as Dustin Hoffman. His slightly nerdy and nervous persona was quite different from the character from the novel on which the film was based but he was a perfect choice in the role and several less obvious lead actors would rise to the top in his wake. In this movie he takes centre stage alongside Anne Bancroft (Mrs. Robinson) in a generational gap relationship that also was far from the norm. Bancroft is also extremely good here in a role where much goes unsaid, which requires very good acting. The timing of the release coincided with a period where youth generation were questioning the values of their elders like never before as a result of issues such as the Vietnam War. In this way Benjamin is an identification figure in that he is consistently used and instructed by his elders. This leads to an ending where the young rebels do what is right for them. But it's hardly a typical Hollywood ending, as after the elation of their act of defiance the camera stays on the couple and catches their uncertainty once their euphoria has died down. It's a European influenced ambiguous ending that shows that the young, like their elders, don't have all the answers either. Likewise, the film is ambiguous in other ways in that the lead character himself isn't really all that good a guy. He may be coerced into having sex with Mrs. Robinson but he chooses to carry on with this potentially devastating affair. Also, his pursuit of Elaine borders on the behaviour of a stalker. And it isn't in fairness ever really that obvious what Elaine, played by the gorgeous Katharine Ross, actually sees in Hoffman's rather strange Benjamin. In fact, it's a movie where it's quite easy to see everybody's point-of-view. We understand everyone's motivations, including the poor Mr. Robinson who has to endure Benjamin firing into both his wife and his daughter. For this reason, it left me with more questions than answers at the end and I couldn't 100% go along with Benjamin's elation.But what elevates The Graduate to true greatness for me is that it combines all these interesting aspects and brings them to the screen in such an alluring way. The camera-work is beautiful throughout and often very inventive, with some neat editing tricks where scenes interconnect excellently. Sometimes it's even done for comic effect, like the diver scene, but the cinematography composition often highlights themes like alienation and entrapment. The photography, though gorgeous, isn't just for show. And to top things off, we have a marvellous folk-rock score from Simon & Garfunkel which has become so famous it can be easy to forget just how good it is in the first place. In particular, the stunning Sound of Silence resonates and is just perfect for this film.",The Graduate
42,KineticSeoul,Outdated but still a bit of a classic erotic classic,6,16 March 2012,"This movie has gotten some good reviews and for good reasons. Movies like this shows that you don't need high budget or lots of actions to be enthralling and entertaining. Although it's a bit of a erotic comedy, except with a bit more erotic parts but doesn't go over the top with it. This movie is basically about a graduate that has a bit of anxiety played by Dustin Hoffman who is a bit confused and not all that happy and a bit disappointed about graduating although the people around him constantly congratulate him. Anyways his dad's business partner's wife Mrs. Robinson tries to seduce Hoffman's character and things lead to something more when Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine gets in the picture. I first thought this was going to be a very serious or weird drama, yes it's a bit weird but it turned out to be a bit of a light and yet erotic comedy. It's interesting to see young Hoffman in situations like this, especially since the premise takes place in the 60's which is an era I didn't grow up in. Although these types of movies seem to be constant now a days, but this movie gives off a feel of originality although it might be because it came out in the late 60's. This movie is very far when it comes to this type of genre and has been done really good afterwards as well. For it's time it really does make it a bit of a classic. What probably really makes this movie enthralling is how it goes in a direction where most guys can relate with, yeah the situations might be different but you can feel the character to some degree, well somewhat. Overall it's a bit outdated movie but it really is worth a watch, especially if you like watching these types of movies.

43,OllieSuave-007,An intriguing drama of the '60s.,8,5 March 2015,"This is a dramatic and well-paced movie that grabs your attention right away when the main plot is introduced toward the beginning of the story, where Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) asks newly graduate Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) to take her home after a house party. From there, Mrs. Robinson begins seducing Ben, but he is hesitant because she is the wife of his father's business partner. Later on, however, Ben gives in to Mrs. Robinson's seduction and an affair begins.The affair pretty much dominates the entire movie, but it is interesting to see how it affects Ben's life decisions such as his post-college plans and, more intriguingly, the strong feeling he feels toward Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, after the two go out on a date. This enfolding drama captures the movie's somewhat tense atmosphere and keeps the audience engage. The movie also contains some laugh-out-loud humor.Anne Bancroft did great in her Mrs. Robinsons' role - domineering, seductive and commanding - while Dustin Hoffman did OK in his role. I couldn't really decipher whether his nervous or shy personality in the movie was a result of his character role or his acting ability. The songs by Simon and Garfunkel were also great.***spoiler ahead*** Some plot points, especially toward the climax, will result in some answered questions, leaving some things ambiguous.

44,sddavis63,A 60's Classic,8,6 September 2010,"This is a 60's movie, so I have to begin by expressing appreciation for the 60's music. Three of the great Simon & Garfunkel songs are here: ""The Sound of Silence,"" ""Scarborough Fair"" and, of course, ""Mrs. Robinson."" It's interesting, though, that that last song really isn't the central song of the movie - that would probably be ""The Sound of Silence."" Those songs alone made this an enjoyable movie to spend time with. Songs aside, though, this is also just a really good movie - a must see if you like movies from the 60's. It's a kind of coming of age story, replete with family drama, comedy and great performances.Dustin Hoffman and Ann Bancroft are superb as the leads - Hoffman as the young Ben Braddock, just graduated from university and with no real idea where life is going to lead him, and Bancroft as the older Mrs. Robinson, a woman in a passionless marriage who seduces Ben. The seduction scenes are really quite funny. Hoffman did a great job portraying the awkwardness and uncertainty Ben felt as he found this woman, who has been a friend of his family forever from his perspective, suddenly looking to him for more than just friendship. There's a lot of sensitively funny material in the first hour of the movie, which largely revolves around this relationship: from the first seduction, to Ben renting a room for them, to the scene in which he insists that they have a conversation before ""doing it."" The dialogue was witty, and the performances completely believable. There's a superbly executed shift in genre (for lack of a better word) in the second hour, as Ben finds himself becoming interested in Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine (a really good supporting performance by Katharine Ross.) The movie takes on a dramatic feel here, as Ben's feelings for Elaine complicate and then end the affair with her mother, as the secret comes out and lies are told in an attempt to cover up. I've rarely seen a movie switch so seamlessly from light comedy to drama. It was pulled off without a hitch by director Mike Nichols. The question in the end becomes whether Ben can convince Elaine to continue their relationship after she learns about the affair with her mother, and there's some real uncertainty about that. The ending of the movie comes across in some ways as a bit cliché, although there's an openness to it as well as you wonder what awaits Elaine and Ben after all they've experienced.From an era in which there was a lot of uncertainty about the future, this movie seems to encapsulate that feeling through a series of believable characters, whose own futures are left completely up in the air as the movie ends. Sometimes a movie leaving a lot of loose ends can be frustrating, but in this case it seemed completely appropriate to both the story and the times in which it was made.",The Graduate

Your a degenerate!,8,9 October 2008,"***SPOILERS*** Even though it ended up becoming one of the biggest movie hits of all times ""The Graduate"" had trouble getting any of the major Hollywood studios to distribute it! With them feeling that it's story was either too spicy or it's cast with with exception of Anne Bancroft, as Mrs. Robinson, too unknown to make the film profitable. As it turned out the 3 million dollars it took to make the movie ended up cashing in some 200 million, in the USA and aboard, for the almost unknown Embessy Pictures who took the chance in distributing it.After graduating with honors, as the debating team captain and top track and field star, from collage Ben Braddock, Dustin Hoffman,had the world at his feet with a bright future ahead of him. What turned out to be Ben's insecurity in his shyness in making friends with the opposite sex that soon ended up turning into a nightmare for him. Long time family friend Mrs. Robinson seeing the young man at a coming home reception set her sights on him in both deflowering Ben and making him her both secret lover and personal sex toy.Tricking Ben to drive her home Mrs. Robinson gets the confused and shy collage boy all alone! She then starts to both flirt and disrobe, doing a very sexy and provocative strip tease right in front of the shocked and startled young man. At first resisting Mrs. Robinson's advances Ben soon gives into them having a wild and illicit affair with her. It's when Mrs. Robinson's 20 year old daughter Elaine, Katherine Ross, came home from collage on the East Coast that this cozy relationship between Ben and Mrs. Robinson starts to fall apart. In that even though Mrs. Robinson felt nothing wrong with her, a married woman, having an affair with Ben she at the same time was outraged that he would end up very possibly doing the very same thing with her both single and available daughter Elaine!Even though at first Ben is anything but interested in Elaine the fact that he was matched up with her by both his parents and the unsuspecting Mr. Robinson (Murray Hamilion), who was unaware that Ben was having an affair with his wife, Mrs. Robinson turned both vicious and vindictive towards the by now emotionally destroyed Ben Braddock!As much as he tires to avoid it Ben falls in love with Elaine but when Mrs. Robinson threatens to expose his relationship with her Ben, what I think stupidly, beats her to the punch! It's with Ben confessing that he once was ""making it"" with her mom that Elaine, who at first was in love with him, throws him out of her, the Robinson residence, house and cuts Ben out of her life forever!Even tough it was the best part of the movie Ben's attempt to win Elaine back never seemed to ring true. Instead of the sensitive and feeling person that he was at the beginning of the film Ben turned out to be a down right and, for the most part, unfeeling jerk in the end. Hounding Elaine all throughout the city of San Francisco, that he traveled to from his home in L.A, where she was enrolled in Berkley Collage a hot bed for student activation Ben both insulated and humiliated Elaine at every opportunity. It was when Ben found out that Elaine had a boyfriend medical student Carl Smith, Brian Avery, that he really went to work on her. Ben soon gets under Elaine's skin by him gleefully taunting her in public, in the Berkley Collage Library, about when she first made it with Carl. This has Elaine leaving the sneering and nosy jerk in a rush and in tears! It made you wonder why Elaine would have anything to do with Ben again but amazingly she did!***SPOILER ALERT*** Despite the films many shortcomings in it trying to make Ben Braddock a hero or just plain nice guy the outrageous actions of Ms. Robinson more then made you forget as well as overlook Ben's hurtful actions, towards Elaine, in it. The by now legendary and unforgettable ending at Elaine and Carl's wedding ceremony has Ben snatch Elaine just moments after she and Carl took their wedding vows. You wonder why Elaine was so happy to at first become Carl's wife and then, on a dime, decide to leave him for an almost insane and hysterically acting Ben!

46,ElMaruecan82,The greatest cinematic heritage of the 60's ...,10,4 June 2011,"Hello darkness, my old friend ... the melancholic melodies of Simon and Garfunkel transport ""The Graduate"" to a dimension, no movie has ever reached  I can't describe how Mike Nichols' masterpiece affected me on that night I watched it for the first time. It was a unique experience inviting me to laugh, to contemplate, to meditate, while mirroring my own condition and carrying it, smoothly, quietly, unconsciously to a mysterious place that only I, could approach  and no one else. ""The Graduate"" became for me, the epitome of cinematic escapism forever graved in my memory ... hell, I even dreamed of it that very night! I know an academic analysis of ""The Graduate"" would cover many paragraphs relating the cultural impact of the film, its iconic status from the red Alfa Romeo to Mrs. Robinson 'seducing' legs, its politically incorrect tone that unsettled America's puritan morality on the breakthrough year of 1967, through the love affair between an awkward graduate and an alcoholic middle-aged cougar. So let's not spoil the extraordinary feeling with ordinary material. I was already aware about the film's status before, ""Wayne's World 2"" and many episodes of ""The Simpsons"" 'spoiled' it for me  but it didn't ruin my experience nonetheless, because the enjoyment was elsewhere.The film is a timeless coming of age comedy with a dramatic approach denouncing in a light-hearted tone the emptiness of the bourgeois way of life, from the point of view of a young educated man, questioning his future, conscious of this superficiality. Ben was my hero. The contrast between the cheers and the congratulations of his parent's friends at his graduation's party and his uneasiness highlights this condition of a social pawn, only meant to reproduce his parent's shallow social model. Ben inspired me as the bourgeois version of the 'rebel without a cause'. At the time I watched the film, I was freshly graduated, I wanted something different too, and when my parents asked me 'why', I couldn't answer. This is Ben's trap and his affection for the fishes in his tanks underlines a sense of empathy, like when he's pushed to test his skin-diving outfit. Water would play a very symbolical role as the incarnation of this environment he can't escape from. 'Water' as the source of Ben's awkwardness and Mrs. Robinson his safety belt. Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft create the perfect contrast between two attitudes, lucidity and inexperience, providing an excellent mix of visual and verbal humor in the first act.The prologue breaks with the 'act' illustrated by the vision of Ben floating on his rubber raft, in the swimming pool. He's floating this time, dominating the allegoric water with Simon and Garfunkel's mesmerizing sound. His love affair became a routine as both help each other to fill the meaningless of their lives and during this long musical sequence, Ben aimlessly contemplates his life, unaware that he's still going nowhere ... like contaminated by the contemptuous idleness typical of the upper class. Finally, pushed by his parents, Ben is forced to date Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine, he slides off the raft and goes underwater again, trapped again. But the trap hides a revelation; Ben falls in love with Elaine making Mrs. Robinson an enemy on a symbolically rainy day and ultimately loses Elaine.But Ben found the true meaning of his life and will follow her till Berkley. A romantic stalking poetically conducted by the beautiful ""Scarborough Fair"" song and providing the second wave of jokes in the film after a dramatic part. In the beginning, the contrasts were between Ben's popularity and the perversity of his actions while in the last act, the comic of opposition, is driven by Ben getting more and more disrespected and hated only to fulfill a romantic dream ... but being loved by Elaine is worth being hated by the whole world, and he understands that even Elaine lives the same dilemma. She's not indifferent, she's almost convinced, she kisses Ben ... and even the mood of the songs changes. I still whistle the iconic rhythm of ""Mrs. Robinson"" whenever I'm in an enthusiastic mood and this song is the one I immediately associate with audacity, youth, and this mix of craziness that drive our lives like we drive an Alfa Romeo till the last drop of gas.One must wonder why it worked though, why she accepted to be 'kidnapped' from the church in the iconic climax ... in real life, if you screamed ""Elaaaaaaine"" while hitting a big glass, would you hear a strident ""Beeeeeen!"" crying for your help ? I don't know, but without this climax, the movie would have been guilty of seriousness. ""The Graduate"" is an escapism pushed to the extreme limit of a fantasy. This is probably why it gained more criticism by mature critics ... I even suspect Ebert of having been too influenced by Kael who disliked the manipulative aspect of the film as soon as Ben became a hero, and Mrs. Robinson a villain. I think this is precisely the dimension I was mentioning in the beginning. It's an escapist movie for people who identify with this youth who don't know what life is about, it's a hymn for immaturity, for this excitement that makes life enjoyable, freedom to make our own mistakes, believing that it's never 'too late'... that's the inspiring spirit of ""The Graduate""! And this enigmatic smile at the end while they're together in the bus, says as much as ""Mona Lisa"" for the painting Art: what are they thinking, are they happy, are they regretting ... I think they're just floating but not in a raft trapped in a swimming pool, in a bus that follows a direction ... which one? Who cares? At least it's going somewhere, so just let yourself transported ... within ... the sound ... of ... Simon ...",The Graduate
47,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Mr. Nichols, you're trying to impress me.",8,20 March 2020,"'The Graduate (1967)' is a film of two halves, with the former being more successful than the latter. When the more famous aspects of the piece fall away and Mrs. Robinson becomes a one-note antagonistic character, the thing starts to lose some of its charm. Still, it transitions from comedy to drama rather gracefully. Its second half isn't at all bad, either. In fact, it's where the eponymous graduate starts to really find his purpose and, as such, features more traditional 'plot'. While certain aspects of the picture haven't aged phenomenally (see 'stalking as romance'), the majority of it is as engaging and entertaining as any modern day affair. Indeed, its direction is markedly good; the movie's long-lens camera work, picturesque blocking and inspired editing give it a distinct aesthetic. It also makes use of focus pulls and zooms to actually tell its tale, an assured choice that belies its behind-the-scenes talent. The picture is enjoyable right from the start, surprisingly funny and wonderfully ahead of its time (it is a sixties film about adultery, after all). Its performances are phenomenal, too. Bancroft, in particular, is great, exuding both an elegant grace and a longing sadness all at once. In the end, this is clearly a landmark piece of cinema, one of the best films of the 1960s. It's funny, affecting and compelling. 8/10",The Graduate
48,gbill-74877,Just one word...plastics,7,6 April 2021,"Any film that has a shot of Moe's Books in Berkeley scores extra points with me.A recent college graduate (Dustin Hoffman) is given a brand-new red convertible by his affluent parents and a place to hang out at while he figures out what he wants to do with his life. One of the friends of his parents (the gorgeous Anne Bancroft at just 36, lol) seduces him, and despite Hoffman being as awkward as he was in his Rain Man role, the two begin having an affair. Things get complicated when the husband encourages him to date his daughter (Katharine Ross), who's also returning from college.While the film is entertaining, it was hard to connect with Hoffman's character. I felt for him most early on when his parents were forcing all their friends on him at a party, and you could really feel the generation gap. ""I just want to say one word to you, just one word ... plastics,"" says a friend of his father, trying to talk to him about a prospective future. I wish there had been more of that kind of thing, or that the affair had played out in some more interesting way. As it is, when he's bouncing from mother to daughter, it's hard to really understand the emotion of it, because I didn't sense much of a connection to anyone from him. The mad race to stop a wedding seemed odd for such a film, and cliché besides. Also, as much as I like the Simon and Garfunkel songs that were on the soundtrack (including The Sounds of Silence, an all-time great), they really don't seem to fit the film all that well.",The Graduate
49,g-bodyl,A Resonating Story!,8,16 September 2015,"If there is one movie from the 1960's that my family loves to rave about, it's this film, the Graduate. I can see why my family loves this film. It's a coming-of-age film set in the time period my parents grew up. A childhood classic, my father would say. As for myself, a generation or two later, I found this to be mostly a great film. If I had a complaint, I would say the film is very outdated and it grew old..fast. But the themes of post-college troubles are very much prevalent in today's world. I liked this film not only because of resonating themes, it's the movie that introduced us to the careers of a legendary director in Mike Nichols and a fantastic actor in Dustin Hoffman. I also liked the soundtrack created by the folk-rock duo, Simon and Garfunkel. Their songs are very catchy and easy to hum along to. Of course, now we all know where the song, ""Mrs. Robinson"" comes from.Mike Nichol's film is about a young man named Ben who has just graduated from college. His parents expect great things out of him. At a homecoming party, he drives the wife of his father's business partner home and he begins an affair with Mrs. Robinson. But things get complicated when he falls for a girl named Elaine. But Elaine happens to be the daughter of Mrs. Robinson! The film is very well-acted. Anne Bancroft does a wonderful job as the sexy, manipulative Mrs. Robinson. Dustin Hoffman shows everyone why he is a great actor. He kills every scene he is in. I think Katherine Ross did a solid job as Elaine, although we don't meet her until late in the film. For those who are fans of the 90's TV Show ""Boy Meets World,"" you may recognize Mr. Feeney himself, William Daniels as Ben's father.Overall, The Graduate may be a bit old and weary, but it tells such a wise story with great acting and fantastic music, that it's hard to not see pass those rusty pipes. As I said before, this film has themes that are easily prevalent nearly fifty years after the film's release. It's one of those coming-of-age stories that shall stand the test of time, even if only because of the themes. This is a very memorable film to say the least.My Grade: B+",The Graduate

52,secondtake,"A parable for the time, a truly funny drama, and brilliance dripping from every scene.",10,24 October 2009,"The Graduate (1967)Dustin Hoffman is beyond astonishing here. I mean, everyone is great in their parts, and the older generation in the 1960s is captured too well for words, the falseness, the materialism. But young Hoffman as awkward, yearning Ben, with a foot in old and new generations (it's 1967 and he's no hippie, but he longs to break away), makes you really feel his entrapment, and his liberation by the end. And Anne Bancroft is easily his equal, as an actress, and her own entrapment as the well-to-do and unhappy Mrs. Robinson, and her ability to lever a way free, is also palpable. All of this is a marvel to watch.It's so easy to like the plot of this film, some of the other innovations get lost, like the lighting, which is daring and beautiful with its willingness to avoid mere prettiness. When the father is scolding Ben in the pool, the sunlight glares behind his head. When Ben and Mrs. Robinson are in the hotel room, whole scenes go on in darkness and we only listen. The photography overall uses this lighting and extends the takes to an almost uncanny extent, so that conversations go on very long--many minutes--with seeming directorial ease (and therefore growing tension in the frame). The writing, too, is masterful. The plot is wild enough for its time, or ours, and is handled with such matter of factness (old woman seducing a completely wile-less younger man, really now). But it's funny! Really really funny. Director Mike Nichols started as a comedian of course, partnered with Elaine Mays, and the subtle, deft handling of unlikely comebacks is both realistic and hilarious and fraught with anxiety. He's one of those directors who understands human interaction, dialog as well as silence, with vivid, subtle keenness (he made many other actor's films, the breathtaking Closer and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf for starters). Nichols uses Hoffman most of all to lead us through the topsy turvy plot.You can't forget the social commentary here, one of the best illustrations of a generation breaking free and the reasons why. It's about the generation gap, about finding what matters beyond materialism. It's about young people having enough money to not worry about survival. It's about true love without calculation, whatever the impulsiveness, and whatever the prospects of their success as a couple. And all of this is done without preachiness (notice the cross in the almost last scene) and without emotional distance. Remember, this was filmed while it was happening--the 60s are still unfinished, and their meaning undigested. There is, thankfully, no nostalgia.I've seen this film several times over the years, but it has been awhile, and I was prepared to find holes in it, or a flagging pace, or something imperfect. And I didn't. Do I like Katherine Ross in particular as the girlfriend-to-be? Not really, but she's a type that makes sense for the year. Is the music plugged in and out logically or elegantly? Well, Simon and Garfunkle's attitude and introspection makes sense, adding to the mood perfectly, and it is fit into some of the scenes like a choreographed film score (as when the car runs out of gas). Fans will note that the versions of Mrs. Robinson are very different than the album releases. But songs are repeated, sometimes a lot, and you wonder exactly why.But so what? These are the oddities that make the film more distinctive and, in a way, more memorable. Nichols, Bancroft, and Hoffman, the little known screenwriters, and veteran cameraman Robert Surtees have made a film I'm sure is truly timeless.",The Graduate

54,atlasmb,A Haunting Classic,10,3 March 2019,"It's true that ""the Graduate"" is a timeless masterpiece. It is also a piece of its time. As someone who experienced the sixties like Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), I have always recognized the film's ability to capture the zeitgeist of its time. Caught between changing sexual mores and the need to establish himself as a man, Ben feels unanchored. He is a product of his parents and his community, but he feels the need to break free of their stifling expectations.Ben seems to be collecting memories, not advancing toward any defined goals. He is, at his core, desperate. As the United States grapples with gender roles, racial upheaval, the onus of a wartime draft, and the ever-present threat of the cold war, Ben feels an anxious nation turning its expectant eyes to him and those of his generation.But Ben has no answers. He really has no idea where to begin to search for them. And so he is never running toward anything, always away. This is best exemplified by the final scene (which stands in marked contrast to the ending of ""Picnic"", for example).Director Mike Nichols, aided by the lyric poetry of Paul Simon's music, has created a film that is simultaneously the quintessence of the sixties and a component of its creation. No pretty boy, like the others who were lined up to play his role, Dustin Hoffman eschews the part of the early-laurelled head being ""chaired through the market-place"" and instead gives us an everyman performance that captures the world of possibilities and the falseness of that world's promises. We feel him struggle under the weight of ""eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase"", like ""plastics"".This is a film classic for its content and its style, which do transcend a moment, taking the viewer to an uncomfortable place, perhaps, but it might be the beginning of a run to some place better.",The Graduate
55,ironhorse_iv,It's Graduation Day! I think this movie is seducing me. You're trying to seduce me. Aren't you?,8,17 June 2013,"The movie has this great 1960's Hollywood New Wave feel to it. This is a coming of age movie that works for me. A lot of coming of age movies seem to try to make their character innocent, but they never actually are. They do a bunch of irresponsible stuff and at the end of the day a lot of people call them ""innocent and lost"", but it just feels like an excuse to sympathize for being an idiot. However I do sympathize for this character, Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman). It seemed like he was forced into a pool and not allowed to come back up. The theme of an innocent and confused youth who is exploited, misdirected, seduced and betrayed by a corrupt older generation was well understood by film audiences and captured the spirit of the times. One of the film's posters proclaimed the difficult coming-of-age for college graduate. Directed by Mike Nichols, the film is based on the 1963 novel The Graduate by Charles Webb. The movie opens to one of the best songs of the 1960's, Simon & Garfunkel - The Sound of Silence. This is one of the best songs I've ever listened to. I think the soundtrack pretty much made Simon & Garfunkel from nearly unknown folk singers, to legends of the music industry. You can also hear an earlier version of Mrs. Robinson in the movie. The song as it appears in the film is different from the familiar hit single version, as only the chorus of the song appears late in the film and with slightly different lyrics. It was only later on that Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel re-recorded the song by employing additional lyrics to form the hit single. It's kinda funny that the original song was call 'Mrs. Roosevelt'. It would really be funny to see Eleanor Roosevelt have an affair with a younger man. The Sound of Silence song work for the film as it really fit in with the plot regarding the lack of communication between the controlling parents and the young adults. Anyways, Benjamin Braddock has just arrive back home, after years in College. Dustin Hoffman played the part of the awkward post-graduate student perfectly. I can't see Mike Nichols first choice, Robert Redford in this role. Dustin is kind of awkward that works, he isn't to an abnormal extent creep, he more just describes the entire situation to the woman. Unsure of himself, by being uncomfortable and anxious, and force to hear others decide for him what he will do with his future. Benjamin Braddock soon find himself, seduce by an older woman, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) and find himself tempt into an affair. Anne Bancroft is a cougar on the prowl, really to pounce on her prey. She was really pretty in the room. Even though her character is sympathetic, it doesn't change the fact that her character is a vindictive sexual predator. Just the line 'You've known me nearly all your life."" Is just disturbing. Mrs. Robinson wanting to bang a kid she watched grow up? That's gross, and just a step below Woody Allen marrying his stepdaughter. She was marry too, so not only is she wanting to date a younger man, she watch when he was kid, but she's also cheating on her husband. It is pure flesh, but she is nice about it. It is just natural, pragmatic and not that romantic-idealistic. She's still the Queen of all Milfs. Her personal life isn't the only thing she's opening. Some people might hate the fact, that the two main characters are two of the most shallow, childish characters. Mrs. Robinson can be especially hateful without any specific motivation, while Benjamin is bit spineless. I do love Dustin Hoffman in the role, but he was way too old for this part. He was playing a 20 year old, and he himself was 30 at the time. Also Anne Bancroft was only 35 during the time of filming. It also kinda funny that the actress Katharine Ross who played Anne Bancroft's daughter Elaine was only 8 years younger than her 35 and 27, miscasting. Katherine Ross looks lovely as Elaine, but she's barely one-dimensional and looks like a girl who would never go for a guy like Dustin Hoffman in a million years. She only went with him, because of her over controlling parents. Anyways, Benjamin soon fall in love with Elaine, and is in a dilemma. Should be continue to live with people telling what to do with his life like Mrs. Robinson or should he set his own future with a girl like Elaine? Find out, by watching it. The ending is up to question, if these two would work out. It leaves a deep interpretation of risky love. This is a classic film: tightly written, intelligent, funny, wonderfully acted, with a great climax with the church, so to speak. You will get seduce into watching the film by how brilliant it is.",The Graduate
56,kenjha,A Cultural Milestone,10,10 December 2009,"After graduating from college, a young man has an affair with an older woman before falling in love with her daughter. This film about alienation and great expectations is a perfect mix of comedy and drama, a cultural milestone. Nichols's direction is so marvelously innovative in terms of camera work and editing that it still feels fresh decades after its release. An integral component of the success of this film is the superb soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel, full of memorable tunes. Hoffman is excellent in his star-making turn, an impeccable comic performance. In Mrs. Robinson, Bancroft creates a figure who is sexy, vulnerable, and tragic. The seduction scenes are hilarious.",The Graduate
57,The-Sarkologist,Quite Dated,3,30 March 2018,"The one reason that I ended up watching this film is because it was one of those films that always seems to come back again and again. Well, not quite because these days it is pretty dated. In fact I didn't realise that it was as old as it was, and here we see a really, really young Dustin Hoffman playing the role that basically made him a star. The problem was that I really didn't think all that much of this film. Okay, while I didn't hate it, I simply cannot give it a higher rating than I have.
 The film is about a young man, Ben, who returns from college to Los Angeles with top marks, and of course all of his family friends are so proud of him. Within a short time he discovers that one of his parent's friends is trying to seduce him, and after some hesitation, he decides to get involved. The catch comes about when her daughter also returns and his parents convince him to take her out on a date, much to the horror of her mother. Anyway, after him pursuing her to no end, they finally elope and the film ends. I can sort of see where the comedy in this film lies, however a part of me finds that what is happening is so unrealistic, at least looking at it from this day and age. For instance, he tries do make the first date as bad as possible, only to change his mind, and suddenly it is all okay. As for him constantly pursing her, there is something call harassment.
 This film is certainly dated when it comes to the content, though a part of me felt that half way through the creators pretty much reached a mental block, and simply did not know how to proceed. Sure, Ben is clearly a smart guy, and at the beginning of the film quite naive, but by the end his behaviour really doesn't seem to make his character all that flattering, and why they didn't end up calling the police when he crashed the wedding, and why Elaine even ran off with him is beyond me.
 In a way this film is one of those coming of age films, but it is also set at that time when many of us are really unsure where we are going in our life. For most of our lives we are guided, though we do make the occasional choices, such as what to study, however once we have finished university all of a sudden the world has opened up and many of us can be lost. Yet this is also about entering the world of the adult, the world where the innocence of our youths is suddenly destroyed upon the realisation that the people that we grew up with have a much darker side. Mind you, we are looking at the wealthier upper classes, but still, many of us in the middle class go through this angst as well.
 Still, I didn't find this film all that funny. Well, I could see where it was funny, particularly the scene where he is wandering through the hotel with his date to discover that everybody knows who he is, except they believe that he is somebody different. Then there is his naivety with regards to the affair, and that curiosity which suddenly turns him into a man in the know. He certainly does change, but as I mentioned, the film pretty much degenerates as we get near the end.",The Graduate
58,sol-,My brief review of the film,4,5 July 2005,"It is easy to see why Mike Nichols won the Best Director Oscar for this film. It is very well directed with some shots brilliantly set up in terms of the spatial relations between characters. But, despite being well directed, this is a far from perfect overall film. The final quarter is very poorly put together. The second ""romance"" is hardly ever developed, and towards the end it all spirals out frantically and messily into predictable territory. The film is also hurt by its soundtrack. The songs are nice but are played far too often, and when played, they are played in excess. One particular sequences stands out where Hoffman is going about his daily business while on the soundtrack a song is heard. The song plays for its full duration, then ends, and then another song begins. It just shows a too heavily reliance on external material. The photography is also uncomfortably close up at times, and all adult characters are quite two-dimensional. In spite of its problems, the film still comes through. It has some very well edited sequences, both Hoffman and Bancroft have a number of fine moments, and Nichols is great in the director's chair.

61,TheMovieDiorama,The Graduate celebrates an individualistic degree through a rebellious seductive affair.,8,12 April 2020,"Education. School. University. Youths study laboriously to achieve a certification of results, optimistically indicating their achievements. Multiple years of tedious self-study, stressful late nights and fatigued lectures culminate into an indicative pass or fail. Regardless of the end result, several determined graduates are then plunged into the real world with no exact-defined aim. For the first time, no route has been devised for them. Wandering lost souls of high intellectual capacity, pondering the tempestuous road ahead. Depressed. Lonely. Afraid.Take Benjamin Braddock for example, a recent college graduate who had just received a bachelor's degree. Confronting the intimidation of unknown measures, his parents glorify the numerous accolades and potential future their son has acquired to his neighbours during a soirée. Visibly unhappy, he abandons the party. Perched on his bed, shrouded in silence. A confident knock on the door echoes through the room. It's Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's law partner, insisting he drives her home. With much trepidation, he does so. Only to then be welcomed by a wave of seduction. A poignant moment in Ben's life, to which he discovers a rebellious side that overwhelms his moral obligations.Nichols' comedic drama, with a slight hint of adolescent romance, is a quest for individualism. A momentous chance for an irresolute soul, unsettled by the sheer potentiality of his future, to discover himself through an immoral act of adultery. Equipped with awkward mannerisms and youthful destructive capabilities, Ben enables an older woman to temporarily manipulate him. Seamless scene transitions, exquisitely edited by O'Steen, traverse the ornate balance between lustrous love affair and familial restraints. confining Ben into a prison of self-doubt. All the intellectual brain cells in the world could not prevent the temptation of immorality. Even Mr. Robinson calmly advised Ben to ""sow a few wild oats"". However, underneath the physicality of their relationship, is their daughter that Ben falls madly in love with. Forbidden to see her, otherwise the affair will be outed, Ben encounters a moral standoff that will determine his future. Love? Or lust?Adapting Webb's original novel of the same name would be a highly lucrative endeavour for all involved. The story, characters and plot ultimatums are instantly relatable to those who have experienced the educational system. Years of academic studies attempt to integrate adolescents into society, yet it is society itself that paves the route for individual futures. Willingham and Henry's hilariously accessible screenplay supply the characters with substantial emotional resonance. The first half in particular is constructed as an offbeat romantic-comedy enveloped in classicism. Minimal crudeness, aside from the intricate quick cuts of nudity that emphasise Ben's growingly awkward persona. No sexual activity. And certainly no cheap laughs. Ben's first physical encounter with a female is illustrated off camera, perpetuating his inexperience.Admittedly certain plot points have not aged well over the decades, particularly Mrs. Robinson accusing Ben of a fictitious rape and generally manipulating him through blackmail. However it's the blossoming yet equally awkward relationship with daughter Elaine that provides affable context. Many will cite the overwhelming stalking to be, well, overwhelming. Yet these two loved up individuals are young and dumb. They've never experienced this overbearing emotion before. Rapid marriage proposals mid-yawn is something that these two would be accustomed to, because they don't know any different. Again, may not have aged well for today's computerised environment, but the rush sentiments undoubtedly work for these characters. Notably due to Hoffman's purposefully monotonous yet understated performance, in what would be his first major break in Hollywood, that holds slight power over Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson. Nichols exquisitely directing many sequences with an abundance of silence, accompanied by Simon & Garfunkel's well-suited folk lyrics, and physical distance. As if the two were imitating the loveless marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson. Ross then adds a delicate dimension into the fray portraying Elaine, with several screaming outbursts and fluctuating feelings.There is a tonal shift between the first and second half of the feature, due to the direction the story undertakes, yet the legendary closing shot cements the lovelessness of The Graduate. Ben, having now become-of-age and experienced the turbulence of immorality, believes he has found happiness. But a sudden face change, from infectious joy to fateful uncertainty, resides over him. For all the awkward laughs and raucous shenanigans Nichols orchestrates, the presence of ambivalence prevails. What does the future hold? All that remains is ""The Sound of Silence"". ""Hello Darkness, my old friend..."".",The Graduate

This choice to never stray far from either side of the theatrical mask is largely responsible for this classic's enduring appeal. However, it's far from its only success. Fans of Wes Anderson take notice: director Nichols edits and shoots with bold experimentation for this sort of dramedy; jump cutting in time, slow shifting camera focus, and long takes full of brilliant acting punctuate this fighting-to-come-of-age romance that flies past the conventions of its era to sit alongside the best that modern indie films offer. Ben Braddock, a recent college graduate, returns home to find himself roped into an affair with older acquaintance Mrs. Robinson. We quickly realize that Ben is essentially a fish in an aquarium, with no control over any aspect of his life, as his dead-eyes blindly follow his parents, Mrs. Robinson, and society's expectations. Hoffman and Bancroft are of course phenomenal. Their characters couldn't be more different (Hoffman anxious and spineless, Bancroft cool and emotionally broken), yet they dance around each other with wit and uncomfortable believability. Tons of great moments and characters calmly ignite the screen, each filled with humor, awkwardness, and poignancy. On top of being a fairly on-the-nose coming-of-age parable, the entire piece is a giant critique of anything and everything (coddled parenting, youthful cynicism, stodginess, frivolity, romance, attaining happiness, even the idea of ultimate purpose). It recognizes that making decisions, even wrong ones, is an important part of adulthood. Yet despite its skeptical view, warm characters and strict honesty have allowed it to age with as much grace as bite.",The Graduate
63,marmar-69780,the graduate,8,26 July 2020,"The graduate is one very good dark comedy that had some very fun moments in it but it also showed how life in 60s were going on and with what staff students had to deal with it in their lifes,Dustin Hoffman was great in his very early role and he showed how he can play any type of character very easily and without any sign of slowing down,story was very relatable to me ,not only cause Hoffman character was likeable and releatable but also cause it was interesting till the very end,ending of a film was very fun to me and it was filled with such camera action that i had to laugh on it,but at least it had that old charm in it,graduate was a very enjoyable and fun movie to see expecely if you are student cause you can find yourself in similiar situation in real life",The Graduate
64,jzappa,Masterpiece of Direction,10,17 December 2006,"I had never seen The Graduate all the way through until yesterday, ashamed of being a movie buff who'd never seen it before. I loved it. It isn't the zany comedy I thought it would be, however it's something much more urbane and cerebral. Really, it's just a demonstration of some of the greatest film direction I've ever seen.Mike Nichols brings a quiet intensity to the movement and rate of the film, almost like a suspense film. Relative to Scorsese, his insinuation of time lapse is done with a mixture of hard cutting, closing in and closing out of tight shots, and a jukebox-like switch from one piece of music playing over the soundtrack to another. His camera-work altogether is an intense, very fixated series of extended shots, some of them taking us through long-lasting periods of action beginning with the profile shot of Dustin Hoffman on the automatic walking belt at the airport during the opening credits and his sustained closeup as he walks through his parents' party and is constantly stopped with several people invading the frame, creating the feeling of his space being violated. The film is in essence of series of shots like these, and it has a tremendous effect on the style, atmosphere, and pace of the film, especially during its scenes of wry humor, as does the recurring soundtrack integrated with Simon and Garfunkel and David Grusin.The early performance by Hoffman is very entertaining, a much-imitated comically shy young man who opens up only to inadvertently reveal himself as a force to be reckoned with, and Bancroft's performance is one for the books, riveting in her screen time as one of the great femmes fatale, both performances sharply contrasting in charisma to the less memorable Ross.The Graduate is one of the milestones of the 1960s, one of the greatest decades for cinema, and it carries on its lingering influence.",The Graduate
65,Vartiainen,"Fools, dancing around in a vicious circle",6,11 August 2018,"Young Benjamin Braddock (Dusting Hoffman) has just graduated from college, but now he doesn't seem to know what to do with his life. His parents are not of much help, being more interested in climbing the social ladder and having him help them along as the perfect, dutiful son.Enter Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), an old family friend, with whom Ben begins an affair to relieve some of his inner anxiety. Later on he also meets Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross).The Graduate could be seen as a romantic comedy. The plot itself, if a bit heavy, especially for its time, is lighthearted enough and the character archetypes on display are such that the jokes practically write themselves. Yet a dark undercurrent floats just beneath the surface, transforming the whole thing into a scathing satire. The song The Sound of Silence, by Simon & Garfunkel, is often played over central scenes, almost functioning as the theme for the whole film. And anyone who has ever heard the song knows that it's rather dark in its message, despite the light melody. ""Hello darkness, my old friend"" indeed.What this film is trying to talk about is being trapped in a circle from which you cannot escape. Ben's character gets progressively worse as the movie goes on, but you cannot really blame him, not entirely. You can see from his parents and from Mrs. Robinson and her husband that he's merely imitating the sins of the last generation. It's easy to see that he and Elaine could very easily end up just as shallow and empty as their parents. It wouldn't take much. And that's the horror behind the usual rom-com antics.A peculiar film. It requires you to look underneath the surface, to question the events that are taking place. And for that it needs to be praised.",The Graduate
66,GOWBTW,"Mrs. Robinson, Mrs. Robinson, she's the reason this movie is great!",10,8 June 2005,"Sultry, seductive, and tempting, these are the things that describe Mrs. Robinson in the movie, ""The Graduate"". A 60's hit with stars of tomorrow. Like Dustin Hoffman, before he did this movie he did a commercial for Volkswagon a year earlier. And now this, he plays a college grad who is clueless on what to do next. Maybe, just maybe. Here you have Mrs. Robinson, wife of his father's friend, and mother of Elaine. I don't know you but I thing any scene with Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft is great. The first scene is when she traps Ben in her daughter's room and is naked right in front of Ben. Too many flash backs and I got really confused. The second time was better for me. In the hotel scene, where she asks Ben to unzip her top, and then she takes it off, I said ""WHOA!"" NICE BODY, ANNE! I would rewind that scene over and over again. This scene puts other seductress to shame. Then the third hotel scene is really the one with the liner: ""Are you trying to seduce me?"" DUH! BENJAMIN! This movie is sinfully seductive and one of the guiltiest pleasures any young man would have. If you like that try these: A Tiger's Tale Flirting with Disaster Spanking the Monkey Or any other movie of your liking. In my opinion this movie IS THE ONE BABY! 5 STARS! ALL THE WAY!",The Graduate

He encounters Mrs, Robinson(Anne Bancroft), a married friend of his parents. Mrs. Robinson Seduces young Benjamin and they have a clandestine affair which is, of course eventually discovered.This is one of the best satires of American life and the great hypocrisy surrounding the supposed values and traditions of the modern nuclear family, still a relevant theme today.Simon and Garfunkel's ""Mrs Robinson"" and ""Sounds of Silence"" are used on a perfect soundtrack. Buck Henry's script is biting and sardonic and Hoffman and Bancroft are amazing in the two lead roles; a great comedy overall.",The Graduate
68,Polaris_DiB,Existential Quandary,10,3 November 2005,"Back before existentialism was cool, we had The Graduate.Dustin Hoffman's breakout role is perfectly backed up by the story of a young, 21 year old man who falls in love with a young girl after having an affair with her mother. It sounds typical soap but really goes in directions still unexpected after all these years.The performances are powerful and affecting, even Mike Nichols'. As the actors brace their characters against one uncomfortable scene after another, Nichols keeps the camera usually very close to Benjamin, which causes an almost subjective and first person narrative while also making the screen very claustrophobic. And when the camera is far away from Benjamin (and he's looking at himself), he's usually blocked in by something, be it water or Anne Bancroft's (Mrs. Robinson's) legs.Very existential, it's a film that presents a hero who finds himself constantly alone in the world, and even his convictions seem unable to pull him together. It's not a happy movie, as the final shot of his face shows when he's riding off into the sunset that is definitely not of his dreams.Okay.Now that I'm done with the review proper, I thought I'd point out something interesting I discovered during my recent reviewing of this film.Modern day ""Indie"" music is like this throwback to the acoustic folksy rock of the 60s, so of course sounds a lot like our friends Mssrs Simon and Garfunkel, who of course play the music for this wonderful movie. Also, Hoffman's hair and dress, along with his painful awkwardness and his conflict with the people who surround him (""people of society"", so to speak), means that if this film was made today, it would be the Ultimate Indie Hipster Film. Hell, it's practically a Garden State, only without the cheesy happy ending and even better performances.I don't know exactly what that means, or even if it means anything at all. It's just something really interesting about how this film looks considering contemporary culture. It's not dated, per se, it's just that a lot of its motifs are weirdly similar to a cheesier and cheaper social subculture, even if it was made almost 40 years earlier.Crazy how things like that work out, huh? --PolarisDiB",The Graduate
69,PWNYCNY,Powerful movie.,10,9 November 2005,"I know that Ben is a sap and a stalker. I know that Mrs. Robinson is a cheating alcoholic with the morals of an ally cat. I know that Mr. Robinson is a fool. And I know that Elaine Robinson is a hapless victim and player in a bizarre and twisted story of marital infidelity and social disillusionment and alienation. Nevertheless, I like this movie. Yes, I'll say it again ... I LIKED THIS MOVIE! The question is: Why? None of the characters in the story, with the exception of Elaine, are particular attractive or nice. In fact, they are some of the most reprehensible characters ever portrayed in a movie. I say this sweeping statement because these characters behave in ways that they know are morally wrong, and despite their knowing better, continue to flaunt themselves anyway. They are angry characters, angry at the world, angry at themselves, angry at each other. They are also boldfaced hypocrites, flaunting their middle-class materialistic trappings, like their nice houses and expensive cars, and so smug, like that fool Mr. Robinson and Ben's father whose only concern is that Ben get a good job and keep up appearances, all of which masking a shallowness and depravity that is the central theme of this story, which is why I liked this movie. The movie offers a candid portrayal of people who you'd think are the salt of the earth and the bedrock of society, but in actuality have the strength and consistency of quicksand. This is a serious movie depicting the moral depravity of modern society and the damage such depravity can cause.",The Graduate
70,ackstasis,"""This is Benjamin. He's a little worried about his future.""",9,3 July 2007,"Now we come upon a true classic of American cinema. Singlehandedly defining an entire era of film-making, 'The Graduate' brought director Mike Nichols (with only his second film, after 'Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf?') recognition as a major new talent, and launched the remarkable acting career of Dustin Hoffman. The film received seven Oscar nominations  including Best Picture and three in the acting categories  though it walked away with just one award, for Best Director. Often overlooked as a highly-effective comedy, 'The Graduate' features a remarkable performance from Hoffman (who, at the age of thirty years, convincingly played a 21-year-old), as well as Anne Bancroft as the bored, domineering housewife who seduces him during a vulnerable period of his life.Benjamin Braddock (Hoffman), having just graduated from college (presumably Williams College, where the author of the novel, Charles Webb, attended, and also because Ben is seen wearing a Williams College tie at the beginning of the film), is uncertain about his future. Pushed to success by his slightly overbearing parents, Ben is confused about where his life is heading, desperately fumbling for an answer whenever one of his parents' friends asks him ""what are you going to do next?"" He stares mournfully into his fish tank, perhaps likening himself to the fish dwelling within it. He is trapped in this glass cube, able to see the world outside but incapable of any meaningful interaction with it. This analogy is reinforced when, for his 21st birthday present, his parents gift him with a metal water diving suit, in which he clunks to the water's edge and sinks mournfully to the bottom of the pool. Unsure of his future, Ben is simply drifting through life: ""Well, I would say that I'm just drifting. Here in the pool it's very comfortable just to drift here.""Into Ben's neurotic, confused life comes Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft), whose failing marriage to Mr. Robinson (Murray Hamilton) has enticed her to seek sexual gratification elsewhere. Despite Ben being half her age (in actual fact, just six years separated Bancroft, 36, from Hoffman, 30), she deviously maneuvers a vulnerable Ben into a compromising position and exploitively attempts to seduce him. Their relationship continues for many weeks in complete secrecy, though the two share absolutely no connection beyond a physical attraction. When Ben is coaxed by Mr. Robinson and his own parents (William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson) into dating young Elaine Robinson (Katharine Ross), he haphazardly tries to ruin any chance of this relationship ever working, in the process falling in love with Elaine. Trapped amidst one of the most awkward triangular relationships in cinema history  a boy, a girl and her mother  Ben must ultimately make a choice about who he would rather be with. Instead of merely drifting along, he must decide what he wants and take control of his life.'The Graduate' appealed very much to younger audiences in its day. With its disapproving attitudes towards the older generation's complete belief in materialism (epitomised by Mr. McGuire's (Walter Brooke) one-word recipe for happiness  ""plastics!""), the film shows a wide rift between the young and old, making Ben's relationship with Mr. Robinson seem all the more shocking and scandalous. Only the younger characters in the film (Ben and Elaine) are afforded first names, likely a deliberate choice to clarify the clear distinction between the two generations. In 1967, Simon and Garfunkel were at the height of their fame, and Nichols exploited this to its full potential. By blending newly-performed tracks (""Mrs. Robinson"") with those already popular with audiences (""The Sounds of Silence""/""Scarborough Fair""), he created a highly memorable soundtrack, whose songs are now universally associated with the themes and particular scenes of the film. ""The Sounds of Silence,"" considering it was written before 'The Graduate' was produced, is a perfect accompaniment to the film, effectively translating Ben's overwhelming feelings of loneliness and alienation.Considering I was expecting a straight-out drama, 'The Graduate' has its own share of hilariously comedic moments, most arising from Ben's pathetic impulsive actions when placed in a confusing situation. My favourite (supposedly improvised by Hoffman to prevent his own laughter from showing on camera) involves Ben dejectedly retreating to the back of the room to bang his head repeatedly against a wall after his pathetic attempt to grope an undressing Mrs. Robinson's chest. Revolutionary, funny, dramatic and memorable, 'The Graduate' is a deserving all-time American classic.",The Graduate
71,dee.reid,"""The Graduate,"" with top honors!",10,10 August 2010,"Incredibly enough, the only reason I even had the slightest clue about this movie was due to an episode of ""The Simpsons"" a few years back. Now that I've seen ""The Graduate"" in its entirety, I now see where that famous episode got its inspiration. Of course being that I'm only 24, that is perhaps the reason why I never quite caught on to the connection between this movie and that particular ""Simpsons"" episode, and plus I have an entire century of movies to pick up the references from!On the serious side, though, ""The Graduate"" is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and certainly one of the best movies ever made. Directed by Mike Nichols (who won an Oscar for Best Director) and adapted from the novel of the same name by Charles Webb, 21-year-old Benjamin Braddock (a then-30-year-old Dustin Hoffman in real life, in his film debut) is constantly on the verge of panic within the film's first 20 minutes. He's just graduated from college (hence the film's title), and has no clue about what he wants to do with his life. His upper-crust parents mistakenly think that he'll probably go to graduate school, after some much-needed rest & relaxation, of course. Instead, Ben just spends his days floating about aimlessly decked out in full scuba gear at the bottom of his parents' swimming pool.Ben does get some direction - or is it misdirection? - when Mrs. Robinson (the late Anne Bancroft), the wife of his father's business partner, tries to seduce him, and he eventually lets her, in private liaisons at an upscale downtown hotel. Ben's own youthful, post-college confusion and Mrs. Robinson's marital unhappiness is a match made in the hellish depths of suburban affluence. The affair continues on for a while with little problems, that is, until, Elaine Robinson (Katharine Ross), the Robinson's college-bound daughter, comes home from Berkeley and Ben suddenly finds some direction in his life because for the first in his life since he came home from college, he now knows what he wants because suddenly he's in love! This of course, causes all sorts of problems because he can't date Elaine while still carrying on a sordid affair with her mother!I've found yet another screen hero in Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of Benjamin Braddock. He's the character that defined a generation; not just for college kids circa-1967, but for college kids 43 years later in 2010! Any kid who goes to college for four years (in my case 5 1/2) and comes out without a single clue as to their future, will instantly find something to like about Ben. (I know sometimes that I feel that I'm Ben; I'm out of college three months and working full-time and still questioning whether or not I made the right decision in my college career.) Ben is confused, desperate, alienated, and clueless. The world as he knows it is big, bad, and scary (hence why he finds solace at the bottom of his parents' swimming pool). His parents expect that he's going to go and make something big of himself, but one of the film's themes regards the cross-generational shift in values, and so some (if not all) of the norms & values of his parents' age may not fit in within the norms & values of his generation.And of course, Ben's generation's norms & values are perhaps quite radically different from mine. In my age- and sex-obsessed generation of 2010, you can bet that Ben's generation of baby boomers would have coronaries due to 2010 standards of right and wrong, what's cool and uncool. And it just seems to me, at least, that people in my generation only just seem to really want instant gratification without really having the will to work for it (which could be blamed on the older generations, each previous one working hard so that the next one has it a little bit easier - but my generation seems to me, to get bored pretty easily, lacks any real moral/ethical foundations, and overall just seems to be pretty lazy); but again, this could be blamed on previous generations.At the end of the day, ""The Graduate"" is really all just about Ben, and his lack of direction. Only when he makes the mistake of falling for Elaine Robinson does his future become clear: it's to marry her, with little pondering of what goes on after that, as demonstrated by this film's hilarious albeit appropriately awkward ending at a church. Anne Bancroft creates a sexy and fearsome, but ultimately tragic and sympathetic Mrs. Robinson. She's not a monster who really forces herself upon Our Poor Hero (a ""cougar"" as today's modern slang terminology would call her), but she's someone who has a chance to make herself happy for once while stuck in a loveless marriage and it seems that she will do anything to keep Ben all to herself, much to his kicking & screaming (heart's dismay). We were all saddened by her passing in 2005, but if she is remembered for any of her many iconic screen roles, it should be the beautiful and seductive, not-so-ordinary suburban housewife Mrs. Robinson.""The Graduate"" is obviously dated by its '60s-era Simon & Garfunkel-performed soundtrack. And even if the dated soundtrack is a musical vocalization of Ben's (and to a greater extent, '60s-era college graduates) frustrations and anxieties, the movie itself still has great relevance today, and for that reason alone, ""The Graduate"" will never grow old, and will always receive top honors from movie-lovers everywhere, no matter what decade.10/10",The Graduate

Though the proverbial ""fat lady"" already has sung, packed up her music, and left the building, Elaine Robinson cannot refrain from beating a dead horse. In the moment that may have inspired the ""God is Dead"" Movement in the late 1960s, actor Dustin Hoffman as Ben Braddock ends his marathon drive and sprint by jamming a sacred metal cross into the church door to trap the mostly elderly gathered Christians inside their temple. The message here is that religion, morals, community standards, knowing where your next meal is coming from, and people over 21-years-old have no place in the Brave New World. The cross country running team captain has barely lifted a foot all summer, because this New World Order is totally fluid--""Plastics!"" is the current buzz word. Now it's perfectly rational to let the mom show her daughter's designated date how things work in bed for his ""maiden voyage"" (or first 50 trips through the wickets), as long as no one thinks too hard about it. Elaine may have been ""started"" in a Ford, but it doesn't take her long to move up to Ben's sporty red Alfa Romeo convertible.

73,Coxer99,The Graduate,10,23 March 1999,"The sequence where Hoffman asks Buck Henry for a room is still one of the funniest scenes ever. It's been said that Nichols' direction to Hoffman was that he should look as if he's asking for condoms. It's wonderful! Hoffman filling out the register, messing up and crumbling a piece of paper into his pocket and starting over is right on the money. It's a perfectly timed sequence with no one playing it too heavily. That's how the entire film is. The film is funny because it seems to me that no one really takes themselves too seriously. Maybe it's the rich and wealthy who feel that way. In any case, the performances are outstanding.  Bancroft is shocking and seductive as the mischievous Mrs. Robinson. Katherine Ross is still one of the most beautiful women ever. The sequence in the bar when she's crying is a perfect shot of her beauty. Hoffman is damn near perfect as Benjamin, even though the original idea for the character was someone resembling a Redford or George Segal. Hoffman's Benjamin is a loner in need of something. Direction. Love. Guts. All of those things.  I'm not so sure that Ben can truly love anything. It looked as if he had a lot of growing up to do. Who knows if we'll met Ben and Elaine again.

77,slokes,Benjamin is really me (and you),10,1 September 2003,"""The Graduate"" is a timeless classic about the perils of growing up as experienced by one Benjamin Braddock, an accomplished graduate (a letter athlete AND newspaper editor) from a college back east stuck about what to do with the rest of his life. About the only things he manages to do is have assignations with the wife of his father's business partner and float around the pool at his parents' upper-middle class estate. ""I'm just drifting in the pool,"" he assures his father, when the old man asks what's up. ""It's comfortable just to drift.""We never really get an idea of what Benjamin's childhood was like, which might account for his reluctance to move on. We see glimpses of his bedroom, an aquarium, and some model planes tethered to the ceiling, but not much. Dustin Hoffman plays him for the most part as a cipher. This feels at first like a bit of a mistake. Who is he? Why should we care? But then it dawns on you, as it did on me the first time I saw it, just after I graduated from college: The guy is me! By making him a blank, Hoffman and director Mike Nichols invite the viewer to pour his (or her) own suppositions into this affable but conflicted character.The supporting actors are also terrific, especially Anne Bancroft, who on repeat viewings is more the heart of the film than Hoffman in her heartless way. Every scene with her in it commands your attention, and it's a sign of advancing age when you watch more for her reactions than his. Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robinson has a couple of great scenes, and his last confrontation with Benjamin in his Berkeley apartment is right up there with Hamilton's final scene as Amity's mayor in ""Jaws."" Wish they made more use of him in Hollywood. I love William Daniels, too, who is both honestly affectionate and facile as Mr. Braddock, especially when he coaxes his son outdoors in his scuba suit for the film's ultimate ""lost-in-a-big-world"" metaphor, featuring Hoffman standing lonely in the center of a suburban swimming pool. It's a key image in explaining the crisis behind Ben's inertia, that he doesn't only NOT know what he's supposed to be doing with his life, but more importantly, why he should care. [""Knight Rider"" fans should know upfront that Daniels didn't do double-duty as the voice of Benjamin's Alfa-Romeo.]The whole feeling of late 1960s suburban culture is pretty immersive here, and put to fantastic use. As a child of the '70s, I can pick up on a lot of residue references. ""The Newlywed Game"" plays in the background TV as Benjamin appears to pick up Elaine Robinson for the first time, and Simon and Garfunkel are effectively sprinkled throughout. The cocktail music not by S&G that accompanies the famous ""Are you trying to seduce me"" scene is pretty great, too, an effective jaunty counterpoint to the tension between Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson that helps underscore the humor and render the moment a true cinematic classic.",The Graduate
78,EUyeshima,"Still a Funny, Perceptive Classic Forty Years Later and in a DVD Package Worthy of Its Reputation",10,13 September 2007,"If there is one film deserving of a full-blown renaissance, it is this seminal 1967 social alienation comedy, and this 40th Anniversary Collector's Edition DVD presents an especially pristine print, as well as several extras that will please die-hard fans. Based on the wry 1963 Charles Webb novel, the film itself holds a special affection among its original audience even now, the aging Vietnam War-era population who championed anarchy and the people who revise their personal histories, so they can think they were members of the now-fashionable counter-cultural movement. At the same time, it has a timeless quality for new generations simply because it's a consistently witty, observant piece of cinema targeted to anyone who has experienced that sense of post-academic confusion when the responsibilities of real life inevitably intrude.This is an accomplished film for someone directing only his second film. But then again, judging from his subsequent work all the way to Angels in America and Closer, Mike Nichols seems to have come into film-making fully understanding the frailties of the human condition and knowing how to convey them in a way that audiences could empathize. It is a testament to Nichols and screenwriters Buck Henry and Calder Willingham that the social comedy aspects of this film do not seem at all dated. In fact, despite its provocative veneer, it's really old-fashioned in key ways from the protagonist's moralistic tendencies to his romantically compulsive motivations toward the end. Dustin Hoffman was pulled out of complete obscurity to play Benjamin, the alienated, recent college graduate drifting amid his parents' Southern California upper-middle class, swimming pool-centered ennui.As Benjamin figures out what to do with his life and faces unwanted advice from his parents' friends, enter Mrs. Robinson, a bored, restless wife, a self-proclaimed alcoholic and about as sympathetic as Lady Macbeth. It's hard to imagine what the original choice, Doris Day, would have done with this role, as it takes Anne Bancroft's formidable arsenal of skills to bring this vituperative woman to life. She gives a masterful performance. The hotel sequence where Benjamin awkwardly asks Mrs. Robinson for a drink is shrewdly observed and downright hilarious - the suspicious hotel clerk (Henry, the film's co-screenwriter) eyeing Benjamin's every move; the reception line which Benjamin pretends to know (TV veterans Alice Ghostley and Marion Lorne, Esmeralda and Aunt Clara from Bewitched, make indelible marks here); and the predatory Mrs. Robinson's business-like approach to seduction.Complicating matters exorbitantly is Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, played with relative nonchalance by Katharine Ross. The film then turns into a revenge comedy with Mrs. Robinson trying to prevent the inevitable coupling of Benjamin and Elaine. She almost succeeds but not before a series of revelations and dramatic encounters that lead to the classic ending aboard the public bus. Some of the comedy and characterizations seem a bit extreme, for example, Hoffman seems to amplify his character's nebbishness a few too many times, and Elaine's fiancée appears like a textbook 1960's TV stereotype. There are also a few forgivable geographic gaffes - most of the campus scenes are not filmed at Berkeley as portrayed in the film but at USC, and Benjamin crosses the Bay Bridge in the wrong direction to hunt for Elaine.The 2007 40th Anniversary Collector's Edition DVD contains two separate commentary tracks, both insightful but for different reasons - the first is an anecdotal remembrance with Hoffman and Ross quite engaged with details of the filming (Hoffman apparently had quite a crush on Ross and still does), and the second has Nichols and director Steven Soderbergh discussing all aspects of the production from casting to camera set-ups within specific scenes. The main featurette is the new 25-minute ""Students of 'The Graduate'"", which amounts to an extended appreciation of the film from Henry; producer Lawrence Turman; two film scholars; various directors (Harold Ramis, Marc Forster, Valerie Faris & Jonathan Dayton, David O. Russell); and film critics (Newsweek's David Ansen, Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman). The second new short, ""The Seduction"", is a nine-minute retrospective look at the famous scene where Mrs. Robinson nonchalantly pounces on Benjamin. The participants from the first featurette are involved here as well, and it provides a good dissection of not only the scene but the sexual mores prevalent at the time of filming.There are two holdovers from the 1999 DVD release. The first is the 22-minute ""'The Graduate' at 25"" produced in 1992 for the laserdisc release. It has the advantage of participation from Hoffman and Ross but otherwise echoes the information presented in the newer retrospective featurette. The second is a 22-minute interview with Hoffman done in quick takes. He lends invaluable and often amusing insight into his selection for the role and the film-making experience. He also talks about the proposed sequel which one can assume eventually turned into 2005's execrable Rumor Has It.... Beyond the original theatrical trailer, the DVD contains a print of the film that makes it look as good as it did in its original release. There is a bonus soundtrack sampler CD with four of the distinctive Simon and Garfunkel songs featured in the movie - ""The Sound of Silence"", ""Scarborough Fair/Canticle"", ""April Come She Will"", and of course, ""Mrs. Robinson"". Lastly, there is a helpful six-page booklet that fills in the rest of the blanks on the production. This is a great package for a classic film.",The Graduate
79,TOMNEL,Very weird.,9,18 February 2006,"starring Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft and William Daniels.This is a strange movie. It's about Dustin Hoffman being seduced by his friend's mom and eventually buying in to it and meeting her places while her daughter's away. It has Simon and Garfunkle music splattered all over it and is very 60's-ish. All in all, it's actually a beautiful film in some way. I give it a 9 because I was entertained through all of it and the music was great and the acting was excellent too. I recommend it if you like cult movies. William Daniels gives an excellent held back performance as the father too.Rated R for sex and language. My rating-95%-A.",The Graduate
80,Enchorde,Mrs Robinson...,7,10 February 2009,"Recap: Ben is coming home after having graduated. He is confused and upset about his future, not seeing his path. And it does not really help when his father's partner's wife comes on to him really strong. Despite himself Ben begins an affair with her, Mrs Robinson. Bur life really really becomes complicated when he meets Elaine, Mrs Robinson's daughter. He falls for her, but mother Robinson is willing to do anything to stop him from dating her...Comments: ""You are trying to seduce me, Mrs Robinson."" A classic line in a classic movie. However, I was a little surprised that it was in the very beginning of the movie. It seems like the climax of a long courtship, but surprisingly no.I would like to split this movie in to. One with Elaine, and one without. The first half, the one without Elaine, when Ben haves his affair with Mrs Robinson is actually quite dull. Slow, cut in small episodes. I'm not sure if it is an intentional reflection of Ben's internal state, however it was really boring.And introduce Elaine. The disturbing affair becomes a very interesting triangle drama were Ben tries to court Elaine and desperately avoid Mrs Robinson. The dull first half suddenly into a spectacular funny second half. It is funny in an absurd way where Ben finds himself in situations, the one more impossible than the other. I regret that the first half wasn't set up like this second part. But it is quite possible that the first part did the necessary groundwork for the second.In the first half I was prepared to turn the movie off, but the second completely resuscitated it into an overall better than average movie. Really good actually.7/10",The Graduate
81,Boyo-2,Mrs. Robinson....an icon in American cinema,10,12 October 1999,"This movie is very well respected and all that and I am glad it has a following.  It is a terrific movie but to be honest it went way downhill for me in the second half, when Mrs. Robinson is more or less out of the picture.  Bancroft is magnificent and should have won her second Oscar. She is the sexiest woman I have ever seen on screen.",The Graduate
82,Steffi_P,"""Hello, darkness""",8,2 October 2011,"When the Motion Picture Production Code was abolished in 1967 every movie genre was irrevocably changed. Action pictures became bloodier, dramas became swearier, and romances became openly sexual. One of the earliest movies to show this change was The Graduate, a movie that pushed at the boundaries of taste not with smut but simply by showing who might be getting into bed with whom, and why.It's an interesting story we have here. On the one hand it follows a very traditional romantic story arc that can be traced all the way back to Jane Austen. Our hero is at first attracted to one member of the opposite sex, only to find the relationship unfulfilling, and find that the ""right"" choice was under his nose all along. The difference of course is that The Graduate is very frank about how bizarrely messy real world relationships can be. There is perhaps a bit of a 1950s-style dig at assertive women (the plot is basically An American in Paris if Nina Foch was Leslie Caron's mother). Ben Braddock makes a distinctly creepy lead man as well, conceivably only a couple of nudges away from Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, to the point where it's unbelievable that Elaine should fall for him. But the whole thing has such a sly, anarchic slant to it that it's enjoyable despite these dubious factors.The director here is a young Mike Nichols. Nichols is really good at playing with the images so that we only focus on the main characters. Often a minor character will appear with their back to the camera, contravening regular film grammar. Even when a character is more prominent, for example Mr Robinson or Carl, they are cleverly shot and lit so that while we remember what they do and say, we don't really get a clear look at them and they don't linger in the mind. Nichols is somewhat heavy-handed at times in trying to absorb us in the mood of a scene (the lengthy moving close-up of Dustin Hoffman at the party is a rather too artificial), but it certainly does the trick, even if it's headache-inducing at times. The precision involved can be exquisite too. The first time we see Anne Bancroft at the party, she might as well be just another extra, but she has a bit of clear space around her, and looks up just as the camera pauses, and thus we notice her, without actually realising yet that she's important.The Graduate also gives us some fine examples of acting. Ms Bancroft is the best, only marginally convincing age-wise, but certainly possessing of all the bitterness and frustration necessary for the role. Dustin Hoffman is deceptively quiet here, never really seeming to show much personality, but when for example he announces his intentions to marry Elaine he has the necessary conviction despite his quietness. Katharine Ross gives a decent turn too, having the most overstated role but keeping it within the bounds of naturalism. No-one else really stands out, but of course that is the whole point of Nichols's directorial scheme.When motion pictures became more explicit about sex, there was inevitably a great hue and cry from many in Hollywood's old guard. A lot of this was simple prudery, but others had more practical objections. Raoul Walsh for example, in his highly entertaining autobiography, says how in the old days all the tension was in when the romantic leads would finally get together, but in the modern era they will probably be shown having sex a third of the way through the movie, and that tension is gone. He has a point, but I think The Graduate puts forward a case for the sexualising of romantic cinema as something which makes the depiction of relationships more interesting, more compelling. It is, if nothing else, more true to life.",The Graduate

84,framptonhollis,Classic!,10,7 December 2015,"""The Graduate"" is one of my all time favorite movies. Mixing light hearted comedy with dark melodrama, it is the perfect film in every way.One of the film'd best achievements as a film is its ability to make the audience really feel for the characters. When it isn't being funny, ""The Graduate"" can be really, really bleak, and almost brutal to watch! I really showcases how a film can have an emotional impact on its audience. There were actually times where I needed to remind myself it was just a film. It was so engaging and I felt so much concern for the main character that I actually started forgetting I was watching a film, both of the times I watched it (I feel like watching it again sometime really soon, considering it genuinely is pretty entertaining).The film is also highly enhanced by a great soundtrack made up of songs by Simon & Garfunkel. The scenes in which ""Sound of Silence"" is played (all three of them) are really powerful, because of both the great song and because of what we, as an audience, are witnessing on screen.""The Graduate"" is a beautifully made film, as well. Some of the shots are very artfully done and, one is particular stands out. It is shown from the point of view of Benjamin, Dustin Hoffman's character, while wearing diving goggles, and proceeding to jump into a swimming pool.There's also some great montage sequences. The scene in which ""The Sound of Silence"" and ""April Come She Will"" play back to back is excellently edited and one of the true highlights of the film.This film is a true classic. Wonderfully made, with great performances, great direction and is just, overall, a genius film. It is an engaging, entertaining, emotional, funny, and classic ride, that even includes a bit of pretty smart satire on top of all that!",The Graduate
85,nycritic,Youth and Alienation in the Late 60s,10,21 May 2006,"It's funny how THE GRADUATE has become to symbolize a dissatisfied generation. Benjamin Braddock, the hero, the boy who came home flooded in early achievements, the boy with promise, walking around in a complete daze while his very suburban parents coo and squeal like gushing teenagers about his success and predict more to come. Benjamin Braddock, the boy who has been given an abstract prediction of the future by a family friend in the film's landmark quote: ""Plastics."" But will he act on this word? Will he act on anything? This is the crux of the matter: Benjamin, it seems, is one of those early over-achievers fulfilling other people's dreams, while he basks under the sun, literally suspended in his parents' pool, caught between security, complacency, and the uncertain future.The thing is, Benjamin is virgin to life itself. Forget that a certain Mrs. Robinson has gone into infamy as the older woman who seduced a boy half her age for unexplained reasons other than a perverse, predatory attraction which hints at matters left unexplored not only between the two -- their affair seems to happen with the passion of lovers engaged in the mechanics of sex. Her appearance in the movie, so aggressive it almost emasculates Benjamin, is a suffocating reminder of those Oedipal ties to the past -- the female womb (notice the physical resemblance between Mrs. Robinson and Mrs. Braddock) -- that demand dependence to its whims and decries any chance of true rebellion and severance.Mrs. Robinson is THE GRADUATE's most interesting character. In fact, her villainy should be taken into note because she literally does two things: robs Benjamin from his cradle in what can only constitute as sexual harassment, and by hooking him onto her she also makes him the fall guy for no reason than her own empty life, her shattered dreams, and a need for repetition going down to the next generation. For the most of her initial appearances, she is seen speaking in haughty, sophisticated tones. She looks down at Benjamin, whom she has chosen as her boy toy. He is to fall for her allure: indeed, she is very beautiful and self-possessed. It's only when the focus threatens to leave her high and dry because of suburban complacency and shifts to Elaine, her daughter, that her true self comes out.Elaine is also an interesting character but for reasons that have less to do with her presence as a sacrificial lamb late in the movie. I believe she and Benjamin are little more than pawns for their parents' self-congratulation as if they were marveling at how wonderful their children turned out. Her affection towards Benjamin is weakly displayed, and makes her horror at learning of his affair with her mother the only flaw. I felt that while she did like Ben, she hadn't precisely fallen in love with him to be that hurt. Also, her reaction to her mother's betrayal is never seen so it must be imagined, and when she finally does take the stand against her marriage of sacrifice/convenience, it looks more like a need for a satisfying conclusion.However, THE GRADUATE, while it does satisfy, it also deceives. What awaits Ben and Elaine as they ride off together in this bus? They are separate even in the end, which leads me to believe that they've got even more problems ahead than merging into a unit. With so much shared personal history together I can't see them maintaining a happy end -- but since the story embraces its own iconoclastic conformity in having Ben get the girl his parents wanted him to marry in the first place, a wobbly life together is what they can face. After all, they're barely kids escaping their homes and about to face the real world for the first time. No film had told this story about leaving the nest for good up until then.This is a fantastic film that broke the standards of transition from scene to scene, has that haunting score by Simon and Garfunkel, and has incredible, hallmark performances. Anne Bancroft, not a glamorous woman, is as mentioned before the film's rotten heart concealed in that husky voice, those dark eyes, and that aura of pure, frigid sex. She's a reminder of the perversions that can arise when you do not know yourself and allow a mistake to taint your life. Dustin Hoffman, also not a handsome matinée idol and having a frog-like voice, lent a degree of credibility to his character who could (at the time) be your next-door neighbor and is great in showing how displaced and limp his character is against what a world wants from him, how the world sees him, and how the two women in his life affect him. Katharine Ross also has a difficult role: her character is less defined and has to convince that she's about to ""graduate"" from being a girl and becoming a woman in love for the first time.",The Graduate
86,jacobs-greenwood,Simon & Garfunkel's soundtrack is classic,6,24 October 2016,"A classic? Yes. An essential? Not in my book. I contend that it's the film's soundtrack and timing which has made others consider it one.Still, it's a comedy, romance, drama that's received wide acclaim and features a terrific, Best Actress Oscar nominated performance by Anne Bancroft. Fellow co-stars Dustin Hoffman and Katharine Ross were also nominated and director Mike Nichols won. The film, its Screenplay (co-written by Buck Henry, who also appears as a hotel desk clerk), and Cinematography also received nominations.Hoffman plays the titled graduate, Benjamin Braddock, who's advised to learn about ""plastics"" (#42 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movie Quotes list) for his future. Instead, he has an affair with Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft), the wife of his father's (William Daniels) partner (Murray Hamilton). That is, until he meets the Robinson's daughter Elaine (Ross).Naturally, Mrs. Robinson is outraged that Benjamin wants to drop her for her daughter. She tells Elaine which leads her daughter into an engagement with another suitor. The film's ending is a classic, not easily forgotten.

87,DeeNine-2,"Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson",10,25 November 2003,"This is one of the defining films of my generation, and of course I saw it when it came out in 1967. Seeing it again after all these years I was struck by both how funny it is and by the brittle, cynical and brilliant performance by Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson. She really is flawless in a part that might easily lend itself to overacting. Instead she is subtle, controlled, focused, and authentic in a way that is both sexy and chilling with just a hint of ironic humor. The maternal manner with which she treats virginal Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman in a breakout role) emphasizes the creepy, almost incestuous nature of their sterile affair.Mike Nichols has directed a number of sexual/relationship comedies, including Carnal Knowledge (1971), Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966), Nora Ephron's Heartburn (1986) and Carrie Fisher's Postcards from the Edge (1990). Nichols's films typically feature talented and charismatic actors and actresses who explore in a deceptively humorous manner the dark side of our human nature. The humor usually has an edgy quality while the taboo elements are somehow resolved into happy endings as in a musical comedy. Nichols likes to work with material from another medium and make it his own.Typically, The Graduate is adapted from the novel by Charles Webb. Nichols also likes to feature cutting edge popular music in the score. What we hear in the background and played over the opening credits is Simon and Garfunkel's ""Sounds of Silence."" Of course Paul Simon wrote the song ""Mrs. Robinson"" for this movie, but what I didn't realized until now is his ""It's all happening at the zoo"" was probably inspired in part by the zoo scene in this film.Dustin Hoffman's confused and drifting Benjamin, worried about his future and suffocated by his parents' generation, knocked everybody out in those days with his dead-panned, literal delivery of one-liners, some of which were written by Buck Henry, who plays the desk clerk at the rendezvous hotel. I especially loved Ben's answer when his father, enquiring about his Quixotic plan to marry Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross), asks, ""Isn't this a half-baked idea?"" In dead seriousness, Benjamin says, ""No, sir. It's completely baked.""Memorable is Norman Fell (whom most of us recall from TV's long-running comedy, Three's Company) in a small part as the landlord of the Berkeley rooming house. He is of course a past master at dead-panning one-liners; in fact, he is a master at mute dead-panning. One of the funniest bits in the movie is when the camera catches his face as Elaine's father comes out of Ben's room spewing obscenities and insults at Ben.What we loved about this movie was the youthful point of view; the wonderful chase scene at the end, a Hollywood staple made fresh; the sympathetic character of Benjamin with whom we could readily identify; the cliché-ridden and shallow parents being slyly made fun of; and the sense of getting what we want out of life and doing it our own way. This is a coming-of-ager and a romance and a social satire rolled into one, and a classic Hollywood movie that no aficionado would want to miss.But see this for Anne Bancroft, a brilliant and perhaps underrated actress in one of her most memorable roles.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",The Graduate

89,sme_no_densetsu,"Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson",8,5 November 2009,"""The Graduate"" is generally considered one of the finest American films of all time. Originally released in 1967, it was one of the key films that heralded a changing of the guard in American cinema.The story concerns a recent college graduate (Dustin Hoffman) who begins an affair with the wife of his father's business partner (Anne Bancroft). Even if you haven't seen the film before you've probably seen parodies of some of the film's best-remembered moments, such as ""Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me"", ""Plastics"" and the climactic wedding scene.Yet, when I first watched the film I wasn't really that impressed, possibly because of my prior familiarity with the film through it's references in pop culture. It took a second viewing at a later date to convince me of the film's merit.The cast is well chosen, with Dustin Hoffman & Anne Bancroft perfect in their roles. They were able to make their characters believable even though there was actually only a six year difference in their ages. Katharine Ross isn't bad but not in the same league as Hoffman & Bancroft. Besides the leads there are also some memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of William Daniels, Norman Fell & Buck Henry.Mike Nichols's direction is top notch and displays many interesting touches throughout the film. He was a deserving winner of the Best Director Oscar (the film's only win out of seven nominations). Nichols also makes excellent use of the music of Simon & Garfunkel, including ""The Sounds of Silence"" & ""Scarborough Fair/Canticle"".In my opinion, ""The Graduate"" is an essential film. If for no other reason, see it so that you'll 'get' the numerous references to the film in popular culture.",The Graduate

91,KUAlum26,Could this kind of movie be done again?,10,10 July 2005,"Mike Nichols directs and Dustin Hoffman stars in this film that is now considered by many to be a classic(I would be one to concur).The performances in this film are unforced and not overstated,in particular Dustin Hoffman(in only his second movie role at the time and his first featured part)and Anne Bancroft(rest her soul!) as Ben Braddock and the bored,sexy and controlling Mrs.Robinson. Katharine Ross' Elaine Robinson is,for the most part,playing ""straight-man"" to the proceedings but she,too,is winsome and likable here. Buck Henry's script isn't so much hilarious as it is sharp,clever and amusing. Mike Nichols' direction seems to be almost ""hands off"" as the long camera shots and gradual pacing of dialogue is meant to accent the awkwardness and anticipation of the movie's characters.I imagine that many young men(I for one)have imagined having a sexual relationship with an older,more sophisticated woman. This movie,based on a book that I was not,I confess,fully aware of,examines the reality of a relationship like this. From time to time,movies have been made to explore this theme since,ranging from thoughtful and sweet(Harold and Maude) to crass and exploitive(My Tutor,anyone?). I wonder if any movie about an unusual and possibly wrong MAy/December relationship could be made again like this film. Granted,it works against the perfect backdrop:WASPy,wealthy,post-Kennedy America. But I feel like the themes here could be explored again,if done like this.In summary, a good ""theme"" movie with classic performances and lines. By no means a ""howler"" of a comedy,but worth a look for film connoisseurs anywhere.",The Graduate
92,frankde-jong,"Still a great movie, after all those years",9,16 March 2020,"When ""The graduate"" came out in the sixties it was a real sensation. In the first place in was the second noteworthy film of director Mike Nichols (after ""Who is afraid of Virginia Woolf"" (1966)). Subsequently Nichols would fall back to a more mediocre director. In the second place it was the breaktrough of lead actor Dustin Hoffman. Finally the music of Simon and Garfunkel.At the moment ""The graduate"" is viewed more critically. Was the acting of Dustin Hoffman really that great? Is the movie not terribly dated?With respect to the way that Dustin Hoffman plays Benjamin Braddock there is a grain of truth. In retrospect Benjamin Braddock seems to be a Raymond Babbitt light (""Rain Man"" (1988, Barry Levinson)). It is also difficult to understand why both Mrs Robinson (Anne Bancroft) and her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross) succumb to the (non existent) charms of the socially awkward Benjamin.I do however totally disagree with the opinion that ""The graduate"" is a dated movie. The ""graduate"" is not a hippie film (like for example ""Easy rider"" (1969, Dennis Hopper)) but a coming of age movie, and as that not bound to a particular decade. It is a good coming af age movie thereto. It is not about a main character craving for sex. In stead of that Benjamin Braddock is fascinated by sex, fear forming an integral part of that fascination (seducing scene). Benjamin Braddock does not have definite ideas about his future, but he knows for sure it is not the future his parents are planning for him. In the end Benjamin Braddock and Elaine Robinson are sitting in the bus, riding towards a completely unknown future. This open end is both beautiful and in harmony with the ambiance of the rest of the film.There are other beautiful scenes, like for example the first date of Benjamin and Elaine. Benjamin feels very embarrassed about this date. It is forced upon him by Mr Robinson while at the same time he is having an affair with Mrs Robinson. He cools down his anger by taking revenge on the innocent Elaine. He takes her to striptease bar, not out of habit (such as Travis Bickle with Betsy in ""Taxi driver"" (1976, Martin Scorsese)) but purposefully being rude. When Elaine asks him why he hates her so and starts to cry, the scene becomes very discomforting and beautiful at the same time.All in all, ""The graduate"" is still a great film after all these years. Maybe it is time to recalibrate the contribution that respectively Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft have made to this greatness.",The Graduate
93,Sirus_the_Virus,"A horrible situation, a fantastic film.",10,6 January 2010,"The Graduate is a classic that involves a horrible situation, but it's a great film. And when I say great, I mean great. The Graduate, nominated for best picture in the 60's, deserves to be called a classic. I was never once bored by this movie. It's funny, to some extent romantic, to some extent creepy, and definitely, in the final act, dramatic. Mike Nicols has directed some of the best work I have ever seen. Though The Birdcage didn't do fantastic, it is the funniest movie I have ever seen. Closer, starring only four stars, is fantastic no matter how many people are in it. And The Graduate. I also loved the soundtrack by Simon & Garfunkel. Funny that my two favorite songs by Simon & Garfunkel are sang throughout the entire movie.This is quite a story. It's a shame too. It's a movie about mistakes. Mistakes are happening through the entire film. From the beginning, in which Mrs. Robinson, and until the end. In which Ben realizes and his new lover realize that what they have just done was an awful idea. The lead character, Ben, is a real creep. I am not sure about this, but I believe that what he does in the end of the film is for spite. The film is about a newly college graduate named Ben Braddock(played excellently by Dustin Hoffman). Ben is worried about what he is going to do with his future. One night, he is asked by Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's business partner, to take her home. so when he does that, she tries to seduce him. At first, Ben hates the idea. Then eventually the two of them have sex and the two of them start to secretly see each other. Mrs. Robinson doesn't really care about Ben's feelings. She just uses him for sex and so then she can have him all for herself. Ben eventually starts to get tired of this, so he is soon put in a position in which he has to take her daughter Elaine out on a date. and he falls in love with her. That is when problems start.The song, Mrs. Robinson, sung by Simon & Garfunkel, is really sarcastic. The lyrics"" Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson, Jesus loves"" is really being sarcastic. Cause Mrs. Robinson is a big bitch. And because of her selfishness, all of their lives are ruined. I expected The Graduate to be funny. Oh my God how I was wrong. It starts out as a comedy, and then slowly turns into a drama. This is a fantastic film. This is one movie classic that nobody can miss. If you start watching it, at first you won't be too interested, and eventually, you'll be seduced by it.The Graduate: A+",The Graduate
94,RNMorton,Ground-breaking,9,26 August 2003,"And you kinda had to be around in '67 to realize just how ground-breaking this movie was.  Lots of new issues not yet addressed by a major film. Bancroft as the bored, aged manipulator and Hoffman as the innocent babe play off each other very effectively.  I think this film ages so well that if it was released today it would be accepted without missing a beat.",The Graduate
95,bobsgrock,Still Crazy After All These Years.,9,12 June 2008,"There is much speculation that this film is not so much a classic anymore as the political satire and dark humor it is so well known for is not relevant in today's world due to the allowance of so much more in society. While it is true that we are not as tight on censorship as we were in 1967, this film still poses many questions and themes that ring true today. If anything, The Graduate stands tall as the simple tale of a love triangle gone terribly askew.Dustin Hoffman makes the most of his breakthrough performance as Benjamin Braddock, the neurotic, geeky, very nervous college graduate who really has no clue what to do with this life. Benjamin represents all of us in a way, especially those who have recently graduated from school or made a significant change in our lives. He finds himself ensnared in a very vicious game involving a seductive, rather unfriendly woman, Mrs. Robinson, played with remarkable flair by Anne Bancroft, and her beautiful, innocent daughter, lovely portrayed by Katharine Ross. We know, as well as Benjamin does, that having an affair with Mrs. Robinson is a mistake and can lead to nothing but trouble. So, why do it? Perhaps it is simply to try something new and exciting or branch out into the world or let off some stress. Whatever the reason, the deed is done and soon, Benjamin finds himself stuck between falling in love with the girl of his dreams and trying to escape the clutches of the controlling mother.This film is very good for many reasons. The best being that the three leads are very good, especially Hoffman, who perfectly captures what it must have felt like to be in that situation in the late 1960s, when everything is changing, but you feel like you're standing still. The script is very funny, particularly the scenes between Hoffman and Bancroft, which almost play off like a comedic parody. The story does an almost complete changeover as Benjamin changes his interest from Mrs. Robinson to Elaine. The film then becomes a chase to see if our hero (or anti-hero) can accomplish his feat. As the audience, it is difficult to identify or cheer for any of these characters. To us, they have all put themselves in this unhappy position and deserve their fate. Still, it is very interesting to see how this all unfolds. In this reviewer's opinion, the ending is sheer perfection.The climax feels more like an anti-climax, but that was probably the filmmakers's intentions. We see the couple we want to see, but they are not doing what we want them to do. Mike Nichols' direction is fantastic, especially from Benjamin's point of view. It all comes together to show what the cinema is capable of, and how people can ruin theirs and others' lives by one simple choice.",The Graduate
96,Jeremy_Urquhart,A great film deserving of its classic status,9,21 July 2020,"First time I've seen this since 2011 (god the nerd in me loves knowing that- thanks internet).
Funny how I was about four years younger than the main character the first time I watched it, and about four years his senior on this rewatch, yet I still had a similar experience with the movie, thoroughly enjoying it both times.The third act briefly drags in parts, which keeps this at a 4.5/5 instead of a 5/5 for me, but it's made up for with a fantastic final ten minutes, and a particularly great ending.
The performances are all really good, it's shot and edited fantastically, and the Simon & Garfunkel score works surprisingly well.Deserves its status as a classic, and is a must watch for anyone on this site who hasn't happened to have watched it yet.",The Graduate
97,hall895,And here's to you...,8,15 February 2008,"The Graduate is a film which has so much going for it. It's wonderfully written...witty when it has to be, smart throughout. It's beautifully photographed with director Mike Nichols framing so many scenes in the perfect manner to best tell his story. It's a film with some wonderful acting performances, most notably by the two leads, Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft, with Bancroft creating one of the most memorable characters in film history. Yes indeed, here's to you Mrs. Robinson. It's a film set in a very specific time and place, late 1960s upper middle class Californian suburbia. The values of that time and place are so very important to the story yet the film still holds up wonderfully four decades later.As the film opens we meet young Benjamin Braddock, played by Hoffman, who has just graduated college and is now returning home to figure out what he wants to do with his life. He'd like a little time to think about his future but his family, and pretty much everyone else around him, has other ideas. They want to know what this bright young man is going to do with himself and they want to know now. Feeling rather trapped by everyone else's expectations of what he should be Benjamin rebels in a rather unique way...having an affair with the wife of his father's business partner. Seems Mrs. Robinson is feeling a little trapped in her life as well. So the two engage in a summer-long affair. But to call this a romance would be inaccurate. These two barely speak to one another, there's no emotion involved. This is a purely physical relationship. But eventually there will be a dramatic turn. Pretty much forced into it by his parents Benjamin very reluctantly takes Mrs. Robinson's daughter on a date. Suffice to say Mrs. Robinson does not approve. When Benjamin comes to realize he'd much rather be with the daughter than the mother emotions boil over and the film begins to move in an all new direction, building to a classic conclusion.The Graduate is not a perfect film. It takes a little while to really get going as we establish just who Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson are and what drives them to have their affair. It's certainly important to learn about these characters' motivations but it is not until the affair actually begins that the story really takes off. And what a fascinating story it is and it's performed brilliantly. In his first major film role Hoffman seems rather awkward at times, especially in the film's beginning. But his awkwardness fits the character perfectly especially in the initial seduction scene where Benjamin is quite obviously way out of his league. But who wouldn't be out of his league when faced with Mrs. Robinson? Bancroft does a wonderful job of bringing this very unique character to life, hitting all the right emotional notes throughout. And there are certainly plenty of different emotions on display. While Hoffman and Bancroft carry the film there are other important performances as well, most notably by Katharine Ross in the pivotal role of Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine. Ross doesn't have nearly the screen time of the two leads. In fact for a character so important to the story we barely get to know Elaine at all which is a minor quibble with the film. But Ross makes the best of what she has to work with, one moment in particular standing out as she does a split-second emotional 180, instantly going from giddy happiness to something else entirely. Well done.The Graduate is a great film. The story is captivating and the actors have done a marvelous job with it. The Simon and Garfunkel songs which provide the soundtrack are a terrific addition to the film as they fit in perfectly with what is happening on the screen. All in all this is a film to be treasured and enjoyed again and again.",The Graduate
98,sharky_55,Plastics.,6,30 July 2016,"Benjamin Braddock is at the tender age in his life where the whole world awaits him and the possibilities are endless. Well, less endless then he might hope; his parents expect him to go on straight into graduate school with a long list of accolades and a much shorter list of career pathways. The frame shakes as he is rocked by each invasive query, each violation of his tender emotional state, each beady eye and ruffle of the hair. This delicate stage of every promising young man's life is full of tricky contradictions and impossible expectations; they baby and smother him, they tweak his nose, they carefully plan out every stone in the path. At the same time they are urging him to overreach, to surpass his potential, in other words...to act and behave like an adult almost immediately. Hoffman was twenty-nine, but doesn't he emblematise exactly where Ben is at; the constant agony carved deep into his face, the almost teary eyes, the stiffness in his body as he is maneuvered around the party's guests like an automaton. And so this goes on and on, for far too long, but I suppose the few weeks or months the film depicts must be an eternity of anguish for someone in their youthful twenties. Again and again we are thrust into the closeup of his despondent face, and then the zoom out reveals just how lonely he is, even in the midst of crowds of civilians (on a plane, or at a college campus). The film is deliberately drenched in the melancholic tunes of Simon & Garfunkel, as if it was Ben himself stuck by the radio in self-mourning (it's missing those delightful acoustic licks that would be in the studio version later). There may be a seldom instance of brief respite - see Ben surrounded by pure darkness, and then the witty zoom out that reveals it is just the hotel bed-board, the equivalent of a sly wink from Nichols - but it becomes so difficult to unearth anything else from Ben, so submerged in his grief. There are other neat camera and editing tricks, which seem frivolous at best. Naturally, all this moping around makes him an easy target for Mrs Robinson. She stalks around his innocent inhibitions, frames him like prey through the outline of her legs. Initially it seems harmless, a bit of naughty fun. He makes the accusation with a wide grin on his face, and the soundtrack sneaks in cheekily, like a twisted porno. Eventually it becomes obvious just how inexperienced he is, and how she is merely taking advantage of his situation to tame her primal needs. She's clever enough to prod him lightly into what she wants, prevent him from realising what she is doing. In the middle of the affair Ben refuses to go on, but she ever so slyly gives him a dose of his own medicine, turning self-conscious, and immediately he relents, because an intrinsic morality and nobility has been instilled into him. But Nichols is so determined to stack the odds against the older generation, so she is never developed further along the lines of her tragic past, and becomes a mean-spirited, stuffy stereotype. A better film might have folded Ben's own sensibilities and insecurities back into Mrs Robinson, making the whole tryst a doubly desperate attempt to recapture that youth, the fleeting moments of freedom, irresponsibility and spirit. But she is simply a predator. Her conversations with Ben are as empty as those of him and her daughter.The first impression of Nichols' goal by many (and still quite a few) is a celebration of the youthful vivacity of Ben, of his daring and radical relinquishment of all that is expected of him. The adults are all screaming themselves hoarse at his intrusion, and even Mrs Robinson has grown old and blind enough that her entrapment has been forgotten and she too is yelling. Ben is adamant to break the cycle; look at his disgust when Elaine mentions the putrid and unromantic method that she has been proposed to. It's no jumping on a bus and running away, which is in itself vague and directionless after the excitement has worn off. Nichols avoids any overt contextualisation, but the subtext is there, the counter-culture of the 60s, fighting hard for peace, for sex, for drugs, for equality, for the shedding of society's artificial excess. So these hippies and bohemians wanted widespread societal change, the overthrowing of the authoritative structures that bound them, but what then? Noble ventures aside, many of these endeavours seem more and more as fruitless and frozen-in- time as the lull in the back of that bus, as the young pair exchange nervous glances and the fervour slowly wears off. Perhaps a corporate desk job at Plastics Inc. might not have been so bad after all. Where oh where is Joe DiMaggio in a time like this?",The Graduate
99,johno-21,A smart and funny 60's flick,8,6 March 2006,"I saw this during it's initial theatrical release and it was a memorable coming of age film for it's time. A young Dustin Hoffman as Benjmin turns in a performance that would catapult him to superstar status as the shy and aimless collage grad suffering from post graduation burnout. He received an Academy Award nomination but did not win. Also nominated was Anne Bancroft as the mean-spirited seductress Mrs. Robinson who also went home without an Oscar. The beautiful Katherine Ross in her role as Benjamin's girlfriend Elaine who becomes betrothed to another and is the daughter of Mrs. Robinson received her only Academy Award nomination in her career. Buck Henry and Calder Willingham wrote the script which also received an nomination. The film also was nominated for Best Picture but the only award it won was for it's Director Mike Nicols. Rounding out this fine cast are William Daniels, Murry Hamilton, Norman Fell, Alice Ghostly and Buck Henry. Shut out from nominations for the great Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack was writer Paul Simon who memorable songs perfectly captured the times and feeling of this film. This was a big film for it's day depicting the generational gap but doesn't hold up as well as many others from it's era or from the year of 1967. I've seen this many times and would recommend it and give it an 8.5 on a scale of 10.",The Graduate
100,khanbaliq2,"The film became a landmark in the cinema of hip, New Wave, antiestablishment disillusionment.",10,28 June 2010,"A young California man (Dustin Hoffman) from a wealthy family, recently graduated, has no idea what to do with his life or how to meet his parents' expectations. He is led into an affair with an older woman (Anne Bancroft), the wife of his father's best friend, then falls in love with her daughter (Katharine Ross).Richly reflecting the disenchanted, anti-careerist mood of young people in the late sixties, this lushly-filmed sex comedy, surprisingly faithful to its excellent, concise source novel, opened a few new doors, looked ravishing, was well acted and had a popular music score. It also conferred instant stardom on Hoffman, who was older than his character: he was 30 when it opened. The Graduate is a comedy of its time, it has also stood the test of time. Adjusted for inflation, the film is #19 on the list of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada.",The Graduate
101,gab-14712,"Hello, Mrs. Robinson!",8,11 October 2017,"""Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me. Aren't you?"" If there is a movie that can hit viewers of all age from this groovy decade of the 1960's, I would have to choose The Graduate. At it's base, the movie is a coming-of-age story and usually those kind of stories relate with people of all ages. The younger generation may be living through the same eyes as the characters in the story and the older generation gets nostalgia as they remember the days of old. In fact, this movie is a favorite of my family. They grew up in the era when this film is released, so they understand the struggles the character is going through. Also the movie is recognizable because it is a damn fine piece of art. It took me years to see the film, and I finally did so recently. It did not hit me as strongly as it did with my family or other people of their generation, but there is no denying how good the film is.I feel like I can relate to the film somewhat because I'm in the same boat of our main character, Ben Braddock. Ben is a recent college graduate, but is struggling to find a life after college. I know how he feels, because I have the same struggles in a much more competitive world. I can also relate to Ben's personality, because I had similar traits years ago. Ben, in the film, struggles mightily around females because of his awkwardness. Back in my teenage days, I had similar issues. Although I eventually changed and I never fell for any older women like..ahem.Ben does. But people adore this movie because of its very relatable themes involving post-graduation life.One of the popular things about the movie was its soundtrack. The film heavily relied upon folk rock duo Simon & Garfunkel to provide the music, and provide the music they certainly did. One would say their most famous song is ""Mrs. Robinson."" Now you know where the song received its personality. Personally, I loved the music in the film but other people, such as the late great Roger Ebert had major qualms about the music. But everyone is subjected to their own opinions because everyone usually have different opinions about any single movie.This film follows around this kid, Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) as he joins the big, wide world after college graduation. Everyone expects great things out of him, especially his parents (played by William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson). At a homecoming party of his, Ben is asked to drive Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) home. Mrs. Robinson is the wife of his father's business partner (Murray Hamilton). After Ben drove the seductive older woman home, they begin an affair. But things take a sharp turn when Ben meets Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine (Katherine Ross).and falls in love with her. Now with two women in his romantic life with the affair unbeknownst to each other, Ben is going to have a lot of work to do.The film partly works because of its fine, naturalistic performances. Dustin Hoffman, despite being 29 at the film's release, convincingly plays Braddock as a shy, awkward kid who wants to take this time in joining the real world. Hoffman will become a big star, and this is the first piece in helping him do so. My word, I really enjoyed Anne Bancroft's performance as the seductive wife. She could have stolen any guy's heart with her portrayal. It's funny because she was supposed to be the older woman in the picture, but she's only six years older than Hoffman is. Those of you who seen the 90's sitcom, Boy Meets World, you'll recognize Mr. Feeney himself, William Daniels who played Ben's dad. He has some amusing scenes, and I particularly liked the scene where he forces his son to try on a scuba diving outfit much to Ben's chagrin. Murray Hamilton has a rather smallish role as Mr. Robinson, but I thought he did a fine job and likewise for Katherine Ross as Elaine, whom we don't meet until much later in the film.Mike Nichols was a well-known director who is known for his quirkiness and sensibilities in all of his films. He sadly passed away earlier this year, but he left behind a legacy of well-known works. The Graduate is his first feature film and boy what a way to introduce yourself to Hollywood. He does an amazing job directing this film and it's no surprise he won Best Director at the Oscars for his first film directorial effort. He told the story in a very crisp away and he never slowed down.The film works as a comedy and a drama, but its not funny in a way you would think. The comedy is more subtle, and that makes it refreshing. However, not everything meant as comedy I found funny. You can blame me living in a different generation for that. The movie also offers some unforgettable scenes. The very last scene with Elaine and Ben in a bus..just a classic scene and quite funny. Just watch the movie, and you'll see what I mean.Despite how much I enjoyed The Graduate, not all is perfect. The film feels outdated. What worked in the 1960's doesn't always work well today. Some jokes are not as funny and on the technical side of the film, it doesn't hold up well. As one would say, the movie has rusty pipes. But those pipes still work perfectly fine. Thanks to the music, the performances, and the themes, The Graduate is a lesson that all young people should learn and it's a movie that still appeals to the older generations. I enjoyed this film, even if other people enjoyed it more than I did.My Grade: B+",The Graduate
102,bankofmarquis,Career defining turn by Bancroft,9,16 June 2019,"On the surface, THE GRADUATE is a story of a young college graduate who has an affair with an older woman. But look beneath the surface and this film becomes much, much more.Directed by Mike Nichols, THE GRADUATE tells the tale of Benjamin Braddock a recent College Graduate who returns home to figure out what to do with his life. He enters the film in a malaise and is paralyzed into inaction by no clear direction to his life. Taking advantage of this young man's vulnerability, family friend, Mrs. Robinson, seduces Benjamin but Benjamin realizes that he is in love with Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine.Sounds pretty straight forward, right? But under the smart, understated Direction of Mike Nichols (who won an Oscar for his work), this film becomes much, much more - subverting the notion of love and lust while driving a narrative that shines a light on the generational gap between parents and adult children in a time of great change in America - oh...and doing it in a subtly comedic way (the screenplay was wonderfully written by the great Buck Henry who makes a cameo in this film as a Hotel clerk).Nichols, smartly, casts then relative unknown Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin because he was able to play the comedy of the awkwardness of the character (especially early on in the seduction/sex scenes with Mrs. Robinson) as well as showing emotion in emotionlessness. His Benjamin is empty - but not lacking of personality or interest - a tough tightrope to walk, but Hoffman plays it well and earned an Academy Award nomination for his work. His character does become...if I'm being honest...less interesting and more ""stalker-ish"" (certainly from a 21st Century perspective) as he pursues Elaine in the 2nd half of the film, so this diminishes this performance just a bit.Also earning an Academy Award nomination is Anne Bancroft who dons a career-defining role as Mrs. Robinson. She was having trouble with the part until Director Nichols reminded her that Mrs. Robinson is seducing Benjamin not out of love or lust, but out of anger at the direction her life has drifted. We find out that Mrs. Robinson was an Art Major in College but gave up anything resembling a career when she got pregnant shortly before marrying Mr. Robinson. You can see the seething anger and resentment in the way Bancroft performs this character, with just a tinge of regret. This is a woman trying to take some control over her life - by controlling her relationship with Benjamin. And, when Benjamin decides it is time to take control of his own life, she resents it and digs her claws in deeper. It is a tour-de-force performance, one of the all-time great female performances in film.The third side to this triangle is Elaine Robinson and as written - and portrayed by Katherine Ross - this is the most problematic of the characters. Elaine appears to be a well adjusted young woman finishing off her college career and is forced into a ""date"" with Benjamin at the insistence of Benjamin's parents and Elaine's father (Elaine's mother - Mrs. Robinson - is, understandably, silent on this). There is a good scene in the middle of the film where Benjamin and Elaine make a connection (which spurs Benjamin into his obsession with Elaine) but I couldn't really see what was in it for Elaine. Sure, there is the ""break away from the carefully crafted life that my parents have set up for me"" angle (and, surely, her desire to NOT marry the pre-Med student that she is engaged to lines right up with that) but I just didn't understand/buy her infatuation with Benjamin. Despite this, Ross earned the 3rd acting Nomination from this film.Credit all 3 of these performances to Director Nichols who finds the right balance in every scene along with an interesting visual style that punctuates the loneliness and isolation that Benjamin is feeling. Add to that the haunting songs/sounds of the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack - just about the only music in this film - and you have a funny, haunting and important film that is an interesting look at a time in America (the late '60's) where great change was happening and the ""Generation Gap"" was never more noticeable.One last note - I LOVED the closing shot of this film. Nichols let the camera roll just a little longer than the actors expected and the look on their faces change, subtly, from surety of their decision and direction to a more ""unsure"" look. It is a perfect, ambiguous, way to end and I applaud Nichols for making this strong choice.Come for the seduction, stay for the subtle humor and to watch a Director at the top of his game.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",The Graduate
103,SmileysWorld,Well done combination of stories.,7,13 December 2013,"The Graduate's brilliance lies in the fact that it is a combination of stories.In the beginning,we have a tale of the crossroads between youth and manhood and the confusion that usually goes with it.In the second half,we have a simple tale of romance that gets complicated by the events in the first half.Dustin Hoffman was brilliant in his profession even then.He displays the awkwardness of youth's comical,clumsy ascension into manhood with flying colors.Anne Bancroft was there to nudge him along,manipulating his inexperience for selfish reasons,thereby adding complication when Hoffman's character finds the love of his life,which happens to be Bancroft's daughter.It is a well blended mix of comedy and drama.",The Graduate
104,jem132,Coming-of-age,9,26 May 2006,"A film for the jaded, indecisive, angered youth in all of us, 'The Graduate' is as much as a coming-of-age of saga as it is a tale about a young guy's dalliance with an older, married woman.Dustin Hoffman stars as Ben Braddock, a rather awkward young man who is a little confused about his future after graduating from college with flying colours. Life seems so strange and fruitless to him, so he embarks on an affair with Mrs Robinson (Anne Bancroft, who wasn't much older than Dustin at the time!) out of desire for experimentation and his need to fulfill his boredom. But he ends up falling for Mrs Robinson's understanding, pretty daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross), who is much close to his age, and the older woman will stop at nothing to ensure the two can't be together.Ben is the hero of the tale, although he clearly doesn't want to be. When he replies 'You Got Me' to his father's questioning over whether the years of college were really worth it, I feel like standing up and cheering him on.Hoffman is excellent in the role; his short, gawky yet cute appearance making him a very endearing Ben. His type of actor would never have got a second look in Old Hollywood, so it is a testament to the changing times that such a film as this with such a leading man was made. Bancroft is great too as the seductive, hardened yet fragile Mrs Robinson. She is a very ambiguous character; touching in her loneliness at one minute, exasperating with her cruelty the next. One gets the sense her affair with Ben is an attempt to recapture lost youth as much as it is an avenue for sexual fulfillment. Does she try to keep Elaine away from Ben out of her own selfish motives or is she trying to protect the girl from falling into the same circumstances (marrying young, with a child, to a man she didn't love) as she did? 'The Graduate' provides an interesting character study, indeed.It also provides an interesting study of the social period that was the 60's, where long-held conventions were broken down and youth found avenues to voice their discontent after many years of confusion and anguish. Also interesting to note that the Plastics industry went through the roof after that little comment to Braddock: 'I've got one word for you, Ben: Plastics'.This is a very humorous satire, with Hoffman getting many chances for deadpan comedy. You've got to love his reactions to Bancroft in the classic seduction scene- it's very entertaining.Ross is rather weak in support, I feel a lot more could have been done with her character. This also has some acute problems with pacing throughout, that aren't really rectified in the end. However, many amazing scenes are on show throughout, and the Simon and Garfunkel (a symbol of youth) music is brilliantly used and is justifiably well-remembered. It has that stream-of-consciousness, Salinger feel to it, with Braddock probably being a variation on Holden Caulfield.9/10.",The Graduate
105,Atreyu_II,Seriously overrated,5,6 November 2011,"As much as this film is famous, it promises more than it delivers. While it may have been indeed «culturally, historically or aesthetically significant», it is far from being good. There are some elements of comedy, such as the lead character's embarrassment whenever Mrs. Robinson is seducing him and his famous line «Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me». Other than light comedy, this movie is worth for Dustin Hoffman's talent and charisma, Simon & Garfunkel's brilliant music and for the 1966 Alfa Romeo Spider 'Duetto' (a car with character, a great engine sound and lines to die for).But a good movie? Definitely not! And just because it is old that doesn't make it a classic. Here we see a young Dustin Hoffman in the role of Benjamin Braddock, a recently university graduate worried about his future. Even then he already had the same face and big nose. It's a surprise to see Dustin portraying such a shy and nervous character, that really made the actor seem extremely tense.Another surprise is to see Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robinson. I will always remember him as the mayor Larry Vaughn from 'Jaws'.I didn't even like much 'The Graduate' for a start and that ending was clearly over the top.",The Graduate
106,johnstonjames,Brilliant. Certainly Lives Up To It's Reputation As A Classic.,10,31 May 2011,"this really is a remarkable film. i always remembered it had a good screenplay and acting, but i never really was all that aware of it's contributions to cinema technique and how it really did shape film physically and intellectually. i always thought of it as being a intellectually sound film but somewhat flat as cinematic cinema. nothing could be further from the truth.'The Graduate' isn't just intellectually sound, it's pure brilliance. it's observations on people and American, suburban life are nothing short of scathing. as has been said about the film, ""it's a brilliant satire of a society littered with cars, cocktails and swimming pools"". it's a society where people are disconnected and desperate to find a escape from their own mindless conformity, only to find themselves trapped by their limitations and inability to reject the very society and lifestyle that imprisons them emotionally and spiritually. it's almost chilling. even the young lovers at the end find that they have escaped with no real plan except to rejoin the kind of world that has objectified and oppressed them.profound. brilliant.people had very few films like this back then in the 1960's. young people had really no films like this at all. most films that were aimed at youth audiences were an illusion. youth films back then were either corny and unrealistic like the Frankie and Annette beach party movies, or they were contrived and manipulative films that attempted to warn youths on the hazards of being young and lawless. Disney baby movies don't count here because their target audience was primarily children and families. 'The Graduate' changed the look and approach to youth films forever. even though a lot of youth oriented films can capture the cinematic look of 'Graduate' these days, they can hardly match it's intellectual wit and it's integrity and sense of moral outrage. and the 'Graduate' is the true spirit of youth and being young, not some manufactured, manipulative illusion of what youth is. no matter what your age, 'The Graduate' will make you feel young just watching it.it's a little depressing to watch this film nowadays and realize how little we've learned since then and how far backward we've gone as a society. youth films today seem contrived and stupid again without the freeing qualities or sense of true morality this film has.what can ya say? everything is perfection here. the music, the direction and photography, the brilliant and insightful screenplay, and of course the outstanding performances by Hoffman and Bancroft. especially Bancroft.wow. kudos to this one. it's waaaay better than i remembered or ever realized it was. it's a little ironic that a film with such ""youthful spirit"", might just take some maturity to fully appreciate it's brilliance.to all the people out that that keep allowing themselves to be objectified and brain washed and conditioned like clones, male and female, and woman DO objectify men in our society like men do to women as this film eerily points out.to all the people like benjamin and mrs. robinson. hold tight. have faith.

107,Pedro_H,Lightweight comedy-drama with end-of-the-sixties values and music,7,24 April 2003,"A middle class college leaver returns home to start his new life, which involves having an affair with a much older married women.Too many landmarks and notables to pretend this isn't an important film, but new viewers may find that the hype more interesting than what appears on the screen. Like Woodstock, you didn't have to be there, but you needed to have been around at the time to fully understand.As is much noted elsewhere, the film plays out its best  tricks very early and we have a long yawn before we get to the memorable climax. The Paul Simon music helps us through the more draggy parts though and started a trend of using pop music to illustrate pregnant pauses.While Hoffman plays out many a youngman's fantasy, the whole thing comes off as limited and boring (sex yes - but not sexy!) Bancroft - as the seducing Mrs Robinson - is a lesson in non acting and is basically charmless. While a very good actress (especially on the stage), she seems to have a natural cold streak which comes through in all her films. Even for a women over thirty (Hoffman and Bancroft's real ages are closer than you think!) casual sex would be easy to come by. Why would a woman need to be involved with someone for sex that they otherwise had no interest in? Bancroft won an Oscar nomination for basically doing nothing but being enigmatic. And that is not to say unbelievable.While well remember and regarded, this film is more about Dustin Hoffman not having to do any more dish-washing and script writers not having to worry about including casual sex than making any breakthroughs.

108,rebeljenn,Taboo themes contribute to its popularity,4,1 December 2005,"'The Graduate' owes some of the popularity down to its portrayal of taboo events surrounding an older, married woman and a young graduate. In summary, the movie is about their relationship and about the young graduate uncertain of his future. The ending scene is classic and memorable, and it's one of those scenes that has probably achieved high, unforgettable status in the film world.The music by Simon and Garfunkel is probably one of the best elements of the film.

109,RonellSowes,A Humorous And Iconic Film,9,3 October 2020,"Coming off his success of Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf, Michael Nichols continued his streak with a critical and commercial hit,The Graduate.An aimless college graduate starts an affair with an older married woman but his escapades take a turn when his interests shift to her daughter.The film was a box office hit grossing over 100 million(equivalent to 770) and was nominated for 7 Academy Awards,Mike Nichols deservedly took home the Best Director.The opening moments of this film alone are proof of Nichols' skill.
Notice how with just the camera and a terrific actor he is able to convey so much about the character. As the credits flash, we watch Benjamin steadily rolling by staring blankly into space. Cut to his house where he his sitting on a couch with an impassive look on his face. He goes down stairs where he is plagued by 'friends' and their congratulations. The entire sequence is shot up close in his face giving you the same apathetic and then claustrophobic,tense emotions he is feeling.I've seen many speculations on why Mrs Robinson is so adamant about Ben not dating her daughter. I believe her motive is very clear. She is afraid Elaine will fall for Ben and repeat her mother's mistakes. And find herself an uncontent forty year something old satisfying herself on young college graduates.
I suppose people only speculate like this, because the characters feel real-due to the superb performances of Bancroft, Hoffman, and Ross.
While on the subject of actors I would also like to mention a 'blink and you'll miss it' role from a very young Richard Dreyfuss.The movie is a true work of professionals it is very funny as well as artistic,entertaining, and a must watch for any film buff. In one word you could describe it as...plastics !",The Graduate

Two other quibbles are that Elaine, though very pulchritudinous, doesn't have very deep dialogue and that the movie will seem very dated because there is no longer quite so deep a divide between generations. I should also mention that the soundtrack is one of the best ever for a motion picture. Strongly recommended, 9/10.",The Graduate
111,elvircorhodzic,"""...well...hello Mrs. Robinson...""",9,28 November 2017,"THE GRADUATE is a romantic comedy drama that, through a generation gap, examines a youthful rebellion, confusion and their strange views on life. This is sort of a collision between a sort of counterculture and a worn idealism. The satire gets a tragic epilogues in this film because, youthful turmoils usually blend from one to the other extreme. It is based on the 1963 novel of the same name by Charles Webb.Benjamin Braddock, aged twenty-one, has earned his bachelor's degree from Williams College and has returned home to a party celebrating his graduation at his parents' house in Pasadena, California. He is a confused young man, who avoids crowds and questions, which are related to his plans for the future. In fact, Benjamin does not have any concrete plans. Mrs. Robinson, the neglected wife of his father's law partner, insists that he drive her home. Benjamin is coerced inside to have a drink and Mrs. Robinson attempts to seduce him. Benjamin has rejected her proposal, but frustrated by the behavior of his parents, he clumsily organized a meeting with Mrs. Robinson in a hotel. The two start a discrete sexual relationship. However, problems arise when Benjamin's parents encourage him to call Elaine, Mrs. Robinson daughter, on a date...An intellectual disruption is evident through a vulgar and harsh behavior of older protagonists and a vivid playfulness of young protagonists. This is probably a result of a traditional view of life and a radical view of social development. Logically, this is the way to an uncertain future in which, perhaps, a youthful zeal, perseverance, and love will not be enough. The plots rely on small incidents. The dialogues are somewhat raw, but rather intriguing. Some scenes have become, rightly, a part of the culture of the 1960s. Almost authentic environments, a very good characterization and excellent music make a tense atmosphere in this movie.Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin Braddock is a young man who is dovetailed between his own confusion and youthful enthusiasm. His ironically-pathetic character is an unsafe step out of an unhealthy society. Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson is simply an unhappy woman, which finds moments of her own pleasure in bed with a confused young man. Her rough expression is probably a reflection of life frustration, though I think it is about escaping from the truth. Mrs. Bancroft has offered an excellent performance. Katharine Ross as Elaine Robinson is a helpless and sensitive character trapped between two generations. Elaine is a beautiful young girl who does not care about the truth, she relies on a youthful enthusiasm where every decision represents a fundamental change in her life.Other actors have responded to the task.This is a great cynical comedy in which you need to understand an emotional and social whirlwind, from which the protagonists pull the worst and the best traits.",The Graduate

115,Bogmeister,Want to Know About Uncertainty? Ask Benjamin,8,22 December 2005,"Who is the Graduate? He's every person on that narrow thread of time after school is over and adult work has yet to begin. I could really identify with Ben (Hoffman) when I was on the verge of graduating from college: I was staring into an abyss, an uncertain path which might go anywhere or nowhere; it was a scary prospect. This doesn't apply to those who have mapped out their next 10 years after college with icy precision. No, this is about indecision, lack of confidence, uncertainty - all applicable to Ben's character. It was why this picture was such a huge success, with young people, with older viewers curious to see their past or their kids' perspectives; Hoffman, though quite a bit older than a college joe when he played this role, easily captured the sense of uncertain youth, of a kid still a kid though suddenly expected to behave like a man. He gets a crash course on methods of being a man courtesy of Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft). It's too much too soon, but it sure unstuck him from a slog through extended childhood, and the other reason for the huge success. Back then, an older woman getting it on with such a young punk was unheard of - scandalous, really.The movie isn't perfect, nowhere near it: there are too many languid portions with that Simon-Garfunkel song piping in yet again. Unless you're a fanatic for their stuff, it wears thin by the 2nd half of the film. But it's this particular picture which made me realize how truly artistic a film can be, by comparison to most of the drivel released in the eighties, nineties and so on. I think this was only Nichol's 2nd film, but he laced it with suggestion and framing unheard of in later decades. There's the jungles just outside the nice housing in the background, the animal stripes on the woman in foreground; there she is, she's the predator and Hoffman is her unwary prey. The water motif, of being stuck, surrounded, suffocating - Hoffman at the bottom of the pool, his one brief escape from reality. Bancroft, tending to appear in frame as a reflection - is she a dream or a nightmare; both, of course. All the actors are close to perfect, including character actor Hamilton as the wronged but slimy Mr. Robinson; my favorite scene is when he confronts Ben in Ben's apartment near the end and calls him all those names, and Norman Fell appears looking befuddled as usual. And in the very end, Ben and his girl (Ross, her best role) are still on a road to nowhere, on a bus, of all things, a future very, very uncertain. The theme of the film holds true to the end. None of those pat Hollywood endings of the eighties and nineties. And so on.",The Graduate
116,movieguy1021,The Graduate: 9/10,9,1 December 2002,"In Dustin Hoffman's first starring role, as Ben Braddock, he's just out of college and 21. He has no idea what to do with his life. So he decides to go with his parents' friend's idea to have an affair with her. She's Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft). That's fine, it brings some excitement to his life. But Ben had no idea that he'd also be involved with her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross).The Graduate has great acting, great and original plot, and great music. The music, by Simon and Garfunkle, is classic (who can't sing along to Mrs. Robinson whenever it's played?). It really brings out the somber mood of the piece which is portrayed so well.The script, though taken from a novel, seems so original and striking that it seems to be thought up at the moment. It actually didn't seem to have a script. It seemed like real life and that Hoffman was actually Ben. A script that could have deftly placed humor along with touching and powerful moments with moments that we can classify with is a force to be reckoned with. We really feel for all of the characters; so well written.Hoffman was completely perfect. His naivetivity and contentness with the world around him made Hoffman seem like he wasn't acting. Wow. Anne Bancroft is also very good, and so is Katharine Ross. All of the supporting characters were very well played, also.With The Graduate's 35th birthday here, it's fitting that I say that it seems to not be ""old"". It could have been released today and I would not have been able to tell the difference.

118,LoneWolfAndCub,"Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson",10,23 December 2008,"Mike Nichol's The Graduate is still as captivating and entrancing as I'm sure it was when it was released 31 years ago. Nichol's smooth direction (which he won an Oscar for) and the all round perfect performances by an excellent cast (including Dustin Hoffman in his first big role, Anne Bancroft and Katharine Ross) make The Graduate an unforgettable and emotional experience.The film follows Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), who we first see returning home from college to a party(celebrating his scholarship) held by his upper-class parents. There he meets Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) and they spark up an affair which lasts all summer long, that is, until Elaine Robinson (Katharine Ross) returns from college. Mr and Mrs. Braddock, and Mr. Robinson (Murray Hamilton) are both pushing Ben to ask her out on a date, much to Mrs. Robinson's annoyance. Of course, what follows is tragedy and heartbreak.Not only is this film a gripping romantic drama, but a look at the 60's, materialism and love. Ben wants to be ""different,"" as it is obvious he feels smothered by everyone around him, congratulating him and buying his presents. Mrs. Robinson is afraid of aging, and prays on young Benjamin to feel alive again, and is afraid of her daughter, who she sees as a threat to her appearance. The characters in this film are all somewhat lost and looking for direction, and when they think they have found it they are actually far from it. Ben is lost in a world full of people worried about money, and Mrs. Robinson is afraid of aging. By the film's end, not a lot is solved and it somewhat comes full circle.Deep and meaningful story aside, the film boasts an outstanding soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel, with the songs suiting the movie's theme, especially ""The Sound of Silence."" Nichol's direction is simply stunning, one scene in particular, which cuts between Ben swimming and sleeping with Mrs. Robinson is masterfully done and creates the perfect mood. I am not going to ramble on any longer, all I have said is not enough to convey how good The Graduate actually is! So I will say this: if you have yet to see it, see it now!!! 5/5",The Graduate

121,oOoBarracuda,The pursuit towards fulfillment never really ends,9,8 January 2018,"I rarely rewatch films I don't care for, largely because I rarely rewatch films in general. A movie has to be special or captivating to reel me in for multiple viewings. I usually have the mindset that there are so many films I want to see, I have to constantly tread new ground in order to hopefully see them all. On occasion, however, especially if a film is well-loved, I'll give it another try and attempt to see anything I may have missed. Seldom have I been as rewarded by such a rewatch as I was with Mike Nichols 1967 film, The Graduate. Following the point in time in a young man's life that if often aimless, that time immediately following college graduation, Nichols does an exceptional job at conveying the listlessness of spirit once ones expected education level is completed. Caught between deciding between marriage and graduate school while his parent's expectations pressure him, Benjamin finds avoiding the decision as long as possible to be the option he is most content with. Starring Dustin Hoffman, in a breakout role, and the incomparable Anne Bancroft, The Graduate is a thoughtful look at the expectations of others and the soul-searching one has to contend with throughout their lives. Just home from college after his recent graduation, Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) is ready to relax after finishing his studies and fill his days by his parent's pool. With no romantic interests or jobs waiting for him, his father pushes him to go to graduate school, and his mother encourages him to go on more dates. Benjamin comes from an upscale neighborhood, and the parents of his friends, all of whom expect him to further his education, wait to hear of a graduate school announcement, all of them except Mrs. Robinson. A friend of his parents, Mrs. Robinson is a beautiful and lonely woman who has a daughter near Benjamin's age. That doesn't stop her from propositioning him and prompting him to ""sow one's wild oats"" while he still has the chance. Surprised and startled by her suggestion, the inexperienced Benjamin attempts to avoid the Robinson's all together before eventually giving in to carrying on a tryst with the family's matriarch. Despite the situation remaining strenuous for Benjamin, as he feels bad for keeping something of this magnitude from his parents, the two carry on both seeming to be fulfilled in some way by the other. As time wears on, and Benjamin seems to be no closer to starting graduate school or getting married, his parents set him up with none other than the Robinson's daughter. This clearly throws a wrench into the lives of both Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson, leaving the former no other choice but to begin making some decisions about his life. Perhaps, part of the reason that I didn't initially like The Graduate when I first watched it, is because I don't care for Dustin Hoffman. I can almost never get beyond him to enjoy the characters he creates. Interestingly, Hoffman was initially going to pass on an audition for the film because he was already committed to playing Leo Bloom in the Mel Brooks production, The Producers. So certain that he wouldn't be selected in the role as the suitor of his wife, Anne Bancroft, Mel Brooks released Dustin Hoffman to audition for The Graduate. As much as I may have enjoyed this more the first time with someone besides Hoffman in the lead role, I'm of course thrilled that this paved the way for Gene Wilder's first strong screen role in THe Producers. I appreciated Hoffman's performance much more this time around, as he seemed to embody the character of someone uncomfortably trying to make their way through life, seemingly unsure of anything. The Graduate begins where Say Anything...ends. Cameron Crowe's excellent directorial debut features a high school senior unsure of what direction to take his life after graduation. The Graduate begins with a long take on a young man with no direction who has just finished college, as he took the route that was expected of him. In my mind, a cinematic universe exists where Lloyd Dobler and Benjamin Braddock are the same person, endlessly wandering through life aimlessly. I anxiously anticipate a post-marriage sequel, perhaps dealing with the pitfalls of a dead-end job or unfulfilling career, I'm flexible. The soundtrack of Graduate is sensational, made up of Simon & Garfunkel songs, perfectly accompanying the mood of Benjamin Braddock. The film was also shot in a powerful way, with Benjamin's face, and the faces of those he communicates with, often obstructed excellently symbolizing the many things that hinder his life and complicate his decision-making. The character introduction of Mrs. Robinson is beautifully communicated thanks to Anne Bancroft. Embodying the perfect balance of unattainable eminence and fragile regret, Bancroft perfectly exposes both aspects of her character. Making herself at home in Benjamin's room where he retreated to for a moment of quiet introspection, Mrs. Robinson shows her strength and control over the situation. It is instantly clear to see that she knows exactly how her relationship with Benjamin is going to play out. She seems to feed off of his discomfort, never being setback by his initial refusal of her advances. Mrs. Robinson's character is fully fleshed out. She is disappointed in herself for giving up everything she wanted in exchange for the chains of matrimony and motherhood. Benjamin isn't the only one searching for something in life. Mrs. Robinson, who finds her motherly duties nearly complete as her daughter prepares to attend college, and her duties as a wife often ignored by her husband who seems to always be inexplicably absent from their residence. Her character, in conjunction with Benjamin's, goes to show that, as human beings, we are always searching for something just beyond our grasp, and no amount of seeming contentment ever really puts an end to that search.",The Graduate
122,elicopperman,Beloved Classic Aged like Sour Milk,5,28 September 2021,"In regards to what is often considered revolutionary and culturally significant in older romantic dramedies of a then new era of filmmaking, Mike Nichols' adaptation of the Charles Webb novel The Graduate comes to mind indefinitely. In addition to being both a critical darling and a commercial hit on its original release, AFI has even listed it very highly amongst their choices for the greatest American films of all time. Looking back however, it might not have aged all that well today regarding its subject matter. While definitely unique and even somewhat fascinating, it might be one of the more frustrating romantic dramas out there.The film follows young college graduate Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), who has no real purpose in his life. Upon being seduced by the wife of his father's law partner, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), Ben begins to spend a lot of time with her until he suddenly becomes obsessed with her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross). Arguably one of the biggest themes in the whole film is the relatable fear many college grads go through once their course is over, and the film satirizes the rather alienated nature of closeted youth by showing what can happen if one ends up in a different path than they ever thought possible. Ben himself is so emotionally wooden and distraught from the real world that having a family friend spend ""quality time"" is perhaps way more of an adventure than college ever was for him, especially when said woman is a depressed alcoholic who'd rather sleep with a dork than her lawfully married husband. The first half of the movie, while a bit unorthodox in how it portrays the innocence of youth gone haywire, conveys this idea in a very hysterical and even playful manner.However, once Elaine Robinson enters the picture, the film immediately loses itself in a diluted mess of insufferable creepiness. While it is only somewhat communicated why Ben would end up being manipulated by Elaine's miserable mom, there is barely any hint as to what Ben sees in her at all, or even what she would see in someone like him to begin with. Perhaps both characters are meant to be parodies of emotional shut-ins trying to break out of the conformist trap that was common in this era of film history, but at no point does it ever come across that way and the audience is left with two blank slates. Even if one could argue that Ben is trying to redeem himself out of remorse for how awful his affair was, it all comes off as selfish and frankly irritating just from how sudden his interest in Elaine becomes. If they have known each other their whole lives, maybe some more scenes with how Elaine feels about Ben would have sufficed. In the end, it just makes everyone in the real world out to stop Ben from achieving any form of happiness, and honestly, rightfully so.If there's anything else at least worth praising about the film, some of the cinematography and camera work of Robert Surtees is quite effective. Depending on a certain dramatic moment between characters, or even just one, a simple yet dynamic usage of unsettling lighting and zoomed framing will be used to heighten the tensity, almost as if we're watching a thriller. Since the film has almost no score of its own, it makes these occasional cinematic layouts rather frightening for what is supposed to be part comedy part drama. However, the songs from Simon & Garfunkel are probably the most timeless aspects of the whole movie. Not only are classics like The Sound of Silence & Scarborough Fair still worthwhile emotional roller coasters on their own, but they are also useful transitions for the more slow and often smoothly edited moments of inner character thought. Considering that this film was where the charming Mrs. Robinson number came from, it has arguably marked its status as a remarkable achievement in both film and music simultaneously, a feat not often met even today.So even if it was unique and distinctive for its time, The Graduate doesn't quite hold up as particularly pleasant and more disturbing than anything. Perhaps if this was written the exact same way but was instead a psychological thriller, it might have been even more unique, but alas, it feels more sad than charming at the end of the day. Then again, perhaps that is what Charles Webb, Mick Nichols and co-writer Buck Henry were going for, as this film does at least get across its message of non conformity fairly well, if not tastefully. It might not be for everyone, but maybe it's not meant to be after all.",The Graduate
123,braddugg,A good movie but very overrated I think,6,27 May 2012,"""Mrs. Robinson, you are trying to seduce me aren't you?"" Isn't this a clichéd dialog. Yes it is very clichéd but not in the context of movie, where it seems apt and fluid. It's a great example how simple things can be made interesting. It's the way we narrate a story makes it interesting and that's what directors or few audience call it as TREATMENT. So watch this out for treatment more than anything else. In times such as 1967, where world was grooving in Hippies and Rock music began with Beatles and few other bands, comes this satirical movie that questions the society. This movie has no dope, no rock music and no hippie stuff. It's about a mundane boy and his teenage thoughts. He is apprehensive about sleeping with a woman much elder to his age and yet falls into the temptation of her. Now, the point is he has to marry her daughter and make her fall in love for him. So that's where the movie is going to go.Is it right to fall into temptations and also fall into love with a daughter of the temptation? Ah, unacceptable still for those tradition lovers but again the context has been put so finely well that rather than questioning more, it's better to give in to the character's state of thinking at that time. Yet, this is not a perennially contemporary that will be embraced at any time you watch it. In 1967 people would have loved it as they are watching such a taboo issue being dealt for first time. In 2012 that is 45 years later, many would have seen such movies or such issues being held in a much more interesting way. At least no this this clichéd. There is a subtext to the character and a relevance of simplicity and that's why I liked it. The costumes just complement the vision and so is an emphatic sound design and oh, did I miss the music by Simon and Garfunkel that is apt and perfect and has a character to it, when the song Mrs. Robinson comes up. The performances are fine and Dustin Hoffman as Graduate plays it supremely well. All said and above is the writing that makes it a story worth watching and being compelled to. I liked it for most part except a silly ending of running away, yet there is an inherent meaning to it conveyed only in expressions. I would with 3/5 that is so very important and is yet a taboo is our society. Not sure, how may may like it as it is, yet I liked it.",The Graduate

But what I never have understood is its label as a generation defining movie. Maybe it's because that is not my generation, but it does seem to me that each generation is apprhensive and unsure about what their future holds even after they graduate from college. Well, it doesn't matter this movie can easily be appreciated by any generation. Its pluses include well paced humor, a good soundtrack, and the classic chase to the church scene that was spoofed at the end of Wayne's World 2. Anne Bancroft does a fine acting job as the legendarily seductive Mrs Robinson. I give it three out of four stars.",The Graduate
125,christophe92300,Generational movie,3,18 January 2014,"The first part of the movie isn't necessarily uninteresting but too heterogeneous, some scenes being very catchy and others a lot more flat, even long. But it's nothing compared to the second part where the script takes a turn for the worse, you end up enduring this romanceless, emotionless, unbelievable love story. Nichols piles up almost ridiculous scenes and you just don't give a rat's ass about the fate of the characters, who by the way are completely unlovable, especially Ben whose amazing corniness annoys more than it amuses.In the end, it's obvious that The Graduate relied on an anti-conformist aspect that probably worked well at the time in the 70's, in a context of evolving mores, but it doesn't have the same impact nowadays, therefore there is not much left from this generational movie except an undeniable aesthetic and artistic research from the director.",The Graduate

He is a slightly autistic person that seems completely empty and has no motivation to do anything. He doesn't even enjoy his love affair. Moreover, his character is inconsistent, and this is in part due to the fact that the writers wanted to make him so awkward that they could put him in endless funny situations. But the problem arises: at times he is very perceptive and shows good intuition and social skills, yet at times he acts like he is not merely autistic, but outright dumb. I never bought or liked his character, and since the whole film is told from that character's perspective, it spoils all the fun. Now, the film has interesting moments, but on the whole it comes across as a failure. I just couldn't bring myself to care about characters that don't seem to care about anything.",The Graduate

And if that wasn't enough to make the film so watchable and so funny and rife with pathos, Mike Nichols is the kind of Director from a school and a time when the work could be analysed completely; every frame and every move and every decision means something so simple and so powerful that it's a joy to watch all the way to the iconic and painful and sympathetic ending.",The Graduate
129,edgeofreality,Going the distance,10,22 December 2018,"A great film of its time, and I think, still great. The music and photography seem better each time, and I think this film influenced future music videos, not to mention other classics of the seventies (Harold and Maude) and later (the films of Wes Anderson). While it is a satire of sixties superficiality and hypocrisies, I see this now as a dissection of how young people are doomed to follow in the older generation's footsteps even as they try to escape this fate. Benjamin determinedly overcomes every obstacle that stands in the way between him and his biggest mistake: getting married to Elaine. Perhaps it is a flaw in the film that in showing him go the distance to the point of stealing Elaine from her arranged wedding, nearly everyone else in the film starts to look like a cartoon character of shallowness and spite. It is a shame that the Anne Bancroft suffers from this in the second half a bit. But I like to think that by this stage we see everything through Benjamin's skewed vision: he is caught up in his own quest for some kind of personal salvation and self-justification through marriage, and will end up, probably, just as lost as Mr. Robinson, Elaine just as frustrated and lonely as her mother. The strange, strained silence after the laughter at the end, shows that he and Elaine will rue this day. This irony at the center of the 'happy' end, makes this a great film: it shows up the romantic fallacy of so many romantic comedies by going on a few seconds longer.",The Graduate
130,rdoyle29,A beautiful film ... until it stops focusing on Mrs. Robinson,9,27 June 2017,"I think I have underestimated how much I like this film, at least the first hour of it. I have seen it a few times and knew I liked it, but I was pleasantly surprised by how genuinely funny it is. That said, I don't really like the last act, and that's largely due to the fact that Mrs. Robinson feels like the real emotional center of this film, but she's reduced to a one dimensional villain during the final act. While Benjamin comes off as a fool, and Elaine is barely a character, Mrs. Robinson is funny, clever and kind of sad ... a very engaging character. The film doesn't really survive her departure.",The Graduate
131,pfgpowell-1,Rather darker than the comedy/drama/romance billed here - but very much worth the ride,8,30 April 2015,"I was remarking to someone just last night that I'd watched Dennis Hopper's Easy Rider only twice and that I saw a completely different film on both occasions. The first time I saw in the Sixties before that decade revealed itself as silly and nasty, it was a fable of 'them' against 'us' and how an older generation would hold out against a younger, more open, more optimistic, more adventurous younger generation.The second time, at least 30 years on, what struck me was how prescient Dennis Hopper had been about just how superficial and vacuous the so-called 'hippy generation' was for all it's idealism and bravura. In where in that first viewing Peter Fonda was the main character and seemed to be calling the shots, The second time around the main character was definitely they less obviously Dennis Hopper's cynical co-rider.I mention Easy Rider in a review of Mike Nicholls's The Graduate because much the same occurred: I first saw it when it came out and like everyone else thought it a smart, fresh, witty and often very funny take on young love and how young, sincere live will out whatever. Tonight I saw a very different, in some ways far darker film, one about obsession and loneliness, how the cruel innocence of youth can cut to the quick the soul of someone who has lived a little and learned a little more.I decided to watch the film again after hearing a radio play on the film's genesis, how producer Lawrence Turman persuaded Nicholls, a respected Broadway director who until then had never made a film, that the novel The Graduate by Charles Webb would make an excellent film. It didn't seem so to anyone else Turman and Nicholls tried to get interested. And even when respected Hollywood heavyweight Joe Levine added his support and the project slowly took off, there were objections to Nicholls's casting decision, particularly having Dustin Hoffman cast as what until then was accepted to be a blonde WASP Benjamin Braddock. But Nicholls held out, having a particular take on the character as being an outsider, just as he, basically a German Jewish immigrant, and Turman, another Jew, were outsiders in Hollywood.So watch it I did and, as I say, a far darker film revealed itself, one which was not about innocent young love but obsession and loneliness. Take Ben Braddock's behaviour: one can accept his gaucheness in view of his seduction by Mrs Robinson and even his tactlessness to the older woman once the affair is underway can be excused, as indeed Mrs Robinson, a woman of the world, does excuse it. But his subsequent pursuit of Elaine, a girl he barely knows, which could all to easily be mistaken for stalking, is decidedly unhealthy. This is not 'true love' needing to find its way as we once thought, it is the obsession of a young man who knows little about the world, isn't particularly aware and quite probably suffers from a bad case of extreme solipsism.The film's very final shot is telling: once he has grabbed his prize and he and Elaine have escaped the church wedding and are sitting on the bus off to start life together, it seems to dawn on both very quickly - and apparently from the looks on their faces to concern them - that all they were really interested in was striking a blow against their elders. And that once that had been done - well, what next? They both seem not to have a clue. They do not come across as two young people who have found a soulmate, rather as two young people suddenly overwhelmed by the course of events.Then there is Mrs Robinson herself, a middle-aged woman (sexily portrayed by Anne Bancroft) caught in a loveless marriage who merely wants to protect her daughter, possibly the one thing she can still cherish in an otherwise empty life, from making the same mistake as herself - her marriage and thus her wealthy but hollow existence was founded on a quick f*ck in the back of her student boyfriend's Ford. Once pregnant she had to give up the art course she obviously enjoyed and it will seem little wonder that she eventually turned to the bottle.Ben Braddock, of course, the solipsistic young graduate she begins an affair with his wholly oblivious to life outside his own being and doesn't even begin to suspect that his middle- aged lover might be very unhappy and that her pursuit of him has less to do with sex and more to do with a far more personal need.My take on how much darker the film is than at first we thought, might make it sound rather heavy going, but actually the film is nothing of the kind and to many will seem to be the romantic comedy it was first billed to be. Nicholls has such a light touch and worked with such a witty script that what I seem to discern is merely what might - or might not - be discovered in its depths. Yet I don't think I am being fanciful. Mrs Robinson, possibly a figure of fun to some, is undoubtedly a very unhappy woman, and I for one am uncomfortable with laughing at someone else's unhappiness.Nicholls theatre background is evident from the film's staging, but is none the worse for that. The film does little but mover from scene to scene, but is saved from any static staginess by some very imaginative camera angles and shots and Nicholls proved himself to have an interesting cinematic eye. If you are young and have never before seen The Graduate, I urge you to see it. If you have seen it before and are considering doing so again after many years, do so: it is a great film which well stands the test of time.",The Graduate
132,SumanShakya,The Graduate (1967).....wonderful 60s,8,14 November 2013,"""The Graduate"" starts as a sex comedy with a recently graduated college student having an affair with one of his parent's friend and later falling in love with her daughter. The rest of the film is a light romantic comedy on how he actually gets her. This sweet 60s classic has all that makes it a classic: no overdose of drama or stunts. Just naturally the story builds with fabulous songs and a light dose of comedy which nowhere becomes crude. Though feels a bit slow in the beginning, there is much of wittiness and charm in each of the situations created in the story. It was one of Dustin Hoffman's earlier movies. Looking a bit expressionless, he carries the film. Perhaps one of the biggest actors of all time, I had myself been a big admirer of his acting in Oscar winning performances of Kramer Vs Kramer and Rain Man. Just a small agony that such wonderful days of 60s movies won't come again.Rating: 3 stars out of 4",The Graduate
133,theshadow908,Strange dark comedy.,7,3 June 2006,"The Graduate tells the story of a young man just out of college and unsure of what to do with his life. His family annoys him, and life is confusing. He ends up starting a love affair with the much older Mrs. Robinson for reasons he can't even explain, but things get complicated when he falls for her daughter. The Graduate is a strange little film that you might have high expectations about due to it's status in cinema history.The Graduate is a very well made film that has many messages about real life, and that may be what draws a lot of people to it. People who describe this as a comedy are a bit mistaken. It's a black comedy. There are funny scenes, but not that are really laugh out loud funny. The drama in the movie is actually more involving. The plot starts out kind of strange, but it gets stranger as the movie moves on. It actually gets more and more unrealistic as the movie moves on, which is kind of annoying. One problem is that Simon and Garfunkel made up the soundtrack for this film, and people who don't like their mellow form of music might start to get really annoyed. In one sequence of the film, they play the song Scarbourough Fair way too much, and it starts to get annoying.If you want to talk acting, it's no wonder Dustin Hoffman made his career off this film. He does a great job playing Ben Braddock, and he is able to convey stress, fear, and funniness all at the same time. The other fine actors surrounding him in this film only help to amplify his talent.Overall, The Graduate is a good movie, but it's not for everybody. Not everybody will be able to understand its meaning, and not everybody will be able to even sit through it. It's a strange little film.7.5/10",The Graduate

Mrs Robinson is an awful character who isn't likable at any point in the film. She should be a seductive, romantic, cougar-MILF. Instead, she's not particularly attractive and her personality is repugnant. She's arrogant, bossy, cold and aloof. She later turns manipulative, angry, dishonest and demanding. It's difficult to believe that Benjamin would be attracted to her in the first place. Before I watched it, I'd been told that it has a happy ending - but that's not the case. The situation that they'd be in after the film ends would be awful.

135,eagandersongil,The exploration of loneliness,9,8 January 2018,"A film that is a must for every movie lover, a film that promotes a story in the best romantic comedy style and yet is surprising, with absolute mastery of technique, script and performances, the American director Mike Nichols knew how to conduct his work with almost complete perfection in what it provides to do. Take a look at the story of Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), a 21-year-old who gets caught up in a sexual journey with the mother of the girl he loves, the movie script is perfectly told, always exploring all sides of the story, the pains, anxieties and fears of all the characters, and we are glazed and stuck to its narrative, even being a romantic comedy, a genre that massively searches for cliche. Benjamin is a character who is embraced by loneliness, he is completely desperate to quench his emptiness, even though he may not know it, when Ben is invited to participate in a sexual adventure, this temporarily fills his void, but after a while he realizes that it only leaves him empty, and when falling in love with Elaine, he sees a desperate attempt to get rid of this ""darkness"", Ben is a completely broken character, that even in love, he has no idea what to do, loneliness who pursues Ben is the drama of many, and the way she is explored in the film is spectacular. Not only does the script have its merits, but the direction too, speaking first of the camera angles, aiming always show well in zoom and then rolls a large zoom out, always showing how small the character is in the scenario, in addition to always using outlets and not to abuse in the cuts, even being a 1966 movie, besides, we have great songs on the soundtrack, sometimes it may seem little distoante or repetitive, but the track talks with the drama of Ben, besides, we have a great editing and sound editing, as well as beautiful photography. Dustin Hoffman is a great performer, and he is one of the pillars that makes the script get to explore so many themes without the actor, the movie would perhaps be a dramatic romantic comedy, we also have the magnificent Anne Bancroft. The use of the spectacular song ""hello darkness my old friend"" in the end contrasts somewhat the idea of ??what the film is going through - unless it is interpreted that the character still feels empty - in the end, it is not a perfect movie, but it accomplishes everything that promises and a little more, a lot more.",The Graduate

137,jayjaycee,The lives of the beautiful people,9,4 January 2020,"""The Graduate"" is 1967 drama directed by Mike Nichols starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. Back in the day, this film sparked a controversy, because it has been the first film to depict the forbidden relationship between a young man and an older woman. What now has become normalcy in our society made the people feel uncomfortable in the sixties and that's one of the few reasons this film became a classic. In his feature film debut and his first leading role Dustin Hoffman plays his character Benjamin Braddock with such a genuine naiveté and awkwardness that the viewer immediately can sympathize with him a lot. To be honest, although he was already thirty years old at the time of filming he played the part of a twenty-one boy convincingly. From the first shot the film builds up a packing atmosphere. Everything seems to be perfect around Benjamin who visibly struggles with his own anxiety about the future and the expectations of his parents. I personally liked this hypocritical tone and how it subliminally critises the situation without condemning it. But the best part of the films starts when Mrs. Robinson, magnificently portrayed by Anne Bancroft, enters the scene. After this there's an extremely uncomfortable tension that honestly took my breath several time. It's scandalously revealing and thanks to superb character play, extremely compelling and entertaining. It's not only this. The analyst in me was also appeased, because there's a prominent metaphor in it that gave the whole film an all new second meaning: What is even the reason behind Ben's decision to fall for his seductress? It's ingenious how the screenplay shows that he is depressed and doesn't know how to deal with his future and with his life in general, although it's supposed to be perfect. This is feeling, this frustration is what made him fall for his temptations. Said metaphor is the pool that occurs multiple time. When his parents force him to dive he's unhappy but it's what his parents wanted, but after the first experience with his affair he floats on it and doesn't care about his parents who want him to care about his career. It's social satire at it's best and I love that. As the film goes on, the conflict begins to become increasingly subliminal and what I can only imagine, extremely hard to watch for the people back then. At times it even offers some funny, even macabre undertone without losing its seriousness. If there's anything to criticize here it's the second half, because the said conflict shifts to a less packing scenario and although it's still great, makes the tension recede a little. But it's still packing and fits with the overall tone of the film, mostly due to the ingeniously accentuating soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel and their classic track ""Mrs. Robinson"". All in all, this atmospheric satire hits at the right spots and entertains due to excellent actors in every role and a plot that doesn't hesitate to agitate the important issue that kids and their futures should not be ignored or decided by parents. It's legitimately scandalous, but not only because it's unusually revealing, because it raises an uncomfortable topic. Anyways, it deserves it's cult status and remains an infamously pioneering piece of art.",The Graduate

In saying so, The Graduate isn't your usual cliché fair; in fact it is something special. Apart from launching Dustin Hoffman's career, The Graduate provides a cynical view on love, relationships and life. In doing so, it feels more like a Woody Allen movie and without a doubt for the next 40-50 years it has inspired, referred or referenced by many other films. I remember in 500 Days of Summer, there is a quote – ""Tom completely mis-read The Graduate"". Years ago, I will probably have mis-read this film as well, perhaps it is timely I waited till now.

Sweetly funny, the changes in behaviour and circumstance are interesting and engaging, keeping you hooked until the ending without being on the edge of your seat.

Besides that, I can't understand why this is a comedy and it degrades people.  If there was someone that I felt sorry for is Ross and not Hoffman.

144,eshwarmail,Dealing with content that is bold for its time complemented by excellent acting,8,6 January 2017,"Reviewed August 2011A movie so bold taken in the 60s is an achievement on it's own. A right mixture of awkwardness, drama and entertainment value, Simon & Garfunkel, terrific performances including a first major role for Dustin Hoffman makes this movie special. Benjamin (Hoffman) just got graduated and was awarded a scholarship for his future endeavors. His family throws him a party after presenting him an Alpha Romeo. Mrs. Robinson, wife of his father's partner is at the party and requests Benjamin to give her a lift home to which he agrees even after suspecting her intentions resulting in a secret affair that continues after that night. Out of obligation, he had to take Mrs. Robinson's daughter out against Mrs. Robinson's wishes and falls for her. The initial seduction sequences by Mrs. Robinson sometimes felt a little disconnected but very entertaining nevertheless. Anne Bancroft was terrific in her role for most part except for a wafer thin part in the climax. Hoffman looked comfortable in that uncomfortable character. Katharine Ross fits well as the beautiful and shy teenage girl. Music is by Simon & Garfunkel and most of the movie features two of their best hits. The climax which is a bit dragged brought me mixed feelings which was out of tone compared to the rest of the movie. It's entertaining and bold and was a landmark for the 60s.",The Graduate
145,eabakkum,This film is perverse,4,31 August 2010,"This film is perverse and the reasons are not what you think they are. The film was made in 1967 and the belief is widespread, that it portrays the atmosphere of the roaring sixties. I must admit that for some time this has been also my superficial impression. Indeed it can not be denied that the sweet music of Simon and Garfunkel is a hallmark of those days. And yes, the film advocates a liberal sexual behavior and clearing of taboos. Nevertheless, after a closer examination I must strongly disagree. It is true that the main character Ben says: ""I wanted to be different"". And he actually succeeds. But his devotion is definitely not directed towards the realization of civil rights, the abandonment of war, or even moral liberation and the mitigation of authority. In fact he and the other main juvenile character Elaine derail in a way, that makes the dysfunctionalities of their parents look insignificant. They develop morals, that are perverse by every reasonable standard. Although the film tries to trick you into believing in a happy end, as sure as eggs is eggs the social misfits Ben and Elaine will continue to wreak havoc. The elaboration on the character of Elaine can be short: she succeeds in convincing two men at the same time, that she will marry them. She actually marries one (the good Carl Smith), and immediately runs off with the other (Ben)! However, the really villainous character is Ben. Although only twenty-one years of age, he gets involved in sexual affairs with two married women. He has the brutality to say to the first (the illustrious mrs. Robinson): ""I enjoy it. I look forward to it. It's the one thing I look forward to"" and to the second (Elaine): ""You're the first thing for so long that I like"". The unfolding tragedy gets apparent, when the first woman discloses that her marriage is hopeless, and she herself has since long become an alcoholic. Indeed her attitude is unsound, but she remains within conceivable boundaries. Her distress (aptly played by Anne Bancroft, and the best scenes in the film) does not stop Ben from eventually dropping her like a hot potato, without any signs of remorse. A long-lasting affair becomes less than a one-night stand. He even explains to her husband, that the affair was comparable to a handshake. In a fit of brilliance mr. Robinson replies ""You pardon me if I don't shake hands with you"". He makes the only sane remark in the film, when he accuses Ben of having a filthy mind. However the film-makers take sides by presenting mr. Robinson as a stumbling idiot. Ben's apparent childish drivel (played in an outstanding way by Dustin Hoffman) degenerates into a diabolic manipulation. The dialogs are rude, pieces of bad taste, and one might say violent. They make ""Deep throat"" look bleak. For instance, Ben knows that in their youth the parents of Elaine had sexual intercourse in their car (""My God! In a Ford?""). One day Elaine tells him, that Carl Smith has proposed marriage: ""He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team"". Ben replies: ""Where did he do it? It wasn't in his car, was it?"". And I repeat: when he and Elaine elope, their relation is obviously doomed from the start. Still it could have been a quality film, if the makers had contented themselves with a reality approach. Instead they tried to deform the events into the shape of a romantic love affair. If this was an attempt to be cynical, then in my opinion it has failed dramatically, since even cynicism has its limits. In spite of excellent play by the actors, what remains is a perverse message, lacking any reasonable moral. It is an overt plea for impulsive and instrumental relationships, preying upon human weakness. My advice: spare yourself the disgust of this degenerate produce.",The Graduate

147,higherall7,Where does 'The Graduate' go from here?,9,2 May 2012,"I actually saw this movie for the first time in Louisville, Kentucky while competing in the Optimist Oratorical Contest. I must have been sixteen at the time, and what I remember most about the film was how it woke me up. I felt energized and trotted back to our rooms filled with inspiration and pep. What I got out of 'THE GRADUATE' was that you could, in the words of Paul Simon, '-get on the bus, Gus. Make a new plan, Stan-'and somehow even without rhyme or reason rise above the Status Quo.Everything in this film revolves around the title, 'THE GRADUATE', and the irony of this appellation in reference to the title character Benjamin Braddock. He has made his parents happy, met all of society's preliminary requirements with academic and athletic success in sports and games, and yet he basks like a gooey mass in the unawareness of society's expectations of him, or even the people in his immediate surroundings. What exactly is the nature of this 'graduation' he is experiencing at this time, and is it really supposed to feel this way?We were sitting in the lunch room one day when I was substitute teaching and listening to Doctor Peoples Ph.D explain how he got started coming up from down South to Detroit, Michigan. He explained how he initially stayed with friends and relatives and cast about looking for a job. Eventually, he found one at a Gas Station and worked his way up to managing the place because people kept coming up to him asking for information and solutions to their problems with their automobiles. He related an incident where one customer would repeatedly pepper him with requests and inquiries so that at length Doctor Peoples said to him, ""Why are you asking me all this?"" The customer looked at him blankly and uttered, ""You looked like the one in charge-""All of us revered Doctor Peoples as he physically resembled a cross between Coleman Young and Joe Louis, the heavyweight boxing champ, and there was about him this unstated strength that placed him above the need to prove anything to anyone. I'll never forget him relating to us how when he was working steady and had some money in the bank, the folks he was staying with asked him humbly, ""You think you can make it now?"" To which Doctor Peoples replied, just as humbly, ""Yeah,... I think I can make it..""The point of that little story is that I think all young people hope at some point they will 'look like the one in charge' and be able to say, '-I think I can make it now-Let me take it from here-'. The comedy of 'THE GRADUATE' to me was that we have here this product of higher education and yet there's no sense about him being eager to take charge of his life or being able to make it from here. You would think he would have some well defined sense of his own basic purpose by now, and yet it seems totally submerged under the obligation to meet the social proprieties of his times.Being a member of the Sixties generation I remember that one of our defining assertions was that the rewards of the Status Quo were not enough. The angst of Benjamin Braddock is beautifully interpreted by Dustin Hoffman. We have in Braddock a kind of walking zombie, stuffed to gills with information where a moral center should be, and filled with a need to truly care about something deeply enough to fight for it and figure out the problems attendant to getting it.The ending is troublesome and problematic while being exhilarating all at the same time, but I felt viscerally that somehow both Elaine and Benjamin finally graduated in demonstrating a willingness and ability to defy and rise above the Staus Quo.One of the great ironies of 'THE GRADUATE' is that the ending comes across as an 'anti-graduation' and an 'un-marriage', as Elaine and Benjamin have cast themselves away from the safety nets of family, community and even the aegis of the Church, but it is anything but that. It is simply a small step for two people who are experiencing a kind of self creation on uncharted waters where anything is possible. Perhaps even a new sense of Family, a new sense of Community, and a new sense of what it means to experience religion and the Church.That's what it was like to come up in the sixties, folks...",The Graduate

Matter of fact, take away the incredible soundtrack of Simon and Garfunkel and the film gets a lot weaker.No doubt that everyone is decent, especially Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin. But there are various sequences where Simon and Garfunkel come on and you see Ben just looking psycho.And that's the core of the film. OK, Dustin's Benjamin is a loser with the chicks, can't seem to do anything right, but he soon devolves into a psychopath lunatic obsessed with Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine, who he has known forever, but has just shown an interest in now.Talk about a stalker! After one date, Ben decides she's the girl for him, and does everything possible to stalk, hunt down, and get the attention of this girl he's actually only kissed one time. It's downright scary how far he goes, how threatening he becomes, and how crazy he gets. And when he is actually around Elaine, all he does is ask her prying questions, like a pathetic needy little boy. There is nothing appealing about him whatsoever, making ""The Graduate"" not merely a horror film in disguise, but a fantasy, having any girl show any interest at all in someone as sorry and pushy as Benjamin.Still, ""The Graduate"" is a decent film, even though it's quite overrated, and good for one solid viewing.",The Graduate

The soundtrack is also wonderful (impressive S&G) but that is the best things of the movie. The plot, who was controversial for the time, now is quite seen and it is causes not so great scandal. It reflects decently the world of the 60's, where the old teenagers found themselves that they had finished their studies but the don't know what to do with her lives, but the director does not spends long time about it. The beginning of the story, the seduction part are superb, and I realize that is because of this that the movie has so great fame, but while the movie develops, the rest of the story is not so well filmed and that spoils the result, and it makes a movie that could be almost perfect to a movie that is just ""good"", despite its excellent beginning,.",The Graduate
152,brefane,Must see for classic performance,7,24 April 2010,"If you want to see a classic performance, look no further than Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson, whose name became a synonym for a seductive older woman. The film's reputation stems largely from the scenes between Hoffman's Benjamim and Bancroft's older woman. These scenes are classic; pointed, funny and superbly acted, but the rest of the film is diffuse,and proceeds by fits and starts. And ultimately, Hoffman's Benjamin begins to seem more like a stalker with a case of arrested development than a college grad in love. Both Ben and Elaine act like high school kids and are so chaste, pure and mono-dimensional that one sorely misses Mrs. Robinson. Arresting cinematography, clever editing and Mike Nichols' direction help camouflage the sketchiness of the screenplay, though the trite musical soundtrack and the accompanying montages become tedious; the film seems to be marking time. The Graduate may not be the classic it's said to be, though Bancroft's performance is.

I think the 1960s got it right when it came to defining modern sensibilities. This film can be enjoyed on so many levels: for its razor sharp humor, its incisive social commentary, its innovative film techniques, its soundtrack, etc. When I first saw the film in its initial release, I naturally identified with the title character. Now when I watch it, I relate to the parents' generation. I understand how these people got that way. It adds another dimension to the appreciation of this fine film. The cast is perfect, from the unlikely choice of Dustin Hoffman as the protagonist, Anne Bancroft as the unsmiling predator (complete with animal-print wardrobe), Katherine Ross, the most appealing and desirable coed, down through the smallest roles. I like to speculate how the movie would have turned out if the role of Mrs. Robinson had been played by Doris Day (who turned down the part). Doris Day never gave a bad performance, and her sunny disposition masked a darker side. I think she would have been great. As it stands, Anne Bancroft steals the show with her wise and knowing interpretation. I never tire of this intelligent, sophisticated, one-of-a-kind entertainment. As a side note for those who appreciate such minutiae: Eddra Gale, the blond woman seated next to Katherine Ross on the bus in Berkeley, had a small part as a party guest in Katherine Ross' other 1967 film, ""Games.""",The Graduate
154,Jared_Andrews,Hilarious Story about Not Knowing What's Next,9,3 January 2018,"The opening scene sets the stage for the remainder of the movie in a few key ways. First, the Simon and Garfunkel song perfectly suits the scene, which is the case each time one of their songs plays. Second, the main character, Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), is filled with uncertainty and doubt, which is the case throughout the movie. Third, the scene takes place at an airport where people often look full of conviction and purpose but are secretly at least a little confused about where they are supposed to be going and are uneasy about going there, which again is the case for the key characters in most scenes throughout the movie.Ben knows exactly where he is going, but in a metaphorical yet much more real sense he has no idea where he is going. In the airport, he knows where to go. In his life, he does not. Paul Simon wrote ""people talking without speaking; people hearing without listening"" and he could have easily added ""people moving without progressing,"" but progressing isn't a lyrically fluid word, so he left it out. As usual, Paul Simon was right.  Here's the thing about Ben: he's kind of a doofus. A recent graduate (as you may have guessed), he excelled in college, won some prestigious award, everyone is so proud of him, but he doesn't seem to have a firm grasp of what's going on in the world. Ben is almost less a character and more a caricature of a recent college graduate who is not sure what to do next. 
 
Everything Ben does is awkward. He's not a bad guy (though he does some unsavory things); he's just filled with so much uncertainty and self-doubt that he sweats and stumbles his way through any and all things adult. It's an incredible comedic performance by Hoffman. He manages to make the movie hysterically funny despite the dialogue containing virtually zero jokes.  His interactions with the hypnotizing Mrs. Robinson (Ann Bancroft) are comedy gold. She's majestically cool and composed, while Ben barely has the confidence to order himself a drink. Their polar opposite personalities make her seduction of him a beautiful whirlwind of cringey, awkward hilarity that seems to last forever. But in a good way. At least in a good way for us viewers, since we aren't dealing with the awkwardness firsthand.  I cannot stress this enough-Bancroft is magnificent. As one of the first cougars in cinema history, she sets an impossibly high bar. She's sophisticated, beautiful and undoubtedly in charge. She uses Ben as her plaything. Though to be fair to her, he's no victim. He's a willing participant from the beginning.  The first part of the movie parallels Ben's life at the time. It's entertaining as can be but aimless. Then we meet Elaine Robinson (Katharine Ross). She's as beautiful as her mother and as full of uncertainty as Ben. Mrs. Robinson insists that Ben does not take out her daughter on a date. Ben agrees. Then as soon as his parents pressure him to take her out he gives in because he's a pushover doofus.  Here things get interesting as Ben finally talks to someone who understands what he's feeling. He's completely enamored with Elaine. Or at least he thinks he is. He wants to marry her. Or at least he thinks he does. Maybe he's just latching onto these feelings because he finally found some sense of direction for the first time since graduating. He finally knows what to do next.  The ending is perfect. I don't say that lightly. The ending is perfect because it lingers just a little bit longer than most movies normally would. It looks like it's going to be a typical happily ever after fairy tale ending that we have all seen a million times. Then it keeps going. In those final 15 seconds we see the elated smiles fade, reality hitting, and doubt creeping back into the faces of the characters. The movie began with uncertainty, and it ends in uncertainty. Ben faces the same question that has plagued him throughout the story. Now what?",The Graduate

157,mr_popcorn,"Mrs. Robinson you're trying to seduce me, aren't you?",10,12 February 2009,"The Graduate is a true timeless classic that struck all the right chords. Benjamin Braddock is character that I can totally relate to and pretty much all the teens who had the same exact problems after graduating college. Dustin Hoffman's breakout role as Ben is a dead on impression. He gives a wonderfully underplayed performance, he got the awkwardness bit right down to that uneasy smirk and the deep lifeless stare. Anne Bancroft on the other hand, plays the legendary major cougar Mrs. Robinson. I have heard a lot of things about the character and my expectations for the infamous cougar queen were really high and after watching the film, my expectations were more than met. She plays the role like she knows it by heart and steals almost every scene she's in. Screw that TV show, Mrs. Robinson is the real desperate housewife.Another great aspect of the film is the soundtrack. Never have I seen a song used more appropriately in a film and The Graduate's 'A Sound of Silence' represents the problem and turmoils the characters face in the film. This is Mike Nichols' best film and easily one of my favorite movies of all-time. If you still haven't seen this, by all means watch it at any cost. Highly recommended.",The Graduate
158,Gideon24,A smart and sexy classic,9,12 March 2015,"The Graduate was the 1967 instant classic that won Mike Nichols a Best Director Oscar despite In the Heat of the Night winning Best Picture that year, and made an instant movie star out of its virtually unknown star, Dustin Hoffman.Hoffman plays Benjamin Braddock, a recent college graduate who has returned home with no real goals or aspirations and, as it turns out, doesn't have really time to think about such matters as he tentatively begins an affair with the much older wife of one of his parents friends, a Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), who pretty much bulldozes Benjamin into having sex with her and then flips out when Benjamin develops actual feelings for Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine (Katherine Ross).Buck Henry's clever and adult screenplay is deftly mounted by Nichols, whose directorial style is evidenced throughout...that shot of Benjamin telling Mrs. Robinson that she's trying to seduce him, from between Mrs. Robinson's legs, is sheer genius and could have come from no place but the creative mind of Mike Nichols.As most film buffs know, the role of Mrs. Robinson was originally offered to Doris Day, who turned the role down as she felt the screenplay was, in her word, ""vulgar."" The character definitely would have been something different played by Day, but I think Bancroft is perfection in the role and I can't imagine anyone else playing Mrs. Robinson and her on screen chemistry with newcomer Hoffman is surprisingly smooth.Bancroft and Hoffman receive solid support from William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson as Benjamin's parents and Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robinson. There are also brief appearances from Norman Fell, Richard Dreyfuss, Mike Farrell, and the film's writer, Buck Henry. The now iconic song score by Simon and Garfunkle, including ""Mrs. Robinson"" and ""The Sounds of SIlence"" is also a big plus and perfectly compliments the on screen proceedings. A cinema classic that should be experience by all film purists. The film was turned into a stage play decades later with Kathleen Turner playing Mrs. Robinson.",The Graduate

160,Elizabeth-328,Great!!,6,1 January 2000,"I like this movie.  It shows how Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) struggles with his life and what exactly he wants to do with it.  And I don't think the Mrs. Robinson thing helps him any!!  An affair with a woman old enough to be your mother never does help a situation, I gather!  If the story doesn't sound juicy enough for you, at least watch it to see what all the fuss is about, with all the imitations everyone has seen!  =)  It really is an awesome film though.  Definitely see ""The Graduate"" at least once this year. Let it be your New Year's Resolution!",The Graduate
161,mohit_sinsniwal,WOW!,6,1 June 2019,"Many people who saw The Graduate on its original release, including critics like Roger Ebert, have misinterpreted the main point of the film. Ben Braddock is NOT a hero that is supposed to glorify the rebellion of the 60s generation. The viewer is NOT supposed to stand up and cheer after the final scene. Ben is supposed to represent the confused state of a college graduate stuck in between youth and adulthood. As best depicted by the scene where he holds the hotel door open for both the elderly group and the younger group, he feels alienated from both generations. He does not want to hear the loud music of the car next to him at the drive-thru, nor is he interested in 'plastics' or the materialistic pleasures of his parents.He has no idea what he wants out of life, and only thinks that marrying Elaine will be the solution to this problem. As the last shot depicts (which may be the best final shot in film history), Ben only seems to be happy for a few seconds after he and Elaine get onto the bus with no money, no prospects, and no certain future. In fact, Nichols cleverly uses Paul Simon's Sound of Silence, and drowns out much of the background sound to show that Ben's is in the same position at the end of the film as he is at the beginning. He has not found what he really wants to get out of life and is as confused as ever. This scenario is not dated nor is it only appropriate for the 60s, it can apply to anyone who is lost or has no idea what to do with his or her lives.Nichols' brilliant direction reinforces the complex exploration of confusion and uncertainty. The flow of shots after he first sleeps with Mrs. Robinson is incredible, as is his use of the swimming pool to enforce his entrapment. He effortlessly switches in and out of focus at different depths of each shot to emphasize certain characters and dialogue. It goes without saying that the performances by Hoffman and Bancroft are first-rate. Add Paul Simon's haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting. As a recent college graduate who was not even born in the 60s, I can say that this film has not dated, and is deserving of its #7 ranking by the American Film Institute.",The Graduate
162,imbluzclooby,"A Timeless Classic which compels us to ponder ""What Now?""",8,8 September 2019,"The Graduate is one of the few older movies I can watch over and over repeatedly without ennui. It's also one of the few older movies that can endear itself multi-generationally. Even young audiences today can watch this with emotional investment. For those who think they are strictly going to see a comedy, which it was billed as, they will either be disappointed or deeply and sadly surprised. There are some funny parts, but are not always played for laughs. This movie has an undercurrent of sadness which is made all the more effective by the haunting beauty of Simon and Garfunkel's songs and the moody cinematography. These two elements are beautifully combined to create those moods of despair and loneliness.In what is considered Dustin Hoffman's debut role, he (Benjamin Braddock) stands out as the typical awkward wimp, small in stature and afraid of his own shadow. However, we hope and believe he can overcome his shortcomings, prove his manhood and achieve an adequate modicum of self-assure. And he does. That is why Hoffman was so suited for this role.As Ben comes home from college to that empty feeling of despair and that magical feeling of uncertainty it is so evident from the initial scenes. He feels so out of place around all these Middle aged folks at his graduation/coming home party. Director Mike Nichols does an outstanding job of making the older affluent adults look like your typical affluent stereotypes, both annoying and shallow, while making Ben appear like a little victim being overpowered by these adults. But the one person, the most captivating character in the film (Mrs. Robinson), an on-screen MILF, played brilliantly by Anne Bancroft, is the one person who treats him genuinely. With her cool and low-key demeanor she is able to capture his attention. But Ben is not so ready to jump in the hay with her. He's actually mortified at the thought of it at first.
This is one of the many reasons why this story is so fun and enthralling in that we aren't sure how much experience Ben does have if he has any experience with girls at all. Mrs. Robinson is a very attractive and chic woman. But she isn't really the villain some viewers made her out to be. The story gives her far more depth revealing to us that she too is a lonely person looking for an escape.I have heard other reviewers discuss why this movie is so important and the pathos it exudes: the gap between the young and old generation, internal loneliness, the uncertainty of life once we accomplish a goal, the inability to fit in, infidelity, young love, etc. All these themes are good and germane to the picture and Mike Nichols touches on all of them. After a couple of dramatic turning points in the film there are effective montage sequences beautifully photographed with the affecting Simon and Garfunkel score: a drive up the coast, a walk in the University quad or the climactic ending where Ben and Elaine bashfully glance at each other in the back of the escape bus wondering to themselves, What Now""?The performances are good throughout and Nichols knows how to get the most out of his actors with so little dialogue. In retrospect I consider the performance of Anne Bancroft to be the most interesting. She was able to convey with subtlety the inner emptiness of a manipulative, dignified, cool, gorgeous, sophisticated and vindictive woman with such depth that we are tempted to sympathize with her despite her unsavory actions.The Graduate is truly an hypnotic experience, especially for those who are going through a transition in life wondering what it all means.",The Graduate
163,arthera09,Beyond expectation,9,3 June 2007,"I will say at the start the only reason I did not give this film a 10 was because I was not convinced that Ben and Elaine could fall in love that quick and I guess it goes back to what makes me mad at a lot of classic pieces of literature where people just fall in love in a matter of minutes. But other than that this film was brilliant. I must say I am a little young to really get the movie for its times, but since I do listen to Simon and Garfunkel that helped with me getting into the soundtrack and what the soundtrack brought to the movie. I love watch classic films like this and seeing how they are parodied a lot, but the best parts of this movie cannot be parodied. The best parts of this was the use of long shots. They were not exceedingly long, but long enough to make one notice. He only cut when he needed to. I loved the acting and at first I thought Dustin Hoffman was one dimensional, but as the movie progressed it ended out to be a perfect performance. One cannot say how perfect Anne Banecroft was and how she really was able to pull off the sexual object so well. I loved how she was so insecure and it came out, but only when she was weak. Some of the shots were so good. I liked how Nichols would often use the framing of the face to great success. It seemed as if he insisted that if he was going to shoot someones face he was not going to do it right on and they were almost always off to the side. I really loved the camera work and it is what makes the movie stand out as something that will last. It amazes me that more directors don't even dare to try something of things that Nichols does in this movie with what seems like little effort. A friend, who knows movies, told me to watch this who was 16 when this movie came out and he says it is possible his favorite movie of all time so I had a lot of expectations for this film and it surpassed all of them. It was surprisingly funny and it a real gem of movie making.",The Graduate

Some of these films were appalling: some were excellent. The Graduate is one of the latter group. So you go to university, you get your degree, and then? Your parents have a nice house with a swimming pool in the garden and can afford to give you a sports car for your birthday. What do you do with your life? Well, there is always the wife of your father's business partner...There are some memorable scenes such as the ones shot through the scuba gear; or when Benjamin, complete with shades and cigarette, takes Elaine to the strip club for their first date; or when the landlord tells Benjamin, whose face is all lathered up: ""I want you out of here!""Hoffman looks suitably dejected and confused; and Anne Bancroft turns in a good performance as Mrs Robinson. Also superb, in a bit part, is the guy who plays the desk clerk.On the downside, the hallmark of Charles Webb's works is that two people can be talking to one another and yet not communicating at all. This is missing from the film version, and the film is all the poorer because of it.",The Graduate

166,Pavel-8,Decent but dated.,6,15 March 2003,"**Warning! Spoilers Ahead!**Some films age well, as their themes and styles resonate through different eras and lifestyles. ""The Graduate"" is not one of those films. All of the values of this movie scream 1960s, and as a member of a generation defined by motivation and ambition, I find the pictured values of confused sexual rebellion and pronounced indifference difficult to understand. At its core, this movie is simply a twisted romantic comedy. The twisted part arrives when Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) decides to pursue Elaine Robinson basically out of spite. I suppose this fit in with the ""**** You"" attitude of that flower child generation, but now it just seems inane. Speaking of inane, Benjamin's theft of Elaine at the end of the movie is plain silly. Initially it's a cute and spontaneous moment. But upon any reflection, Elaine has zero reason to abscond with him, yet joyfully flees the scene as though Benjamin were a white knight. Again, maybe in 1967 his character was Galahad personified, but that shining armor has rusted greatly since then. I can appreciate the style of the film. From the opening scene in the airport to the vivid yet reserved colors throughout the film, the look of ""The Graduate"" endures not necessarily as ground-breaking, but as a '60s time capsule. Bottom Line: While this film was evidently a grand statement at the time, its message and appeal have faded greatly in the 35 years since then.

169,Mikew3001,Still touching after 35 years,10,6 March 2002,"This is one of my favorite love movies ever. Dustin Hoffman's first major role is - next to his 1968 ""Midnight Cowboy"" - still one of his best and most touching movies ever made. From the very first scene to the happy end it is showing the painful state of growing up, falling seriously in love with an older woman, experiencing sex and new feelings and leaving the conservative standards of living behind.Hoffman is suffering in nearly every moment of the film from his longings, feelings and dreams, and Mike Nichol's direction, the photography, the fascinating song sound track of Simon and Garfunkel (including some of their best songs like Mrs. Robinson, The Sounds of Silence and Scarborough Fair) and the brilliant cast of Hoffman, Katherine Ross and the late Anne Bancroft add weight to Hoffman's private world.The movie is also a good parody of the typical middle-class jet set lifestyle of the sixties (university degrees, good jobs, marriage, an own house and bland garden party conversations) and a soft variation of the typical 1967 topic of revolution and protest in the summer of love... this movie is as old as me, so I feel some kind of related to it.

Stuff like this and ""Harold and Maude"" was probably very meaningful to depressed upper class hippies, but today it's just plain irritating. The parts about uncertain futures and love conquering all are still relevant; nothing else is. I suppose, for example, Dustin Hoffman's act of pursuing Elaine out of spite after ONE lousy date was defiant and cool in the 60's, but today it just seems... strange, to put it mildly. And while Hoffman is great at looking nervous and confused, his character has no real personality. I don't hate this movie: the first forty minutes are a blast, and the ending is a delight. But the majority of it is just empty and irrelevant today. Maybe it's important for defining the period, but if I'm going to watch a movie, I'd like to get something out of it.",The Graduate
171,Kubris,You can't learn that in school,8,15 June 2012,"IMDb Top 250: 164What a strange film. The Graduate follows meek undergrad Ben upon his return from school. He doesn't want to socialize at all, despite his parents pushing him and later embarrassing him. Eventually he finds something comfortable in a precarious affair which creates a notable change in Ben... until he meets his partner's daughter. Conflict, quirk, a little creepy and cute follow in the Rebel Without a Cause of the 60's.This could've been a very boring, mundane film. But creativity triumphs. Scenes are lively, almost on the surreal side, and certainly engaging. The cinematography is incredible, with inventive ways to show a scene like the scuba view, the many car shots, extreme zooms and the famous leg shots. Topically the film is very similar to Lolita, but visually The Graduate is in the current generation of film while Lolita remains in the previous.Unlike the warm atmosphere of his home, Ben is a very plain person. Early we hear about some of his school achievements, none of which he exhibits much pride in (or has any proof of), and he keeps to himself. He doesn't even have the presence to call a waiter. Hoffman makes this weakness so painful, and in cases funny to see. But Ben exhibits change and though his thoughts don't shift, his belief in his own opinions deepen. By the end of the film you'll be looking at a radically different person.The Robinsons are just as compelling, namely the sultry Mrs. The scenes she shares with Ben are magic and among the most memorable of the film. They are opposites: she dominates with confidence, he... doesn't. Like Ben she has a change- but not at all the same way. Elaine also draws emotion, like a sick feeling on their first 'date'. You feel for her, she goes through a lot. I felt she was familiar, and with further research I realized why: she's in my favourite film of all time Donnie Darko.I have a lack of affinity for several sex themed films, like Doctor Zhivago. So this film was a bit tough stomaching, with the whole jumping generations as partners. You may feel the same, or a more extreme, disgust, or you may find it simply theatrical and funny. I could tolerate it because of the light tone and strength of other aspects. I also, with an objective position, figured that Ben gets to be quite a stalker, despite his intentions. If you can put things like that aside in a film you will like the film even more than I did.The Graduate is a culturally significant film, relateable to all who are getting out of school and facing the real world with its work and social problems. It's a charming depiction of coming of age and to terms with ones' self. You'll laugh, raise a few eyebrows and will certainly enjoy this film. I also hope you like Simon and Garfunkel because they play over, and over, and over... 8.5/10",The Graduate
172,FilmMuscle,An Under-appreciated Classic!,9,23 September 2013,"I find it disappointing that the Graduate isn't one of those constantly-talked-about classics like The Godfather, Kramer vs. Kramer, Apocalypse Now, The Shawshank Redemption, etc. I had mixed expectations for the film since I heard, prior to viewing, some negative opinions and positive ones from individuals who'd recently watched it. Now, let's talk about why this film should be just as remembered of a classic as the others above. First of all and- in my opinion- most importantly, the film carries with it a highly intriguing and interesting story that keeps you entertained the entire way as the clever plot unravels. You're presented with this socially angsty twenty-year-old who's basically helpless, surrounded by intimidating people and frightening situations. He's a character that the audience can't help but love. For me, I could find myself relating to his personality quite a bit. I, too, attempt to stray away from great attention and prefer a much calmer and less crowded environment. The story, itself, keeps your attention because it's just strongly gripping insofar as this character finds himself in extremely awkward and threatening situations. Personally- like with the scene where Benjamin is awkwardly attempting to avoid suspicion while getting a hotel room- I recalled similar instances with myself where I was about to engage in something that could be regrettable and had to deal with suspicious or curious bystanders, family members, or whatnot. While we're still on it, the acting was unbelievably good, especially Dustin Hoffman's break-out performance as Benjamin. The way he portrayed a timid and awkward character surely blew away the moviegoers that night of its release. His timing and speech delivery, overall, creates an absolutely believable story about this fully realistic outcast. The way he would retreat under the pool whenever he felt vulnerable or faced his imposing parents definitely moved me because I could honestly understand him in any given predicament. At times, I feel like finding some peaceful and impenetrable spot to socially leave the world and obtain some time to breathe. The script of this picture is brilliant from the convincing dialogue to the intelligent build-up of relationships and their interconnections. For the moment, let's delve into the more technical side of The Graduate since its cinematography and editing is exceptional- excellent, might I say. The evolution of filmmaking over the decades from when Hollywood first stemmed truly and impressively proved itself in this movie. For example, there's a particular scene where Benjamin is ""drifting"" on the pool's air mattress, and he's interrupted by his irritating parents and the Robinsons themselves, and as they begin discussing his current uneventful life, the camera perfectly displays these incredibly condescending figures looking down at him with the sun shining so brightly that it seems to be blinding both the viewer and Benjamin as he's forced to look up at them. You sympathize with Benjamin because you feel their aggression and- again- condescending conversation about how he's not doing anything with his life, and I'm sure everyone's been in that sort of position, mentally or physically. Then, another shot shows Elaine as her confused face gets less and less blurry (indicating her progression towards fully understanding the mystery) until she finally realizes what's essentially transpiring between Benjamin and her own mother. In terms of editing, an instance showcases fast cutting to Mrs. Robinson's naked body as Benjamin attempts to ignore it but can't help his lust in a way. The film also smoothly and uniquely transitions to new settings without the audience even noticing at first as Benjamin exits the pool, walks to his room, and is suddenly found entering Mrs. Robinson's bed. Another strength of the camera-work is the noticeably lengthy shots where we witness entire conversations occurring in one single take or the scuba mask scene where a few minutes or so are filmed from a first-person perspective as Benjamin dives into his pool. In sum, the film seemed like a breath of fresh air that was affected by an unquestionably relatable protagonist that you felt for and his escape with the love of his life seemed utterly satisfying as well. Usually, happy endings done the way The Graduate did it come off as corny and clichéd, but your liking for the characters and their success overshadowed that aspect. So far, I've been loving all the films in class as this is yet another one I can't help but give high praise to.",The Graduate

Yet the real genius of The Graduate has nothing to do with all of it.The genius of this movie is that every single scene hooks you up to the next. Each one leaves you wanting to know what follows. The watchability of this movie is timeless. Every single moment could easily be the highlight in any other film. No other movie I can remember has mastered this so well. Nichols never reached again this level of perfection. The dialogs are memorable, the silent scenes are even more. The soundtrack has survived the test of time. The only ""60s"" thing about this movie is that it dared to take risks.The Graduate is so different from anything ever done on film is hard to categorize. My favorite film of all time.",The Graduate
176,ilikeimdb,This is really *that* good; but not perfect (and so what),10,21 December 2003,"The Graduate is a ""must see"" film for its fun and inventive cinematography, terrific acting, bold and cynical screenplay by Buck Henry, and certainly, its tour-de-force ending with a wan future upon wan smiles.  Other comments I've read complain about Katherine Ross's acting (I disagree), the overuse of Simon and Garfunkel music to move things along (maybe overdone), the unbelivability of the plot (in context, it has consistency), and that some scenes just go on for too long (perhaps, like the underwater diver pool scene).  But these are truly minor quibbles among an otherwise splendid quirky view of a spoiled, nihilistic, horny and obsessive rich kid in the California 60s.  The director Mike Nichols deserves every accolade -- I'm glad I finally had a chance to see this classic.",The Graduate
177,wandereramor,Postgraduate angst and anomie abound,9,4 October 2011,"There are some movies that you watch at exactly the right time in your life. For me, there's no better time to come to The Graduate than right now, having recently emerged myself from the womb of the university and facing the daunting prospect of entering the adult world, a shift which seems abrupt no matter how much adult hand-holding one gets. The film perfectly captures the kind of aimlessness that comes with two decades of institutional guidance running out on you and the plaid horror of adulthood. Ben (whose character Dustin Hoffman expertly constructs out of polite deferment and aw-shucks candour) is used and imposed upon by the adults around him, and is caught up further in their net no matter how hard he tries to rebel.The whole thing is brilliantly shot, from the otherworldly underwater sequence to the last shot, lingering long enough to make us wonder about the inevitable consequences of youthful rebellion and pose the tragedy of the moment after the craziest moment of your life, the inescapable question of ""what now?"". Mike Nichols' camera can be coy and humorous at times, a rare treat, but almost always captures beauty. It's rare that you see a narratively-driven film like this with such distinctive direction, and it deserves praise for managing to capture the best of both worlds.The Graduate isn't a perfect movie by any means -- the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack begins to grate after a while, and Ben's love for Elaine never feels really justified -- but it manages to capture perfectly a complex emotion that always awaits on the other side of ambition, something that few works of art I've seen have even touched on. Recommended, especially to recent graduates -- hell, they should include it in the envelope with the diploma.",The Graduate
178,rms125a,"Great movie, but ....",8,2 November 2017,"Great movie, but I will have to make some tiny, niggardly criticisms. Bancroft is wonderful in every facet of her role save one -- she does not seem remotely convincing as the mother of Katharine Ross's character, which probably explains why the two women share minimal time together (the only time I saw the movie was on TV, so I don't know what was edited or deleted). Less than a decade older than Ross, Bancroft's femme fatale, whose first name we never learn, is more like a raven-haired evil stepmother, who trifles with Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) but rejects him as thoroughly unsuitable for her own sweet daughter, Elaine. (She looks comically rabid in the film's ending scene at the church where a wedding is NOT held as planned.)William Daniels is overbearing (as so many of his characters were) as Benjamin's father who sets in action the sequence of events leading to Mrs. Robinson's downfall by pressuring Ben to go out with Elaine, despite his son's unwillingness. Murray Hamilton, as Mr. Robinson, comes off as an almost hysterical wimp in the scene at Ben's Berkeley boarding house room, unfortunately.The rather bizarre scene where a shirtless Benjamin is shaving, and his mother (an amazingly and unexpectedly sexy Elizabeth Wilson, usually known for her gorgon-like supporting and comedy roles) is standing, in a rather revealing nightgown, for lack of a better word, inside the open bathroom door querying him as to his nocturnal proclivities is priceless and may give a clue as to Benjamin's own quirky neuroses and problems with women.",The Graduate
179,K-Slicer,"The worst ""classic"" of all time",2,9 November 2002,"I watched this film and I wondered how.  HOW!  How could ""The Graduate"" be a classic?  This movie is a really dumb and utterly depressing piece of work. I decided to vote for this movie on the number of actual qualities it possessed.  The movie is deeming qualities of this film are the awesome performances of Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, and Katharine Ross and the incredible score by Paul Simon and Art Garfunkle.  Besides that, ""The Graduate"" is not a classic.  It royally sucks and I can't believe this movie reached the heights that it has.This is where I rant for several hundred words.  The real reason this movie bites is because of Dustin Hoffman's character.  He is a stalker and there is nothing beyond that.  I have no sympathy for him.  He is a brainless moron who needs to be beat with a chunk of cinder block.  He uses his second head as opposed to his first and that is really a stupid thing to do.  By doing that, he screws himself over as well as the woman he loves and her father too.  It is extremely sickening to see this.Another aspect was Mrs. Robinson herself.  She is evil and willing to cheat upon her own husband with a younger man.  She also blames the young man for the problems she has caused.  In my mind, adultery is repulsive and since she doesn't want to take responsibility for her own actions, it is even more repulsive.Thirdly, innocent people are hurt because the actions of the two aforementioned.  Katharine Ross' character is unfairly hurt.  She is dragged across hot coals in this.  In reality, she would have dumped the brainless moron and found someone else who actually cared for her. The scenes she played out with Dustin Hoffman were really eerie.  Realistically, she would have called the police and they would have dragged him away.Fourthly, the dichotomy of reality and unreality in ""The Graduate"" is really messed up.  At first, the story has an extremely realistic edge to it but the last third ends up unrealistic.  I was hoping that Hoffman's character would have been the loser but it doesn't happen.  The object of affection in the film finds it cute that her cracked in the head suitor is chasing after her.  She is an absolutely rational adult and she should comprehend that she isn't a teenager and what this man is doing isn't cute.  It is really deranged and beyond the norm.Overall, this is a sad excuse for a film.  It should never have reached the level that it has.  It is overrated, sickening, and above all wrong.  I despise adultery and I sometimes despise the fact that emotion overrules logic.  ""The Graduate"" give sympathy to a main character who doesn't honestly deserve it.  I wish the guy would have picked up his shattered heart and moved on with life but it didn't play out that way.  I give this sad film a 2 out of 10!  Thanks goodness for the sane music!Here ends my rant!",The Graduate
180,thomvic,An interesting film and a good comedy,9,9 May 2011,"I was dying to see this film for ages and couldn't seem to find it at my video store no matter how often I went. Well I finally got it from my local library and sat eagerly to watch this.And I'm glad I did! Even though this film is more than forty years old and I'm a 22 year old Gen Y, there is still a lot to relate to in this - the decisions you make when you are at that age and also the decisions you make when you're considerably older. Dustin Hoffman plays a great quirky character with Ben Braddock who has graduated from college and not sure where he wants to go in life, with pressure from his parents and their friends. Then jumps in Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) who takes him down a path of guilt and seduction, who just happens to be his father's business associate's wife.The interesting thing about this film is that this can happen anywhere and probably more nowadays. The bored housewife stuck in a meaningless marriage, out looking for some fun is something you see quite a lot in today's time as well. It must have been even more controversial back in the 60's when the age of innocence was coming to an end. I can only imagine what it was like back then when something done was considered unconventional and highly immoral.Another thing about this movie was its great soundtrack. 'The Sounds of Silence' is a song I wanna hear again and I felt it really added to the feel of the film with the songs played. You really root for Ben as he goes to desperate lengths to find what he wants, especially when Mrs. Robinson's daughter comes into the pack.And also hilarious was the ending scene. I'm not going to spoil it but now I'm so glad I watch the Simpsons because it just makes you laugh when you see how many references that TV show has made to so many classics. And it was even funnier seeing it in this movie - it just made me laugh. It also begs the question of do we follow our desires without looking at the consequences - or should we just face them as they come since no one never really knows what happens when we make certain choices?Perhaps at my present time in life - now knowing exactly what I want to do with my future, you can relate to Ben's character at being lost and confused. I don't know if I would have a fling with an older woman though but you can see how desires and temptations often lead you to do things you never thought you might. I guess it's the whole thing about being young and thinking you need to do everything before it's too late.",The Graduate
181,marissas75,"Still hilarious, still affecting",10,31 December 2005,"""The Graduate"" has been part of American pop culture since long before I was born. The story of uncertain college graduate Benjamin Braddock, his affair with older family friend Mrs. Robinson, and his eventual pursuit of her daughter Elaine is now common knowledge, and the many upheavals of the '60s have come and gone. Despite all this, ""The Graduate"" is still emotionally involving, rather than dated. The acting, screenplay, and direction are all skillfully done, and overall the film truthfully conveys how it feels to be ""adrift,"" like Benjamin.""The Graduate"" is hilarious and painful, often at the same time. Some great humor comes from the satirical skewering of American culture (""Plastics""), but most is character-based, arising from Ben's awkwardness and knack for saying exactly the wrong thing.Technically, Dustin Hoffman was too old for his role and Anne Bancroft was too young for hers (they were just 6 years apart in age!). And sometimes it's hard to believe that Hoffman is supposed to be 21, but his performance captures so much of Ben's post-college angst, insecurity, and confusion, it's easy to forgive him for looking a little old. Bancroft is able to play older than her actual age, and more importantly, she makes Mrs. Robinson into a complex and human character. Mrs. Robinson could easily be a cartoon of a sex-hungry woman, but in Bancroft's portrayal, she is rueful, bitter, wry, and determined. ""The Graduate"" has inspired many other films focusing on youthful alienation and anomie. But, in my opinion, a lot of those movies fail by trying to be ""hip"" or ""ironic"" or ""quirky"" to such a degree that it's impossible to empathize with the characters. ""The Graduate"" avoids most of this. Sure, the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack was very hip at the time, but the music always serves the mood of the film, rather than just proving that Mike Nichols listened to cool bands. The film's montages, underscored by this sweet, melancholy folk-rock music, have a surprising emotional power.The famously ambiguous final shot practically begs you to speculate on what will happen to Ben and Elaine in the future. In other words, the characters are interesting and relatable enough to keep thinking about long after the movie has ended. That should be proof enough that ""The Graduate"" is still an excellent, relevant, involving film. Go check it out.",The Graduate
182,jmvscotland,Still a fine movie but it hasn't traveled well through time,7,20 March 2016,"It's been a long time since I last saw ""The Graduate"" but I've just watched it again.In many ways, it is still a very fine movie with some great performances, especially from Anne Bancroft and from Dustin in what was probably his first major movie role.BUT, in my view, there are now problems with the movie which might not have been evident at the time of its release. The Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack is still wonderful but ONLY up to a point. A movie cannot and should never have been so heavily dependent on a few great songs as this one is and, to be quite frank, by the fourth time Scarborough Fair started up, I found myself saying out loud ""Oh, not again!"". That is really my only criticism of The Graduate even now. It is far too dependent on the soundtrack in exactly the same way 2001 has suffered for being far too reliant on Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra that it featured way too often throughout its two and a half hours' length. That too, like the Simon and Garfunkels in The Graduate, was simply overdone and now detracts from the enjoyment of each of the movies.Nonetheless, I still rate The Graduate quite highly and happily give it a 7. In hindsight, I think it would have been so much more enjoyable to watch now had it featured something other than the repetitive S and G soundtrack. Anyway, how did one pair of artists get the gig for an entire soundtrack? JMV",The Graduate
183,adamshl,Landmark Late 60s Film,8,21 April 2009,"Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin appears in closeup in the opening shot of the first scene. He continues to be in every scene till the end. It reminded me of Audrey Hepburn's Princess in ""Roman Holiday"" and Vivien Leigh as Scarlett in ""GWTW."" The device is, get the viewer involved in the main character and follow him/her through the drama.In this case, it certainly worked. Even though Ben isn't the nice, straight-laced lad we might have thought in the beginning, he's there occupying our attention from start to finish. During the course, he's seen doing some morally dubious things. At one point Mr. Robinson calls him ""filth, scum,"" and ""a degenerate."" That's a pretty strong indictment for a hero, and in fact he becomes an instant anti-hero, once his character is given verbal definition.While the film can't quite make up its mind whether it's a drama, satire, social commentary or comedy, it gives the impression it knows what it's about. Ben's sulking matches the wistfulness of the Simon-Garfunkel songs, and the whole enterprise is kept alive by brilliant acting, directing, photography, and editing.Anne Bancroft made Mrs. Robinson her own; Hoffman became an instant star; Katherine Ross was in fine form as well. Mike Nichols' work was constantly inventive and striking.Viewed today after many years, the film remains engaging; still, to me it seems to rather lack a heart and soul. It's neither negative nor positive, just sort of neutral, not amounting to much in the total scheme of things, yet an engrossing diversion of times past. Though ""plastics"" are still very much with us.",The Graduate
184,commandercool88,One of cinema's greatest coming of age tales,10,29 July 2008,"What makes a movie great? Is it a timeless appeal, continued relevance year after year after year? Is it iconic performances, forever immortalized on screen? Or is it that feeling we get, a realization that we're watching something very special? 'The Graduate' falls under any one of these categories and much more. It was released in 1967 but could pass as a film made forty years later, eloquently tackling the troubles and frustration of young adulthood.There's a subtle and tactful atmosphere that surrounds 'The Graduate', a film not always ripe with words and talk but heavy and thick with emotion and unease. Dustin Hoffman so perfectly captures the 'what now?' feeling about the game of life, an undeniably intelligent young man but with no sense of direction, no sense of meaning. It's a state of mind many of us, if not all of us, can relate to strikingly well. His character is fascinatingly complex, standing alone at one of life's many crossroads with confusion, desperation, anger, and loneliness. The dreamlike sequence before Hoffman's first sexual encounter with Mrs. Robinson is absolutely stunning and powerful, a visionary moment that speaks profoundly.It's Anne Bancroft who steals the show with her enticingly sultry turn as Mrs. Robinson, Hoffman's seductress at least twice his age. Her sensuous elegance, the dangerous game of risk. She captures Hoffman in the palm of her hand, but beneath the surface, there's a lifetime of hurt and loneliness. A hole that can't be filled by physical pleasures, no matter how hard she tries. We feel for her, but at the same time, we hate her. Does all the blame rest squarely on her shoulders? No, it takes two to tango. But she plays her devilish hand with a shrewd nastiness that makes 'The Graduate' such a compelling picture.Mike Nichols created his masterpiece with 'The Graduate', a phenomenal effort riddled with comedy, drama, romance, heartbreak, and an ending that touches the perfect note. The film's execution is precise and genius, while Simon and Garfunkel's legendary soundtrack launches 'The Graduate' into cinematic immortality. It captures a feeling that resonated so well with younger audiences back in the 60s, and it's still working its magic to this day. Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson. And thanks for a great film.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",The Graduate
185,TheNabOwnzz,A brilliant depiction of personal alienation,7,9 September 2018,"Most of the kind of flicks like the Graduate, which rely on showing the alienation of a main character to society, cross the line towards the cringeworthy, creating an unpleasant and uneasy feeling for the audience. The Graduate, however, manages to depict this alienation in such a relatable fashion that there is no real cringe to speak of.Dustin Hoffman deserves a lot of credit for his role in the film. He was reportedly the same kind of person as his character ( Ben Braddock ) and it definitely shows that he was born to play this role. His nervously having to wait for two different generations of people before going through a door, or his lack of attempting to 'Call' to a waiter while instead just pointing behind his back, it all shows that this is a person that is uneasy and alienated to the society he lives in. This could have easily been cringeworthy, but Hoffman's acting feels so raw and the screenplay feels so realistic that one can only stare in awe at how accurate this depiction is. Ben starts out as the gullible alienated schoolboy but evolves towards a determined human being towards the end of the film, resulting in a great display of character development. Anne Bancroft as Mrs Robinson, Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robinson and in a bit lesser terms Katharine Ross as Elaine are also performing to the best of their abilities which in turn makes the acting in The Graduate one of its many strengths.It is a motion picture filled with subtle and artsy metaphors and symbolisms, and a lot of fantastic visual storytelling. Examples of this are the shot of him before the fish tank, which symbolizes his jumbled view of life at that point. Not yet knowing what his purpose is, and what he strives to be. Another example is the famous under the legs shot with Ben in the background which shows us exactly how hard to refuse the seduction must have been for his already quite compliant character ( At that point ). Or the fantastic scene near the end which shows us a camera position in the distance that Hoffman is running to the entire time, which tells the story in visual terms that he is running but not getting any closer, and only when the camera zooms out and a certain building is revealed on the left side of the screen we suddenly see that this was merely a diversion and that his goal was indeed nearby the whole time. Due to this fantastic visual storytelling, the audience will start to create quite a sympathetic feel for the protagonist since this subtly tells us what his inner struggles are.The Graduate appreciates the audience's intelligence, and doesn't use any more dialogue than is necessary. It isn't ham fisted, and it features a lot of montage scenes which focus solely on the facial expressions of its brilliant cast of characters to tell the story, while using brilliant photography, cinematography, innovative camera angles & shot variety to truly immersive the audience into its environment. Instead of an orchestral original score by an acclaimed film composer, The Graduate cast Simon & Garfunkel as the musical additions to the film, and their songs perfectly capture what Ben is going through throughout the film. Many scenes include Ben reflecting on his life while Simon & Garfunkel's fantastic iconic music plays, and it fits perfectly with the narrative.The greatest scene has to be the superb final one, namely when they are on the bus itself. While Simon & Garfunkel's fitting ( Because the scene has no dialogue ) Sound of Silence plays, our main characters are seen in joy after disrupting Elaine's wedding and making it towards the bus which will make them live happily ever after. That is, if director Mike Nichols cut the scene short for about 20 seconds. The smiles slowly disappear and some 20 seconds long our characters monotonously stare in front of themselves which symbolizes the fact that both characters know what they are getting into and know that their path ahead will be difficult. And it is this sense of self awareness that makes this film stand out so much from your average coming of age film. It could have easily ended 20 seconds earlier with both characters smiling and riding off into the sunset, but Nichols left on a stunningly realistic ambiguous note with both characters realizing they have obstacles to overcome, and can not yet live happily ever after. In a slight complaint, for such a subtle film the depiction of the parents as indoctrinating monsters is slightly overdone and lacks obvious subtlety, yet it still helps the narrative forward.It is the kind of film that relies heavily on human emotions & uses a lot of facial expressions and visual storytelling to create this emotion. It has brilliant acting, a great screenplay, a great score by Simon & Garfunkel, great cinematography, and above all fantastic direction, which all creates a succesful study on society alienation and overcoming indoctrination.",The Graduate

187,Chuck-149,Good job Mrs. Robinson!,9,10 September 1999,"When people think of the movie that gave the boost to Dustin Hoffman's career, they think of ""The graduate"" which is totally correct in my opinion. However, even though he got a nomination for his role as Ben Braddock, and considering the fact that he is my favorite actor, I must admit that I believe he did such a good job in the movie because he was acting with one of the best actresses of all-time, Anne Bancroft.  I believe that the team they made is really what makes this movie an American classic.  Ben Braddock (Hoffman) has just graduated and so his parents decide to host a grand party in his honor and attending the party is Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft).  She manages to get Braddock to take her home and even gets him trapped in her daughter's bedroom as she stands totally naked in front of him.  Completely out of control, Braddock tries to break out of the room but Mrs. Robinson keeps him inside explaining to him that if he ever wants her services, all he has to do is call her.    The next week, Braddock calls Mrs. Robinson and asks her to spend a night with him at a motel.  She agrees under the one condition which is that he must never take her daughter out on a date.  However, when Mrs. Robinson's daughter (Katharine Ross) returns home from college, Ben's father tells his son he should take her out on a date just out of courtesy and this is when everything starts screwing up.  Fine performances by Bancroft, Hoffman, and Ross, great directing by Nichols, and excellent music by ""Simon and Garfunkel"" are what make this one superb.  The only flaw the movie has is a rather simple dialogue but the originality of the script is so good that it helps back-up the movie's only weak spot.  Highly recommended.",The Graduate
188,daviddaphneredding,did anyone ever really graduate?,6,8 November 2013,"This movie was comical to an extent, but there was also a serious point to it. I personally felt that it was trying to say to not throw your life away after you graduate from college. The young Braddock man, played to a tee by Dustin Hoffman, was thoroughly confused, and Mrs. Robinson, (which was one of the beautiful Anne Bancroft's most memorable roles which she played well) only made matters worse for him by tempting him to do the wrong he did. It was a character study which delved into the characters' lives. There was also symbolism found in the production; for example, when Braddock was sitting at a zoo, in a cage nearby were three monkeys, and in light of the situation in which Braddock found himself, anyone would have to wonder if this graduate's thinking was any higher than that of the lower form of animals. William Daniels did well as a firm and concerned father of Braddock, and Elizabeth Wilson did fairly well as Braddock's mother. Murray Hamilton showed forth outstanding acting ability as Mr. Robinson, the man who believed that Braddock would be good for his daughter Elaine whom Braddock had been dating; of course, his attitude toward him changed after his affair with Mrs. Robinson, and he was understandably bitter. Though she was not in it as much as most of the others, the beautiful Katherine Ross stole the show as Elaine; this is the role for which she was best known, it seems. The ending was good, though very comical. But again, all the main personages in the movie were immature, to say the least, so you would have to, again, wonder if they ever really graduated. Because of the symbolism and the point of the story, it was a passable film.",The Graduate
189,fred-houpt,"Ah yes, the 60's......",9,8 November 2006,"This is one of the most talked about movies from the 60's. This is the era that took America back into a war most did not want - Vietnam and it ended up tearing the nation apart. This is a movie that is only partially a mirror to the entire 60's or to the growing menace in their Vietnamese conflict. It is also a movie about a young 20 something man who is not given enough time to sort out what his next move past college will be or is given enough time to sort out his sexuality.If we pay close attention to the script we are told several key things about Benjamin. He is very bright, a very high level achiever at school, the pride and joy of his parents, apparently their only child (unless I missed something here?), someone who at an earlier age only had nasty fights with Elaine, is maybe a virgin, is definitely a schlemiel and mommas boy and is completely emotionally at odds with himself about what to do next. When we are introduced to Ben he wants to hide in his room rather than face his parents friends and their well intentioned but annoying and cloying back slaps, boozy lipstick smearing kisses and unending free advice. He keeps saying (although no one is really listening or interested in his answer) that he has no idea what he is going to do next and he keeps insisting that this is really bothering him. The pressure Ben felt was the same for all college grads; the expectation of his family to make something of himself after they had presumably paid a great deal of money for his education put him in the hot seat. Although he was home for a summer vacation, neither he or his family will let him take stock of himself and just get to a decision on his own terms. The angst he expresses seems to me to be larger than just himself. This appear to be Mike Nichols reflecting the angst of the entire 60's generation who was as I was saying just coming to grips with a huge conflict over Vietnam, a conflict that brought great friction between young people and a generation that saw America triumphant in World War 2. Although the film is a comedy, it certainly has elements of the 60's conflicts that have been written about extensively by historians and journalists alike.The film is famous in our eyes for several reasons. The music of Simon and Garfunkel is always a joy and although some of the tracks are played just wee bit too often, we enjoy the music nonetheless. The hilarious sound bites: ""Ben, I have one word for you: plastics"" must have been repeated ad nauseum by people for years after. I know my brother and I used to crack ourselves up with repetitions of some of those phrases. The steamy sex scenes: my God, if Anne Bancroft is not one super hot woman in this film! I was quite surprised to see a stripper flip her breasts around in that funny and sad scene - only wearing pasties. I say surprised because I thought it a bit more steamy than films of that rating would have had at that time. It is a short scene but it effectively launches the building of a real relationship between Ben and Elaine.Much has been written analyzing the relationship between the nebisch Ben and the hyper-manipulative alcoholic and sexually deprived vixen Mrs. Robinson. Clearly she saw him come back from college and could not live without instant satisfaction. She was not interested in what he felt; she is incapable of giving that much concern to another person. She is needy, grasping, willing to hurt her own daughter in order to satisfy her pulsating libido. She has no morals and clearly wants like a true addict: getting only means more wanting. Is she a nymphomaniac then? Perhaps, but her personality is corrupted and she is more than willing to take every advantage with a young buck who has strayed into her sights. You can just imagine that all the time Ben was away from her Mrs. Robinson drank herself into oblivion with her sexless marriage. Along comes Ben and she sees salvation through physical conquest; Ben is so over his head in confusion and insecurity that although he notices that he is being used he doesn't know what to do about it. Bancroft's portrayal of Mrs. Robinson is certainly one of the most powerful and much talked about female vixens in movie history. Bancroft was a superb actress and she makes mincemeat with the stumbling Hoffman. It is just a delight to watch her even though she gives in to such self destructive urges.Hoffman: what a bang for the start of a movie career. He is so fantastic to watch there are not enough words in a short review to say why. A 'graduate' of the method school, he shows everyone why he is to be respected; as a very young actor he worked with the script and direction and the inherent conflicts of the movie without going astray or overacting. Hoffman is just worth his weight in Oscar gold.This is a seminal 60's movie and there is so much that one can see in it given my 2006 perspectives. Anyone who wants to see movie making from the 60's at it's very best should start here. There are few better than this one.",The Graduate

192,writerasfilmcritic,"""The Graduate"" is a Tale of the Sixties. You Had to be There or you Won't Understand.",10,13 June 2005,"Many of the remarks which are critical of this film are coming from people who are too young to have fully understood the mood of the sixties. Young people today embrace the goals of career advancement and material success as all-important, and in that respect, they are much like the older generation of the sixties. The younger generation of that era are, of course, today's older generation. At the time (though it may be hard to tell now), they rejected the values of their parents and were idealistic and Utopian in their approach to life. The generation gap was the biggest issue of the day (aside from the Vietnam War) and it was a recurrent theme in this film. The shallow, cynical, and corrupt older generation were wonderfully depicted by the boozing Robinsons. They wallowed in bourgeois elitism and hypocrisy, an apt theme the extravagant, big band lounge music that Mrs. Robinson puts on after Ben drives her home from the party. Recall, as well, the seemingly off-the-wall advice given to Ben by a man at the party: ""One word, son -- plastics!"" Actually, it might have been good advice, considering the way things have developed, but it sure didn't seem so at the time. The older generation were ""plastic"" (artificial and phony), whereas the younger generation strove to be honest and natural, though obviously, few succeeded at it for long. In any case, you had to have been there to fully appreciate and understand these references, which at the time were anything but subtle. Even though Mrs. Robinson is undeniably a far more sophisticated and sexy woman than her pretty, naive daughter, Elaine represents the unapologetic and uncompromising idealism of the younger generation. Ben, who more than anything wanted his life to be ""different"" and grew tired of his purely physical relationship with Elaine's mother, just naturally shifted his romantic attachment to her daughter. The movie's score began to play a more important role as he courted her. I don't necessarily agree with those who claim the second part of the movie wasn't as good as the first. Although Ben indeed may have been kidding himself about just how much he loved and needed Elaine, he nevertheless fervently pursued her, and his love for the girl, whether real or imagined, represented what he considered most important in life. This was a real parting of the ways from the values of the older generation, who appeared to place romantic love fairly low on their list of priorities. In fact, without so many examples of their cynical and oft-nauseating attitudes continually in evidence, the movie changed into something else, just as it did in real life when the relatively innocent younger generation tried to experience life on their own terms (which few of them ever succeeded at doing for very long). ""The Graduate"" was thus a classic movie that spoke for an entire generation. It is easy to understand why many members of the younger generation of today would be turned off by this movie. They are like the older generation of yesterday (only more so)-- boozing at an early age, driven by a desire to achieve material success above all else, obsessed with gadgets and other ephemeral distractions, and terrified that they might be perceived as ""losers,"" which not coincidentally is the biggest insult they can apply to one another or to members of the older generation of today. Benjamin Braddock would be, to them, ""a loser"" who didn't know what was important or what he ought to want. When their own kids reach maturity and begin to seek greater meaning and purpose than the emphasis on money and position that is obviously so important to their parents, watch them reject almost everything Generation X stands for. It will be ""The Graduate"" all over again.",The Graduate

I enjoyed the movie until Ben told Elaine the truth about his affair with her mom and from that point it was down hill for me where Ben started to stalk her in Berkeley and the irony that Elaine after she went on only one date with Ben can love and elope with him was beyond me..only in movies you can do that not in real life.. furthermore how can a girl accept a guy who had slept with her mom the only explanation I can get is love is indeed blind and she is young and rebellious..In summary the whole culprit and villain is indeed Benjamin.. not Mrs Robinson who I can and standby is the victim of this whole affairThe soundtrack is just great every tune hits the spot.",The Graduate
195,Stibbert,A Timeless Gem,9,4 November 2005,"I accidentally cached this movie on TV and as I didn't have anything else to do I sat down and watched it. I'm glad I did. I've heard good things about this movie, but didn't know too much about it. Never the less I really liked what I saw. This is truly a timeless classic and one of the best films there are.Benjamin Braddock is an insecure 21 year-old who has a scholarship and a future a head of him. He just don't know what he want's to do with that future. He get's involved with Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's partner and long time family friend. Then one day the Robinson's daughter comes back home and after spending time with her, Ben sees his life heading in a new direction.The story is great. It's a story that can be cute, funny, dramatic and intriguing. The screenwriter makes use of these possibilities and does so well. The story is well written and the characters are great. You get to love them and hate them and you get to understand their behavior. There's good drift in the story and you get interested and want to watch the rest.Dustin Hoffman is excellent and nothing less. His portray of Ben Braddock is great. I don't think I've seen him deliver such a performance ever (not in those of his movies I've seen). Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson is also great. She gives her character life (or lack of) in a great way. The rest of the cast also lives up to the leads and delivers great performances.Like several films in the 60's this makes use of songs that would later become radio hits rather than a classic score. It works excellent. I, however, didn't like the way they played Scarborugh Fair three times in a row with a couple of minutes in between, but it still does the job very well and the rest of Paul Simons songs fits this movie like a glove. It sets the mood and is something more to listen to then just a score. It's different and it's excellent. The other sound work is also very good.The cinematography is really a gem. The lightning is just nice and the composition of the shots are good. Only thing that pulls the cinematography down one point is some odd zooms that not always fit in, but that's not a big issue and apart from that it's excellent. The editing is also really good. There are some pretty nice transitions at one point and the rest of the film is nicely chopped as well. It's technically very good and very enjoying to watch.The Graduate is a timeless gem. I saw it and didn't think for one second that this is the 60's. The theme is timeless and there are no particular references to the 60's. That makes this move great and enjoyable still today and I hope for generations to come. This is in my opinion a movie everyone could watch and enjoy.",The Graduate
196,iwalrus,Top Of The Class,8,6 October 2021,"A movie that is still good decades after it was made.A great cast, in particular Dustin Hoffman at the beginning of his career.Good music by Simon and Garfunkel.A very risky storyline for the 60's.Good production.There were faults in the script but didn't detract from an enjoyable film.",The Graduate
197,cleary-joshua,If anyone was born to play an awkward 21 year old...,8,20 June 2013,"If anyone was born to play an awkward 21 year old deciding what to do with his life, it has to be 30 year old Dustin Hoffman, who steals this movie with his brilliant portrayal of Benjamin Braddock. It's a performance with humour and emotion all rolled into one. For example, Hoffman's performance when he first takes Mrs. Robinson home is hilarious, with his constant nervous stammering and occasional high-pitched squeaks. The final shot of Elaine and Benjamin has so much drama in both of their expressions, and you can tell how great the pair are as actors. They've just run away together, and she's already married. Are they completely happy? Not really, and both of their faces have a sort of ""now what?"" expression, leaving the audience thinking about whether it was the right decision.As for the story itself, it's comical without becoming too farcical, and has enough drama later on to keep the audience interested. It's also beautifully shot, with a lot of clever cutting and images, such as the fact that Benjamin is always being shot through other objects, like the hotel woodwork, or Mrs. Robinson's leg. The music too is great, and Simon and Garfunkel's songs, though some of them are used almost too much, manage to create just the right atmosphere for the film.The late Roger Ebert originally gave this film 4 stars, but thirty years later, dropped his score down to 3, something I'm not sure I've ever heard of a critic doing. He states in his later review that it's not a film that has stood the test of time, that modern audiences wouldn't find it as funny. I disagree with this, and managed to find humour in a lot of the film. However his main reason for doing so is the character of Benjamin, whom he calls an 'insufferable creep', and now I think about it, Ebert is kind of right. Perhaps the awkwardness does go a bit too far at points, and he is just a bit strange and horrible in taking Elaine to the strip club and stalking her for a long time.This detail aside, I still found it to be a hugely enjoyable film which left a lot to think about afterwards, as well as a lot of laughs, and it's worth watching if only for Hoffman's performance and delivery of that classic line: ""Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me, aren't you.""",The Graduate
198,dlynch843,great piece of social history,9,17 December 2018,"Spoilers ahead. A lot has been said of those last 5 seconds--the look on their faces--that turned....somber? serious? I have two takes on that---first, I think after the smashing of social restraints--ripping away from a marriage and the culture it represented, began to dawn on them--more so Dustin Hoffman---that they were facing a whole different future, and with that came responsibility. So those reflective faces showed their concern for what lay ahead. Just a hint, anyway.
My second take is this: no way was Mike Nichols going to make a movie where they lived happily ever after. That would have been too 'Hollywood'. So he put in the last little hint of seriousness, without ruining the ending--where the camera stops and the bus moves forward.",The Graduate

200,Primtime,Too High on the AFI,8,9 April 1999,"To have this film ranked #7 on the AFI's 100 best list is an injustice to the majority of the films that followed. This is a good film, however, not top ten material.I'm not really sure why so many people have said that Dustin Hoffman gave an incredible performance in this film. Sure he showed emotions of confusion (although very naive for a college graduate) but how hard is it to make somebody think that you are confused? I believe that Anne Bancroft gave the only credible performance to this film. Whatever Mrs. Robinson's motives were for getting Benjamin into bed will always remain a mystery to me, and you can tell that Mrs. Robinson even has her doubts as well. Katherine Ross had the only other role of substance as the daughter of the Mrs. Robinson, and seems just as confused as Benjamin does throughout the film. Other than a few scenes of emotion, Ross adds very little to the film.The ending of this film has its great points - the whole exiting the church and taking off on a bus part, and its lackluster points - would you go off with a guy who slept numerous times with your mother on your wedding day? The music by Simon and Garfunkel played well throughout the film, although ""Scarborough Fair"" just might have been played to death. Nichols did a very good job directing this film, especially the scene in which Benjamin is to meet all of his parents friends after coming home from college. Look for Richard Dreyfuss as the dorm student who says that he will call the cops.8/10 stars.",The Graduate

I know this is similar to some of my reviews but I avoid spoilers completely even on a movie this old. Every actor is perfect. The story is amazing. The scenes are absolutely aggravating. A character stuck in personality is frustrating. And Simon clearly did not need Garfunkel. I love that the script introduces a little humor there and here. A bit outrageous. Very clever.

202,ToldYaSo,"Dee da dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee da dee, Doo da doo doo doo doo doo da doo",10,12 September 1999,"Here's to you Mrs. Robinson. Was it the song by Simon and Garfunkel made popular by the film, or did the film entrench the song into popular culture? Who's to say either way? It's a matter of opinion, and it's irrelevant really. The fact is, it's a great song and a great movie and the two compliment each other like peanut butter and jelly, ham and swiss or May and December.This movie is for anyone who's ever wondered what they are going to do with their future, anyone who's been in love with someone their parents didn't approve of, or anyone who's had an affair with one of their parent's friends. Granted, not many will fall in the latter category, but it throws an interesting spin on the film.The film perfectly encapsulates and portrays the feelings of self-doubt, alienation, disenchantment and unwanted pressures and expectations for a twenty-something just out of college. Dustin Hoffman is the only person we can possibly imagine in the role of Benjamin as his imprint and superb acting makes this film a great one. As reflected on in an interview with Dustin Hoffman on the DVD, ""The Graduate at 25"", his life changed after this film, propelling him into something of a superstar status as his incredible talent found wide recognition. When I saw ""Rushmore"" I had a similar feeling about young Jason Schwartzman in the lead role. For him, time will tell. Although ""Rushmore"" isn't the time tested success that ""The Graduate"" is, anyone who enjoyed ""Rushmore"" would likely enjoy ""The Graduate"" if they haven't already seen it. They are, however, distinctly different films.This comedy is something of a benchmark in many ways. Not many films of a comedic nature are so socially relevant and of such high quality that they make the A.F.I.'s top ten of all time. The film by many standards is more than just a contemporary comedy. It is quite possibly the best one ever made, given its widespread appeal.It is well shot with interesting sequences and hilarious segments that hold up against the test of time. It has been a long-time favourite of mine, and I can scarcely imagine growing tired of it.",The Graduate
203,markymark70,Sacrilegious maybe - but i thought it was poor,4,23 August 2012,"I've never seen The Graduate until last week. But I knew of it's reputation - a timeless classic. Apparently. I also looked up the rating on IMDb - 8.1 - impressive. So I dived right in there to witness what all the fuss was about.I'm sorry but I just don't see it? I don't get it at all. Far from being a classic - I think it is a particularly dumb and totally far fetched movie with strange scenes, dialog, situations and a weird ending.Okay - the premise seems reasonable at first - a newly graduated young man - Ben (Hoffman) - begins an affair with Anne Bancroft (Mrs. Robinson)- a mature friend of the family. But then falls for her daughter instead. Sounds OK - doesn't it? But is it executed well? Not in my opinion.Firstly - Mrs. Robinson's attitude in seducing Benjamin initially is totally incredible and unbelievable. She is an attractive woman and Ben is young, socially inept around others and not to mention short and geeky looking. Why would she would even bother with him in the first place was my initial thought. But to persevere after being rebuked several times beggars belief. But the affair happens and thru circumstances - Ben is forced to go on a date with Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine (Katherine Ross at her most beautiful). Then we are supposed to believe that he falls in love with Elaine at the drop of a hat and wants to marry her? Ridiculous. And she wants to marry him too - after he treated her like dirt initially and then she found out that he slept with her mother? Again ridiculous. And the ending? Don't even get me started on that. I won't spoil it here for everyone - but to say it is laughable is to be generous to it in the extreme.There are some clever camera tricks all the way through - however the 'snap' editing of Mrs. Robinson's nude scene was NOT one of them - but it isn't enough to save this poor attempt at a story. Simon and Garfunkel's music is okay - and maybe I am been too harsh here as I am not a fan of them either - but again the music can only do so much for a film.In all - and I assume I am in the minority here - I thought the film was shoddy. 4/10 and 2 of those points are there for Ross' looks alone.",The Graduate

207,Supachewy,A Dramedy Classic,9,20 August 2010,"The dramedy The Graduate is a film from director Mike Nichols and stars Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, and Katharine Ross and takes place in modern day Pasadena, California.The film is about a young man, Ben (Hoffman), who just graduate college and is worried very much so about his future. But at his party to celebrate his graduation one his parent's friends, Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft), lures Ben to her home and tries to seduce Ben. At first she doesn't succeed, but then Ben finally calls her up and takes her offer. Their affair goes on for quite a bit until Ben just wants to talk to Mrs. Robinson for once instead of just having sex. Then Elaine (Ross), Mrs. Robinson's daughter, comes home from Berkley and she and Ben start to date. The tension builds rapidly and emotions begin to fly in this classic film.Mike Nichols deserves his Oscar for Best Director because of all the legendary shots in this film. There are so many, the first that comes to mind is when Ben says, ""Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?"". Another is when he is in his scuba suit. I can go on and on about the amazing number of brilliant shots. Another thing he did very well was make us connect to the characters, especially Ben and Elaine. I could feel Ben's nervousness when Mrs. Robinson is playing her little game with him and I could feel Elaine's humiliation when she was brought to the strip club.The whole cast gave fantastic performances. Dustin Hoffman developed the character into a true human that anyone could relate to by being nerdy, curious, and very stubborn. Anne Bancroft brought most of the laughs to the film in her iconic role as Mrs. Robinson. She was cold yet desirable and did a brilliant job of playing a woman tortured by her mistakes during her life. Katharine Ross was the girl next door and was absolutely wonderful, she was the girl that everyone would want to marry and will always be remembered for her performance in this film.The score of this film is just as legendary as the film itself. With music from the band Simon & Garfunkel, such as Sounds of Silence and the iconic song Mrs. Robinson. The music was perfect for the film and will always be something that the film will be recognized for.Overall this is a great film, I would say a weak 9/10 just because it is slow at some parts. I would have to say I would recommend this film to everyone, I personally believe this is a film that everyone must see before they die.",The Graduate
208,hcoursen,Disjointed,6,23 September 2006,"The opening sequences are amusing and beautifully timed. Benjamin's effort to achieve a conversation with Mrs. Robinson is very funny. Benjamin's descent into his family's swimming pool is a classic. But once Benjamin meets Elaine and begins to pursue her, the film falls apart. It becomes spasmodic and radically unmotivated. There's just nothing between the two young people. Why he pursues her is unclear. Why she responds is incomprehensible. The only good two moments occur when Mr. Robinson feels insulted after Benjamin says that making it with his wife meant no more than shaking hands, and when Benjamin uses a broken cross to bar a door (to be more specific about that would be to utter a dreaded spoiler). This is a movie that runs of of ideas halfway through -- and we lose the glorious Bancroft as well!",The Graduate
209,FANatic-10,In praise of Mrs. Robinson,8,27 December 2001,"""The Graduate"" is just a wonderful film to anyone of my generation or older (I'm 43), as it truly seemed to encapsulate the feelings many of us baby boomers had as young adults.  Perhaps it is dated and underwhelming to younger viewers - time does march on - but it still holds special meaning to me.Dustin Hoffman was the perfect blank slate as Benjamin, a great debut.  A hilarious, career-making performance.  Katharine Ross also was every school boy's dream as Elaine, warm and beautiful.  But looking back now, the greatest performance is given by Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson.  Actually, I think its one of the greatest performances ever given by an actress.  This character has such undercurrents - rage, passion, sensuality, intelligence, desperation.  Anne Bancroft makes the most of the comic aspects of the role, but also gets across the pathetic nature of Mrs. Robinson in such a way that you're both appalled and sympathetic to her.  This was a female archtype in the pre-liberation 60's - a gifted, intelligent woman, ostensibly living the good life, but beaten down by ennui and a lack of options in suburbia.  Its interesting to know that Doris Day was first wooed to play her.  I could also see Angie Dickinson having been a great choice, but Bancroft really was unbeatable - she received a lot of acclaim, but not as much as her younger costars and I think she should receive her due!",The Graduate
210,Paddy-49,"A true ""Fin de siècle"" story symbolising the end, and the beginning, of an era.",8,22 February 2007,"I am the same age as Ben Braddock the Dustin Hoffman character in The Graduate so when it first came out in 1967 it was in every way a must see film. In those distant days (and despite the fame of the 60s as an era of free love) sex was rather less a matter of fact presence in your teenage years than it is today. So the older woman fantasy which Benjamin lives for real was one that most of us shared. Sadly I didn't find a Mrs Robinson to teach me and entertain me, but wish that I had! ""The Graduate"" is a film about sex and love  but quite a lot else as well. It is a true ""Fin de siècle"" story. The seductiveness and enticing allure of Anne Bancroft as the forty-something Mrs Robinson is quite brilliantly portrayed by this most excellent of actresses. She manages to separate love and sex in the same way that Benjamin does. At no point is there anything to their relationship except physical gratification  sex as recreation. When Ben tries briefly to develop something more (""Let's talk"") he is rebuffed. Mrs Robinson enjoys Benjamin and he enjoys her  but deep down they have contempt for one another. Mrs Robinson also has contempt for her husband - a dull, dim, drone of a man whose marriage to Mrs Robinson only happened because he impregnated her. No love there either.For love we need to look at the character of Elaine Robinson  beautifully played by the young Katherine Ross. She is loved not only by Benjamin but also, and crucially, by her mother. In Mrs Robinson's sad and shallow life the only good thing is Elaine. So when Benjamin dates her and (almost) instantly hits it off with her Mrs Robinson is incandescently jealous. Benjamin, her toy boy, is going to desert her for her beloved daughter. It is not the loss of Benjamin as a stud that (one suspects) worries Mrs Robinson, but the loss of her daughter. There is always another potential lover available to replace Benjamin  but she only has one daughter.The Graduate is also a revealing satire on the getting and spending society of California in the 1960s. There is money galore for the likes of the Braddocks and the Robinsons and this can be easily converted into possessions. Mr Braddock lets his guests know that Ben's diving suit cost $200 ($1200 in today's money) and his and Mr Robinson's house are vulgarly ostentatious. Ben is struggling with this conspicuous consumption and can't really be bothered to launch himself onto the gravy train  he'd rather lie in the pool and have fun with Mrs Robinson. Very Californian! The soundtrack is quite superb  not just the great Paul Simon songs but also the Dave Grusin instrumental tracks. ""The Sounds of Silence"" predates the film, but seems to be perfect for it. ""And the people bowed and prayed. To the neon god they made"". The ""neon god"" is the god of money, consumption, pretension and the certainty that, as a parent or an older person, you have the right to control others. That certainty spurs Mrs Robinson to forbid Ben to see Elaine and spurs the two Robinsons to try and force Elaine into a loveless marriage with Carl Smith  principally to spite Benjamin. That ultimately Benjamin and Elaine escape together is symbolic of the growing confidence that those of us who were of the baby boomer generation had to break free. We were the first generation not to automatically follow our parents' writ.1968, the year after The Graduate appeared, was the pivotal year of the second half of the twentieth century. It was the year of the Prague spring, of the Tet offensive, of the famously photographed summary execution of a Viet Cong officer by Nguyen Ngoc Loan, of civil rights demonstrations across the USA, of Mai Lai, of the assassination of Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy, of ""Hair"", of Humanae Vitae  and of Richard Nixon's election. ""The Graduate"" can be seen both as the end of one era as well as the beginning of another. The era of conformity, formal clothing for university students, deferential regard for parents and so on disappeared as Benjamin Braddock and Elaine Robinson eventually did their own thing  as million of young people in the west began to do the same. I was one of those and I remember it well  it was fun, and, for me, a personal Mrs. Robinson might have made it perfect. But you can't have everything!",The Graduate
211,conannz,I liked the car,5,21 February 2015,"This movie was very much a product of its times. Watching this movie 47 years after it was made is a curious experiment. I totally get why some think its a very significant film and captures the zeitgeist of 1967 and for viewers who are older and remember some of that perhaps it does.But if I may be so bold - looking at it now it is more of a curious relic where many of the elements that were significant in 1967 just look strange now.Dustin Hoffman may as well be a piece of wood throughout the whole movie. I'm not a fan of his acting and certainly his fame from this role has nothing to do with his acting skills since he really may as well have been asleep through the first half.As others have remarked the second half of the film is inexplicable and doesn't really make much sense.If the Ben character was sleep walking through the first half then having him wake up and decide to go stalk the daughter in part two of the movie might be progress but it shows he has learned nothing.In fact the character of Benjamin is perplexing all round. Surely if he has completed a 4 year degree at an Eastern university he would have some clues, some friends and some ambition but that is not in the script. Instead he is little better than a prop for his parents expectations. In 2014 if we see a character like that we would call him a loser and that is what he is.Sure there are some other elements about the film which are worth a mention and many others have remarked on this. The soundtrack, the cinematography and editing is all savvy and well done. However I think the reason why this film still resonates for many- especially older viewers is the subject matter and the exploration of what would have been taboo topics in 1967.I did like the final scene where the characters are on the bus and they seem to realise something has happened but they have no idea what.For me in 2014 however I mostly just liked the car. A classic Alfa Romeo and the biggest dramatic moment was when it was driven on the curb and nearly crashed.For those reasons this film is a flawed classic. I'm glad so many people like this film but there are much better ways to tell stories now and I'm also very glad about that.",The Graduate
212,Instant_Palmer,Best-EVER Soundtrack Sync. #1 Greatest Comedy,10,29 September 2017,"'The Graduate' is THE best movie comedy of all-time, ranking #1 on my IMDb ""Top 10 Greatest Comedies List"". The film is culturally significant and a flawless work of cinematic art.The film propelled director Mike Nichols and actor Dustin Hoffman to the top of the Hollywood A-List.For baby-boomers, this is an iconic film - a snap-shot of rapid cultural change that occurred in mid-1960s suburbia, complete with its post-college let-down, introspection, angst, and confusion.Baby boomers perceived things much differently than their Greatest Generation parents, and Nichols (along with screen-play writer Buck Henry) integrated the resulting ""generation-gap"" in a way no film had done before.Dustin Hoffman was fortunate to get the lead part as legend has it, and Nichols was fortunate to get him - both took advantage of the opportunity, and we are all fortunate they did so.The best soundtrack sync in movie history... One morning at the beginning of the film's production planning, Nichols had an epiphany about using the introspective and melancholy music of Simon & Garfunkel in the film - The resulting sound track ""music sync"" established what was then, a new standard for use of popular music as an integral part of story telling. NO film since then has done this better. Without that music sync, this would have been a fine film, but it would not have reached its legendary film status.Buck Henry's original screen-play delivers some very funny scenes - the hotel scenes running from the approximate 20 to 35 minute marks in the film are hilarious and everyone pulled it off to subtle perfection. Nichols ensured those comic moments were delivered with impeccable timing by utilizing Henry as a Day Player in the role of hotel manager.Anne Bancroft is brilliant and hot, and portrays her tragic and narcissistic character with perfection, in what has become an iconic film character.Much of the film's success is due to the performance of the ensemble cast. Nichols directs the movie like one of his stage productions where every line by every actor has impact.This is Mike Nichols' greatest and most important achievement in film, and over time has made many top 10 greatest comedy as well as all-time favorite movie lists. If one were to place slap-stick into its own separate genre (as so often the Chaplin and Marx Brothers films are cited as greatest comedies but are based largely on physical pantomime, not dialogue based comedy-drama), I believe this film is THE all-time greatest comedy in film.What else can I add that hasn't already been stated by many others?See 'The Graduate' again when the mood strikes.First timers, you are in for a treat.""Here's to you Mrs. Robinson!""🎶🍸",The Graduate
213,kirksworks,Fresh as the day it first appeared,10,1 March 2009,"I watched this for the first time in many  years and was impressed with how well it holds up.  Film technique alone still seems fresh, the montages being as much fun as I remember them.  I guess the film has become the holy grail of 1960s youth movies, the word ""plastic"" being more prescient than most of us ever expected.  Dustin Hoffman hasn't been as likable or as charming since.  It's one of Mike Nichols' best films, but beyond Hoffman and Nichols, it was Anne Bancroft who stole the show. She was just perfect.  I also noticed something I'd never paid attention to before.  There's a water metaphor carried throughout.  Ben was often seen in shots with water. He says he's 'treading water', not knowing what to do with his life.  I think Nichols used water when Ben was overwhelmed by the world of his parents and the establishment and avoids water when Ben is in control. We first see Ben after the credits, depressed, sitting in front of his fish tank.  He hangs out around the pool a lot, is given scuba gear as a birthday present.  When he comes to pick up Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine on a second date, it's raining, but a drenched Mrs. Robinson gets in his car instead of Elaine.  When he's in Berkeley, he enters his apartment to find an angry Mr. Robinson, smoking a cigar, waiting for him.  In the window behind Mr. Robinson we see it's raining. Warm scenes with no rain accompany moments when Ben is in control.  When Ben runs off with Elaine from the church at the end, it's dry as a bone. Amazing I never saw this before.The DVD has two commentary tracks, one with Dustin Hoffman and Katharine Ross, another with Mike Nichols pretty much interviewed by Steven Soderbergh.  The Hoffman Ross commentary is less interesting than you might expect. The Nichols Soderbergh track, however, is excellent.  Soderbergh is a big fan of the film and he knew exactly what to ask.  Nichols is very erudite and entertaining, filling his comments with both historical information and keen observation.  A great director for sure. And the film looks good on DVD.  I'd love to see that church where they shot the ending.  Nichols mentions that the reason Hoffman has his arms spread wide when he's banging on the glass is not a Christ symbol, as so many have suggested, but rather, the owner of the church was afraid the glass would break the way Hoffman was banging with his fists.  So Nichols asked Hoffman to bang on the window with his hands spread wide so as not to break the window.  And the last scene on the bus with Hoffman and Ross was a single take. Nichols made them nervous and put the pressure on since they only had the bus for enough time to do a single take.  That uneasy look they give each other comes from their nervousness at Nichols demanding they be great. But after viewing it, Nichols realized the uneasiness in their expressions was something that would elevate the film from a feel good ending to something perhaps a bit more profound.  Indeed it does. When I was younger I didn't like that they weren't totally happy at the end, but now I think it really gives weight to the whole idea of the film.  Where are they going now?  What will they become?  Copies of their parents?  Just excellent.",The Graduate
214,tripper0,not as good as I expected it to be.....,6,14 May 2002,"****CONTAINS SPOILERS****I sat down to watch this movie, and I thought that it was going to be something special.  It started off that way.  Dustin Hoffman is great as confused youth Benjamin Braddock.  His performance is really the only reason I kept on watching this movie.  The best part of this movie is the first forty minutes or so, mostly focusing on Mrs.Robinson(Anne Bancroft) and Ben.  The early scenes which show her confidence and his nervousness and inexperience are funny and honest.  They are perfectly played out and directed.  A memorable scene is Ben getting a hotel room under a fake name, and claiming to have luggage in the car, only to reveal it as a toothbrush.  Hoffman is extremely funny, and is a character you really feel for.  After that, however, the script starts seeming more fragmented, the characters and character development become less important, and everything starts to just happen and all becomes rather silly.  His rash decision, and quick love for Mrs.Robinson's daughter, Elaine, is never developed.  The soundtrack is also repetative, and this becomes quite annoying. 
The last scene in the movie was okay.  What I realize now, however, is how well ""Wayne's World 2"" parodies it.  It was an okay movie, but Mrs.Robinson didn't seduce me, all though she tried.  6.5 out of 10.",The Graduate
215,tresdodge,A classic of all classics,10,1 November 2004,"A scholar (Dustin Hoffman) returns to his suburban middle class home after completing his academic studies much to the admiration of family and friends. However, now out of education, he no longer wants to be the golden boy who can do no wrong, instead, he contemplates his future while endlessly lounging by the pool, drinking beer and more importantly sleeping with Mrs Robinson the wife of one of his parents friends. This film is wonderful, it has everything a classic needs, excellent acting, superb dialogue, a unique style and fine music. Hoffman's character appeals to the rebellious streak in all of us, that of turning our back on responsibility and throwing caution to the wind.Anne Bancroft is extremely good as Mrs Robinson, flaunting her sexuality to an 'innocent' inexperienced young man. In addition Elaine Robinson is played very well by Katherine Ross who looks extremely beautiful on screen.Great movie, which I will never grow bored of no matter how many times I see it!",The Graduate
216,dixxjamm,I have one word for you : PLASTICS,10,7 April 2006,"What a ride....This is a perfect example of what art can generate if one puts soul and wit into it. Firstly, I find human emotions and life issues depicted in a bitter-comic manner to be a charming combination.Love,sex,insecurity,family relationships,shyness,deception are treated with great humor and witty dialog in this movie.Long and elaborated shots,incredible story-telling creativity (like 1-st person camera views,long still frames,distance frames),video-clip like sequences (beautifully sustained by Simon and Garfunkel's heart-warming poetry and sad irony).There is enough creative film work in The Graduate to suffice for 10 movies.The dialog is excellent and the acting pure genius.And, oh...the time frame...the sixties...don't get me started.The 2000's are like an insurance seminar compared to that... No need to praise this movie anymore, it speaks for itself.It is not,however,a movie for the masses.This is no Ben-Hur type of flick,with spectacular imagery and epic storyline.It is an epic of the inner soul.It requires a bit of meditation, it is only entertaining if you get in touch with your inner self and not expect to watch the screen and BE entertained. Despite its comic appearance,I always felt that it touched a sensitive somehow sad chord in me.It's kinda like:""Haha very funny, but I felt those type of emotions and they didn't seem funny then.""It's also so easy to laugh at other people's feelings,torments and emotions, but when you realize that you are also part of that old human comedy and drama, your laughing becomes more restrained.More mature.I always connected with this movie, and with Mike Nichols.Too bad they don't make'em like this anymore.We live in an era where people like John Woo and Michael Bay are starting to dictate what we will be watching more and more.What a shame....",The Graduate
217,matteveland95,"Seductive, funny, enticing, ridiculous.",7,9 January 2019,"Watching this for the first time in 2019- I can say for certain these actions by the main character would be completely sketchy and ridiculous in today's time. I found Benjamin to be completely absurd in his actions and his overall behavior to be ridiculous, unrealistic. The women truly shined in this film, both lead lady's sparked my interest and had me imagining my place with them, they are the real reason to watch this film. I throughly enjoy the reversal of roles in which a women stakes her claim and presents herself decisively. Elaine is truly beautiful and Mrs. Robinson is as well, It is tough to determine my own outcome in this situation. Though Dustin Hoffman could have played it a lot cooler- the women picked up where he fell inadequate. Both women deserve to be loved.",The Graduate
218,uroshnor54,Unconvincing,3,2 May 2017,"I can't say I connected with this movie either on its comic level or on its dramatic level. I'm giving this two stars because I liked the soundtrack (although I thought both ""Sound of Silence"" and ""Scarborough Fair"" were repeated a few too many times) and the cinematography. The characters and story I didn't care for at all.If I had to describe this movie in one word, it would be ""unconvincing."" Most of the characters' actions seemed to have weak or nonexistent motivations. Why does Mrs. Robinson admit to Benjamin that she married her husband because of an unplanned pregnancy? Why does he hate her so much when she tells him to stay away from her daughter? Why do he and Elaine suddenly fall in love after not seeing each other in years? Why does he suddenly want to marry her? Why does she suddenly want to marry him?As others have pointed out, the awkward and unfocused behavior of the main character does not seem consistent with what we find out about him at the start of the film, which is that he has won academic awards and is also a successful athlete. This movie reminded me of one of my favorite books, The Catcher in the Rye. Both stories are about young men who don't quite know what they're doing with themselves and both have a kind of ambiguous ending. The difference between Holden Caulfield and Benjamin is that Holden's behavior throughout the book makes sense given what we already know about him. At the start, we know he's an academic failure and holds many of the people (especially the adults) he knows in contempt.Some people hate the book, because of Holden Caulfield's constant whining and complaining. But J. D. Salinger didn't mean for the reader to think of him as a hero. We are supposed to see Holden as a bit of a whiner. Some people will find him endearing and will see his whining more as understandable observations about life. Others won't, and that's okay. But I'm a bit confused about how we're supposed to view Benjamin. Is he a hero or an antihero? Are we supposed to sympathize with him in the end, when he runs off with a married woman, essentially on a whim? I think that the answer to the second one is no (we're supposed to infer, I think, that Benjamin and Elaine might end up in the same situation as Mr. and Mrs. Robinson), but that the answer to the first is the former - no character who is meant to be sympathetic reproaches him and he doesn't seem to ever have any moments of serious self-awareness. We're supposed to accept that he makes mistakes, but never think that he's obnoxious or unpleasant. One of the big problems with The Graduate is that we find out very little about Benjamin's worldview. Holden accomplishes very little by the end of The Catcher in the Rye, but we at least know what he thinks about just about everything. Benjamin says he is concerned about his future, and the movie would have been more interesting if this concern had been highlighted throughout it, but it's forgotten after Benjamin starts his affair with Mrs. Robinson.Also, this is supposed to be a comedy and I'll admit that I didn't think it was funny. The only part that made me crack a smile was when Benjamin and Elaine run away from her wedding and he uses a cross to fend off her parents, her fiancé (who is actually her husband at that point), and the guests, and uses it to bolt the church doors. But comedy is highly subjective, obviously, so other people may have found this movie to be quite humorous. Lastly, I think I should assure anyone reading this and thinking I disliked the movie because of prudish concerns, that isn't the case.",The Graduate

220,florida87,Pivotal Film For 1967,6,8 June 2005,"You've got to love The Graduate. It really craps all over the traditional family of the 1960's whose kids are getting out of the house. The mid to late 60's was just such a pivotal time in America. A whole lot of things were turned on their heads regarding the family, alcohol use, drug use, gender bias, age bias, racism, and whatever else you could think of from a leftist point of view. Certainly The Graduate fits into that mold. I did really enjoy the movie though but looking back isn't it just sooooo far fetched? I was thinking of this film because of Ms. Bancroft's passing, I mean she is just any guy's fantasy (at least she was mine in this film). A hot middle aged woman who wants no strings attached sex on the fly. I mean that really sells for a teenager, or younger man as a selling point to watch. So we have this film that just craps all over middle aged traditional grownups (they're all alcoholic cheaters, bored with their suburban lifestyles, etc etc), and it has our glorified ending where the two young lovers in pure bliss go off in the sunset on a bus. Gotta love the pure fantasy this movie sold us, and hey I'll be the first to say I bought it all the way. But I just realized when I saw Ms. Bancroft's age at her death she is just 5 years older than Hoffman in real life! I mean she's playing a woman 15 years older than herself in real life and Hoffman's playing someone 10 years younger! Definitely a good sell there (I bought it), but than again it was that guy fantasy we had where we WANTED a late 40ish woman to look 15 years younger in our fantasy. They were going to make a sequel to this film, called ""The Post Graduate"". It's where Benjamin and Katherine get off the bus in San Francisco, and get married. She pumps out a couple of kids, finds out her husband had done her mother and turns really really bitter. Mrs Robinson shows up and Benjamin and Mrs Robinson split for Las Vegas (on a bus). The script's out there so it may still happen (along with the alternate 3 way ending and spin off TV show ""My Two Mom's""), unfortunately sexy Ms Bancroft won't be in it, so I'll pass when it comes out.",The Graduate
221,garrettderose,The pinnacle of Rom-Coms,9,24 August 2009,"I admit I was a bit shocked when I rented The Graduate. The first thing I did was look at the back of the DVD box. I saw a ""PG"" rating. I was wondering how a movie about an extramarital affair between a young man and an older woman could receive such a rating. I'm still confused to this day.This doesn't sway me, though. The Graduate is worthy of it's high acclaim. Ben, played by young Dustin Hoffman is really awkward on screen. This doesn't take away from the film though. He successfully plays how I felt when I lived back home. When grandparents came from out of town to visit. ""What do you want to do with your life?"" - I ran from those questions, just as Ben does in the film. His family and their upper-class friends are bent on him succeeding and going to grad school to make his career. Ben just wants to be. That's it. He has a hard time making connections with people, and it turns out the first real connection he has with anybody is the wife of his father's co-worker. This sets the stage for some sequences of extreme awkwardness. I loved every second of it. Dustin Hoffman's quirk and boyish charm is unmatched by most characters in the Rom-Com genre.If you've at a time ever felt threatened by your parents expectations, or the pressure to be something in society that you're not - you might make a strong connection with this film.The cinematography was great. The music was FANTASTIC. The whole soundtrack was done by Simon and Garfunkel. I was a little hesitant at first, I thought it would be a bit too much. It really sets in after about a hour through.I can't get the scuba-in-the-pool scene out of my head.

224,carljessieson,A Great Classic,9,29 September 2010,"First of all, I completely understand why this film is a classic. It's the story of a young college graduate, uncertain about his future, beginning an affair with a tempting older, married woman. It's an interesting plot, a dirty one. That's what makes it so interesting.Dustin Hoffman does a great job playing the character of Benjamin. All of his mannerisms, his words, his facial expressions work together to create a young college graduate perfect for this film. Bancroft is excellent in her role as well, as a seductive, bitter housewife. I really believe every actor did a great job in his or her role, I was impressed.Another thing I really loved about the movie is the soundtrack. I wouldn't say I'm particularly a fan of Simon and Garfunkel, but after seeing this movie, I'm considering purchasing some of their music. The way it complemented the scenes, the mood it set, was extraordinary. I really loved it. I always think it's cool when movies have just one artist making the soundtrack, because their sound becomes synonymous with the message of the film somehow. Every time I hear a song from a movie, I really want to go watch that movie, and I feel like that's what's going to happen anytime I hear some Simon and Garfunkel. I'm looking forward to it, it was really great. :) The plot is really interesting. I thought the film was only about this affair, but it evolved into more than that. It evolved into a love story, and I really was not expecting that. The only weird thing to me was how quickly and easily things happened or were resolved. Some characters seem to get a little crazy and obsessive by the end, but maybe that's just the portrait of love Nichols was going for. Hah.There are a lot of good scenes and filming techniques that make this movie a huge joy to watch. I was entertained the whole time and I laughed a lot. I definitely recommend it and would love to add it to my collection someday. :)",The Graduate
225,compi24,"Review Of ""The Graduate""",9,26 January 2012,"""The Graduate"" is a 1967 film directed by Mike Nichols and starring Dustin Hoffman. The film tells a story of a young somber graduate student (who knew) who finds himself tangled up in an affair with his father's business partner's wife. Now, first off, I've heard nothing but great things about this movie. I heard that Hoffman was great in it, it had a great story, soundtrack, dialogue, etc. I can say that after everything I heard, this film definitely lived up to it's hype. The film is almost half a century old and yet I found myself (a generation Z college student) relating to it in a myriad of incredible ways. The fact that this film stands strong after an immense amount of time is, in my honest opinion, the most impressive aspect of the film. Dustin Hoffman is arguably the greatest actor in the business and he's in this movie - it's common knowledge that he's going to be good in it. All of the characters in this film were well written and well portrayed as well. Even the side characters were well-written. The script, in general, seems to be the epitome of good writing. The soundtrack is written by two of my most favorite artists - Simon And Garfunkel. Needless to say, it's timeless and unforgettable. The ending of the film was really well done, and the direction altogether seemed to be executed with the utmost precision. There were even a few editing techniques that impressed me in this film. Overall, ""The Graduate"" is a film that truly impressed me. Every person that was at once a student (pretty much everybody) should see and identify with this film. Really good stuff here.",The Graduate
226,brainofj72,Not Quite The Classic It's Claimed To Be,6,1 August 2006,"I recently read an interview with Roger Ebert in which he was asked if there were any films he had changed his opinion on over the years. He named The Graduate as a film he didn't like nearly as much as he used to. I think that says a lot about The Graduate.It is an intentionally comedic drama about a recent college graduate (Dustin Hoffman) who returns home and sinks himself into a comfortable rut involving nightly hotel rendezvous' with an attractive older woman (Anne Bancroft), but when her daughter, who is much closer to his age, returns home, he falls for her, and a chaotic mess of twisted emotions ensues.The film plays out like a teenager's wet dream. Hoffman's character has rich parents, almost no responsibility, and nightly sex with no strings attached. But director Mike Nichols tries to present it in such a way that Hoffman's character is bored out of his mind  typical youth. This section of the film is one of the best depictions of the emptiness and anxiety of casual sex that I have ever seen. It is wonderfully heightened by the excellent accompanying Simon & Garfunkel.However, the film loses a lot of steam when the daughter enters the picture. We are supposed to believe that Hoffman's character falls in love with her, but I must admit that I felt no real connection between the characters and no real chemistry between the actors. It felt like the writer just needed to throw in something to cause some conflict in the story, so he simply threw in an underdeveloped relationship with the daughter. The whole thing seems to be a cheap attempt at depth, but it just comes off as shallow.And then we come to the film's often-parodied ending in which Hoffman's character breaks up the daughter's wedding and runs away with her. I found the whole thing to be rather underwhelming. There is no real love between these characters  they're just a couple of young people being compulsive.I also must say that I didn't think the comedy element of the film worked very well at all. It just wasn't very funny, and I don't see why it was necessary.However, the film does have strength in Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft, who are both simply wonderful here. The juxtaposition of their characters alone is fascinating enough  a young, naïve man who yearns for a meaningful relationship, but can't resist his hormonal urges, and a hardened, somewhat bitter older woman who simply wants to cut out the arbitrary, for lack of a better term, bullshit and get to the carnality. But Hoffman and Bancroft inject a genuine life into these characters that no one else could have. All the Simon & Garfunkel was a big plus for me, as well.Overall, The Graduate has the potential to be an introspective drama about the emptiness of sex and the confliction of attraction, but it is squandered on a juvenile and rushed romantic twist.",The Graduate
227,awlauter,"outstanding film, one of the best ever",10,20 February 2001,"I have probably seen the Graduate 4 or 5 times and haven't tired of it in the least. Hoffman gives a tour de force performance as a naive college grad who is seduced by a friend of his parents and ends up falling in love with her daughter. As almost everyone probably knows, the soundtrack is by Simon and Garfunkel and in my mind,is terrific and couldn't be more appropriate for the movie.

I wasn't around back then but it still feels fresh. Benjamin Braddock played by Dustin Hoffman is home after graduating college. He's got no idea what to do with his future, all his dad's friends are congratulating him but he's just ""Blah"". The Robinson's are friends with the Braddocks. Mrs Robinson played by Anne Bancroft is going through a midlife crisis and bored with her marriage. Soon we get the infamous hilarious scene ""Are you trying to seduce me Mrs Robinson?"" and the awkward touching of her breasts. The affair goes on for awhile then Mr Robinson sets Benjamin up with their daughter Elaine. Mrs Robinson is beyond upset so much so that she tells her husband and Elaine. Elaine is all set to marry another guy but Benjamin shows up at the wedding and goes psycho. Elaine leaves with Ben and they ride off on a public bus together as the credits role.

229,ArthurDental,Overrated,7,24 December 2002,"I don't know if critics have a different sense of humor, but I really don't know how some films are classified ""comedies."" Take this film. There were two or three laughing-out-loud scenes, but that's it. At best it's a drama that, as a few others have pointed out, starts off brilliantly but fades out about a third of the way through. The problem is the ending, and what led to it, was inexplicable and cliched. Ben and Elaine had just a date, half of it probably wasted by Ben's cruel behaviors, before he decided he wants to get married. Despite Mrs. Robinson's warning against his going out with her daughter, I don't see how Ben's feeling for the her just dropped out of the picture. Well, actually, the moral is that when the man finds what he can have, he can and should go after it.That's the bigger problem with ""The Graduate."" I don't like being a morality cop but this films suddenly turned Mrs. Robinson out to be the villain, whereas Ben's role in the destruction of the Robinsons' family left no dirt on him. Elaine was also apparently not very mature - she easily agrees to marriage proposals.It just seems obvious this movie was made in a different era. Doing basically the same things, the woman is the villain, the man the hero. He gets the girl, she the blame.So is this one of the best films ever?

Even today, young people are challenging their guardians more and more on life, love and the pursuit of happiness. My spouse and I eloped at age 21 and 20 respectively, and have been married 33 years now. Although, we eloped five years after this movie was made, and there would be an argument this movie had a profound effect on our lives, I would argue that point. I know there was no thought in my mind at the time relative to this movie, and I can't speak for the better half. Yet, this was an important movie about relationships and sex.Making this movie special is the music of Simon and Garfunkel so beautifully carved into the movie, the first of many running scenes for Dustin Hoffman, a stellar performance by Anne Bancroft, the interplay of emotions between Bancroft and Hoffman, and the message about plastics, which turned out more real than even the business community at that time and in the next fifteen years would know.

The cast, the direction by Mike Nichols, the screenplay, the soundtrack, are all PERFECT. If the role had gone to Robert Redford, would it still have meant as much? Dustin Hoffman was brilliant, and so believable as the unsure,awkward, and stressed out Ben Braddock that imagining another actor in that role is impossible.  While all the cast was great, it was Hoffman that made it what it was!  Tippi Hedren or Kim Novak probably could have been adequate Mrs. Robinsons, many other young actresses could have played Elaine, but Dustin Hoffman WAS Benjamin Braddock! The film has humour, and is basically a dark comedy, but I think its greatness lies in its drama. The film appeals to the Ben Braddock in all of us.

I am sure most of the pages of the screenplay were describing everythingthe camera movementsets and expressions but dialogues. You can see Rainman's Hoffman also in the movie. The treatment of the movie was the best thing about it. The story was simple but the way every scene is developed, it brings the best possible out of the simple story. The story at first looks to be one of a chic flick but the treatment makes it a classic. Simon & Garfunkel's music in the background also fill the silence well.The climax of the movie is also not what you see very often in Hollywood movies but goes well with the movie and it was fun to watch Hoffman in such a role. Watching it with a bunch of friends for double fun.",The Graduate
236,jeffronthi,Coming of Age Done Masterfully,9,5 April 2015,"I am glad they let the film breathe, showing Ben in transitional, but critical, moments. The film just sort of envelops you, even when nothing is happening. The soundtrack was a perfect way to place you in the sentimental ""drift zone"" with Ben. It is then that you come to really connect with his melancholy. Who hasn't been on the edge of the unknown, sort of shut in by fear or ambivalence? And the ending! Kind of says it all, doesn't it?A fine, fine performance by Dustin Hoffman, even if he was ten years Ben's senior at the time. One of the few films in history that lives up to its gargantuan hype. Check it out if you're a film buff.",The Graduate
237,nunoaraujoduarte,movieinthepark.blogspot.com,8,28 August 2011,"Mike Nichols didn't earn my esteem. At least until I saw The Graduate. Locked and forgotten below movies such as Closer or Charlie Wilson's War, this one comes out very comic and surprisingly interesting. I pictured a annoying drama and a so-called comedy but maybe by accident, it ain't. The Graduate introduces you Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman). He's a twenty year-old who's just graduated and is very unsure about his future. His parents throw a party, inviting all their friends. Suddenly, a Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), married to a business partner of Ben's father, asks Ben to drive her home. Later at her home, she tries to seduce Ben. She eventually succeeds, but Ben falls in love... with her daughter(Katharine Ross). The topic is quite silly actually, but the movie is very enjoyable. A little less than two hours, though it could a little bit shorter, as it has one of the silliest endings of the story of the cinema. And I mean it. Dustin Hoffman does a very impressing job. Definitely my favourite between all his roles. Again, awesome music, that I think to have been written specifically to this movie, written by Paul Simon, performed by the same plus Art Garfunkel. It's very good. Go figure, its single knocked The Beatles' White Album out of the charts top. Won one Oscar for the directing, and earned three other nominations, for each of the three main actors. 8/10",The Graduate
238,dimbost,A fake Classic that doesn't make sense,4,30 May 2015,"I am huge movie buff and usually am very kind to all films, but have to point out the fact that the film doesn't make any sense or have any serious character development.The Story is extremely fast and inconsistent. We meet Ben (Hoffman) who is shown to be a shy and an introvert,He just graduated and is a prize student with a brilliant future. At his Celebration party Mrs. Robinson a family friend asks Ben to take her home, there she tries to seduce this extremely shy, introverted virgin. She doesn't succeed but plant the idea and Ben falls for it. They began to have an affair. Meanwhile Mr.Robinson is trying to set up his daughter (who doesn't have many friends) with Ben, who has no interest her, then when his parents also get involved he decides to amuse his parents and not get in an uncomfortable situation with his mistress and his parents. At the same time Mrs. Robinson states very clearly that she doesn't want him to date her daughter, but pushes to more of a reason then just not sharing her young meat with her daughter. After putting Elaine through the worst date he apologizes and falls for her in a matter of seconds, as she does for him. Then the whole story falls apart, Ben goes from Introvert to an extrovert, Elaine goes from a shy and innocent ""Pure"" like girl goes to a socially confident woman who has friends and a boyfriend. Ben after losing Elaine to the truth, decides his only choice is to marry her. Elaine who had 1 date with Ben and falls in love with him, doesn't tell him about her other boyfriend who proposed to her. When Elaine's parents find out about Ben's plan to marry her, they decide to marry her off to her boyfriend the next day. Question implies, why did Elaine fall for a Jerk? a guy who was having an affair with a married woman. and later a guy who was accused of raping her mother. But bigger question is why did she agree to getting married to the other guy and going through with it, if she loved Ben? The film might be a classic due to its Acting, Dustin Hoffman was brilliant as a 20-21 year old shy graduate student, and more importantly Anne Bancroft was simply amazing as the much older mother, (she is actually only 6 years older the Hoffman) but the story lacked gravity and emotion, it lacked logic and timing. So this was just a fake classic that people loved for the idea of being forgiven and the idea that true love conquers all.",The Graduate
239,MicheBel,A Perception Problem,8,30 December 1998,"Actually, what this movie communicated to me, better than any other movie I can think of, is not about the older woman sex thing. It's the way everyone has their own perception of a situation, and quite often, they don't hear what the others are saying, so wrapped up are they in their own worlds. Plastics, my friend. Plastics, indeed.I also love how the three leads are, in reality, about the same age. A cosmic Hollywood joke.",The Graduate
240,YellowManReanimated,Rebel Without a Destination,10,22 August 2021,"Ostensibly, the plotline of The Graduate is remarkably simple. A young man graduates from university. Unsure of what to do with his life, he ends up drifting into having an affair with an older woman. He then develops affections for the older woman's daughter, and, after a series of hurdles, ends up eloping with her. By merely analysing the concrete plot elements, we would have an edgy, quirky romantic comedy on our hands in which the hero gets the girl at the end and all is right with the world. Throw into the mix an iconic Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack, an acerbic and fantastically quotable script, utterly stand-out performances from Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft, some genuinely brilliant montage editing and evocative use of close-ups and shadow, not to mention the experimental sound design (go back and listen to the sound design during the scuba-diving scene, this is something Kubrick would clearly explore further in the following year's 2001) and you've also got a slick, technically brilliant cinematic treat on your hands. And yet all of this merely scratches the surface.In many ways, the essence of this film is not revealed until the final scene. Anyone who has watched it will remember the two star-crossed lovers' looks of ultimate triumph suddenly and painfully morphing into uncertainty, confusion and, finally, defeat. In what is the most jarring, unsettling and brilliant ending to a film I've ever seen, we are exposed to the hollowness that lies within not just the film's protagonists, but in the fruitlessness of their and an entire generations' endeavour. Ben has his girl, she has been rescued by him, but both of them have no idea what to do next. Their motivation was driven by a pursuit of the forbidden, their meaning came from rebelling against those who told them what they could and could not do. Their rebellion has been successful, but what do they do now there's nothing left to rebel against?This is the conundrum that was faced for all those who wished to turn society on its head during this era. No doubt there was plenty to rebel against: racism, women's oppression, homophobia, environmental degradation and the Vietnam war, just to name a few examples. Naturally, by challenging these attitudes and the practices which stemmed from them, the '60s represented a major era of social progress. But that wasn't enough for some. For this reborn, idyllic, radical generation remedialism was not the goal, there was a real sense that total social transformation could be achieved and that, fundamentally, it was love that would lie at the heart of this transformation and it was love that would save and redeem us all.The Graduate shows us that a passion strongly held does not always lead to positive or even meaningful outcomes. During the infamous wedding scene, the previous generation is defeated, the young '60s heroes, Ben and Elaine, escape. But they end up hitting a dead end. They've gone too far in their rejection of their community (read society). There's no more road to run. The path to utopia turns out to be the path to no place at all.",The Graduate
241,sunshinebeachcinema,A treatise on the nature of being a graduate,8,30 September 2013,"In following up those cinematic classics that I'm somehow still catching up on, I recently saw The Graduate for the first time. I inevitably went into it with some idea of what was going to happen, but little more than an expectation for Dustin Hoffman to pursue a relationship with an older woman, to the sound of Simon & Garfunkel.Hoffman is Benjamin Braddock, the disaffected young university graduate who returns from his studies to a summer without direction. He is swiftly seduced by Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's business partner, and embarks on a lengthy affair, but his affection soon turns to her daughter, Elaine. Yet this is merely the bare bones of the plot: it's more complex than a simple romantic comedy, and the ending, notably, is ambiguous.It's impossible to complain about spoilers for a film that came out over forty years ago; it has seeped into popular culture, and been subjected to merciless parody. The iconic ending sequence is especially strange to watch for someone who grew up repeatedly watching Wayne's World 2 (1993), where it is replicated shot for shot.The critical eye has been on the film for so long, and it has passed through so many generations that its contemporary relevance can be questioned. Though a product of the late 1960s, the counterculture elements we associate with the period, such as free love, psychedelia, or hard rock. Benjamin's sexual experiences are not part of a revolution, and he remains trapped firmly within the rigid framework of upper middle class suburbia.While there's a certain fascination to looking back on a snapshot of the past, many of us no longer have the same relationship with our parents and the older generation. Do we look back at a history of steady liberalisation, but no massive social upheaval, and see further subversion as unnecessary? Do our parents, the children of the past, simply provide us with a system we no longer need to escape? Maybe modern youth have it worse than Benjamin; our coming of age is not so straightforward. We are no longer afforded the opportunity of clear rebellion, and are left to wallow in the established structure.What does hold true is the portrayal of a graduate with no clear future, returning to inhabit the fading skeleton of a life that's somehow no longer his own, and the dull resignation that there's little incentive to do anything about it. As a graduate myself (Though my current social circle suffers an absence of attractive lonely women) I can largely sympathise with Benjamin's predicament.After all, what does the immediate future hold? The prospects of the graduate are numerous and varied. Will it be more of the same on a postgraduate course? Are we heading for the city for a mysterious role as an analyst or consultant (when we're really just brewing tea for executives)? Perhaps it's just going to be a couple more months playing video games in pyjamas before we make a final decision.We still need something. A last hurrah before we're thrown to the world of work and responsibility for good. Could the modern rebellion be merely the fabled gap year abroad? At any rate, it seems coming of age requires something extreme, ditching the world and obligations, the way that Benjamin does at the end of The Graduate. The whole film is an exploration of these questions, symbolically relayed through the central relationships. The choices the characters make in their attachments are reflective of the choices that can be made in all facets of life.This is emphasised stylistically through a number of visually captivating shots and transitions that underline the sense of emptiness and alienation. Water (swimming pools, aquariums, and rain) appears frequently as a tool of separation. The soundtrack contains little youthful euphoria, but is melancholic, featuring repeated motifs that again, accentuate loneliness.These are played during moments that could otherwise be seen as positive steps in Benjamin's life, at the height of his relationship with Mrs. Robinson, and during his final elopement, elevating the drama above mere comedy.His obsession with Elaine is far from romantic destiny, and exists primarily as an escape from his relationship with her mother, and a chance to give his life some purpose outside an unhealthy liaison that makes him feel increasingly trapped. Compared with Mrs. Robinson, Elaine's character is chronically underdeveloped, though she responds positively to Benjamin's pseudo-philosophical ramblings.While she is disgusted to learn of Benjamin's affair with her mother, we learn little else of her thoughts on home, and where she fits in do the loveless dynamic in the Robinson household. We do not know if she as desperate to break free as Benjamin is. She ultimately follows him on impulse, having initially been happy to marry another at her parents' request.The separation from the character of Elaine forces us to experience the relationship purely from the perspective of Benjamin, who has put her on a pedestal and made her the object of his salvation.Despite the vein of sympathy I have as a fellow graduate, Benjamin is at times an insufferable and frustrating character to watch, and ultimately, Mrs. Robinson comes off as more sympathetic. She is the one who is truly lost and trapped. Benjamin still has his whole life ahead of him, once he finally decides what he's going to do with it.",The Graduate

245,souther02,Coming of age or dragged in,10,21 December 2010,"Finally I've seen it. One of the most authentic films ever made. I guess at the date of release on a lot of movies, and am usually within 2 or 3 years. But I was off by 5 years, and the Hoffman film with a colossal cast of supporting actors was in theaters in 1967. Totally and thoroughly enjoyed this movie which felt like a cultural predecessor of the ""me era"". If Mrs. Robinson(Elaine's mother) was not the epitome of a selfish, sad, hateful and probably scorned woman, I don't know who ever was. I don't think any of the assorted cast from ""Bewitched"" were that way(there were several at the party at the hotel). I get the idea that the Robinsons were loaded and Ben's family was not. It was difficult to grasp that concept. Shortly after coming home from school, Ben met the elder Mrs. Robinson and it looked like Ben picked up the tab for the room. This was a nice hotel. A lot of movies made at that time did not ever get transferred, and it's very cool to see the archives or things of days gone by. Like that hotel. Motels usually worked well for me in my late teens.Ben's parents see their son lounging about ""a few weeks"" after he graduates from college. They worry he will not get on with their life. Ben has a new playmate, and the arrangement is one that makes him happy despite the fact that his girlfriend/lover has become very possessive. This emotion plays an important part later in the movie. None of the humor in The Graduate is silly or shallow. The things that Ben says to his elders is at times direct and obvious, a little ingratiating(to them) and sometimes sarcastic. Screenplay in terms of scene changes is fresh and new--nothing I see in more recent or modern movies competes well with the movie in that sense of direction. I only now see there were seven Oscar nominations and one win for Best Director. There were more than one light in the thoughtful movie besides Dustin Hoffman-- the other one who's movies have lasted are Katharine Ross, who was in Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid.",The Graduate

247,henryonhillside,Five Viewings; Five Different Reactions,5,22 December 2015,"1. I first watched this film in 1968 when I was 12 years old. I didn't understand anything about it other than the music, which I loved. Later that year I ran out and bought ""Bookends"" by Simon & Garfunkel, and the album got me through junior high school alive. (The best song on the album IMO is ""At the Zoo,"" a mostly-forgotten classic that hasn't been played on an FM station in 40 years.) 2. I next watched the film in 1973. I was 17. I fell in love with Katharine Ross and remain enamored to the present day.3. Next time I watched the movie was in 1976 when I was 20. I loved it, I felt, with all the fervor and angst of a college lit. student, that it summarized and articulated my life, i.e., what's it all about? Plastics? Really? OMG.4. I next watched it in 1981 and found it enjoyable, watchable, somewhat dated, not accurate about the '60s.5. I watched it today, December of 2015. It seems radically dated and essentially unwatchable. The thought crosses my mind: it's the most over-rated ""cool"" film of the '60s; it is to the '60s what ""It Happened One Night"" is to the '30s, i.e., I guess you had to be there. It has a lot to do with being a smart graduate of Williams College in the late '50s and early '60s (the author of the novel, Charles Webb, is Williams Class of '61) but very little to do with the middle and late '60s and nothing whatsoever to do with Berkeley in the '60s when political engagement was robust. The sensibility is a hip '50s sensibility (i.e., a Mike Nichols sensibility) and besotted with its cuteness.I was surprised by this latest reaction. I look forward to watching the film again in a few years and seeing if I feel the same way.Memo to Benjamin Braddock - get your own apartment, dude; everyone else in the '60s was, why not you? (The answer, as noted, is because he's in a '50s film rather than a '60s film.) Memo to Mrs. Robinson - smoke some weed, mama. (Every rich hip suburban lady circa 1968 who was unhappy in her marriage, craved sex, and lived in a college town was smoking weed.) Memo to Elaine - grow up. (In the second half of the '60s, young women like you were breaking loose, reading Cosmopolitan, smashing conventions, and going for it.)",The Graduate
248,stephparsons,"Creative, compelling & classic",8,12 May 2013,"You've gotta love The Graduate.  Even after 44 years, it's still relevant, highly watchable, funny, a titchy bit avant-garde, and boasts a top notch, flawless script.  Dustin Hoffman as Ben does a bang up job playing the hapless graduate who desperately wants to escape his boring, careerist fate (as predetermined by  his parents and society at large).  He exudes 'sullen-youth-ness', boredom-with-life, naiveté, awkwardness and an (almost) 'aspergers' style of speech which are amusing and poignant.  Despite all the drama that unfolds; the seduction followed by the 'coming-of-age' sex with an older woman, the falling in love with a fresh, vibrant young woman, The Graduate is, ultimately, a film about ennui; that dull, thudding, inexorable grind we face upon leaving school and being forced to 'decide what to do' for the rest of our sad, pathetic , predictable lives.  Career paths being far more restrictive in the '60s,  the sense of doom and pointlessness that Ben feels is exacerbated and he portrays it so very well.   The friend of his parents who says, ""I have one word for you Ben...plastics"", sums up the soulless, futile, and arid future that Ben fears is his destiny. The Graduate experiments successfully with some creative cinematography including unusual camera angles, and interesting switches from one milieu to another e.g. Ben jumping into the swimming pool but ending up on the bed with Mrs Robinson.   The swimming pool scene where Ben must walk under water in his birthday present - an old fashioned diving suit- is especially memorable and provides a convincing metaphor for the restrictiveness, loneliness and entrapment that he fears is to be his fate.  There is nothing 'awkward' or dated about this classic film, it holds one's attention from start to finish.  The ending steers clear of that typical 'happily ever after' Hollywood schmaltz  and, in subtle tones presents us with 'ennui in a nutshell' as Ben and Elaine exchange smiles, then worried looks, and then expressions devoid of all emotion.  There is nothing I would change about The Graduate, it's a classic and always will be.",The Graduate

With Dustin Hoffman's incredible performance, excellent soundtrack, and an entertaining and funny plot, this movie has something else.Some elements of this movie may seem clichés, but we only think this way, because we see it in almost every romantic comedy, but these new movies were all inspired by this one, witch makes it a classic, and should not be missed by any movie lover, Hoffman's performance is outstanding, his turn from an dumb, let's say teenager, to an real adult, is very well made, and wouldn't be as good without Hoffman. The supporting cast, although doesn't shine like Dustin, is great too, the scenes where people overreact are probably, the funniest scenes in the film (Like when Ben tells his mom he's getting married).Probably the most acclaimed element of the film, is it's soundtrack, that is all made by Simon and Gartfunkel, which means, it's one of the best of all time.Verdict: Even if you're not a romantic comedy fan, you'll have to see this one, it's a classic, it's funny, it's Dustin Hoffman!",The Graduate

254,FilmWiz,`The Graduate' graduates Hoffman from amateur actor to a great professional.,10,17 June 2003,"The Graduate, a 1967 film directed by Mike Nichols is a wonderful film starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), a graduate from Berkley college has just arrived back home to find that there is a graduation party for him. He feels a little down throughout the entirety of the party and then he meets up with Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft). She asks if he could take her home in his new car, as she cannot drive. When they get to her house, we learn that she has known Ben for his entire life and that her husband is Mr.  Braddock's boss. They have a few drinks and then go up to her room, where she gets undress. (`Can you get that zipper for me Benjamin?') Ben thinks he is trying to be seduced and is frightened out of his wits. What would happen if Mr. Robinson came home? Mrs. Robinson goes to the bathroom and she undresses, then comes into her bedroom, naked. Ben is there, and is scared out of his wits. A car is heard. Mr. Robinson is home! Mrs. Robinson presses herself onto the door while telling him that it is perfectly okay and Ben grabs the doorknob trying to get out. He does without Mr. Robinson knowing that he saw his wife naked, but he does see Mr. Robinson. And they have a long conversation
Trying to win back' Mrs. Robinson, Ben asks her to go to a hotel to get a drink at night. She accepts and unbeknownst to her, he rents a room. They sleep together for the first time, and they  talk in the darkness of a hotel room. After several times of this adultery, we learn that Elaine Robinson (Katharine Ross) is coming home. Mrs. Robinson forbids him to date her. We learn that the Robinson had to marry because Elaine was born.
So Elaine and Ben go out because Ben's parents literally force him to. Mrs. Robinson tells him that he must make sure that she doesn't like him. After a horrible date, they do fall in love with each other, until he realizes that she's getting married to a jerk.What a movie to think about!

255,fineanimal,Not As Good As They Say,5,5 March 2005,"I was born the year The Graduate was released, but only watched it for the first time yesterday. I had heard all the praise, the hype, and academic analysis of why The Graduate was one of the greatest films ever made. I already knew about the Robinson affair, and even about the importance of ""plastics"". So clearly this film was influential. Otherwise, how could I know so much about it without actually watching it? I also kept seeing The Graduate toward the top of the IMDb's 50 Most Popular Comedies, which kept reminding me that I must watch this film one day. Not with the same anticipation I look forward to each new Star Wars installment, but definitely with interest and high expectations.So I finally watched it, 37 years after it was released, and instantly recognized that it's not a very good film.On the positive side, the casting is excellent, and the acting superb. Dustin Hoffman's uncomfortable awkwardness at the beginning is genuinely funny, and holds your attention. And let's face it, who doesn't want to watch him be seduced by Anne Bancroft? But after a while this humor becomes nothing more than comic relief in an otherwise dreadful film that lacks a real story, and somehow manages to simultaneously trudge along like a dirge, while developing the story by introducing major changes almost instantly. For example, we watch the main character Benjamin stand, sit, lie down, stare and think about things that are never revealed to us for minutes on end, wondering when the story will ever get moving again. Then he suddenly meets a girl and decides he loves and wants to marry her after just one date. Realism clearly wasn't a goal here.Furthermore, the lead character, Benjamin, has no goals, interests, ambitions, or purpose. He's not fun, or intentionally funny. He doesn't exhibit any talent, and not much knowledge for a ""graduate"". He's a man without a personality, and when the film was over I was still trying to figure out what an older woman and her daughter could possibly have liked or loved about this character. Benjamin is a boring person.So what was the appeal of The Graduate? I suspect it was a sign of the times in 1967 that shocking audiences with a young man-older woman affair and dysfunctional families would result in strong sales and praise, much like ""All in the Family"" would do for television four years later. But ""All in the Family"" was really funny, and focused. Each week it made important points in a highly entertaining way, then the episode was over. The Graduate seems to make only one point: We are going to show you some social taboos you've never seen before, on the pretext of a deeper story about a young man who is disillusioned by America's growing fascination with the material world.In fact, it's really just a vehicle for showing a young man having an affair with an older married woman, in 1967. That's all it really is. And in the 21st century, that ain't nothing' new.To make matters worse, The Graduate has the most annoying soundtrack of any film I've seen. It is merely repetition of the same few Simon & Garfunkel songs. During one particularly tedious section of the film, the song ""Are You Going To Scarborough Fair"" is played not once, not twice, not even three times in a row. It is played four times in a row! And this is a traditional English song about a town in England, not the WASP suburbs of California. Indeed, the lyrics throughout the film have absolutely nothing to do with the story, aside from mentioning ""Mrs. Robinson"" in the title track. This is an example of great songs being thrown together to create an awful soundtrack.Director Mike Nichols won an Oscar, presumably for using some clever camera angles and transitions here and there. Yet I would think the primary job of a director is not to use innovative visual tricks, but to ensure that the finished product tells a good story in a compelling manner, keeping the audience's attention, entertaining them throughout, and leaving them with thoughts and emotions to deal with after the film has ended. When The Graduate ended, my only emotion was relief that this film was finally over.So with all due respect to a great cast, and to the warm legacy The Graduate has enjoyed, I cannot recommend watching this film unless you are mainly interested in the nostalgia. 5/10 (almost entirely for Hoffman's performance).",The Graduate
256,bibi-3,DID I MISS SOMETHING ?,1,15 January 1999,"When I saw this movie in the top the list, I can't but question: did I miss something ?I can't understand how a movie like this, featuring the moral decadence of a society is considered a ""classic"".A boy who just finished college is having an affair with the wife of his dad's partner, doing anything else for months, instead of trying to achieve a goal in his life.Then ""falls in love"" with the daugther of that woman ( can you tell me how they could fall in love after what happened in the cabaret?  Did Elaine have a brain ?  Loving him after she knew he slept with her own mother ? Going to the altar with a man she doesn't love ?Is all this representative of something ? Yes, it represents the moral decay of a society.I think that the only valuable thing of this movie is the beautiful music and Hoffman's great acting.The rest is so naugthy !!",The Graduate
257,billpappas-1,A 10. I love this movie,10,16 March 2011,"I saw the Graduate when it came out and I was about 21, so lucky me. To this day, when I watch it, each scene is so perfectly crafted to evoke a variety of emotions, from anxiety to outrageous laughter to tenderness, etc.The cast was perfect. Hoffman looking dazed and confused at the beginning to becoming a man about town to a man in love chasing his woman. Katherine Ross was the ideal mid-60s young woman, beautiful, long hair although the false eyelashes are a little jarring in 2011. Her walking across campus with boots was a familiar image from back then. I recall a Life magazine photo of young woman that Ross remind me of. It was classic look. How could Ben not, you know, go for it? That scene at the end of their first date when they are at her door and she's reaching into the bag to get a french fry, then Ben walks away out of camera range and tosses the empty, crumpled bad back at her was one of those tender moments. I know it doesn't sound romantic.Ann Bancroft is a joy to watch in every scene she's in, the way she can get a waiter when Benjamin fumbles his attempts, taking off an earring to answer the phone in the bar, rubbing a spot off her top while she's undressing in the hotel room, turning on the stereo to a blast of music while 'seducing' Benjamin in the sun porch, smoking and just that sexy way Ann Bancroft is. Her boozy husband is a hoot. Ben's parents are also great in their oblivious way.I know the plot by heart and I don't try to analyze it much as I just enjoy watching the actors perform the way I enjoy a singer sing. It's artistry. Although the situations may be unusual, it seemed like we knew all of these types of people in our own lives.I've been smitten and driven long distances for love and although I wasn't seduced by my father's partner's wife, I had friends that did stuff like that or saw single mother's of friends that looked like they didn't stay home alone Saturday nights. I've seen parents like Ben's too.The movie captured something familiar yet normally experienced privately and took us on a ride as though we were living it.",The Graduate
258,LeonardZelig,"Brilliant, Flawless, and Then Some...",10,7 August 1999,"Obviously, this is a great movie.  The performances are all nothing short of brilliant, the script is a work of art, and the off-centered direction and cinematography make it truly unique.  But let's delve in a bit deeper, and really see what this movie says to us, shall we?""Plastics.""  What does this word mean to you?  Unless you're employed in a field that involves a great deal of plastics, probably not very much.  Or take Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), a bright, athletic college graduate who has absolutely no clue where he's going or, for that matter, why he's going there.  What does plastics mean to him?  Nothing.  But, if an opportunity to do something with plastics came up, would he take advantage of it?  I think so, simply because he couldn't think of anything better to do with his time.Which explains the ultimate confusion of Mike Nichols' ""The Graduate"". Why would a guy like Ben every have an affair with someone like Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft)?  Because there wasn't any real glaring reason not to, and because he couldn't think of anything better to do with his time.  Mrs. Robinson simply becomes available, just as Elaine (Katherine Ross) becomes unavailable.  In a world where nothing makes much sense, what seems easiest and most available is, only too often, what we take advantage of.Enter the world of Ben Braddock, where nothing is quite what it seems, and yet everything makes complete sense.  Everyone has, I believe, been in Ben's shoes.  If not, they will be sooner or later.  Confusion and self-doubt are a part of everybody's coming of age, and ""The Graduate"" turns these feelings into a bizarre, inexplainable masterpiece.  The empty faces at the end only help to put us in Ben's position all over again.  Where are we going, why are we going there, and where will we go from there?**** out of ****.",The Graduate
259,tomloft2000,just one word...plastics,9,2 December 2005,"that one word serves to remind Benjamin Braddock what he does not want to be-that is, not like his parents generation.he spends the first half of the movie following this path,without knowing what he really wants.but in the second half he changes course and figures he knows what he wants.there is only one problem:it is seemingly unattainable to him.the film parallels another 60's rebellion Easy Rider in that the means were a lot more important than the ends.Buck Henry's insightful screenplay(especially for the times)keeps things moving right along,accompanied by the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack(much appreciated by Joe DiMaggio).someone to look out for:Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robinson,who seems to have about as much screen time as Mrs. Robinson.maybe not as influential as it once was,but still packs a wallop.",The Graduate
260,rhklwk-1,"No Longer ""Holding Up""",5,3 March 2019,"More than fifty years after its release, I don't think this film is holding up. My main criticism, at this point, is Dustin Hoffman, who I feel was miscast, and his character, Ben, who does not seem genuine to me. Hoffman was too old (29 or 30) and too atypical in appearance, and he lacked the athletic form that a track star would have. Ben, the character Hoffman plays, for all of his academic and athletic prowess, is a complete loser. He can't even greet his parents' guests or engage in small talk. This makes no sense, in view of the cultured and socially motivated parents he has. Ben has no grace. The guests at the party, in fact almost all of the adults, are strictly stereotypes, although Murray Hamilton -- excellent as always -- has some good moments. But, even so, almost all of the adults are generally nice, and genuinely like Ben, although it is not clear why.Why Mrs. Robinson would get mixed up with Ben remains a mystery. Her husband (Murray Hamilton) and her alcoholism are the reasons, I guess, but there is no real character development to give us an insight into her behavior. The daughter, played by Katharine Ross, delivers a stiff, one-dimensional performance She went on to become a pretty good actress.The soundtrack is holding up fairly well, but to be honest, the songs largely deal with an individual's right to occupy the center of the universe. The music was very egocentric.All of this is just opinion, 20/20 hindsight, if you will, so no one has to get mad. It's an enjoyable flick, tedious and predictable at times, but worth seeing once or twice, but not repeatedly. As for Hoffman, he would very soon put in a timeless performance in ""Midnight Cowboy.""",The Graduate
261,agore3,A transitional movie in the mid-60's for Hollywood,7,31 October 2013,"I think this movie is more part of the transition of the movie industry in the 1960s than great story telling. It has great photography and good music for the times except Scarborough Fair is over played. The first half of the movie was very good. Anne Bancroft really shines. The last half was much less. The plot has several key sudden events. First, Benjamin decides to call Mrs. Robinson for the first meeting after additional setup so I guess this is a attributed to boredom. Second is when Elaine spontaneously likes Benjamin after the strip club scene. It did not take much for her to change their mind except begging for forgiveness and now they are happy. The same thing happens when Benjamin pursues her at Berkeley and considers marrying him after all he does is harass her in several scenes. There is no real explanation for the sudden change. There was no courting or other scenes to justify here behavior. Of course she was going to marry the other guy without saying something like ""I am in love with another guys""...no mention of any relationship there except at the zoo. In fact Benjamin and Elaine had so little dialog between each other. The relationship between Benjamin and Mrs Robinson was explored far more with some relationship dialog.",The Graduate
262,Cd1083,Third Time's the Charm.,8,12 May 2015,"I had seen The Graduate two other times prior to this most recent viewing and I wasn't much of a fan. There was such a high expectation established prior to my first viewing that I was inevitably let down when the film was over and nothing that special happened. I used to consider myself a film buff because I had seen a lot of movies. After disliking a revered film like this I began to question my taste in films. Why did I dislike it? After some time to let my initial impressions digest I decided to give it another watch and much like the first time I just didn't 'get' it. What was I missing?The third viewing was different from the first two because I had what I was previously missing, context. On this occasion instead of expecting the film to entertain me, I broke the film apart to see what made it special. It's when taking the time to observe the clever editing and overall flow of this film that I was able to see what everybody was talking about. The key difference I didn't even think to look for the first couple times was the generational gap theme throughout. I had misinterpreted it as simple teenage angst or apathy, but in reality it was a much more complex emotion. Recognizing this along with being able to recognize the unique cuts used gave me a new appreciation of what I was watching.One thing that I still was unable to shake is the fact that the music becomes incredibly repetitive throughout. I believe there were about three songs throughout that were repeated. Sound of Silence/Scarborough Fair and Mrs. Robinson. The quality of these tunes is inarguable, but the lack of variety is hard to ignore.Overall I can now say I'm a fan of this film, though it isn't quite strong enough for me to consider it one of my all-time favorites.",The Graduate

The Graduate is for me like a glimmer in a dark night. You walk into the dark and suddenly lightning illuminates everything - you realize where you are, you see your way, everything comes to clarity! After a second everything is dark again, but you know where you are headed and you have the confidence that you will arrive there.

265,b-gallagher2,movie review,9,13 April 2011,"This was a great movie. Ben Braddock played by Dustin Hoffman is a college graduate who ends up getting into a sexual relationship with his mother's friend Mrs. Robinson. This movie was made right after the Hays Code era and for good reason. This movie added to the definition of ""New Hollywood"" Sexually suggestive themes, partial nudity, swearing and overall morals that said go against the system. The music also had an awesome soundtrack, primarily Simon and Garfunkel. The movie was so well done. The movie was technicolor, shot in 35mm panavision. The cinematography was amazing. The movie had incredibly unconventional angles and even some shots were the camera would remain stationary and people would walk off and all you can notice is people talking out of the shot. I think after the code, it was a breath of fresh air for collaborating filmmakers, because so many films were made that would have never been approved anywhere before 1967.",The Graduate
266,thepsychocritic,"Contrary to popular belief, love can be funny too.",9,19 November 2011,"The most interesting feature about The Graduate is the allusion to the protagonist being perpetually underwater. In one of the initial scenes of the movie, Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) is shown talking to his father resting against a fishtank in his room, his voice interspersed with the bubbling in the background. As the film proceeds, Ben walks into a swimming pool, oblivious to what everyone is excitedly screaming around him and remains there, still as the cadaver, as the camera retreats slowly, moving through water itself. Further more, there are several scenes that have him floating lazily on the pool, drifting away, both literally and metaphorically. The message in the bottle is clear - Ben is confused, dazed and drowning helplessly - and this forms the crux of his character. After returning home from college, Ben is worried about his future. He is smart (a recepient of the coveted Helpingham award), he is an athlete and is the son of rich, proud parents who just can't enough of their son. Yet he is worried; talk about first-world problems. He meets Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) at a party that his fiesty parents have arranged on the occasion of his homecoming. She asks him to drive her home and then invites him inside. One thing leads to another and before Ben can do anything about the events (though he does understand what's happening), a woman twice his age who is also the wife of his father's business partner, is standing naked in front of him, trying to seduce him. He makes a desperate dash for the exit but it isn't long before he calls Mrs. Robinson again, thus beginning a series of secret, cheap, hotel-room flings. However, things take a turn for the wilder side when the Robinsons' daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross), returns from Berkeley and Ben falls in love with her despite Mrs. Robinson's protestations, who is 'prepared to tell her everything' in order keep Benjamin away from Elaine. The neurotic Benjamin Braddock has been played superbly by Dustin Hoffman. The vacant expression on his face as he stares into nothingness, the trace-like quality to his gait, along with the underwater metaphor tell a lot about him. There is a distinct Woody Allen-esque feeling to him. He is an innocent, curious twenty year-old with a clean conscience, but is merely lost and doesn't know where his life is heading. The acts his commits - sleeping with Mrs. Robinson, being rude to Elain initially, seeming brash and arrogant to people at the party - though intentional, are often a result of being in this mental state. Though many actors could have pulled this role off, hardly anyone would have done it as beautifully as Dustin Hoffman. The film has been made in a really intelligent manner, and you don't get to hear that very often for rom-coms. By not attempting to drag the movie very far from the realms of reality, it presents a kind of humour that keeps the laughter trickling, without overwhelming you.The film doesn't overdo the jokes; they are simple things that grab your attention and make tickle your funny bone - like Mr. Robinson repeatedly giving Ben a scotch even though he insists on having a bourbon, Ben's accidentally driving onto the pavement when Elaine mentions the Taft Hotel (the place where he had the flings) or Ben's encounter with a hotel clerk at the Taft. Along with Ben, the humour does break loose entirely in the head, which appears like a gradual crescendo and does have you gasping for breath through all the laughing, even though it seems slightly amateurishly done. The cinematography, occasionally, really stands out from the rest the of the film. Parts of the movie that interlace the night Ben and Mrs. Robinson spend together with Ben's stay at home, merging the two in a confusing yet clever manner is really well done. It shows that despite his initial refusals, Ben actually enjoyed the time they spent together and thinks about it in his waking dreams, perhaps even without guilt. It does come as a nasty turn to see Ben lying on Mrs. Robinson and hearing Ben's father ask him the background 'Ben, what are you doing?' By maintaining the right balance between the romance and the comedy, The Graduate, made in 1967, does set a precedent for generations of future romantic-comedies to come. It even has the iconic two-forbidden-lovers- run-to-their-freedom-while-evil-folks-try-to-catch-them scene among plenitudes of others that other films have shamelessly ripped off. Having Simon and Garfunkel do the music was a particularly intelligent thing to do. Listening to them croon 'Hello darkness my friend,' not only holds true for Ben, but also makes the film a soothing experience.",The Graduate
267,ChristophCinema,"""Well, I want you to know how much I appreciate this. Really""",10,18 December 2012,"The Graduate is one of my all time favorite movies. I saw this movie for the first time in high school, and I've always just been drawn to it for some reason. Actually, the first time I saw it, I was really confused, but I still loved this movie. At the time, I never watched a movie like it. The subtle comedy was something I never saw before, the story through a lot of curve balls my way, and it's somewhat depressing; but this movie just has this hypnotic effect on me. Now that I'm older, I can see why I love this movie so much. I'm Benjamin Braddock. Never before have I related to a movie character so much. If you want to know what I was like in high school, just watch Dustin Hoffman's performance in this movie. I know exactly what he's going through. Feeling alone as the future approaches faster and faster, hoping all the answers will come fast and easy, making decisions without thinking of the consequences, and having a new outlook on life; this character is so identifiable, that it's scary. I also love the music and the cinematography. They complement each other perfectly. They really enhance the mood of the film, and make it feel so much more real. The movie also has a lot of awkward moments. I've seen this movie so many times, but no matter how many times I see it, those awkward moments are still just as uncomfortable. And why shouldn't they be? The film deals with a very heavy, very real, and very uncomfortable subject, so those scenes are very necessary. The scenes may be awkward, but hey, so is life. It's a great movie, and I really can't think of another movie like it. It has a great, subtle, dark sense of humor; it has very heavy emotions, the main character is great, the side characters are great as well, and it takes a lot of risks. It's another one of those movies from the late 60s that definitely broke new ground, and paved the way for modern day cinema. It may not appeal to everyone, and its unique style may throw a lot of people off, but to me, this is one of the greatest movies of all time, and it'll always be one of my favorites.",The Graduate
268,andysevenfold,"Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson.",9,6 April 2020,"The Graduate (1967) is a film directed by Mike Nichols, which stars Dustin Hoffman as Ben, a man who starts an affair with his parent's friend after she tries to seduce him. Ben is stuck in the in-between, after graduating from college and struggling to decide what he wants to do next. As their affair persists, Ben starts to realise that he may just be making a mistake. Enter Elaine, the beautiful daughter of Ben's lover, and chaos soon ensues as Ben tries to navigate the love triangle he has found himself tangled up in. The Graduate has one of the best soundtracks to a movie that has ever blessed my ears, written by Paul Simon and performed by Simon & Garfunkel. The Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair and Mrs. Robinson reprise throughout the film and they become more and more meaningful and relatable as the movie goes on.

269,GregRG,A biting satire against upper middle class boredom,10,5 January 2000,"Dustin Hoffman's offbeat, quirky, Benjamin Braddock is one of the most interesting and realized characters in movie history.  His cluelessness and disillusion after college, and the resulting affair with the infamous Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), are told in such a empathetic way that you completely understand the choices he is making, even though they are the result of sporadic behavior and poor judgment.  This leads to perhaps the most gratifying ending in movie history, as our hero breaks free from upper middle class oppression to make a wild and romantic gesture that ultimately may save him from the unoriginality his life seemed destined to be heading towards.  Katherine Ross is delightful as the object of Benjamin's unique affection, and the soundtrack is the perfect punctuation point for Benjamin's confusion and desperation.",The Graduate
270,mateusolivotti,Mrs. Robinson,10,28 October 2020,"What to say about The Graduate?
This is, without a doubt, one of the 50 best films of all time.
The film tells the story of Benjamin, a young man who upon returning home after graduating is seduced by Mr. Robbinson, a middle-aged woman who is a friend of his parents, until he knows Elaine, daughter of Mrs. Robbinson and is lost. in love with the girl.
Everything about the film is simply incredible, but there are points worth mentioning, such as the direction of Mike Nichols (who was even nominated for Oscars), the soundtrack that is sensational and the performance of all the actors. However, there is one thing in this film that stands out more than any other in my view, which is the ending, which is simply extraordinary, an optimistic but pessimistic ending, in which you know that the characters are happy at that moment, but you can notice look at them and even on the soundtrack a question in the characters' heads: we are happy now, but will we be happy forever?
And that is why The Graduate is for me one of the best films ever made in the history of cinema.",The Graduate
271,mammigirl,The Graduate,8,8 April 2010,I thought this movie was really good. The Graduate was made in the year 1967. In that same year was when the Hays Code ended. In this movie the 180 degree rule was used. This rule was used in the scene when Ben is in Mrs. Robinson house at her bar. Another scene which I thought was good was when he was in the diving suit. The audience was able to only see his point of view. By hearing and seeing what Ben saw through the mask. This movie also had a lot of long takes in it. I thought the end of the movie was good. When Elaine runs off with Ben even though she was just married to another man. She even ran away with him knowing everything and with her family hating him.,The Graduate
272,oconnor0930,Visually Amazing if you can Stay Awake,7,21 April 2010,"Let me first start out by saying that visually, ""The Graduate"" is amazing. The color is so rich and the variety of shots keeps film buffs interested. The layering in the scenes is excellent. There is a shot of Ben (Dustin Hoffman) through a fish tank with Mrs. Robinson standing in the doorway in the background that exhibits this layering. There was also interesting choices in framing. Characters who were talking oftentimes had their heads cropped off or the camera on the back of their heads.My main beef with the movie was Dustin Hoffman. He just doesn't do anything for me as an actor. And on top of that, the movie was long, slow, and boring.Another strong suit is the amazing soundtrack and how music is effectively intertwined with the plot and transitions. The film also does a good job of showing the generation gap. The ending at the church and the fight scene are amazing and almost make up for the pace of the rest of the film. Overall, I have mixed feelings on ""The Graduate"" and recommend others to watch the movie when you're tired and in bed so the slow pace won't annoy you.",The Graduate
273,critical-escapist,Mrs. Robinson can seduce Benjamin Braddock but the film can seduce audiences.,9,14 April 2006,"The Graduate is a charming, lovable, feel-good movie that gives you a hint in the first scene that you are going to like this movie. The film opens with a Simon & Garfunkel song in the credits as young Benjamin Braddock (or should I say young Dustin Hoffman) finally arrives home after receiving a bachelor's degree from college. He is obviously the family's golden boy and as his family throws him a party but Benjamin is not interested in any of it. He wants to be alone, think about his future a bit  well, maybe for months probably. But the main thing is that he has no interest in his own college experiences and he just wants to be alone for a while.Mrs. Robinson (Ann Bancroft), a middle-age wife of Benjamin's business partner seems quite interested in Benjamin. Benjamin is then seduced by Mrs. Robinson but complications arise when Benjamin's parents and Mrs. Robinson's husband wants Benjamin and the Robinson's daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross) to go on a date together after she comes home from Berkeley. The two go out to a date together after Benjamin promises Mrs. Robinson that he would not do such a thing, but the sad thing is that Benjamin falls in love with Elaine.You know what? I love this movie. I really, really do. I love the music from Simon & Garfunkel (who can hate the song, ""Mrs. Robinson?"") and I love the weird satirical comedy that is inserted into The Graduate. Mike Nichols (who is probably better-known for his more recent film, Closer) does a great job in directing this film and little did he know that this film would still be ""hip"" to the average teenager 33 years later. I think one of my favorite scenes is Benjamin's birthday where he dives underwater (with his scuba diving costume that his father bought him) in his family pool just to sense the quietness of life just for a moment.Even though The Graduate may be a flawed masterpiece (Elaine's sudden approval of Benjamin, the ending, etc.) I don't think I would really want to pick out the ""flaws"" because I feel that I am in no right to do so. The Graduate is so entertaining and likable that the flaws just slowly fade into a distance. I have never read the novel, but there is absolutely no doubt that Calder Willingham is an excellent screenwriter, mixing both comedy and wit together perfectly (same goes to Woody Allen, but well, Allen isn't even associated with this movie).The acting is brilliant here. There is not one second that I didn't believe that Ann Bancroft wasn't Mrs. Robinson and Dustin Hoffman wasn't Benjamin Braddock. The beauty of the acting is that we like the characters even though they are not even that likable. The great thing about Hoffman's performance is that it was the start of an excellent career, and him putting that nervousness into Benjamin is what the film needed. Even though Katharine Ross had little worthy dialogue, she was good here as well as Elaine, who is maybe more confused than Benjamin.This is what I would like to call a true classic  great acting, great music, and a great story. After seeing The Graduate, I felt glad that I saw the movie because this is not the typical ""affair"" movie that you see popping up from every corner.",The Graduate
274,dataconflossmoor-1,Proclivity for the Unorthodox? One Woman's Response: Me Too!!,10,27 February 2011,"The year,1967, was a pivotal year for movies. The Academy Award nominees were: ""Dr Doolittle"", ""In The Heat Of The Night"", ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"", ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and, of course, ""The Graduate"". These five films revolutionized the movie industry, and addressed social issues for adults (as well as children) which changed the ossified formulae for making movies. The innovate genre to movies in 1967 manufactured a mystique to movie goers, and cultivated an enlightening dynamic to the directors and producers of the American cinema. Esoteric concepts which were emphasized with these films, encapsulated the movie audience with socially clairvoyant philosophies. The implementation of the egalitarian dichotomy between social commentary, and ,paramount Hollywood film making, for all of these five pictures, accommodated a pique for movie productions in the future. The realm of creativity with these five films manifested a cinematic ideology which was a harbinger of Hollywood's ensuing years ahead. By the beginning of the year, 1968, ""The Graduate"" had a gross revenue which ranked it the third highest for any movie ever made in the whole history of major motion pictures! ""The Graduate"" was surpassed only by ""Gone With The Wind"" and ""Sound Of Music"". As it turns out, ""In The Heat Of The Night"" won the award for best picture in 1967. Winning the Oscar for best picture is always a rare and coveted accolade, however, the final assessment to winning the Oscar for best picture can be conceptualized accordingly: If a film wins the academy award for best picture, it is put in the category of films like ""Casablanca"", ""Best Years of Our Lives"", ""Ben Hur"", ""Godfather"", ""Deer Hunter"", and ""Forrest Gump"". If a film is nominated for best picture and does not win the Oscar, it is put in the category of movies such as ""Citizen Kane"", ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", ""Network"", ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Shawshank Redemption"", and, what else? ""THE GRADUATE"" (This scenario literally being, six of one, half a dozen of another). What was the basic gist to the film ""The Graduate""? Men do it all the time, so why not have the shoe on the other foot. It is very possible that the script to this movie could have been motivated by the advent of the XYY theory, which became a sexual revelation for women! The elusive sophistication of Brentwood, swimming pools, one martini after the next, and the double-entente solution to quelling your boredom, all became acrimonious elements to surviving the affluent monotony of corporate, well to do suburbia. The director, Mike Nichols, who also directed ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", which, in my opinion, is one of the greatest films ever made, does a brilliant job at expediting the aggregate comical rancor in ""The Graduate"". This stupendously identifiable technique exudes Nichols' directorial genius all throughout the film from start to finish! Often times, ""The Graduate"" is ranked as high as the eighth best film ever produced in the history of all film making by the critics of AFI (American Film Institute). ""The Graduate"" was an integral part of 1960's pop culture, the sixties were a complex potpourri of taboo tenets of radicalism which inevitably erupted and wound up precariously influencing the American people in one way or another. ""The Graduate"" became an unprecedented executive class freak show for unconventional actions and capricious mannerisms. This movie's astute depiction of disconcerting and latent emotions serves as a necessary ingredient to fortifying the foundation of the entertainment curriculum designated for movies and television! The acting in ""The Graduate"" is phenomenal! Dustin Hoffman was impetuously perfect as Benjamin, the sexually befuddled and precocious misfit. Ann Bancroft was sensational as Mrs Robinson. Making a relatively impossible role look naturally easy to perform is a proverbial needle in a haystack, yet, Ann Bancroft succeeded very admirably. That year,(1967) she was up for best actress, Bancroft was a lot of movie critic's choice. Second, was Faye Dunaway for ""Bonnie and Clyde"". The winner ended up being Katherine Hepburn for ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"". To say that the nominations for best actress were intensely competitive in 1967, would be a masterpiece of understatement. Other stars in ""The Graduate"" included: Katherine Ross, Murray Hamilton, William Daniels, and, even a cameo appearance by Richard Dreyfuss. Mike Nichols won for best director for ""The Graduate"", suffice it to say, this award for best director given to Mike Nichols was extremely well deserved. The Simon and Garfunkel music contributed to this movie in a very uplifting and auspicious manner, and became one of the movie's most memorable trademarks! The most poignant line applicable to this movie was from the song ""Mrs Robinson"", that would be ""Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes"". ""The Graduate"" became a flick which set a higher standard for the discerning criteria pertinent to the findings of all of the prominent American Film Academies. Yes, as this film illustrates it, a situation can be simultaneously funny and deranged! It boils down to Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) battling with the macabre repercussions of true love! Humour about an individual's blatant imperfections is one of the crucial cornerstones to Hollywood filmmaking, ""The Graduate"" epitomizes such a feat. See this film!! It is outstanding!!",The Graduate
275,Sweets742,live,8,11 May 2010,"The Graduate was a film that every young adult could relate to. That's why I really liked this film. While watching it, there was so many times I would say ""whoa is this my life"". Everyone has that pressure after college that you have no idea what the heck your going to do after you graduate. Your parents are asking you, your family members are wondering, and even your other classmates want to know what you are going to do for the rest of your life. Not everyone knows and its alright. The graduate showed yout hat you are not the only person in the world that doesn't know what you are doing for the rest of your life. I liked how the director caught that. I also loved Mr. Robinson, he reminded me of my uncle, who still tells me to relax and live life.",The Graduate
276,CaseyIMDB,After the code,9,27 April 2011,"The Graduate I thought was very funny. There were some pretty cool scenes in the movie where they stretched the code by far, very far. But its a good thing the code wasn't in affect. Some scenes in the movie were pretty dirty, but it was good. It was good to see movie directors doing what they wanted instead of being held back. The acting was really good and the movie was cracking me up with some of the things that were happening (I don't want to ruin anything) Mrs. Robinson was being very seductive to a man while she was married, but does Mr. Robinson wind up finding out? And what is the deal with Mrs. Robinson's daughter?",The Graduate
277,wc1996-428-366101,Beautiful Perversion,3,20 January 2013,"This film marks the beginning of the fall and decline of Hollywood which parallels the state of the nation as the result of President Kennedy's tragic death. The country really never recovered from JFK's death and wandered aimlessly into the Vietnam debacle. The Nixon era followed and it seemed to the world that the once steady and straight United States had become a travesty of itself. Only Ronald Reagan was able to pitch the union straight again but by then Hollywood was beyond repair and has been a mess ever since. But it was Mike Nichols with this film who more than anyone nailed the last nail into Hollywood's coffin. This amusing beautifully wrapped package of perversion began a series of similar films with similar themes - Reflections in a Golden Eye, Suddenly Last Summer, and so forth. Glittering silver screen treatments of sordid, depressing and ultimately revolting plots. The true greatness of Hollywood can be seen from the mid-thirties to the mid-fifties. Picture after picture inspired and moved audiences to a higher plane of consciousness. This picture along with others like it simply denigrate the virtues of life and reduce them to fodder for egomaniacs like Nichols who have no moral or ethical view.",The Graduate
278,Laner,"Pleasantly surprised by a supposed ""classic""",7,2 January 2000,"I've wasted far too much time watching movies that are supposed to be classics (Citizen Kane, 2001, Pulp Fiction, etc.), so with much trepidation I rented The Graduate.  I was pleasantly surprised, however.  Great performances all around, the story was great, and I particularly liked how no character was especially likeable.  They were all pretty nasty or shallow in their own way.  It was a pretty accurate representation of the times, it seems (I was born several years after it was released, so I can't say for sure).At any rate, it works on many levels.  I can't say if it belongs in the API top 10, but it's certainly more worthy than the films I listed above.And the ending is great - the happy ending which isn't!",The Graduate
279,stasia_stasia,Dustin Hoffman = Benjamin,8,13 April 2010,"This movie was excellent. There were so many directorial techniques. It had dramatic long takes, and zooming on the important characters. Some parts it had a montage of scenes. This movie showed the most match cuts I have seen in any movie that I have noticed. This makes the movie seem so much more interesting and really puts the watcher in the mood of the scenes. The Graduate was filmed after the Hayes code, so the writers now had more of a freedom of having what they wanted in their films. Subjects such as sex, drugs, and more realistic drama.Dustin Hoffman did an outstanding job at playing Benjamin. He showed great confused looks, love, and other emotions. This indeed is a classic film, that has scenes people often still talk about. which I never knew till I finally watched this film.",The Graduate
280,bruscinoa833,The graduate,8,27 April 2010,"The Graduate did a great job of capturing the atmosphere of the 1960's from the point of view of the older and younger generations. This is shown perfectly at the start of the film which is the ""Welcome Home"" for Ben, thrown by his parents. The use of the camera during that scene puts the audience in Ben's shoes and it feels as if you are at the party with him. While Ben is greeting his guests the camera whirls around to each one and remains on Ben's face as he tries his hardest to seem interested and excited. Dustin Hoffman does a fantastic job of being the nervous, unsure young man. His obvious tentativeness with Mrs. Robinson is endearing. Anne Bancroft is just amazing as well, she has a way of owning every scene that she is in and the combination of her strength on screen and Hoffman's naivety really makes the film.Masny interesting shots are used in the films as well. The setup of the camera inside the scuba mask when Ben is showing off the scuba gear for his guests is fantastic. The match cut shots which were used mostly during the affair between Ben and Mrs. Robinson portrayed Ben's double life and how inane his life seemed to be without her. One of the best scenes in the entire film is the last shot when Ben and Elaine are sitting on the bus. At firs the two are laughing and seem happy with their decision but as they sit there both of them seem to realize the repercussions. It brilliantly demonstrates the state of minds of much of world at that in time in history. Overall the film was just fantastic.",The Graduate
281,j-schardt,loved it,10,28 April 2010,"Just a great film, and by far my favorite film I have watched yet in my American cinema history class. Right away you get a taste for what great cinematography your going to experience, the shot where Dustin Hoffman first arrives at airport and the camera stays with the his luggage bag for an extended period of times. Thats just the beginning and its gets better from there. Right away you also notice the great photography every shots lighting perfectly fits in with the scene. The editing tricks in this film are also mind blowing. The scene when he jumps on the raft, then it cuts to Hoffman jumping in bed with Mrs. Robinson, then back to him when you hear his dad voice. That was just one of the few examples of fantastic editing. The acting was also great in this film. Have only seen Hoffman before in his role as Rain man, I was already a fan but his performance in this may rival his performance in Rain man. Mrs. Robinson was just as good and I was even more surprise to see her daughter actually look like a younger version of her. The film was funny, dramatic, sad, shocking, and the list could go on and on. This film had a little bit of everything and thats is just part of the reason why it was so go. The film had a strong social message that at the time an entire generation could relate to, and the youth of today can still relate too. I related to it just because of the pressure I feel from my parents is very similar to what Hoffman was going through. Not only did this film reach out to youth, it show to parents that they need to be careful how much pressure they put on there kids. I wish films like this were still made today, and I feel everyone at someone point should watch the Graduate.",The Graduate
282,m-bailey8,the graduate,10,22 November 2010,"This has to be one of my new favorite movies. This is a movie definitely good for any college student. In this movie there are many examples of diegetic and nondiegetic sounds, and on screen and off screen sounds. These types of sounds are seen together many times throughout this movie. Besides good sound, the cinematography was also impressive. I loved when Ben would go from the pool to the hotel room, from the hotel to his room, and from his room to the pool again. It was a good example of an ellipse as well. What was also impressive was the acting. I loved Dustin Hoffman's part of Ben Braddock. He pulls off the awkwardness and shyness of his character very well. The humor of his character wouldn't have been possible either without the help of good writing. The writing and dialog in this movies makes it so funny.The movie also deals with the theme of the ""generation gap"". Many times in the movie, I could see the difference between Ben and his parents. His graduation party and the swim suit for his birthday are just a few examples. Also, the theme of rebellion shows up in this movie. The ending is the most memorable one when Ben and Elaine run away together. This movie is now one of my favorites and I'm recommending it to all of my friends!",The Graduate
283,n-racicot,The Graduate,9,1 December 2010,"The Graduate was filmed in 1967 by director Mike Nichols. The Graduate is an early comedy classic released within the first year of the post production code era. The movie tells the story of a young college graduate that comes home only to end up in a real pickle. Dustin Hoffman plays the role of Benjamin Braddock, the graduate. He finds new a love interest much older than himself to help pass the time. The problem is that the woman is his father's business partner's wife, as well as the mother of the girl he ends up falling in love with. While trying to fix everything, Benjamin has to hurdle all obstacles in his way. The Graduate is packed full of laughs with a unique story that any young man wouldn't mind getting into. A definite must see!",The Graduate
284,cinema_student2010,Very interesting,8,17 December 2010,"The graduate was definitely on my list to see, I've heard people make reference to it and other movies/t.v. shows. The Jen Aniston movie Rumor Has It, for example. So I kind of knew in a nutshell what it was about. All though overall I cant say it was one of the best, most remarkable films I've seen, it was quite good. After taking a film class I've come to appreciate how this movie was for its time, it was one of the earlier movies that chose to take on such a risqué subject.Faults I had with the movie, Ben's love for Elaine was so intense but their were very few scenes leading up to that, it kind of through the whole movie off for me. But there were some very funny parts throughout. Dustin Hoffman's awkwardness as Bed was just down right hilarious. It was really interesting to see Hoffman in a younger role as well. While watching this film I noticed some very interesting things. Towards the end there's a scene where he steals a small red sports car to chase after Elaine before she gets married. He pulls into a gas station to ask for directions. While watching this I instantly was reminded of the movie Wayne's World. He goes into the church and starts banging and screaming on the glass window above the ceremony, and then locks them in the church by sliding a broom handle through the door. A minute later when the car brakes down, the couple hop a bus. Waynes World totally ripped this scene off from the graduate.There was also an earlier scene in the movie where Mrs. Robinson was trying to seduce Ben. So for me personally it was very interesting to see how more current films are still keeping The Graduate alive. definitely a classic that im glad I got the opportunity to see, I enjoyed it and wouldn't mind watching it again.",The Graduate
285,crivers123,The Graduate (1967),6,12 May 2011,"The Graduate (1967) was an alright film. The first half was entertaining; watching the awkward Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) stumble over himself as he carries on an affair with the attractive Mrs. Robinson. But then it took a sort of dark turn when Ben starts to fall in love with Mrs. Robinson's daughter. What started out as a quirky comedy ended up turning into depressing, quasi-romantic story. I feel as if Ben's relationship with Elaine wasn't truly genuine, almost as if he only liked her because Mrs. Robinson told him not too. And when he breaks up Elaine's wedding and they both escape together on the bus, they both look as if there was some regret in their facial expressions. All in all it was good. It features explicit sex and nudity, which during the time of the film's release was considered taboo to be seen in films. All in all it was a good movie.",The Graduate
286,NOXiFy,Hilarious movie with a twisting plot!,9,23 April 2012,"I really enjoyed this movie, it tells a great and hilarious story of a ""nerdy"" college graduate who throughout his college years never once had an intimate moment with a woman. The cinematography is fantastic and the color is very good for a mid-sixties movie. Lots of different angled shots and many shots in rapid succession at different angles. The sound was great as well, all the words and music were synced up and the movie was just overall a great one.I'd recommend this to family and friends seeing as how it's a funny movie and quite entertaining.

Mike Nichols successfully creates a hilariously awkward film. Dustin Hoffman did very well in portraying his quirky and naive character but there's no question that Anne Bancroft as Msr. Robinson really stole the spotlight in this movie. Her performance as the sex-craved, alcoholic, house wife is astonishingly authentic and enjoyable to watch. The scenes between her and Hoffman are quite possibly the best in the entire film. The cinematography was very artistically done with several interesting shots, such as the underwater shots and the transitional montage. The ending was amazing and enjoyable, it made the whole film for me. overall a very successful coming of age story.",The Graduate

The one thing that did impress me was the cinematography, it was very inventive and artistic. For example the where the camera took a dive into the pool, as if you were seeing through the eyes of Ben. Also the point of view shot of Ben looking at the desk clerk through the spokes of the desk. I liked Elaine, I thought there relationship and ""love"" was a bit quick and bizarre, but she was very likable and I found that Katherine Ross did a great job playing here. Not my favorite Dustin Hoffman film, but I did appreciate it.",The Graduate
289,BatmanAndRobyn,Great coming of age story!,8,26 April 2013,"'The Graduate' is a great film with a realistic storyline. Though not everyone may be able to relate to it, the story still rings true and proves that life after college is just confusing and frightening. Dustin Hoffman does a wonderful job playing the young and naive college graduate. He gives a really believable performance and his character is easy to empathize with. With all of life's struggles and temptations, his character obviously hits multiple rough patches, but in the end gets what he thinks he wants at that point. Anne Bancroft also plays a great antagonist and her character is one of those that I honestly just loved to hate- she was just so manipulative and persuasive. The editing in this film was especially great. I liked the quick edits they did, such as the editing that was done in the beginning with very brief cuts showing different parts of Anne Bancroft's body. However, my favorite part of the film, besides the overall storyline, was the soundtrack. As a long time lover of Simon & Garfunkel's music, having it playing in the background for a majority of the film made it that much more enjoyable. I also thought the music fit surprisingly well with the films overall mood.",The Graduate

I was disappointed that I didn't pee my pants because laughter (not actually), but I was expecting a good laugh, and I didn't get it. Besides the fact that I didn't consider the movie a ""comedy"", it still had a pretty good plot. Ben Braddock (played by Dustin Hoffman), the new graduate and the character that the movie's title is based off of, finds his way into a very eccentric love affair with his father's business partner's wife, Mrs. Robinson (played by Anne Bancroft), but eventually ends up falling in love with her daughter, Elaine Robinson (played by Katherine Ross). It is a very bizarre story, but ultimately, it was pretty entertaining, despite the fact I never got my good laugh!",The Graduate

292,Patti-Gaston,Fresh and Funny,8,22 April 2015,"This movie definitely takes a different approach from movies in the past but provides a fresh and humorous view of an adulterous relationship. As Ben becomes entangled with the provocative Mrs. Robinson his emotions take him on a roller coaster ride of highs and lows. Add to the mix, Mrs. Robinson's beautiful daughter Elaine and dear Ben becomes a frantic mess. Eventually Ben realizes that it's time to step out of the manipulative shadows of the adults and follow his heart. There are many clever shots throughout the movie, especially Mrs Robinson's bent leg framing Ben and the underwater swimming pool scenes and the dialogue is witty and funny. An abundance of water is also seen in this film and I was curious to the symbolism regarding all the water; I googled it and one theory suggests that the water is the womb and Ben as a recent grad going through an existential crisis is reluctant to come out of the water and leave the womb. My feelings are that the water represents the innocence of youth which Ben clearly had until Mrs. Robinson decided to make a man out of him. Well written and beautifully filmed it is definitely a must see.",The Graduate

I thought the main character, Ben, was very boring and didn't have a lot of personality which made the whole movie kind of boring to me. The movie is about a new college graduate named Ben who didn't really know what he wanted to do with the rest of his life. His mothers friend, Mrs. Robinson, began hitting on him and the two began secretly meeting at hotels and hooking up. However, when Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, came home from college to visit, Bens dad made him take her out on a date. He ended up liking Elaine and told her about his relationship with her mom which lead for her to not talk to him anymore out of disgust. She went back to college and Ben chased after her trying to convince her to get back with him. Elaine ended up getting engaged to a boy at her college and she is standing at the alter at the end of the movie about to say ""I do"" then Ben came running into the church saying how he loved her and that she couldn't marry him.

I enjoyed it the first time through, but didn't pay enough attention to really get the most out of it. The second time through I enjoyed the film a so much more and I caught a lot more of the dry fast-paced humor that can be found throughout the film. I really enjoyed all of the performances in the film with Dustin Hoffman's performance really being my favorite because he really pulled off the awkward and intelligent character of Benjamin. Even though I watched it for a second time and I definitely enjoyed it more the second time, I still felt like the movie kind of dragged on towards the end of the movie. I can't quite put my finger on when it starts to feel this way to me, but just like the first time through it felt like it should have ended sooner.",The Graduate

The acting in the is film is particularity impressive. Dustin Hoffman is excellent as Benjamin. He portrays a young man unsure of how things will turn out perfectly. He also does a great job of playing a man who is hopelessly in love. The editing in this film is probably the most original part. There are some really amazing shots that fade perfectly into others. The famous scene of Ben jumping in the pool with his new scuba gear is purely innovative. I recommend this film to anyone, one of my all time favorites.",The Graduate
296,cleigh115,One of my favorites,10,16 April 2015,"The Graduate was an interesting film to watch. I thought it was great in many aspects. Each scene is so perfectly crafted to evoke a variety of emotions, from anxiety to outrageous laughter to tenderness, etc. Dustin Hoffman did a great job acting, as well as Anne Bancroft. She had a way of being there even when she wasn't on screen. The main theme in The Graduate is that of a character who is confused about their life and future, while being pressured by an older generation. Ben feels like he is ""drowning"" because he is confused about his future and is constantly being pressured by his parents. This film speaks to the younger generation; informing them of the dangers of not turning into the person they want to be, but instead, turning into what others want them to be. Even today, The Graduate is very appropriate and its theme is applicable. The story easily attracts today's viewers since at one time or another we all have questioned where our lives were heading. The Simon and Garfunkel songs which provide the soundtrack are a terrific addition to the film as they fit in perfectly with what is happening on the screen. This film was clever and very well made.",The Graduate
297,c-fronk,The Graduate,7,26 April 2016,"The Graduate is somewhat set in its time, with some elements carrying over to the present day. The sense of rebellion of Benjamin's generation is made clear throughout the film in its own quirky way. Dustin Hoffman's acting was simply outstanding; he played the lost, awkward character of Benjamin quite well. Anne Bancroft also portrayed a strong role as the confident, desirable mother. The editing of the film is also worth noting. The various montage sequences are very well put together, particularly the bed-to-pool scene. I'd consider the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack to be timeless, and the movie would not be the same without it. The Graduate may seem a bit dated to a younger audience, but the editing, acting, and soundtrack are some things that make it worth the watch.",The Graduate

It is fab to see Dustin and Ms.Bancroft make this picture work.  But these are several liberties with plot logic to make this adventure work.  The premise is set up in a compelling way.

299,Hwos,I Didn't like Hoffman's Performance,6,10 December 2011,"The Graduate is the story of Benjamin Braddock played by Dustin Hoffman. Braddock recently graduated college and is feeling lost in life when he is seduced and has an affair with Mrs. Robinson a sexy older woman played by Anne Bancroft. Ben has known Mrs. Robinson his entire life and the affair sours when he falls in love with Mrs. Robinson's daughter. The film follows his pursuit of the daughter and the backlash from his affair. Bancroft was great as the sexy Mrs. Robinson, and the use os Simon and Garfunkle's music complemented the film perfectly. To me the film was not as good as advertised because I didn't find Dustin Hoffman's character believable. Hoffman's portrayal of Ben as lost and naive was overdone and unbelievably, specifically when it came to his interaction with Mrs. Robinson. The gee shucks Mrs. Robinson schtick didn't jive with someone mature enough to be having an affair that was so dangerous. Hoffman only seemed real when he was fervently trying to win over the daughter, Elaine. The story was entertaining, and most of the actors did a good job, but Hoffman's failure and lack of realism made this film very average to me.",The Graduate
300,ctladybird,A jarring film about the uncertainty of the future,10,27 April 2014,"I would first like to point out the massive contrast between films like this and modern ""Coming of age"" films. Ben's behavior towards Elaine (Which is far from romantic) is never condoned by ANYONE in the film, even his own parents. When Elaine screams the rest of the men in Ben's house come to make sure she is okay and refuse to leave until she is okay. In today's coming of age films Ben would be encouraged and goaded and told his behavior was okay, and the ending would have implied a happy ending for the two. ""The Graduate"" is a jarring film about falling into toxic relationships and the life of a jaded youth. If Ben had just gone to work or chosen a graduate school, or perhaps worked harder to refuse Mrs. Robinson's advances, would his situation have been better off? With fantastic film work and amazing cinematography, ""The Graduate"" asks the important questions.",The Graduate
301,s-diblasicrain,HIST American Cinema,10,16 December 2009,"This is a really fantastic and enjoyable film that was an avant-guard and groundbreaking film which (along with a few other) helped begin a whole new era of Hollywood movies.This film reflects the dissatisfied and restless youth of the 1960's whom are beginning to question their parents stale, middle class, cookie cutter lives that were still reminiscent of the 1950's image of the ""American Dream"".The acting in the film is absolutely fantastic and unbelievably realistic which, in this films case, is particularly impressive because of its techniques in long, fluid camera takes. This wonderful comedic-satire is visually engaging, thought stimulating and a film in which almost any young person in there twenties, whom all the sudden must learn to deal with the overwhelming and harsh realities and choices of adult like, can easily relate to.",The Graduate

It was funny to see his character's nerves all the time and he portrayed them well. I thought his character was very relatable in how he handles the predicament he gets himself into. I didn't like how we never got a straight answer as to why the mother didn't want him to date her daughter, though. I'm glad he told her himself that he was sleeping with her mom. I don't understand though how she can just forget about him raping her mom and marry him. Because even though he didn't raper her, he never gets the chance to explain what really happened so the whole time she thinks he raped her? The ending was very unbelievable.",The Graduate
303,b-kelly13,A New Film For the Time,9,17 December 2010,"This film was a new kind of film for it's time. For one it showed things which never would have been shown before such as nudity, dry humor, and a love affair. I enjoyed the scene when the main character Banjamin is under water in his scuba suit and all you can hear is the sound of him breathing into the air tank. I feel as though this is a metaphor for how he really feels with his life. For one, he just graduated from college and his parents are expecting great things from him. This puts a lot of pressure on him because he does not know exactly what he wants to do. I feel as though it represents how he feels he has no where to turn, and he is just drowning in his own life. I liked how this film showed the consequences for infidelity. It is also a very romantic love story, seeing as how Benjamin will do anything to prove to Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine how much he loves her. It is interesting to see how the affair between Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson turns out, and what happens between Ben and Elaine.",The Graduate
304,jrippz,uhhhh,10,17 December 2010,"The Graduate epitomizes New Hollywood for me. The way Dustin Hoffman's realistic performance and awkward character contrasts with the campy, airy adult characters is New Hollywood's generation contrasting with Old Hollywood's generation. Simon and Garfunkel's music is used to excellent effect, and I still say that this style of soundtrack hasn't been used to its greatest potential yet. The film is still relevant to today's youth as every new generation inevitably has some sort of rift between their parents/former generation. In fact, more so than the 60s, there's a rift between individuals and their own generation. And the movie's theme(s) fit perfectly with that too. I'm sure that there are plenty of people who can relate with the tragic Mrs. Robinson.",The Graduate
305,d-jacobs1,"Hilarious, rebellious, and risqué.",8,16 December 2010,"This crazily interesting film is a great adventure into the changing mentality of the 60's, full of cleverly funny moments and creative use of editing and sound. The standout moments in the editing comes during the montage of Ben's affair with Mrs. Robinson, where he walks through doors and jumps out of his pool and ends up in the hotel or in bed. The shots create a sense of unity between Ben's monotonous life and his love affair. There is a notable shot which utilizes sound, or the lack of it, to perfectly illustrate Ben's feelings; when Ben is dragged out in his scuba gear by his father, there are cuts to POV shots from inside the suit, these shots include only the sound of the suits re-breather and represent Ben's feelings of his disconnection from the world of his parents. The final scene is also iconic, as Ben and Elaine triumphantly elope, the camera continues to film them for some time during which they seem to realize what radical things they have done and seem a bit uneasy about it all, which is a fitting allegory for the times.",The Graduate
306,k-plekan,An Enjoyment,9,17 December 2010,"I remember once that I heard about a movie like this but I never actually saw it. When I watched this movie in class I really did enjoy it because it combined all the different emotions that humans have and how we react to certain situations. This movie was rather funny in the beginning and towards the end it became more serious. In the beginning all the awkwardness was rather funny which made it enjoyable and kept my attention. In the end I was still captured by the film because it was getting more intense because relationships became complicated.To me the movie showed a certain message. The way that he was tangled in the web of the affair with the mother, he was being manipulated and was somehow a puppet. In the end when the daughter and the graduate ran off with each other, it was as if they were breaking away from the older generation to live their own life.",The Graduate
307,JoshuaC96,The Graduate is a classic,9,8 December 2010,"I enjoyed The Graduate. It was a fun movie to watch; it had suspense, drama, humor, romance; everything required for an entertaining film. All of the actors gave good performances, especially Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. I love Simon and Garfunkel music, so that greatly added to my enjoyment of the movie.Ben Braddock is kind of a depressed guy who doesn't know what to do with his life. The Graduate is a great film for young people, especially college kids, because a lot of them can identify with the main character's feelings of being lost and not knowing what choices to make. The only problem I had with the movie is that Hoffman's character seemed kind of ditsy a lot of the time and made weird illogical decisions. However, his choices were what pushed the plot forward so it was easy to go along with.Overall I thought The Graduate was pretty great. There is a lot to like about the movie and it has a lot of meaning behind it. The film is more than 40 years old but it doesn't seem like it. It's a classic and is as good as any modern film.",The Graduate
308,alexv1208,Review of The Graduate,10,9 December 2010,"The Graduate is funny and witty, yet intelligent and allegorical. It's an excellent representation of the 60's. The ending really shows what the 60's are all about. Ben and Elaine run off together, even though she's supposed to get married. They're are going against typical societal norms, which makes the storyline so compelling, and dramatic, not just comedic. In addition, the music in the film accentuates the whole feel of the movie. Simon and Garfunkel produced music specially for the film (scored music). Without this music, there wouldn't be nearly as dramatic of an effect as there is. The music evokes emotion and helps express the depths of the characters morals in each scene. The sound in the film also adds to the feel of the film. The famous pool scene when Ben goes into the pool with scuba gear on, you feel like you're in his place, because all you can hear is him breathing. The Graduate is a must see. It's emotional and riskay for it's time, but it really represents the gap in generations, and how the younger generation was going against society. Ben and Mrs.",The Graduate
309,ben_jm89,Review for History of Cinema,9,11 May 2011,"I thought this was a very interesting film. the story allows for the new Hollywood style to make a stand, pushing limits that are rarely touched like nudity, a man and a woman in the same bed, even naked together. And then of course an older married woman sleeping with a much younger boy. these happenings were done, i believe, to showcase the potential that future movies have, the lines that can now be crossed and turned into something great. Furthermore i think the film is trying to show young people a few things about life. showing firsthand the ups and downs of a relationship with an older person. another i think is that one should not rush into marriage at such a young age because, as you see in both Ben and Elaine's faces as they ride away on the bus, they have no idea what to do and how they will do it.Its a great movie that is funny and smart while teaching valuable lessons.",The Graduate
310,E-reilly3,Great story of a confused graduate,10,10 May 2011,"This is a great film that takes advantage of the ""New Hollywood"" era in which films were allowed to show things on screen that were previously deemed unacceptable by the Hayes Code. A few things that I found interesting were the use of popular music of the time, Simon and Garfunkel rather than an orchestra like previous movies. Also there were numerous scenes where Benjamin is in bed with a woman, engaging in sex before marriage which was unheard of prior to this era. Another thing is that this movie is wide screen in order to get people to go to the movie theaters because it isn't something they can see on TV. This was an interesting movie and I could relate because at this point in time I also have no idea what to do after college. This is still relevant today with a lot of people graduating and not so many jobs available.",The Graduate

From beginning to end, I found myself revolting, even hating, Dustin Hoffman's character, who slowly becomes more and more repulsive and frightening. However, when up against a conflict, I'm rooting for Hoffman again, before sliding back into disgust, and then the cycle repeats. The rest of the film is clear as to how much I enjoy it, such as its use of water, montages, transitions, and music.

313,NineFelines,Great Sixties Icon,8,17 April 2012,"I am not able to grasp all of the significance attributed to this film by those who have personal experience regarding the 1960s, but I am able to recognize it as a very well crafted movie. The acting is great, particularly Dustin Hoffman's perfect portrayal of a dry, almost stiff, innocent and Anne Bancroft as the original über-cougar. The music is also spot-on and enveloping. I never listened to much Simon & Garfunkel, but I am now inclined to start. The cinematography is excellent and varied with perfect examples of masking & a match cut plus underwater scenes.While the story itself is not that unusual today, it has a different quality to others I have seen from that period in time. Even though it is obviously dramatized, it seems more ""real"" than previous movies. The situations are more frank than what would have been depicted in movies made only a few years prior and I can easily see why that, at the very least, resonates with the spirit of freedom exhibited in the 1960s.",The Graduate

The movie conveyed a message about life and I felt it meant you only live once, so do what you have to do to get what u want; however the end of the movie is a bit pointless, on their behalf. He went all out for a girl he barely knew but loved so much. He basically stalks her around her school. On the other hand at the end, they both had a very confusing look as ""what do we do now?"" I found that to be pretty fascinating because he went out his way to get her and she ran out on the middle of her wedding to be with him. There are so many interesting more parts I would like to say but then again I will be spoiling the whole movie. Mr. Hoffman played a great character in the graduate.

Any way, i still end up liking it and loving the ending. It is a film that is predictable in some ways, but in others it definitely isn't. The whole movie, in itself is great. The editing is a great way to start the break-down. One of my favorite shots is the triple take in the beginning half of the movie. Another editing part that ALWAYS catches my eye is the pool shot then the hotel shot. The way it merges as one scene into the next is NOTHING like I have ever seen before. That definitely kept me enticed. The story line as well kept me watching it. The way it ended made me think, ""Could there possibly be another way they could have found each other?""

So it was still exciting to watch it again. I knew what to expect overall, but now I was able to analyze everything in between. I just had an overall better understanding of it, being older and having almost finished college myself. So now I can appreciate Ben's thoughts and feelings as a character. Personality wise, Ben is just really awkward. Which I find is frustratingly hilarious. At certain parts I just felt he was being stupid and that someone needed to really tell him so, but he lacked friends. He was very detached from his parents, so he really had no guidance from anyone. He was just by himself in all of his rather bad decisions. I found the movie to be a little cryptic at times, but it was horribly bad. I liked how some scenes went in and out of each other, probably to make the viewer feel like Ben. Drifting through a routine with not much thought, then being disturbed by an outsider. The music went along great with everything as well.",The Graduate

This has some of the things that the studio system didn't have back then. The worst part about this film was the point where people saw some quick shots of partial nudity. I didn't like it at all, even though it was one of the parts that had excellent editing. The reason why I didn't like that part is that I found it way too disgusting for my taste. This is perhaps the movie that started influencing other films to do that. However, not everything is bad. There are a lot more good parts about this film. I love the way Dustin Hoffman did his character, the humor, the music, and the editing of the film. The rest of the film like the minor characters and more are mostly a hit-and-miss for me. Overall, this one is another film that you should see.",The Graduate

320,gcappadona,The Graduate Review,9,30 November 2014,"This film was great! Every aspect was perfect, especially the comedy aspect. This movie I think does a great job of touching upon the awkward relationship that Mrs. Robinson has with Ben; but more importantly it focuses upon the huge generation gap that there is between the two of them. The film does a great job of never referring to the adults with a first name; it is always Mr. and Mrs. Robinson etc. Also, there is very little dialogue during the sex scenes which makes Ben seem more experienced than he really is. The plot twist in this movie is great. I think it is perfect that Mrs. Robinson is jealous and worried that Ben will fall in love with her daughter and even goes as far as making him promise to never take her out on a date. When he realizes he is really in love with Elaine Robinson (the daughter) all hell brakes loose. The very last scene when Ben and Elaine ran away together and exchange looks on the bus is absolutely perfect. It is a look of ""oh my, what have we just done?"" and ""we barley know each other"". This was the perfect way to end this film.",The Graduate
321,shavonnacroley,The Graduate (1967),10,24 November 2014,"Dustin Hoffman was awkwardly funny in this film, I loved it. Mrs. Robison was by far my favorite character in this film. She had this presences about herself that just made you stop and watch her every movement. When she tells Ben that she doesn't want him dating her daughter, I found that one scene to be the most interesting out of the whole film. In my head I'm thinking she said this because she wants Ben all to herself and perhaps she is falling for him but she doesn't speak out loud. If she felt that way, it would've have been great to see her speak her mind about her feelings and perhaps we would have an entirely different film on our hands. I thought that maybe just maybe Ben was falling for her as well. Unspoken words, ahh man. The use of imagery in the film was amazing, we're brought from one scene to another using one item in each room, this one item brought us to an entirely different scene. I loved the use of water in this film. It was Ben's ""thinking hat."" The ending scene was pretty great too, these two characters take each other as they are and in some ways end up realizing that maybe they had just done the wrong thing. The lack of eye contact said it all. In the end I felt so bad for Mrs. Robinson's daughter...the final scene was heavy.",The Graduate

You may have your own opinion on the graduate, but I think this was honestly a knock out. Dustin Hoffman was truly the star of the show. From his quirky huffs and puffs when things started getting weird, to his reactions to different situations and being a slight odd ball I don't think this movie would be as popular without him. The relationship that his character shares with Mrs.Robinson is funny and keeps you interested because the way they react with each other is down right hilarious. Even the camera angles are perfect in this movie, such as when he gets the scuba gear on and they show his perceptive of being in it and going into the water. This movie is truly amazing, and the lighting is near to perfect. Other than the same song playing continuously and nearly driving me crazy there isn't anything that should have been changed to make this movie better.",The Graduate

There was so many creative personal perspective shots where we are taken in to the mind of Benjamin Braddock , played by the brilliant Dustin Hoffman. His performance was what made this film , something somewhat necessary you would hope out of your main character. His performance was so awkwardly hilarious , her truly captured the persona of the post college young buck with hesitation to perfection. Right along side him Anne Bancrofft, Mrs. Robinson, was sensational as well. I think this film was comedically ahead of it time and set the tone for plenty of our greatest modern comedies such as American Pie(1999) and such films in that genre.",The Graduate
324,MC_Barton,"""Have you thought about graduate school?""",8,22 April 2015,"""The Graduate,"" to me is a landmark movie. There are so many things that the film does correctly, not just technically but contextually. For starters, the movie seemingly connects the generation gap by a wobbly bridge over troubled waters by introducing sexual relations between a teenager entering his adult years and a fully grown woman with an established life. From this aesthetic quality arose many quarrels during the duration of the plot, which were always filled with tension, and I mean always, even at seemingly calm segments. This, I felt and became anxious as to what was to happen next. Technically, I have never seen a movie of such grace. The unique camera angles and panning techniques utilized really offered many differing perspectives which allowed me to perceive the situations in different lights. My favorite though are the cutting techniques, specifically when facial close-ups occur and then the camera pans out to reveal that the entire setting has changed, and this all happened smoothly. Also the scene where Ben propels himself out of the water onto the raft in the pool only to cut to a scene of himself landing on top of Mrs. Robinson is great.",The Graduate
325,aladar-219-783287,The Graduate - My Review,9,27 April 2015,"This was another movie I saw previously in my high school film class, and like Night of the Hunter I did enjoy it a lot. It's symbolism is amazing and the use of its camera is delightful and interesting (though that doesn't need much saying). As well as surprisingly comical. Ben as a character is likable (and cute, if I do say so myself, haha), and the development is fluid and you know how and when changes in them take place.One thing I found so eerily beautiful is the integration of Simon and Garfunkel's music and the scenes put in place. Their songs are just beautifully composed and match the situations well. I still have some of their songs on my iPod to this day because of it, and I picture the scene in my head almost instantly.One thing I did find creepy is Ben's infatuation with Mrs. Robinson's daughter. While I understood the symbolism involved in it since Ben represented the young generation seeking values outside the norm, the values outside the norm being Mrs. Robinson's daughter, but even so it was just awful watching him lose his mind and follow this poor girl. Shame on you, Ben.He got his crap together eventually, though... or not. The wedding crashing is so funny and crazy yet very meaningful as well. I kind of like how Mrs. Robinson almost seemed to crack a smile when she noticed that Ben chased after her daughter, even when she told him not to. In a way I felt like she was only restricting him just so he could want it more and go after it, unlike when she was his age (based off of what their talk was about). It only sealed the deal in my book that it was all based in real life, in an environment that was real at the time and still is to some extent.It's a substantial movie so I wouldn't recommend it for someone who wants to watch a weekend film with their significant other, but if you want a thoughtful night, then give it a fling.",The Graduate
326,hagen2357,The Graduate Review,8,12 May 2015,"Like many movies in this era, this film did a good job of showing the differences between the older and younger generations which was reflected in society at the time with controversies such as the Vietnam War. An example seen in this film occurs in the beginning of the film when Ben is having a graduation party thrown for him. He is shown being obviously uncomfortable in front of his parents older friends and doesn't have much in common with them. Never seeing this movie, I had always heard about Mrs. Robinson but never knew the whole story. I thought her character was great in showing a rebellious side while also feeling bad for her. Along with many different problems occurring in the story, including Ben not knowing what his future holds in store for him, this is another love story told in a unique way. The music in this film provided by Simon and Garfunkel helped give this its feel and actually was thoughtfully done in many ways. For example, the guitar playing slows down as Ben's car breaks down which occurred simultaneously. The camera-work in this film was also significant. Split screen and zooms were frequently used which is unique.",The Graduate

Don't get me wrong, the two youngsters had to go through some crap, Ben question what he wanted to do with his life, questioning his relationship with Mrs. Robinson, having the constant family pressure on him, and the same for miss Robinson. and that whole ordeal where Ben took her to a titty bar for there first date, i wish i could have jumped through the movie and slapped him. but the person i keep coming back to is Mrs. Robinson. and what here life will be like, and of the promise Ben broke when he began to pursue miss Robinson.

It just gave the feel an awkward feel to it and I did not find it enjoyable at all. The quick transition from being with the mother to being with the daughter was interesting but hard to understand. I am still confused as to why he ever admitted to sleeping with Mrs. Robinson, he totally could have gotten away with it. The music felt like it was on repeat, sure it was okay for a couple scenes but it became annoying rather quick. Montage of Mrs. Robinson exposing herself was actually well done, you knew you saw it, but I had to question if I really did or not because it was so fast and smooth. The acting was decent, Hoffman did his job well if his character was meant to be socially awkward while the other cast was average at best. It was a different story for sure, but I'm not sure I'd watch it again.",The Graduate

However, it was extremely intriguing and watching Ben and how he grew was remarkable. It definitely shows how so many people are lost during their college years, when all they've been told is that this is the time to find themselves. It's a stressful time and Ben handled it by ignoring his problems and becoming pre-occupied with something totally unrelated to his future- an unhappy married woman. It's also interesting how the end scene has Ben and Elaine both very happy initially, but then the realization that neither had any idea of what was next was unsettling- something a lot of college graduates feel.",The Graduate

Soon later, Ben and Mrs. Robinson end their affair but the trouble doesn't end there for Ben. He meets Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, and quickly falls for her. Ben finds himself in a messy love triangle with wanting to be with Elaine and not wanting to upset Mrs. Robinson, who is completely against Ben and Elaine dating. This movie could've been a big shock for audiences in the '60s because the Hayes Code had recently been broken.

331,CriticalViewing,Here's to you to Mrs. Robinson!,10,16 May 2016,"In this timeless classic, we follow Ben Braddock on his path of self discovery. This came at the turn of the counterculture movement in 1967. The very early frame of Ben's head in a fishbowl is very symbolic, because that's how he feels in life. That everyone is on the outside, looking in on him, yet they've always controlled and dictated the way his lie was lived. When Mrs. Robinson came along in this Nichols film, she turns his fishbowl upside down. And the rest is past, present, and future-time history! The title song by Simon and Garfunkel is very important in the telling of this song, as it embodies a feeling. The stanza lyrics, ""And in the naked light I saw- Ten thousand people, maybe more- People talking without speaking- People hearing without listening- People writing songs that voices never share- No one dare- Disturb the sound of silence"" is the most telling. A generation felt silenced, and in desperate need of disturbing the defiantly curiousness time, to disturb the silence they were forced into.

333,alooftrashman,As Awkward as Hitting Puberty,9,28 April 2010,"Wow, the sixties were an interesting time period. You've got the counter-culture Easy Riders on one end, and sweeping cougar trend starting with The Graduate.Mike Nichols knew what he wanted in this movie, and to sum it up in one word, it would be awkwardness. The camera's sense of space and character's sense of space during the entire movie was jarring and sometimes very uncomfortable to watch, but that's what Nichols was striving for, I think. You have Ben Braddock (played admirably by Dustin Hoffman) just graduating from college, and like so many other listless 20-somethings of that era, had no idea what he wanted. Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) of course had plans of her own.While mothers preying on young awkward men is nothing new nowadays, at the time this movie came out it was landmark and debaucherous all at the same time. Likewise, this movie was anchored by a haunting tailored soundtrack by Simon & Garfunkel, and some of their best songs were written specifically for this film. Tracks like ""Scarborough Fair"" and ""Sounds of Silence"" add to the awkward coming of age in the movie, feeling comforted and uneasy at the same time.All in all, definitely a movie worth watching, if not for its racy content, then certainly for some of the best cinematography of the era.",The Graduate

Its completely unique and one of a kind. It captures the feeling of social isolation perfectly. The editing and camera work are amazing, completely off the wall but amazing. So many quick cuts. The sound design is perfection. This film looks and sounds spectacular, its like you can hear every little detail. It really pulls you in, you get wrapped up in this world. Its a world we've probably all been at least once in our lives. Even though its main focus is on the generation gap of the 60s, this film still feels relevant today. Dustin Hoffman is at his best, he's so awkward, dorky, socially inept and charming. He has a lot of flaws but you can't help but root for this guy. This is one of the best films I have ever seen and it is possibly one of the best ever made",The Graduate

He surprised me though with his excellent acting. The scene at the party where everyone was in his face and the camera was close up was a good method of conveying how smothered he felt. Additionally the scene where he is in his scuba get-up showed how different he felt from his parents and their friends. I found the movie sad, realistic, and fulfilling. The editing was continuous and the narration smooth. I found it difficult to analyze the movie formally while I was watching it because the story was especially unique and I definitely became way too absorbed. Awesome flick.",The Graduate
336,bellsa037,Great Job Dude!,9,13 April 2010,"The first scene begins with the long take, and the camera moves following the main actor (kenesis). In the same time, the director opens the music with singing that is very appropriate for this movie in both content and form. I think putting the music with singing is a new thing to make a movie run smoothly, and it is definitely a way to promote the song too. In addition, the main actor has the character that is exact in the role of the movie such as his face or his manner that is the same with the concept of flat character. In the scene that the main actor lay down on the swimming pool we can see the switching between the picture of the main actor and the picture of water in the swimming pool. When the picture of the main actor is becoming dominant, the picture of the water is disappearing. When the picture of the water is becoming dominant, the picture of the main actor is disappearing. Moreover, the director use ""Ellipsis Tecnique"" to switch the shot between the room and his home many times. I think it helps to reduce the feeling of discontinuity between shots. After the main actress knew about the real between his mother and the main actor, the relationship between shots is not continuity(discontinuity editing) like his life that has no aim. Finally, he did something that is unpredictable with the brave heart that beat the audience mind, and the end of the movie finish with the same song with the beginning.",The Graduate

The music goes hand in hand with the storyline. Sam O'steen does a wonderful job at editing the film to fit in tune with the certain songs done by the group. Dustin Hoffman plays a great part in this movie. He is intelligent, but wittfully stupid in a fashion that is pretty funny. He gives his character a certain innocence throughout the film, which is very entertaining to watch him get in certain situations. The sexual content of this film really was revolutionary for its time. 1967 the cultural revolution was in full swing, and you can certainly see it portrayed in this movie. The rebellion against the Hayes Code, which would very soon after this movie get reduced by the federal courts was stand out. Certain scenes directly offend and step on the toes of Hayes code enforcers. I thought it was great to see, I think that it was director Mike Nichols way of joining in on the cultural revolution and making a bold statement that the old road is rapidly fading. I would certainly suggest this film to anyone. Great stuff.",The Graduate

But the best acting in this movie has to obviously go to Anne Bancroft. She is mazing in this movie and it is no wonder her character in this movie is referenced in so many other mediums.Another amazing thing about this movie is the filming.

Dustin Hoffman suits this role pretty well, being a very young, naive, and awkward college graduate. It's no surprise when his neighbor's mom, whom he has known for years comes onto him, he has no idea how to react. That is what i liked best about the film, was the cleverly written dialogue, and charismatic demeanor of young Ben. I also enjoy the negative take on suburban life this movie seems to have. There are also some beautiful camera work, such as the scene when he is underwater in the suit, or when he leaps onto his pool raft, cutting to him jumping into bed with the devious Ms. Robinson. What I didn't like however, was the gaps in plot line, and how this ridiculous situation just suddenly turned out alright and worked out for the better. There is no way Ben would ever be able to make sleeping with Elaine's mom, bringing her to a strip club, and onto of that stalking her all the way out to Boston, to ask for her hand marriage. And then he takes her away right at the fateful moment of her hand being put in marriage with some other guy?! The first half of the film has a lot of enjoyable moments, but I really can't make heads or tails of the second half.",The Graduate
340,kendraocon,Great Movie!,8,19 December 2012,"I thought the director was great and the cinematographer also! The techniques were just awesome and they kept you interested! They had many interesting shots and perspectives, it kept the movie more interesting. For example the one shot of Ben through her legs goes along with the context during that time. The shot of her body aligned with Ben's face with the quick switch of shots made it look like she had a hole in her body. The pool scene with Ben in the scuba shot, was the best scene of the movie because of it was all through Ben's eyes you could see everyone/ everything as he was seeing it. It was his point of view of the people at the party. When the camera is in the closet, it starts off with it being lit with the open door and then suddenly changing when she shuts the door. They did a montage shot of Ben different days and sometimes different locations, but mostly in bed.",The Graduate
341,yilmazomar,The Graduate,10,19 December 2012,"I liked how Dustin Hoffman portrayed the clueless and aimless college graduate. I think we've all been his character at one point or another. The humor in the awkward scenes between Misses Robinson and Benjamin were great, so was the tension and excitement. Misses Robinson was damn seductive and sultry and just a sexy lady all around and I love how that changed and how she became an evil sexy woman, she was subtle throughout the entire film. The music was wonderful, and the camera work was hip and smooth, the film felt youthful, it felt lively and sexy and naive all at the same time,amazingly seeing as it's over 40 years old.The story itself was strange and a nice change from the Hay's Code era I'm sure.",The Graduate
342,uziesuzie,great film,8,8 May 2013,"It was fun to see this film right after watching ""Midnight Cowboy"" and to realize what an amazing actor Dustin Hoffman is!! He's so good at playing so many different roles/characters. Over all I enjoyed the sound track but after a while the repetition of songs got a little too repetitious. I Didn't really get the ending? Were they at first excited to run off together, but then they slowly realized how much they were loosing? Or that they knew it was a bad idea? They didn't look happy that's for sure. This was a very scandalous movie for 1967, the Hays code was just ending. The content in this film wasn't considered acceptable since 1934, so I'm sure a lot of people were shocked when they saw this movie.",The Graduate
343,LizNaylor,The Graduate,9,1 May 2013,"This movie gets better every time you watch it. The storyline is just so obscure, you cannot help but get sucked in and see what happens. There are a few twists in the movie as well. The ending is one of those endings that leaves you sitting there, wondering what could've happened next. The soundtrack, although a but repetitive at times, was really nice with the movie, it was a unique touch, to make it that much better. Dustin Hoffman did a good job playing an extremely awkward young adult in this movie. It made the plot that much better because of his acting. The Graduate is an all around good movie because of its interesting plot, good music, and good acting. This is a definite must see for anyone who can appreciate a classic.",The Graduate
344,v-colarusso,Plastics,9,4 May 2013,"This film encompasses the revolutionary (sexually in particular) period of time in between the 50s and 60s. It's metaphorical for the rise and fall of the American dream. It's also symbolic for what the country as a whole was going through in the late 60s. Benjamin's disdain for the transition period of post-collegiate life into adulthood is depicted beautifully. It's something anyone can relate to. The older generation's expectations of Benjamin and his clashing ideals on life is extremely comparable to a dilemma that many young adults face. The scandalous plot is a nuance for Hollywood at this period in time, yet it's beautifully done. The debauchery and rebellion of the younger generation is very characteristic of this period in American history. This film was fantastic.",The Graduate
345,westersnows,"""Mrs. Robinson, if you don't mind my saying so, this conversation is getting a little strange.""",9,29 April 2014,"I've waited so long to see this, and it was worth it. Dustin Hoffman is amazing, and such a versatile actor even when he was young. I could go on and on about how absolutely nothing in the film adds up correctly, but I won't because I think it somehow helps construct the odd sense of humor that's there. I will say, the one thing that bothers me the most is Ben's lack of self-motivation and reliance. He's ""drifting"" and he needs to rely on another person to give him direction. But, although this personally bothers me, it works with the story, and I'd say is rather part of the point. So parts are unrealistic, yes, but it's in such a way that's absolutely hilarious to the right taste. This is another one of those films that I think people think about too seriously—it's supposed to be funny!The cinematography is great, as is the editing. There are a lot of famous examples in this film, and they don't disappoint. My personal favorite is the use of the deep space and focus when Ben is implying to Elaine that his affair was with her mother. The camera is pointed at her over Ben's shoulder, and then pulls focus to Mrs. Robinson's face and we see Elaine's realization as is comes slowly back. The editing had great continuity, as well as the more famous examples like the smooth transitions from Ben's house and pool to in bed with Mrs. Robinson. The soundtrack is wonderful.",The Graduate
346,john-hogan23,"""You aren't one of those agitators, are you?""",7,4 December 2014,"My favorite thing about this film is the way in which I connect with Ben. Just having graduated, he faces the daunting task of moving forward from his academic career, but with no idea of what he wants to do next. I'm facing the same crisis. Months away from graduating, I face the same difficult decision as Ben. I have no idea what I want to do with my life. What I love most about this connection I had with the main character is, despite it all, I don't find Ben relatable whatsoever, and I think that's absolutely hilarious.The Graduate's great sense of humor is personified wonderfully by its leading man Dustin Hoffman. He's a handsome guy, much better looking than me, and I envy that, but he manages to gives his character Ben a remarkable awkwardness. It's his performance that gives the events in the film weight. He presents himself as the type of person that could really cause these types of ridiculous situations. It's not enough to make you feel like these things could actually happen, but just enough to give it a relate verisimilitude as a film. Bonus points to me for that wonderful use of narrative jargon.The film has plenty of flaws, however. The most prominent of which being the accompanying soundtrack. I have to imagine Mike Nichols was dangerously high when he decided it would be a great idea to use the same handful of Simon and Garfunkel songs dozens of times throughout the film. The narrative structure of the film also bothered me a bit. It spends quite a lot of time on Ben's affair with Mrs. Robinson, which is good by itself, Anne Bancroft gives an excellent performance, but it doesn't leave enough room for the rest of the story. Ben's relationship with Elaine Robinson is so rushed that the film takes a big hit. The second half of the film always influences an opinion of the film more so than the first, it's fresher in your mind, it's what you're dwelling on when the film ends. The rushed nature of their relationship is obviously intentional, as evidenced by the final scene, but that doesn't necessarily mean it works.All in all, The Graduate is a completely unique film, and that's why people love it. It doesn't have to conform, so it doesn't, and that's something to be admired. I know I enjoyed it, but I'm not really sure of my final verdict on the film, and the thing is, I didn't really need to be to write about it. That's something not many films can do.",The Graduate
347,m-meehan-28239,The Graduate,10,13 May 2016,"This is easily my favorite old movie I have watched in while. The graduate is a great representation of new Hollywood. The film is just super refreshing after seeing a lot of older darker shot films. The Color is extremely bright and vivid. The content helped push the limits of film with its main topic being infidelity. The real masterpiece however is how they are able to make it so funny. This movie had me laughing the entire time. The editing helped a lot like when he is about to have sex he turns off the lights and the song comes in ,""hello darkness my old friend..."". This is just a really good movie even today.",The Graduate

There an unexpected depth and somberness for a romantic comedy.

The swimming pool is a metaphor that is especially well done, reflecting both leisure with apathy and boredom. Great music choice that makes the film more memorable.",The Graduate
349,dwanehoyt_jrstaff,Fantastic Film!,10,15 December 2010,"This film is such an American classic and can be enjoyed during any time period, such a fantastic film with great actors and an amazingly awesome storyline.The film revolves around fresh-out-of-college Ben whose parents expect great things from him. At his graduation party an older woman, Mrs. Robinson, asks him to drive her home in his new car as her husband had already left. He complies after a while and upon arrival at her house she begins to seduce him and after the awkwardness settles they start a sexual relationship with each other. The relationship goes on until Ben's parents hound him to ask her daughter out on a date, the affair unknown to them obviously. He resists to ask her until his parents force it and because of the fact that Mrs. Robinson said that she absolutely did not want him to be dating her daughter or she would expose him. He takes Elaine, Mrs. Robinson's daughter, on one date where he intentionally tries to make her not like him in any way. As the night went on however they take a liking to each other and he risks his relationship with her mother to go with her. She finds out about he and her mothers affair and wishes to never see him again as she goes off to college in the big city. He's determined to marry that girl and follows her to her college much to her dismay as she's already planning to marry someone else. The marriage falls through because she still loves them and they run off together much to her mother's dismay.A really great film with a great storyline and great actors.",The Graduate
350,Amym-24,Awesome Film to Watch!!,10,15 December 2009,"Moving ahead into the future can either be exciting or scary for an individual.It can be very scary if the individual has no idea how to let out their emotions and go achieve their goals and desires that they want in life. It's important for people to be honest with one another as well as themselves in life. If there's something that the person wants, then they need to get the courage to get it, despite the other individual's opinion against your goal. Never do anybody else's bidding for them because they'll prevent you from obtaining your goal or that special somebody that you love. Otherwise, you'll regret it in the end.The Graduate is the best movie that shows how an individual can be determined to be with that special somebody for the rest of their lives and achieve that goal, through many obstacles that block their path. It's important not to have an affair with somebody's mother because they're afraid to let their emotions out about the mother's daughter that they love so much that they'll do anything to win her love. The plot is easy to follow and captures the viewer's interest right away. The use of back-lighting and shadows on the character's faces are great and dark in contrast through the artificial lighting. The depth of field on Hoffman as he's watching television was shot well. Selective editing was used well to show Ben's path in the diving suit as he tests the new suit in the pool. The overall acting in the film was excellent.If you're interested in viewing a classic coming of age film, then this film is great film to watch. With it's interesting screenplay, great cinematography, great acting, and good plot, The Graduate is an awesome film to watch!",The Graduate
351,B-Seide24,"""Mrs Robinson are you trying to seduce me?""",10,10 April 2010,"I watched this movie in my history of American cinema course and it was by far the most enjoyable film of the class. Dustin Hoffmann is as good as it gets in this 1967 film directed by Mike Nichols. Hoffmann does an amazing job of showing you what it was like for a college graduate who never really got to ""live"" during his college years. A truly great coming to age story and honestly now one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time. Anne Bancroft who plays the seductive wife of Braddock's fathers partner in business gives a performance for a woman that had not really seen before because of the stupid hays code. The use of cutting and ellipsis are displayed perfectly from frame to frame and adds a whole new dimension to the film. The use of the song ""sounds of silence"" is very key to the movie. It sets the tone for the movie and ends it perfectly, in both turns it signifies how in life, sometimes you lose the way of things and your stuck in silence trying to peace back what once was your dreams and ambitions.",The Graduate

A story like this cold not be told correctly under the Hays Code, and when the story begins to reveal the direction it is heading, the filmmakers begin to intentionally break all the rules including one's associated with photography like the 180-degree rule. The music captures Benjamin's emotions perfectly in the film which repetition captures how they never seem to change, no matter what he goes through,and is constantly stuck in a bit of a funk and encountering problems.

And considering it was made at the height of the 60s, The Graduate still holds up amazingly well. Hoffman's performance is by turns funny and realistic, while the supporting cast makes the most of their well written roles. There are many very funny moments too, but in the end, many of the sequences stand out because they are technically brilliant. And for a comedy, that's a great achievement.",The Graduate
354,GoodBen,The Graduate review,8,16 December 2011,"Overall, I liked this movie. It had some funny dialogue and a great soundtrack from Simon & Garfunkel .There were also some funny scenes, like when Ben's father makes him wear the scuba suit to show off to friends. However, I also thought this movie was very frustrating just because every time the character Ben tried to explain what really happened between him and Mrs. Robinson, no one believed him. Another frustration was the fact that Mrs. Robinson was being very mysterious as to why she wanted Ben all for herself. The movie always kept you guessing because you didn't know what would happen next or if Elaine and Benjamin would end up together. The ending also made me wonder what happens to them later.",The Graduate

I liked it very much, yes, and the way Ben reacted to Mrs. Robinson's seduction was quite funny. In fact, there were several parts of the movie that I found quite entertaining. But, there were other parts where I just found it to be a little hard to follow or just boring. I'm really not sure if I love this movie, or just think its okay. It was very entertaining, and I would certainly watch it again, but for some reason, it just felt to me like it was missing something, though I can't quite put my finger on what that something might be. I would still recommend this movie, though.",The Graduate
356,t-covino,The Graduate,9,8 May 2013,A very odd love story to say the least. It is quite the comic film in subtle ways and it has a lot of romantic twists. As Dustin Hoffmans character tries to dodge his bosses wife mrs robinson but at the same time he is falling for her daughter. Dustin Hoffman does as really good job at acting as a newly graduated college student trying to get on his feet and stay away from trouble.The film is very good at continuously filming and rotating in conversations. I like how the direct shoots his scenes and focuses on specific aspects to show you what the character is focusing on. I thought it was a good movie with a very good performance by Dustin Hoffman.,The Graduate

I feel like everyone has been in the main characters shoes before( not knowing exactly what you want to do with your life). The theme was very relate-able. I feel as though everyone had a specific character that they could some how relate to. The music in this film was something that stood out to me. It was a bit more modern. I adored the fact that they not only made this movie a drama. But they also fit a lot of comedy into the film. I feel as though Dustin Hoffman played the role of a personality actor. I felt like I've seen the same persona played in other films he has starred in as well.",The Graduate
358,bayhorse,A Pricelessly Symbolic Reflection of Its Era,10,28 January 2007,"This film, in form and style, too, is a uniquely gifted work of art; on a par with other, more wastefully ""forgettable,"" so-called ""grade B"" masterpieces, such as Desire In the Dust (a must, for every Raymond Burr fan), and Hell on Frisco Bay (an equal must, for every Edward G. Robinson fan). The latter two had apparently been conceived, or, at least, might just as well have been, for the very purpose of showcasing the induplicably villainous talents of, again, Raymond Burr, as Colonel Ben Marquand, and Edward G. Robinson, as Victor Amato; whereas, quite obviously, Anne Bancroft herself stands out, to this selfsame end, as Mrs. Robinson, in The Graduate; along with a no less outstanding supporting cast, as is also the case with the other two thus far mentioned. While my own release from prison bears certain outwardly, superficially, and commonly misleading similarities with those of Dustin Hoffman alone, in addition to a strong personal identification with the nature of his internal struggle as well; it is, nevertheless, my sense of deeply temperamental empathy with Alan Ladd, from Hell on Frisco Bay, and with Ken Scott, from Desire In the Dust, which serves, about as overshadowingly, to set me just as apart from Hoffman, too. I'll even expand the analogies here, by referencing myself as a cross, between John Cassavetes, from Crime In the Streets, and, again, John Cassavetes, from Edge of the City; or, similarly, again, to Hoffman, too, but much more grimly, as a cross, between Farley Granger, from Edge of Doom, and Paul Anka, from Look In Any Window. . . . Despite my enormous head start, over Alan Ladd, in the sense that he'd begun, during mid-incarceration; his own extremely volatile level of intensity had been very equal to mine, on both counts, in my case, prior to his period of confinement. However, Ken Scott had required barely no time at all to catch up, on one of the two counts, subsequent to his release; just as, by now, he's the only one with whom I bear any kind of similarity, at least in one sense, during the very end of his own extremely well-crafted Morality Play. Unlike with him, however, my own particular story-line is not entirely finished yet, even though it is historically just around the bend; as my own real-life version of Jo Van Fleet, from East of Eden, along with her other son, are also about to discover. Indeed, an equally superlative performance, by Edward Binns, from Desire In the Dust, is about to make its mark, too, the hard way; particularly with relation to those who also participate in the selfsame profession he did, but much more commonly than superlatively. Fortunately, the relatively imminent ending which I currently anticipate is much more historically if not otherwise so very circumstantially well-timed than had been the case, say, for Preston Foster, from The Last Days of Pompeii, or Kirk Douglas, from Spartacus; even when the latter had decided he could endure no more, let-alone when Laurence Olivier had finally had enough of him. What I have to concern myself with the most, however, is the extent to which the much more endurably noble temperament, of Spartacus, is still being displaced, in my case, with the one of, again, Kirk Douglas, from The Last Sunset, during his more dangerously, irrepressibly volatile intervals. Likewise, Al Pacino, even at the end of The Godfather II, let-alone III, just as analogously and tragically comes to mind; alongside the equally unfortunate relevance, on second and third thought, of these very same segments, from Stallone's Rambo saga. . . . I do consider myself fortunate, nevertheless, that my story hadn't already ended, long ago, in the same way it had for Dustin Hoffman, or even Alan Ladd. More to the point, it probably wouldn't have made any difference, had I decided to continue the same senselessly masochistic ritual, right up to the back of the church; let-alone while slugging it out in a speed boat, against all the forces of hell! How brutally laughable that I had ever wanted it to work at all, contrary to the dignity as well as patience and self-control which required an alternate form of education to become more perfectly-ingrained; and which, even despite my current imperfections, has a much better chance of finally sinking in on time. Even then, I'd also despised the entire lot of them, no less than they did me; the way Jack Ging felt, along with Brett Halsey, about the former's own father and sister, at the end of Desire In the Dust. Regardless of how much time life proceeds to grant their kind, they only seem to continue feeling more and more delighted about what they are; to the point where I also deeply identify with Burt Lancaster, from The Swimmer, and feel just as Desperately, Fatalistically Vulnerable, during my numerously weakest moments, also like Anthony Quinn at the end of La Strada. Vincent Price, as The Last Man on Earth, is an appropriate analogy, too; alongside Charlton Heston, as The Omega Man! I feel as fed up, and for the same reasons, as Dr. Louis J. Prescott (Gene Lockhart), when he dived off the mast, to his death, in The Sea Wolf!--Or like Rod Serling's Leading star, from Number Twelve Looks Just Like You, as well as The Obsolete Man! And let's not forget John Hurt, under the Tutelage of Richard Burton, in 1984! They still despise me, but with even less reason, as well as more, than Brett Halsey had, for popping Ken Scott in the jaw; just as even the latter had much better reason than I would have, were I to reply, to the numerous jabs I'd received, by saying, ""I don't blame you for doing that, doc!"" However, my warning is just the same as his, but on even Higher Authority than they're so hysterically, violently, idolatrously venerating, when he continued, ""But don't try throwing another one!""",The Graduate

Dustin Hoffman was extremely well casted as the main character Ben. His silly awkwardness creates a likability and a connection to the character that not many films can get across, especially when you break down the film to its core and discuss that it is a film about a 20 something year old man who has sex with both a mother and her daughter, the mother of whom is married. The mother, played by Anne Bancroft, plays the character of Mrs. Robinson so well, even though she is an immoral spiteful woman, you can NOT help but really really like her. The film's use of Simon and Garfunkel is also one of the things that makes this film really worthwhile to me.",The Graduate

I finally have watched the movie to the catchy song, here's to you, Mrs. Robinson by Simon and Garfunkel. I never knew this song was from this and for this movie. All in all though, I loved this movie from start to finish. It was a perfect plot and Ben was your typical kid who doesn't know what to do after college. The whole scenario with having an affair with someone's wife, then falling in love with their daughter was brilliant. The quality of the movie was great and the color looked really good. The best scene to me was at the end of the movie. I loved it when he was standing at the top of the church banging on the glass door. He didn't have a care in the world and he was going for what he really wanted. It was really cool. But after that, when their on the bus driving away was the best. They got on the bus and they went to sit and the back and seemed very happy. When the bus drove away, the look they both gave each other was perfect. They both looked like they knew they messed up with what they had just done and that they couldn't take it back. The bus was already leaving symbolizing that there was no turning back.",The Graduate

Although this movie seems to move a little fast toward the end, it shows that kids those days simply made decisions to make them, without thinking about the long-term consequences that they would face. Hoffman's monotone voice throughout the whole film adds to the mystery that he is trying to depict in his character. The music in this film fits perfectly with every scene that it is in.

Its characters have little to no growth throughout the film and when they do change the changes make no logical sense. What the movie tells the viewer is happening and what the viewer sees are two entirely different things. Benjamin Braddock is supposed to be seen as a confused young man trying to find his purpose while being corrupted by an charming older woman who then falls in love wither her daughter.. Instead we are shown a weak willed little man who is taunted into sleeping with a cold old woman who then becomes a her daughters stalker. None of these characters are endearing. None of these characters make decisions that would rationally be made even by those caught in the throes of late adolescent confusion. There is some creative direction in the movie. However the long montage scene only serves to throw off the viewer's sense of time. And endless folk rock songs do not aid the films tone if they are way overplayed. This is a movie meant to portray the new generation breaking off from its parents generation.

The use of many different cinematography methods made this a movie that you discover something new about it every time you watch it. The different camera angles used and the filming techniques cease to amaze me. The scene underwater in the pool with Ben all dressed up in the scuba gear to the scene and the point of view is of him looking out of the mask really caught my eye.

A confused college grad, stuck in the inevitable in-between of youth and adulthood, who is seduced by the experienced Mrs. Robinson. Dustin Hoffman gives an unforgettable performance as Benjamin ""Ben"" Braddok, so convincing as the depressed, lost, and hilarious 20 year old he depicts. The editing of this film sets it a bar above the rest, with some truly fun match cuts thrown in there. (Ben crawling onto his pool float cutting to him crawling onto Mrs. Robinson comes to mind) The Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack is timeless, and cleverly used to depict the emotions felt by Ben throughout the film. Even the ending, where Ben runs away with Elaine, and the camera lingers on the two just a moment longer to show that it isn't a happy ending- Ben is just as confused and lost in life as ever. While most of the film is a bleak comedic approach to the uncertainties of life, the ending is a very sober reminder that once the film ends, you are also a victim of those uncertainties. This is a must see, especially for those who find themselves in a similar position as Benjamin Braddok. I can't recommend this film enough.",The Graduate

368,k-cronin,Here's to you Mrs. Robinson,10,17 December 2009,"Some might say the soundtrack is too much,(Simon and Garfunkle) I loved every aspect of this movie. It was shot so smart and with such great effort and though. Ground breaking. 180 used all over this film. Sequenceing, timing, pace, each individual part of this movie had such a huge impact while you were watching it. I thought it was so smart and directed well. Montage throughout the whole movie. Director did a great job with the use of his camera during all the driving scenes. They seemed so real, like you were right in the car with them. Non- diagetic, but the songs conformed to the film. This sound track was such a HUGE part of this film. I loved the fast paced plot. The fluidity between the frames and the long takes. Memorable scenes. I really liked this film!",The Graduate
369,zthaleb,Comedy,7,10 May 2013,"This movie is a great classic comedy from the 1960's. Even though this film is funny it has a great story and great lessons. I also think that this film summed up the sixties perfectly. I think this movie has a funny way of answering everyones question: what do you do after you graduate college? The movie plays with a huge love triangle, which always makes things a lot more complex. Through out the movie you see the main character Ben Braddock, played by Dustin Hoffman, realize that he is making the transition into adulthood. I think that Mike Nicolas did a great job making this movie hilarious. A lot of people are scared of making that transition into adulthood but I think that this movie put it really lightly and made it super funny. I enjoyed watching this movie and I would recommend it to anyone who just wants a good laugh!",The Graduate
370,m-visker,The Graduate,9,8 May 2014,"This movie has been on my ""movies I need to watch"" list for a very long time and I can finally check it off! This is a brilliantly edited movie and extremely charming. It is great that even though this movie was made in the 60s it is still relate-able to teens today. The idea of not knowing what you want to do, but you know you want to do something ""different"" is still around, the youth felt misunderstood and separated from their parents and earlier generations. The Graduate is able to showcase this idea and make it funny. The Graduate as I mention before is fantastically edited. One scene that I enjoyed was in the beginning when Ben is just walking around his house at his homecoming party and is being constantly stopped by adults bombarding him with questions. The camera follows Ben as he quickly ends conversations but is only trapped into a new after only a few steps. We are able to feel the annoyance building up in Ben and also get the feeling of becoming claustrophobic, the camera stay tight near Ben as if we are standing right next to him. Another example of great editing is of course the scene when Mrs. Robinson tries to seduce Ben. We see Ben's shocked face and then the camera will cut to Mrs. Robinson and show a quick shot of nudity but only to cut back to Ben's face again. This technique is inventive and interesting. Showing us what Ben sees but only for a second at a time. This movie has so many amazing things about it, it's such a charming and relate-able movie even when it does get a little ridiculous.",The Graduate
371,Bcrosier1674,Absolutely Fantastic Piece of Film,9,8 May 2014,"When I saw the end of the movie, I immediately thought of Wayne's World 2, and I knew where they bit that end off from. And now, with hindsight being the clearest, they picked an excellent film to rip off. Dustin Hoffman, playing the recent college graduate, which I can feel for, does an excellent job of portraying the cluelessness that we as young people have when the world that we know of ends. Add a sociopathic cougar into the mix, and it seems easy to believe that the young man had more than enough on his plate. To me, this film is special, because it was one of the first to really break free from the Hays Code, which had been lifted earlier that year. Without the restrictions, this film tells a great story, and pulls you in with a fantastic soundtrack. A definite must see.",The Graduate
372,connorsalisbury18,Dustin Hoffman is Superb,9,9 May 2014,"The Graduate (1967) directed by Mike Nichols, is an interesting film, that is so good at what it does. It combines drama with humor and Dustin Hoffman's love triangle is fun to explore. The film is successful, because the writing is so well done. Mrs. Robinson is seductive towards Benjamin, but she does so in such an entertaining way, through her actions and dialogue. The film has great shots too, close ups, and far shots, and pans. The film has a good soundtrack, featuring folk artists Simon and Garfunkel, and their type of music fits the feel of the film. Overall, I give The Graduate (1967) a 9 out of 10.",The Graduate
373,jmille42,Top 5 Film Class Movies: FILM #4,7,27 July 2005,"I am going ""Old School"" with my 4th favorite film from class with Mike Nichols coming of age hit The Graduate. A very young Dustin Hoffman plays Benjamin Braddock, an extremely shy and indecisive college graduate. He returns home with the pressures from his family and friends about his future goals (which he could care less about). The very attractive Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) turns Ben's life upside down when they begin sleeping together. The situation does not get any easier for the young man as he falls for Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, despite a stern warning from the seductress.You would not know it unless you watched this film two or three times, but Nichols is a genius with the symbolism he uses in showing the confusing journey that is Benjamin's life. Framed portraits of clowns on the wall, the water motif, and the selective focusing are just a few of the now famous traits of his film that shows the goofy mannerisms and entrapment Ben has encountered. Hoffman portrays one of the finest ""airheads"" I've ever seen on screen. Not in the sense of someone who is dumb, instead someone who is always unsure and careless.This film is listed as a comedy, but probably will not provide the guffaws most would expect. The comedy comes from the relatable situations Braddock faces and the very odd ways he chooses to handle them. ""Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me. Aren't you?"" Even this famous quote shows his unconfident demeanor and social anxiety. Nichols also shows his psychic abilities with Ben receiving the unwanted advice to invest in ""plastics."" Keep in mind, this film was made in 1967.",The Graduate
374,nhudak-99559,An unrealistic love story but still a good one.,8,16 December 2015,"After watching The Graduate all I can say is, this is an over the top love story and I love it. Now, with this film I didn't know what to expect going into it. I thought it would be about a coming to age sort of movie where we would follow our main character as he tries to figure out what to do with his life after he has graduated from school. But was I so wrong. The issue I have with this movie is that it changes half way through the film. What was first starting off with our main character having an affair with a married woman and keeping it a secret. To then go out and try to marry her daughter. Honestly there was no real reason for the daughter to become the main focus in the film after going half way through. It would've been more interesting if the movie had our main character exposed that he had an affair with a married woman and then have his life go down the drain. Then see him try to recover from it. I'm not saying that I don't enjoy the movie because I really do. I feel as though the direction it took could've been done differently. Plus there is so much Simon&Garfunkel songs that I can take until I find it annoying. Either way i recommend that you go and check it out to see how it all ends for our college graduate.",The Graduate
375,cwangz,Talk about a love triangle!,9,5 May 2021,"I love this movie. What I enjoyed the most was the constant movement of the camera, zooming in and out of people's faces quickly and following the characters every movement, as if the camera was on them. I also really loved the characters, especially Elaine. She was wise and kind, but also held her ground and was smart about the situations she faced in the film.Side note: I never knew that last scene from ""Waynes World"" was very clearly based off of the ending of this film! I loved making that connection!",The Graduate

Nichol's knew how to use the camera to put his audience into every emotion, every ambiance, every minute that passed by. The writing behind this film is filled to the brim with hints and clue and details. There's such a big nod to how Ben is stuck at a crossroad in his life; whether he goes for someone older or younger... for starters. We constantly see that symbol of elder vs youngin'. The score of the film was absolutely delightful and added so much more character and overall cinematic development to this movie.",The Graduate
377,aeiyok,Week 13 IMDb: The Graduate Review,8,3 May 2021,"The initial scene in the graduate starts by following our main character Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) through the airport. Soon were at his house where a party Is being thrown in his honor. Throughout this party he's very unhappy so he escapes to his room. Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) meanders her way into his room and gets a ride out of him. As they arrive at her house she tries to seduce him. Being uncomfortable he evades the situation. After some pondering and a night at out he calls her on her proposal. They get a room and after some challenging from Mrs. Robinson they do the deed. Their meetings become nightly and his behavior gets erratic as well. In their last meeting Mrs. Robinson says Ben is not good enough for her daughter Elaine. (Katherine Ross) Elaine comes back from college and, Ben forced by his parents takes her on a date. After purposely blotching the first part of the date to preserve the relationship with Mrs. Robinson he changes his approach. As their date gets good they visit the hotel Ben and Elaine's mom use to get nasty. Elaine discovers he's having an affair but doesn't know who. The next day before their next date Mrs. Robinson blitzes Ben's car threatening Ben about telling Elaine about the two of them. Ben Blitzes Elaine to let her know but she figures it out by herself. The two separate and Ben takes a lot of time to stalk her and be sad from afar. Eventually Ben decides to pull up to Elaine at college to win her back. Ben actually does after some persistence but in a turn of events Mr. Robinson (Murray Hamilton) pulls up on him. To lecture him and get him to stay away from his daughter. Elaine then proceeds to get married to Carl Smith (Brian Avery) who is the rebound. After attaining information from various individuals Ben finds himself at the wedding. He ruins the wedding and takes off with Elaine. THE END.The Graduate is a post Code era film. This film dived deep into the sexual nature of the human experience which was lost for 26 years. It also throws in great foreshadowing in the case of mentioning Elaine coming back from school multiple times until it becomes important. Also with Mrs. Robinson stating as an athlete Ben wouldn't smoke, then him immodestly taking up the habit. This movie is filmed in Ben's point of view. They use different shots to depict that which gives a more personal feel. For example when Ben is stalking Elaine you see a long shot of Elaine and her family from his eyes. This movie is a master at thickening the plot. As predictable as it was the road was windy which added strength to this film.",The Graduate
378,chasingllamas,The Graduate,10,16 December 2009,"Mike Nichols' The Graduate (1967) is filled with memorable quotes and witty dialog, a great soundtrack and introduction of the young Dustin Hoffman. The use of color was becoming a more prominent part of movie making. The color usage in The Graduate gives such life and thrill to the film. The colors were soft when they needed to be and also vibrant when the story picked up.The camera-work in this film is noteworthy because of the angles and focus. The dolly shots stood out the most for me. The scene where Mrs. Robinson tells her daughter of her relations with Ben Braddock wouldn't have been the same without the drastic zoom out technique. Mrs. Robinson is standing across the room from Ben and the camera is close up on her face and then it pulls back in a fast motion making her seem so distance from not only the camera but from Ben and the world.

The reason it is such a great scene is that it's all in first person so you know exactly what Dustin Hoffman's seeing and there are no cuts during the shot.",The Graduate
380,spdowling,A rare combination of great comedy and compelling drama,10,13 May 2011,"Mike Nichols' The Graduate(1967) has all of the elements that make for a truly great film and Nichols deftly handles all of the elements in creating one of the most iconic films in the history of cinema. The acting, photography, writing, music and tone are all flawless. As a comedy or a drama alone it would shine but the film's ability to combine the two is what makes it historic. Dustin Hoffman's Benjamin Braddock represents a generation of young people who see the world far differently than their parents and grandparents and believes that the meaning of life is not found through climbing a corporate ladder or following the path that is set before you by others but by making your own way and enjoying life at every turn. This was something of a revolutionary philosophy in the 1960s and the social significance of The Graduate was just as great as it's comedy and drama.",The Graduate
381,floridanate,Scarborough Fair,9,24 August 2003,"Despite the over playing of Scarborough Fair which drones ON and ON in the film (Simon and Garfunkel ROCK, but enough is enough...) this movie is fantastic.It's the story of a young man graduating college, at that great cross road in his life.  ""I'm a little worried about my future,"" Hoffman's character says throughout much of the film.  This movie redefined comedy, and pushed the boundaries of acceptable sexual material in a film.  This was Dustin Hoffman's breakthrough role, and, in my opinion, his best peice of work.
WATCH IT!  It's well worth any rental or purchase price.  Also, it makes watching Wayne's World 2 ***A LOT*** FUNNIER.",The Graduate
382,als_1223,"An excellent, excellent movie.",8,12 December 2009,"I have seen this movie several times, and the story is something that still hits true today. There have seen several films made since The Graduate that have had the same story line, with a man falling in love with an older woman and then her daughter, but none have done it as well as The Graduate. Dustin Hoffman did an excellent job for his first above the title debut and he really makes you feel for his character and everything that he is going through. Anne Bancroft was great as Mrs. Robinson, and she really made the viewer believe that she was a much older woman pining for Hoffman's Ben Braddock, even though in actuality Hoffman is only six years younger than Bancroft. Katharine Ross did well as Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, who Braddock eventually fell in love with, but her character is nowhere near as iconic as Bancroft's and Hoffman's. While I absolutely adore the very last scene, the wedding scene, and the scene when Ben is underwater so he can deliberately not pay attention to what his parents and their friends are saying are definitely a few of my favorite scenes. Director Mike Nichols was able to make this film amazing and shock people with the affair (even though by today's standards, this is normal) due to the end of the Hays Code. And one cannot forget the soundtrack done completely by Simon and Garfunkel, that alone made the movie even more watchable.",The Graduate

It just seems so cool and funky. I'll start by saying Dustin Hoffman played his part perfectly. He played an accurate out-of-college student who thinks a little differently than most. Mrs. Robinson who is played by Anne Bancroft is smart, beautiful, and crafty. The story is wonderfully told with the help of Simon & Garfunkel, whom I love. The music fits the feel of the movie very well, very 60s. Another thing I loved was Katharine Ross who played Mrs. Robinson's daughter. Katharine Ross is a beautiful person who I would certainly drive great lengths for.",The Graduate

It was entertaining throughout the movie because it had a level of comedy that most people can relate to when they are faced with certain things. The ending was not how i wanted it to be in terms of as both of them drive away in the bus they look as though they might fear the consequences of what they did, I wanted them to be happy with their decision and have a happy ending with no remorse.",The Graduate
385,l-seidel,Poetry brought to life,10,23 April 2014,"Every once in a while you see a film that embeds itself beneath your skin. Whether it's the movie itself, or just happening to see that film at exactly the right time in your life. The Graduate for me, is one of those films.The beauty of this film is how the mood and feelings of the main character dictate everything else. The lighting, sound, editing; everything is all about Benjamin and how he is relating to this world he lives in. When he feels suffocated by the world he is in and isolated from everything that surrounds him, we too feel it in the absolute silence the director allows. In fact, the most poignant moments of the film for me were when the character didn't speak at all. The blank look on his face tied in with music that so brilliantly conveyed everything going on inside him that he just could not get out said more about his character in a single scene than some movies can pull off through their entire course. The plot itself mirrored the turmoil and confusion going on inside Benjamin. How indecisive and unsure he was about what he wanted to be and how he fit into the world. He wiles his time away with Mrs. Robinson (his feelings on this relationship can be summed up in the scene where his father asks him what he is doing and he responds, 'I'm drifting') while trying to find himself and understand just exactly who Benjamin is. When he happens across Elaine, he finally feels that rush that comes with having a sense of purpose. She is someone he can connect to and can feel like himself with. He has an identity with her as opposed to with her mother where he nothing more than a fake name. On that note, I adored the scene where he entered the hotel with Elaine, everybody calling him by this other name he has gone by for ages now; a reminder of how lost he has been with Mrs. Robinson. But this is taken away from him by Mrs. Robinson when she lies about what he has done and turns her family against him. His time drifting is now his undoing.The ending scene was perfection because it wasn't a clear cut happy ending. Benjamin made his decision to go after Elaine; to claim his identity in her outside of Mrs. Robinson and his own family, but the expressions on their faces as soon as the adrenaline wears off speak of the fact that they don't quite have things figured out yet. The world is not a cut and dry place, and because of that, the ending of The Graduate could not be cut and dry.",The Graduate
386,hourmatt326,The Graduate Review,9,26 November 2014,"The Graduate is not your typical comedy. It has very fumy scenes with a serious undertone of adultery and love. The story is a good one with all the characters being likable and towards the end you have very strong feelings for all of them being good or bad based on what you think of the film. The thing that stood out the most was the cinematography and how well it was shot. the editing, lighting and camera work is something we don't see as much in comedy's now a days with them doing nothing spectacular with the actions listed above. That is what I think separates The Graduate, from all other comedies I have ever seen, because of how passionate and well done the filmmaking is mixed in with a great cast, story and characters makes The Graduate an instant classic for me and gets a 9/10.",The Graduate

The great thing about this film is that it's really done a good job at connecting with the younger audience. I know I'm not male or anything, but I could connect with the main character since I'm a little awkward myself, and when I graduated from high school, everything was beyond me. I was lost and confused, but at least I didn't go down the route he did, which was still wonderful regardless. The wonderful acting was great, because this movie was different in where it didn't follow the flow of most other films, so it was wacky (like with the soundtrack of all things). Fun, wacky and perverted film that spoke for itself, and it's just great.

Laid back, not entirely sure on what to do with his life, Hoffman's character starts a purely physical relationship with his father's business partner's wife. Soon he starts going out with her daughter and things get heated. I liked the film and Dustin Hoffman's acting performance was probably my favorite part of it. One cannot leave out Anne Bancroft's acting as the sexy femme fatale-like Mrs. Robinson.he really works the character and makes the viewer infatuated with her yet hate her guts at the same time. Even still I found it easy to dislike certain characters because of the way movie characters very rarely know the main character's agenda.",The Graduate

The music, cinematography, dialog, and story are all compelling.Mrs. Robinson's seduction of Ben is classic and brilliantly written, filmed and performed. Those scenes you could watch over and over again and pickup (no pun intended) so many details missed during prior viewings.The social significance is varied; the older women/younger man, generational differences, social expectations, the impact of reaching middle age and the emotional immaturity of youth all collide here.

First of all the cinematography and soundtrack for the film were great. There were some great scenes and shots in the movie and the music of Simon and Garfunkel I think fit perfectly with the characters, situations, and the film as a whole. While some of the situations seem impractical and unrealistic, it doesn't really matter, because the characters, their emotions, and their reactions, are what really make this movie a great one, and the acting really helps make this a reality.",The Graduate

I'm referring to the opening scene in The Graduate where Benjamin (Dustin Hofmann) is followed while moving along on the conveyor belt in the airport. No words are spoken and the scene is only accompanied by Simon and Garfunkel's music.A very bold move by director Mike Nichols that promises a lot to follow later in in the movie. And rightfully so.... Hoffman brilliantly plays the role a young man that has outgrown adolescence yet is too young to be considered a man of the world yet.It's not a ""coming of age"" type of movie but does give a great view on the ""gap"" between youngsters and their rather old-fashioned a parents in the late 60's, and by doing so the movie is an interlude to what happened in ""the 60's"".",The Graduate

There are so many plot twists, it's hard to keep them all straight, but overall it is a great movie!From a plot perspective, the film is scandals with affairs and adultery. But it is a good romance movie. As the story unfolds, you are pulled into each person's moral story more and more. The film is all about morals and how easily they can be messed up.",The Graduate

Ben's awkwardness and honesty was amusing at first, but became painful to watch. I got second-hand embarrassment just from watching him. From the very first mention of the daughter I knew that Ben would fall for her and cause a lot of problems, then the movie would end with them together. It was just too easy and beyond predictable. It almost felt lazy in my opinion.",The Graduate
395,AlexCWM,Hilarious Cringe Comedy,8,28 April 2021,"The Graduate tells a very odd but funny tale. The dynamics in this film would almost be creepy, were it not such a funny comedy. Ben is convincingly awkward in a way that can be related to by many people of college age, which makes for some great cringe comedy moments.Benjamin's thoughts and experiences are captured wonderfully by the soundtrack, which is one of the best I've heard in a movie I had never heard of before. The style of this film is so very 60s, and yet it still feels like a story that could happen today.

396,tinyredspoons,Ahead of its time,8,13 May 2011,"The Graduate's (1967) release was a significant cinematically. The movie, unlike movies before it, discusses sex openly and depicts the life of a young man in a much more realistic light. Rather than glossing over and pretending all of mankind is sexless- as many movies of the time did. The film also shows nudity in quick flashes, which would have been unheard of only a few years before. The soundtrack of the movie is also ""more modern"", utilizing Simon and Garfunkle rather than the usual more classic soundtracks that seemed to be standard in older movies. The editing and filming of The Graduate are much more conscientious than earlier movies, calling attention to itself.",The Graduate

There are quite a few clever shots and transitions between scenes. The writing is superb and the acting is excellent. Dustin Hoffman is painfully awkward in a way that is almost hard to watch. Anne Bancroft is excellent as Mrs. Robinson. She plays her character with a cool and brooding tone. My only criticism is the reoccurring theme song, but I am clearly nitpicking. This trend seems to be very popular in the 1970's films (Midnight Cowboy, Harold and Maude).Otherwise this film is an absolute must see and a cultural milestone.",The Graduate
398,j-catanzaro,Strangely enjoyable,8,30 November 2011,"Let me start off by saying that I definitely enjoyed this movie. That being said, however, I do believe that I enjoyed this movie because of the extreme levels of strangeness and awkwardness associated with the plot and characters. As the movie starts we immediately jump into Dustin Hoffman's (at first) unwanted affair with Anne Bancroft, and this sort of sets the tone for the rest of the film. It is very humorous watching Hoffman fumble around as he attempts to entertain this older and clearly more experienced woman, and the movie is clearly a comedy. But then something happens- Mrs. Bancroft's daughter enters the story and I felt the movie sort of shift and lose sight of its original plot. Perhaps this was done purposefully, but I feel that once Hoffman meets Bancroft's daughter it turns almost into a drama. The movie still maintains its humor but I think we see a clear change in the tone from jovial boyhood antics to someone who suddenly decides they want to grow up and get married out of nowhere. I don't think this detracts from the film, but I feel that Hoffman's character changes gears so suddenly the viewer may not be ready for it. Still a great film however, and I would highly recommend anyone to see it. There were some interesting camera tricks during the early stages of the film when Hoffman and Bancroft start their affair, as we see almost a montage of sorts depicting Hoffman running back and forth between his parents house and the hotel rooms he frequents with Mrs. Bancroft, illustrating his shame in a way. Also, there are some cool underwater shots in the pool scene(s) and I think they were very imaginative for the time. It felt fresh to me and I thoroughly enjoyed it the whole way through. Overall, this was a great movie- go see it!",The Graduate
399,Piratezombie7,Heres to you Mr.s Robinson,8,15 December 2011,The Graduate came out in 1967 during the time of New Hollywood were all kinds of new subjects were used as film base. In this one the movie tackles the controversial topic of adultery. Dustin Hoffman's character Ben getting involved with a married women was something that up until the ending of the Hay code could not be talked about. The movie really tested what people could allow in a film and did it in a way that opened up many peoples minds to the use of film as a way to discus sensitive topics. Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of Ben is much weaker then the character in the book but his shyness is actual quite interesting and works in a way that makes you almost feel for him.,The Graduate
400,a-choppa,Benjamin Braddock is a recent university graduate who falls in love with a girl who's mother he's had an affair with in the past.,6,29 November 2012,"I found this movie very comical, but almost too far-fetched that I couldn't enjoy it to the extent that I have enjoyed other films. The cinematography was great and the cameraman's ability to show the point of view of the character in certain parts made the film interesting. I found the scene where Ben took Elaine on the date to be absolutely ridiculous, for the mere fact they fell in love when neither of them acted desirable on the date. Throughout the film, Mrs. Robinson continually expresses how much she doesn't want Ben to date Elaine but never explains why. However it can be inferred it's because she has feelings for him herself, it is never clarified. When Ben follows Elaine to Berkeley, she accuses him of raping her mother, and by simply telling her this isn't true, Elaine believes it and agrees to marry him. This may have been the most far-fetched scene of all. No right woman would believe a rape cry to be untrue by simply being told it isn't. Perhaps the wild ideas of the film are what make it so enjoyable to some people. It was entertaining and kept my attention, but I probably wouldn't see it again.",The Graduate
401,jsalavar,Would you believe...,7,7 August 2008,"The story didn't make a lot of sense. First, Dustin's character was all bummed out at the beginning, for reasons that were unclear and didn't make sense considering he just finished a very successful college career. Second, he had one date with Mrs Robinson's daughter, which started off terribly but ended well. On their attempted 2nd date she finds out about him and Mrs Robinson and ends with her crying and running off. Those were their only two interactions and yet on their 3rd meeting, which takes place several months later, she's open to marrying the guy.Oh, yeah, that is so true to life! (rolling eyes) Still, its entertaining and worth watching.",The Graduate
402,Natybug97,"Not great, but not bad",7,9 May 2014,"I have heard such good things about this classic movie, but I cannot say that I was enraptured by it. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie with fantastic acting. I just found myself constantly distracted, especially when they have the quick edits of when Ben and Mrs. Robinson get together. Ben and Elaine's romance is also a little far-fetched to me, it seems that after one night with he is completely smitten, and that's fine, but then he decides he is going to stalk her after she left him so that they can get married. I'm not saying that the movie was bad by any means, it was well done with some interesting photography, I personally enjoyed whenever he was in the pool because he always seemed to slip away to another version of reality. I also liked Mrs. Robinson. She was classy and sexy and confident despite all her life mistakes, her character was also very- well executed. The one thing that I did not like at all was the music! The soundtrack that accompanied the movie was definitely not my favorite. The Sounds of Silence and Scarborough Fair? No thanks. Especially the latter.",The Graduate
403,SaveFerris97,"Seriously, just watch the movie. Right now. Go.",10,9 May 2014,"Mike Nichols's ""The Graduate"" (1967) is easily one of my favorite films. It's a classic for a reason. Nichols perfectly summarizes both the rebellion of the younger generation, known as ""the generation gap"" that erupted in the 1960s, and the troublesome crisis that everyone goes through at some point in their life when they realize they have no idea what they want from it. The photography and cinematography of it is incredible. Every shot has meaning, every shot is innovative, and every shot adds to how amazing this film is. It's built on how artistic and creative the physical foundation of it is, and the story goes from there.""The Graduate"" would be nothing without its lead character, Benjamin Braddock, and his actor, Dustin Hoffman. I've heard that Hoffman's a method actor through and through, and this performance proves it. He fits the role perfectly. Benjamin, a recent college graduate who reluctantly goes to live with his goofy parents due to having nowhere else to go, is awkward, lost, confused, and most importantly, lacks motivation. His character stands for what everyone feels at times, and represents that part of us, but when he overcomes his life-induced faults and recovers the motivation to move forward with his life, it's truly inspiring. Hoffman portrays his character amazingly.Simon and Garfunkel's music is perfect for this film. It emphasizes both how achingly forlorn it can be at times, and how hopeful and beautiful it is.""The Graduate"" is awkward, realistic, and witty. While watching it with several other people I discovered that for some, like me, it's hilarious, because of my dry sense of humor, but for others it's simply more of a drama. I see it as a romantic comedy that is at times painfully sincere, and laughed my way through it.The most memorable part for me was the very last scene where Benjamin and his unfortunately troublesome choice of a love interest are sitting in the back of a bus, having just fled from a wedding, romantic-movie-style, and the uncomfortable moment that no romantic comedy wants to show comes: the inevitable ""what now?"". It's a paradigm of how awkward and real the film is.",The Graduate

405,lutzkevinandrew,The Graduate,7,9 December 2015,The Graduate is a fun and exciting film filled with humor and romance. Dustin Hoffman's character is priceless as he attempts to avert one woman and pursue another. The audience can definitely see a separation of the generations as the younger aged characters do everything opposite of what the older folks expect from them. The cinematography is beautiful and Director Mike Nichols does an excellent job at creating thrill and drama. Anne Bancroft is my favorite character just because she is beautiful and she does a fantastic job at seducing her prey. The Graduate is a great film and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. Owning this film would be great to add to the collection as well.,The Graduate

First off, the acting was fantastic. The main two characters, Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson, really played their roles well and made you either have empathy for them or hate them at times. The editing had an impact on the film, making it stand out. There are a couple scenes where they are dissolving and jarred to represent his point of view. The yellow coloring of the film made the feel of it more old school and as though him and his family live in this perfect little world. Aside from Cinematography, the meaning behind the Graduate was very important. It really showed that breaking out of your shell is harder than it seems. Not only that, but it shows that the stereotypical prep boys don't actually have it all. They actually are trapped in a world following their parents footsteps and can't act outside how they're expected to behave. Overall, a great film with a break through in film making and social rebellion and love.",The Graduate

The Graduate is such a great film and the cinematography was what did it for me. I did a movie breakdown on this film and really got to notice all the little details. The way the camera angles and effects conveyed the emotion of the characters was very well done. One scene that really stuck out for me was when Ben is lounging out in the pool and his parents are talking to him about his future again. The way they are angles standing over him with the sun glairing from behind portrays the suffocating way they constantly hover over him, always pressuring him to make something out of himself. You can feel the pressure from the low angle shot of the camera. Also, there wasn't much music in the film, but that made the parts with music that much more powerful. And of course the song Mrs. Robinson is epic!",The Graduate

How else to explain how bad it is, how many dramatic cheap shots, the way it telegraphs its sanctimonious ""insight"" into contemporary America of that time. With absolutely leaden direction by Mike Nichols---a former stand-up comic who specialized in smug superiority which he carried over to his next job description. His former partner in stand-up, as well as one of his exes, dealt in the same shoddy goods---Elaine May. Their rap-sheets read like indictments. Here we have Dustin Hoffman miscast as a ""sensitive"" guy---Dustin Hoffman is miscast every time he works: All the acting ability of a sea anemone.

413,tbello22,One of my favorites,9,28 April 2010,"Parts of this movie have been spoofed in so many television shows and newer movies but I never understood what they meant until seeing this film. The Graduate is a timeless film that will go down as one of the best films ever. I love seeing a young Dustin Hoffman because I have seen so many movies with him as he was older. The film touches on a issue that wasn't shown in film and the main character seemed shy and awkward towards the older Mrs. Robinson. I love that he fights so hard for the girl toward the end and eventually they run off together.The most important part of the film is the music that is used. I believe it is only Simon and Garfunkel that put their music into the film. Some of the songs are played more than one, something you don't usually see in films. It is to hard to find anything that I can complain about this movie. It is a classic and a must see.",The Graduate
414,tiffany_demeo,The Graduate,10,1 December 2010,"The Graduate was an excellent movie. I was very into it and couldn't keep my eyes of the screen. This is the first movie we have watched in our class that has been in color and to me makes a complete difference in the movie. Dustin Hoffman was one of my favorite characters, he did an excellent job playing Ben, he really played the role so well you actually believed it was really him and those were his own actions. Mrs. Robinson also was another top character of mine, she was funny in a serious way and you could tell a lot about her through her actions. Ben's parents were also hilarious and kept the movie with a little funny twist. The movie to me has a meaning, what goes around, comes around. Thats normally what happens in life anyways. I would so recommend this movie and I think everyone should watch it.",The Graduate
415,c-farrell7,The Sound of Simon and Garfunkel,8,15 December 2010,"The Graduate is a great movie for many reasons, one reason that may commonly be overlooked is its clever use of sound. The opening dialogue between Dustin Hoffman's character Ben and his father is accompanied by the diagetic ambient sound of the fish tank suggesting that Ben's thoughts are in another place. A similar effect is achieved during the scene where Ben must try on his Scuba suit for his parents party. While he is underwater the sound of his parents and friends fades away and all you hear is the bubbling mask and his breath. The soundtrack is mostly Simon and Garfunkel songs played during crucial scenes and transitions. There is a lot of nicely done match cuts including one memorable one where Ben is jumping up out of his pool and then it cuts to him diving into bed with his older mistress Mrs. Robinson.",The Graduate
416,k-hotaling1,The Graduate (1967),9,13 May 2011,"I absolutely enjoyed this film. I found that it definitely took advantage of the ""New Hollywood"" era where films were allowed to show things that were previously unacceptable due to the Hayes Code. I thought the acting was great - Ben played a lost and naive college graduate extremely well. The scene where Ben is in scuba diving gear and almost forced into the water by his parents is memorable and somewhat easy to relate to. It reinforces the fact that at that age we are so confused and unsure of our future, yet still rely on our parents for advice and guidance. The music is probably one of the most effective parts of the film especially for it's time. Simon and Garfunkel do an excellent job depicting the character's as well as the story's mood.",The Graduate
417,sushifish55,Amazing!,10,18 May 2011,This movie just helped solidify my love of the wave of New Hollywood films even more. Dustin Hoffman is amazing as the newly graduated Benjamin Braddock and Anne Bancroft role as the first seductive and then vengeful Mrs.Robinson is fantastic. While it is just my opinion I feel like Cinema really came alive after the death of the Hayes Code. Now I know along with this came the creation of plenty of films whose only goal is to entertain with shock value but pre-code movies just don't have the raw freedom post code movies have. While I know this isn't the main message of the film I feel like it does a pretty good job of showing it. First of all a man and woman even if married couldn't sleep in the same bed together and here you have a 40 something year old married Anne Bancroft seducing an almost 21 year old Dustin Hoffman; then latter Dustin Hoffman going after Katharine Ross who plays Elaine Robinson Bancroft's fictional daughter. It really showed off the new freedom Hollywood now had and in my opinion opened up cinema as an art form even more. Amazing performances accompanied by an amazing soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel and amazing cinematography by Robert Surtees make this one of my favorite movies and in my opinion one of the greatest films of all time.,The Graduate
418,dzuber32,Hey Mr. Robinson,8,11 May 2012,"This is a movie definitely good for any college student. In this movie there are many examples of diegetic and nondiegetic sounds, and on screen and off screen sounds. These types of sounds are seen together many times throughout this movie. Besides good sound, the cinematography was also impressive. I loved when Ben would go from the pool to the hotel room, from the hotel to his room, and from his room to the pool again. It was a good example of an ellipse as well. I loved Dustin Hoffman's part of Ben Braddock. He pulls off the awkwardness and shyness of his character very well. The writing and dialog in this movies makes it so enjoyable.",The Graduate
419,kevin_m_sullivan,Down with the Code!,8,12 May 2012,"The Graduate is a near-perfect example of a New Hollywood film. Physically speaking, the movie employs mostly-traditional techniques and is beautifully shot and edited. There are some scenes that could be considered innovative, such as that which depicts Benjamin's underwater view. The acting is superb and the dialogue is (mostly) realistic, which I have found to be a bit more common in films issued in the New Hollywood era. What truly makes The Graduate a decidedly New Hollywood (post-Hayes-Code) movie is its lewd content. It's safe to say that the on-screen relationship between Ben and Mrs. Robinson would have been a bit too much had the film been made just a few years earlier. Finally, what I think allows the Graduate to maintain relevance and bridge generational gaps is its themes, which among others include the youthful struggle for identity.",The Graduate
420,DennisJOBrien,A true classic film for the 1960's generation,9,25 November 2005,"What memorable characters and vivid portrayals by all concerned! It was the summer of love and a time for questioning traditional values. 1967 California is perfectly captured in this charming comedy. Who can ever forget Mrs. Robinson or the final hilarious scenes in the church and bus? Many do not realize that the introspective folk rock songs of Simon & Garfunkel had already been established hits before being adapted into this soundtrack.In 1967 there had been race riots in Detroit and a few other cities, a prelude to worse riots that would come in 1968. At the end of the year the Academy gave the Best Picture Oscar to ""In the Heat of the Night."" I suspect they felt it was the politically correct thing to do. However, the Best Director award was rightfully given to Mike Nichols of ""The Graduate."" Usually those two awards go hand in hand, so therefore I think ""The Graduate"" might have won Best Picture if not for the racial tension in the nation.",The Graduate
421,Sidster3,"Quirky, Confused, and Cute",8,13 May 2015,"""The Graduate"" (1967), was a surprisingly good film to watch, but I don't know why I was so surprised considering Dustin Hoffman is the lead. The music in this film was so unique and so perfect for each and every scene. The music led you into how to feel and then BAM hit you with the rest of it. Dustin Hoffman does an excellent job at portraying how confusing and overwhelming young adult life and graduating college can be. I honestly couldn't stand his parents though, but the actors who played them, William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson did a fantastic job at playing the clueless, annoying, and embarrassing parents. The cinematography and the editing in this film were award winning in my opinion and the film is well worth the watch just to see the unique and artful use of the camera and editing techniques.

Mike Nichols does a great job, the cinematography is fantastic in this film. I don't think Mike Nichols could've taken any better actors for the roles. Dustin Hoffman playing a young awkward college graduate and Anne Bancroft playing a seductive older woman. Ben(Dustin Hoffman) knows exactly how to play his role and he does it perfectly. While searching to find himself on what he wants to do following his completion of college he seems to be stuck no knowing. Soon enough at the end of the film Ben knows what he wants and that's to be with Elaine Robinson(Katharine Ross), daughter of Mrs.Robinson (Anne Bancroft). Many things about the film were very smart and well done like slowing the soundtrack as Ben's car slows down from running out of gas and the lighting in numerous scenes is done well also. Some of the voice over work could've been done better but, that's just about the only flaw of the film. This film is about breaking from the old and in with the new. This fits the category of New Cinema all too well. This film deserves a 9.",The Graduate
423,Emmajoy93,Great use of cinematography,9,6 May 2016,"This was a really great film because of all the work the cinematographer put into making this film something special. Something different for the audience. He used many different camera angles and techniques in this movie. For example when we see from Dustin Hoffmans point of view when he is in all the scuba gear and we see what we sees underwater while he is diving in the pool. They used different match cuts in this film and some reverse shots. And dissolve shots of Mrs. Robinson. I like how they used Simon and Garfunkel songs throughout the whole movie, I thought that was different than other movies. But the song Mrs.Robinson is a little different in the movie than on the radio. I think the movie really made that song popular. And I think Simon and Garfunkel became pretty popular to my generation because of The Graduate. I thought Dustin Hoffman was perfect playing the kind of awkward college graduate not sure what to do next.",The Graduate
424,famsmith,American Cinema Par Excellence,10,15 June 2003,"The Graduate is undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever made.  It is a film that works on a myriad of levels; as a comedy; as social commentary; as a coming of age film; as a satire about American family life; and as a pure entertainment.  The photography by Robert Surtees is visionary, it gives the precise look the film needs to set the tone for the story and precedes the boldness of underexposure that cinematographers would delves into only a few years later.  The script by Buck Henry is marvelous and a serves as all the script as both a foundation and springboard for great possibility.  In other word the nuances, the quirks, the subtleties that lend a film of the magnitude and resonance of The Graduate its distinctness always belong to the people that bring it to life, namely the actors and the director, but the screenwriter gives us the body.  The casting is one of those sort of conundrums or quirks of fate that all great works seem to have.  Initially as the producer of this film talks about they were shooting for a more typical all-american cast particularly in the case of Benjamin Braddock the track star, but looking back at it now with 20/20 who can imagine anyone else playing the role of Benjamin the way Dustin Hoffman played it.  This illustrates that sometimes a project takes on this whole life-force.  I'm not saying that the film was destined to succeed, there is no doubt that the film is a testament to the hard fought genius of artist like Mike Nichols, Robert Surtees, Buck Henry, Dustin Hoffman and Anne Banecroft.  With that said there are these things, these curiosities, these chips that seem to fall into place, a perfect alignment of the stars.  But at the end of the day to me the most beautiful thing about the film is the story.  You have these two products (in Elaine and Benjamin) of the so-called all-American family who had Mrs. Robinson not interrupted would have no doubt married each other, it had been set up from the beginning.  Note that when Ben comes over to the Robinson house to pick Elaine up Mr. Robinson says, ""It's about time you got around to this Braddock,"" and that Ben's parents are persistent in nagging there son to take Elaine Robinson out.  Perhpas things are not so different in America after all.  If Mrs. Robinson had intervened then there would have been nothing unique about the story.  But of course she does, she wants something for her self, to take something that her daughter might have had and to possess it for herself, in a sad way it is her last attempt at trying to reach out and connect with someone, and after it is over it is too late for her, she is dead.  In the end despite the brief road block of Elaine being married off to Carl Smith Benjamin's back up since he was deemed by Elaine's parents to be inadequate they have set things back on course, but not before shaking them up, and doing it their way.  But then we have the ominous and somewhat ambiguous ending where both characters get on th bus and go through different emotions, but not at the same time.  In the end these two characters must accept that in spite of all their kicking, scratching, world-shaking and hell-raising there is only so far they can go, they can only be so different.

Growing up is hard when you are in love with your lovers daughter. This is a scenario many men his age would dream of, but this movie clearly shows this path is not one to fantasize about, but one to dread.",The Graduate
427,mike-adly5,"In a Nutshell Masterpiece: ""The Graduate"" 1967 (8/10)",8,8 December 2010,"The Graduate...Here's to you Mrs. Robinson!40 years ago they made a romantic drama as fast paced as 21st century sci-fi action blockbusters. Starring Dustin Hoffman in his late 20s, The Graduate is a story of Ben Braddock (Hoffman), a recent college graduate who gets involved in an affair with Mrs Robinson, a family friend. Later on, Ben also falls in love with her teenage daughter Elaine, and there starts the complications.In many ways, the significance of this movie lies mostly in acting and dialogue. Having said that; there are three main characters that contribute to more than 80% of it; first of all, there's Dustin Hoffman who plays the lead role of Ben Braddock, picturing the ultimately realistic confusion of a recent successful college graduate, unsure of what to make up of his life. His tone, his gestures, his actions, his reactions, all showed worthy enough to gain his first of seven Oscar nominations in his career.Secondly, there's Academy Award winner Anne Bancroft, who plays sort of the center piece of the movie, in other words ""Mrs Robinson""; a hot, rich and strong woman in her 40s who finds satisfaction in trapping Braddock (Hoffman) in an affair. Anne Bancroft, a much bigger name then than Dustin Hoffman himself, was a necessary base for the whole acting cast to be built on, especially that the other two pillars of the movie were recent talents at that time. Bancroft has later earned a Female Lead nomination for her role in The Graduate.Last but not least, there is Katharine Ross who portrays Mrs. Robinson's teenage daughter Elaine; a young naive extraordinarily beautiful girl, who instantly strikes the liking of her mother lover Ben Braddock. Katharine Ross here excels in presenting the female equivalent of Hoffman's character, planting thoughts in the viewers' minds of what should and should not happen if they both had existed in a perfect world. Needless to say that if a movie's main reason of success is good acting, that we can only relate to a strongly genuine script. The Oscar nominated screenplay provided not only the complex reality in similar real life situations but also the blatantly realistic conversations that come with it. Now take that script, those actors and hand them over to Mike Nichols who's just made his directing career debut with ""Who's afraid of Virginia Wolf"", a picture that earned no less than 5 Oscars. If the first movie you direct earns you an Oscar nomination and wins another five, it's only fair that you win one on your second film, and that's what happened when Nichols walked away with his first Oscar for directing The Graduate and the only one won for the movie out of 7 nominations.The Graduate's identity is finally perfected by a soundtrack that spices its visual entertainment and takes it to a deeper dramatic level. Folk- rock duo Simon & Garfunkel's music fills up the film with various songs and background music from beginning to end. ""The Sound of silence"" has become a constant reminder of the picture for whoever watched it and the hit single ""Mrs Robinson"", which knocked off The Beatles from the top charts in 1968, forces whoever comes across it to recollect the whole Graduate experience, especially its ending.In a nutshell, The Graduate is a cinematic landmark of the 1960s with a directing Oscar win and 6 other nominations, and with a lead acting debut for legendary actor Dustin Hoffman. It is, without a doubt, an acting, writing and directing cinematic icon.",The Graduate

Nichols somehow fuses the beautifully, the product is a truly stunning film. Nichols creates an inner voice within Benjamin Braddock through the use of powerful cinematography and a great soundtrack, this inner voice is what makes this film so great. With the Hays Code now gone actors, directors and cinematographers had full creative and artistic freedom. So many doors were opened in the world of film in the late sixties, and it seems as though The Graduate led the way. Everything about this film is great, the storyline is so simple yet so complex. Everyone can relate to these feelings but no one knows how to deal with them. Benjamin Braddock is such an easy character to relate too.

Then when he finally does (he falls in love) it is taking away from him by some jealous crazy lady. There is a lot of great camera work in this movie. Like in the begging when Ben arrives home and everyone wants to see him. You get the feeling that all of these people are in you face and you can feel his frustration. And when he has the wetsuit on and you see his point of view from inside the wetsuit is great too. There are so many great quotes from this movie, as I demonstrated in the summary.",The Graduate
430,crimsonsanctuary,Okay,6,16 May 2010,"When it was released in 1967 and everyone had gone to go see it. The college crowds loved it because it was the first of its kind. It was a film that proposed adults were emotional sell-outs who thrived on being superficial and materialistic. The film is very creative in more ways than one. The first is the creative film shots that were filmed and the cutting of scenes and images suddely. The second is the sexual imagery which really keeps you on the edge of your seat and always thinking and wondering. I really liked how Hoffman's mother was deliberately made up to look like Mrs. Robinson and completely ironic for many reasons. Audiences were obviously very shocked yet intrigued by all this sexual innuendo and the lack of traditional values.It was such a huge slap in the face of traditions during the same time that society was questioning itself in the 60s, it certainly doesn't seem surprising that the film was one of the biggest hits and definitely created a new theme/genre in film history.",The Graduate
431,hollywoodjohnny,Instant Favorite,10,19 December 2012,"The Graduate, 1967The first time I saw this movie was in my History of American Cinema class. I had been wanting to see it for a while and wasn't really sure what to expect and I didn't have too many expectations for this besides the obvious one of seeing a good film. I could not even review this film and tell you that I went out the next morning and bought it on Blu Ray. Needless to say, I loved it. The second it was done, I wanted to watch it again. It became one of my favorite movies of all time after watching it just once. There were so many things about it that made me feel that way. There's a sense of sympathy you feel for Hoffman's character throughout the film. The cinematography and vivid colors make it extremely appealing to watch, especially for an older film. The soundtrack, which includes a reoccurring track from Simon & Garfunkel add to the mood of the film. And who could forget Mrs. Robinson, a character that, in a sense, made this film. Her relationship with Ben makes the film risqué and sexy in a way. I loved it. I recommend this to anyone who wants to see an amazing film.",The Graduate
432,miss_flowers,Fantastic,9,10 December 2012,"While I have my issues with The Graduate technically, it's definitely not to say it's not iconic and awesome in its' own right. The use of lighting is really incredible in this film, and really speaks to the time that it was made. Though everyone was pretty much ignoring the Hays code at this time, they still cut out the lights to avoid depicting anything beyond a single kiss between the two main characters, even though there wouldn't have been anyone to stop them if they had done that, and they would have just gotten a harsher rating. Moving on, the angles for certain shots were great, and there was very dramatic lighting a lot in the beginning. I especially liked the POV shots (one of the very earliest I'd seen) during the birthday party scene. There seem to be a lot of shots from very far away, which work very well when the main character is traveling or when he is driving or looking for his girlfriend in a sea of people on a college campus. The upwards-and-downwards angles during the final scene in the church were really great. Great plot, great movie. 9/10 would see again.",The Graduate
433,joem294,The right generation,9,9 May 2014,"When I look back at this film one thing I hear about it is that Dustin Hoffman was too old to take the role, but I myself thought he took the role and made it himself the graduate and acted the perfect way for the film. With the awkward moments between his neighbor Mrs. Robinson who he thinks one thing, but she says another he reacts so nervously and red that it is funny.The film that is surrounded by a man that just graduated college and his only friends at home are his parents friends. So what is he to do when he wants to be alone...drive off in his new car with his neighbor that turns into something more than what he was looking for.The film that shows the old generation doesn't belong with the young by showing the many times Ben meets with Mrs.Robinson, but once he finds a way to date her daughter he begins to see his world in a better and brighter way. The only thing is he has to get rid of the older generation not letting him be happy with the woman he loves.This film uses music very strongly to set the scenes for the perfect moments that will happen. Keeping the audience glued to the story. This film uses many darker scenes to show very little but sets the scenes like that perfect for the moment like that. The most camera-work used in this film is the moving camera with the car following the car as if the audience was in the car with Ben.",The Graduate

A mother should in no way consider it okay to even ATTEMPT to seduce a man less than half her age in HER DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM!!!! I understand the symbolism: She's trying to live through her daughter. But just... ugh. It doesn't help that every character seems like a crappy person, except the daughter. Mrs. Robinson is a manipulative old woman who can't control her hormones, Benjamin is a lazy young man who's unhappy with his life, and also can't control his hormones. Benjamin's parents seem like the type who don't truly care about what's going on in their child's life so long as it doesn't reflect badly on them. The only good part seems to be Simon and Garfunkel.

I was only 13 years old, can't understand how could Ben have sexy with Mrs. Robinson but fall in love with her daughter. Now, as time goes by, I understand that there is no relationship or feeling between Ben and Mrs.Robinson. They just meet each other and only satisfy with physiological need for each other. But when Ben sees her daughter's photo on the wall, we all know that he is falling into her. The point I don't understand is the daughter.

Here are the positive characteristics: Katherine Ross is (almost) unbelievably beautiful; the Simon and Garfunkel songs are great; the individual performances are interesting. Here's my problem with this film. How did a young man in 1967 graduate from college and still remain so clueless about women? Ben acts like he has no idea what Mrs. Robinson is after. How can that be? To me, that is unbelievable. He's supposed to be this brilliant student, editor of the college newspaper, etc., and he stutters and stammers and acts like he's never been with a woman. It's just ridiculous. OK, so imagine that you can accept that part. Can you then accept that Ben would think that it's going to work out between Elaine and him? Especially since he's basically stalking her??? ""Oh, by the way, Elaine, I've been sleeping with your mom for months and I was hoping that now I could just switch over to you."" HUH???? To me, the writing is the problem. He doesn't know people at all! This story made sense to me when I was 13. It really is written at the ""young teenager"" maturity level. Ben acts like he's about 16, instead of a college graduate.",The Graduate

Finally a color movie. some of the things I noticed throughout the movie the music slowed down during the car scene, like when the car went through the tunnel. There were lots of long takes some of the long takes i thought were a good idea but some I feel made the movie slow down and made it kind of boring. the pool scene when he jumped in his scuba suit was kind of cool because they shut out all the sound which was a cool feature but when he was in the house he could here his father talking? this was strange.the sex scene was a little strange as well the woman started taking her close off and there were extremely quick flashes of nudity. when he started sleeping with her the lights would go out and you could still tell what was going on I liked that and thought it was a good idea for the movie.Each scene led itself into another which I liked. Think that he seemed very unknowing during the movie guess which is what it was all about.The las thing I nocticed was the running of cars didn't really sound normal to me they seemed to loud and really overbearing during the movie. The last thing I liked was the camera view through the glass table, I thought it was a really cool effect. Megan Himmel",The Graduate
439,pinkpanther1164,The Graduate,7,8 May 2010,"The Graduate is a very risqué film from 1967, starring Dustin Hoffman. This film came out about a year before the Hayes code was totally abolished. During this time period society had moved past the Hayes code and was ready to deal with reality; the graduate did just that. Dustin Hoffman played the role of Benjamin Braddock, a recent college graduate. Benjamin comes from a prestigious family who seemed to have raised him right, however he has no idea what he wants to do with his life. During the summer instead of trying to figure out his dilemma, he gets lost within an affair. Benjamin is seduced by his father's business partners wife. They don't talk, they don't have a relationship, they just have meaningless sex. His plot alone in a film was recently not even allowed to be filmed, now it was boldly in front of an audience. As the summer passed on and Benjamin was yearning for more, he was forced to take his lovers daughter on a date. For what seems like the first time in his life Benjamin has finally found something that is meaningful to him. There's only one problem, he's already involved in a dangerous affair. Director Mike Nichols and Dustin Hoffman created a groundbreaking film that left the Hayes code a memory in the Hollywood film world. The plot is sexually twisted that throws reality in its audiences face. The camera shots are remarkable creating a work of art on screen, while Dustin Hoffman accents the script perfectly. This is a film that can be enjoyed by anyone with a mature mind.",The Graduate

However, his boyish charm and comic discomfort, in my opinion go flying out the window about halfway through the movie. He gets kind of creepy, and one of the reasons I think that may be is that they didn't develop Ben's relationship with the daughter enough. It looked like they went on one date (that started with a strip club visit), all of a sudden they're in love, then they break up, but he follows her, gets an apartment and stalks her. Come on... kind of creepy right? His landlord could sense it too. Oh, and I like Paul Simon as much as the next guy, but that was overkill.",The Graduate
441,Merkin4pres64,Outstanding. Best Comedy of the 1960's.,10,11 February 2006,"Up until I finally saw Mike Nichol's classic ""The Graduate,"" I always thought nothing would top Stanley Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove or..."" for funniest comedy of the 60's. I have been proved wrong. ""The Graduate"" takes you back to a time when you believed what was on the surface was the truth and what was beneath it wasn't mentioned.Opening the film is Benjamin Braddock on a flight to his parents in preparation for a graduation party. Here, Ben is displayed by his parents as who they think he is, not who he really is: a honor student and brilliant scholar. Below the surface, we see Ben as a shy, timid, non-initiating young man who's confused about life and what he will do with his. The along comes Mrs. Robinson.Mrs. Robinson is unfooled by the surface presentation of Ben Braddock and see's the real Ben, the Ben his parents don't know exists. After she asks him to drive her home because her husband has the car and ""won't be home for hours,"" so she invites him in to watch over the house. What seems to be an innocent drink results in Mrs. Robinson pouring out her troubles and the ""mistaken"" look of seduction of Ben by her. She then invites Ben up to her daughter's room to view her portrait. Then Mrs. Robinson begins to undress and propositions him; he refuses.A few weeks later, Ben is sitting alone at a hotel bar drinking his troubles away when he calls up Mrs. Robinson and takes her up on her offer. They get a room, undress (a hilarious scene), and officially begin their affair. After many weeks of this, along comes Elaine Robinson.Elaine was away at school over the period of Ben and her mother's affair. When Ben's father and Mrs. Robinson's husband set up a date for them, to Mrs. Robinson's disgust (secret to them, known by Ben), he takes her to a burlesque show (a hilarious scene). This obviously doesn't go over well with Elaine, so Ben confesses he was on this date against his will. Things become more relaxed and Ben begins to fall in love with her.When Mrs. Robinson finds out, she says she'll tell Elaine about their affair, but Ben, thinking it would be better for him, tells her first and breaks her heart and any chance of being with her, and not her mother.For the rest of the film, Ben is chasing down Elaine, trying to explain his actions. When she finally accepts his explanations, she agrees to marry him even though she is engaged to the ""Makeout King"" whom of which Ben is unaware of. In the climactic end scene, after being banned from seeing Elaine by the Robinsons, Ben comes in, disrupts the wedding (which had just finished), fights with Mr. Robinson and a couple of the guests and finally wins Elaine's heart. Here, they run off together and head the for the nearest bus where one assumes their romance takes off again.",The Graduate
442,SuperDuperMCA,Hilarious yet awkward,9,22 April 2013,A stupendous comedy full of rich colorful acting and great cinematography. Dustin Hoffman plays the role of an awkward witty young man perfectly as does the seductive Mrs.Robinson (Anne Bancroft) in her role as the cougar. The story to this movie is a bit twisted so it is better off being viewed by a mature audience. During its era The Graduate was a very edgy film because the hays code had just been lifted and it was wonderful seeing America cinema begin to shed light on more adult subjects. The humor of this particular movie is captivating because of the realism put into it. Each awkward situation Ben becomes involved in had me chuckling just because as a viewer one really starts to sympathize with his incredibly awkward life. The ending is great and all but doesn't make very much sense rationally and the progression of Ben and Elaine's relations felt a bit rushed overall. Still a timeless classic and a must see for anyone who can get a good laugh out of a story so ridiculous.,The Graduate

He is so spineless and childlike how can Mike Nichols expect us to believe that this wimp actually made it through college, with high grades, as it is implied throughout the movie and was a track star to boot? When this first came out it owned the Campus theater for an entire quarter while I was at college. Then, it seemed profoundly meaningful. Now, it just looks dated and is not the least bit entertaining. I just want to slap him in the head and tell him to wake up and find his cojones. How Elaine could be attracted to such a loser as Ben Braddock is the main mystery of the movie. All the adults (meaning, the parents) in this movie are such clueless drones they are just as unbelievable as is Ben. Seeing it again after 30 years was a mistake; I should have just left it in my memories as a good movie. The performances are excellent, the characters are idiots and the story is lame. Now, it is profoundly meaningless. What a disappointment.",The Graduate

The theme of glass and water is shown over and over and no one can explain what it's supposed to mean. The goofs listed on this cite are really very trivial and don't affect the film too much. However; please answer the following: 1. How does Elaine find out where he is staying in Berkeley? She suddenly just bursts into his room to confront him. How does she get into the building? How does she know what room he's in? How does her father find out where he's living and waits for him in the apartment. Did Mr. Roper just let him in? 2. If Mrs. Robinson claimed Benjamin raped her, why did she never report it? 3. How does Benjamin know which fraternity Karl Smith belongs to? He just shows up and asks about him leading to the chase. 4. When he get to Santa Monica, he turns into a gas station and quickly rips through the yellow pages trying to contact Karl's father. I imagine there are more than one Smith in the book...even more than one Dr. Smith. How is it he's able to figure out which one is the right one? ""Hey father....need any gas?"" With it all, probably the most entertaining film I've ever seen. The only problem is Hoffman's voice. You can barely understand him sometimes.

Although I wasn't born anywhere near the 1960s, this movie gave me a feel for that era. The contemporary music just absolutely makes the movie and just wouldn't be the same without it. And I also cannot go without mentioning how amazing Anne Bancroft was in the film. I don't think anyone could've done a better job.

I have heard many things about it's wonderful storyline and acting, I definitely had high expectations going into the film and it exceeded those. I always love a movie that is scandalous, and makes you wonder every second if someone is going to get caught. Dustin Hoffman really took on his role and made it believable to his shy nervous personality. He managed to make most scenes awkward which made it very funny. My personal favorite was the scene where Mrs Robinson tried to seduce him, you could tell by his facial expression and sweat he was extremely nervous and uncomfortable. The shots of Mrs Robinson's nude body then to Benjamin's face then back to her body and so on really was comical. The storyline did end up becoming interesting and complicated due to obvious reasons which overall added to the film. I liked the fact that Benjamin never gave up in what he wanted and fought to the end.",The Graduate

I thought the film was very good and it made me wish that one of my friends mom could have been Mrs. Robinson and I could have been Ben. I thought the editing in the movie was really good especially when they are in bed together and then they instantly show him in the pool on a raft and having a drink. It was truly awesome.

450,v-doody,The Graduate (1967),10,8 May 2014,"Let's be honest; in terms of cinema, 1967 was a pretty spectacular year. Mike Nichols's ""The Graduate"", for example, is very high on the list of best films released in 1967 (or really, ever). This film truly is quite brilliant. Based of Charles Webb's 1963 novel of the same name, ""The Graduate"" focuses on the story of a young college graduate who is quickly trapped in a messy affair with one of his parents friends. Not knowing what to do with his life post-college, Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) gets involved with an older woman, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), and beings a long and complicated process of equal parts self-loathing and self-discovery. Unfortunately for everybody involved, Benjamin quickly falls in love with Mrs. Robinson's much more age appropriate daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross) and now has to face the consequences of telling the girl that he loves that he's been sleeping with her mother and then also tell the woman he's been sleeping with that oops, he's fallen in love with her daughter.As equally interesting as the plot, the way the film was made is just as neat. With witty dialogue and superb acting, the characters were portrayed in a way that was extremely believable. The editing of the movie was also done quite well. With beautiful montage sequences and really cool point-of-view filming, and the addition of Simon and Garfunkel's music to really make the film what it was, ""The Graduate"" was created, in terms of both form and content, in a way that is both brilliant and representative of issues of issues, such as self doubt and not knowing what to do with your future, that almost everyone must face at some point in their lives.",The Graduate

The filming, the editing, the acting, the set designs and everything else all work to portray issues that most people fresh out of college are left to deal with, but in an exaggerated and entertaining manner. This is a film that is by no means boring or unentertaining in any way, shape, or form. It will keep everyone who takes the time out of their day to watch this film engrossed, and leave them with a message to keep with you on the way out.

Second, the man's parents suggest to him that he should date with the young woman, who is the mature woman's daughter. Finally, though the man and the young woman are attracted to each other, the mature woman tries to separate them. I like the scene where the man takes the young woman away because it shows he loves her very much. In contrast, I don't like the scene where the man is having an affair with the mature woman. This is because I'm not favorably disposed toward an affair between a young man and a mature woman. I recommend youngsters who have uneasiness for the future to watch this film because it shows a youngster's uneasiness and fear for the future.

We can all understand where Benjamin is coming from and why he is so nervous, and the humor adds to the serious situation in a great way. There are lots of beautiful shots in this movie to really appreciate along with its amazing soundtrack featuring Simon and Garfunkel.

454,Neonfinity,Seducingly Excellent,9,26 September 2017,"The Graduate is a 1967 film directed by Mike Nichols and stars Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, and Katharine Ross. The film is distributed by Metro Goldwyn Mayer, being labeled as a Dramatic Comedy. I was aware of the film's presence in cinema before watching it. But after watching it, I wanted to document my observations and opinions just for you.The Graduate is the story of Benjamin Braddock (played by Dustin Hoffman) fresh out of College who doesn't know what do with his future other than for life to carry him away. After his Graduation party, he becomes seduced by Mrs. Robinson (played by Anne Bancroft) and they start dating. Ben's father then asks him to date the Robinson's daughter, Elaine (played by Katharine Ross) whom Ben is now attracted to and proceeds to do as such. Ben soon gets caught up in troubling affairs and antics throughout in a world not quite as promising as it seemed. Dustin Hoffman's ""break-out"" performance as Ben Braddock is an excellent audience surrogate, being confused, nervous, and trying to keep his cool through the first half of the film. Plus his character development is great and woven into the progressing story perfectly, who runs in complete circles in the game of life. Anne Bancroft's performance as Mrs. Robinson steals every scene she is present. She has almost total dominance throughout entire scenes, being the perfect blend of sexy and dangerous. Katharine Ross delivers a very good performance as Elaine, showing very convincing emotions when needed. Though I think her character is slightly underwritten as I would have liked to see more of her. I liked a lot about The Graduate (well, that's an understatement). Every single shot never ceases to amaze me with it's composition, movement, length, sound design, and more. I also loved the lighting of each scene, serving as both a metaphor and carefully crafted filmmaking. The film is realistically dark seeing as it envelopes Ben in this newly found adult world, giving new meaning to the term ""Dark Comedy"". The Soundtrack by Simon & Garfunkel really set the tone and elevate scenes in which it is present. Plus, the songs are enjoyable by themselves, even without context. The Graduate's themes are about adulthood, relationships, and society. Ever since you or anyone turns into an adult, life turns a complete 180 degrees and that can be troublesome for most. But The Graduate makes this turn of events both surreal and grounded, showing this world feeling manufactured and weird, but also with a sense of realism to follow. The lesson I got from the film is that you need to plan things rather than life giving you a rude awakening very quickly.I believe this movie has something for everyone. General audiences can appreciate the depth and the film in general. And people who like cinema outside of watching it will get a surprisingly deep story. And since the film is PG-13, I believe the film is worthy of the rating showing adult themes and even imagery. But I would recommend this movie to anyone mature enough to understand it's themes. I believe this is the same tier of comedy the Coen Brothers and other legendary comedies set decades later.Overall, I give The Graduate a... 9/10",The Graduate
455,t-spitzbarth,The graduate,8,5 May 2021,"This movie show's everything you could do with a camera to film a movie. This movie show's the life of the 60's.

The movie is based off Mrs. Robinson seducing an unexperienced ben after graduating college. The affair goes on for a decent amount of time until Mrs Robinson daughter comes home. Ben get's too attached to the daughter and wants her instead of Mrs Robinson. They eventually fall in love and start to ruin the whole Robinson family. This movie is dramatic and funny at the same time. I always wonder who was Mrs Robinson from that song but now i know.",The Graduate
456,bengreenb,"50s ethos, 60s pathos",5,19 July 2007,"I had a lot of difficulty relating to the main character, Ben Braddock. At first, he rejects Mrs. Robinson's attempts at seducing him. Then, with a very clear head, he decides to call her up and have sex with her. It's difficult to have sympathy for a character who made such a decision with a clear head-- what does he expect but to get caught? The protagonist of this movie is both too good and too bad at the same time. He is a prude with a giant unignorable super-ego on one hand, and a guy who makes stupid, morally questionable decisions on the other. In other words, a coward.This movie was significant for its place in film history, no doubt. It created a bridge between the ethos of the 50s-- marry the girl you love, be respectful at all times, be prude when you're in the public sphere-- and the pathos of the 60s-- running away from society without any coherent plan, breaking sexual boundaries, and rebelling against ones parents. Think about it-- Ben, despite all of the disaproval he meets from his elders along the way, is actually pursuing the girl they originally begged him to pursue! If this movie were really about breaking away from the 50's as its apologists claim it is, he would have gone off with a black woman from the other side of town, not the timid girl next door (Elaine Robinson). It does have a lot of interesting symbolism, and its an undeniable fact that it was a milestone for American cinema. (Could a movie like Garden State emerge without this having been released decades earlier?) For all of its latent symbolism and historical significance, though, one must ask some very basic questions of this movie-- was its plot good? Was it entertaining? For me, the answer is that the plot was very interesting but limited by its unexciting dramaturgy. I feel like only the first and last 10 minutes of the film are really exciting. It's the film equivalent of listening to a song by The Beatles-- it's well arranged, has an interesting theme, but is nonetheless not as good as people think it is-- under the pretense of being loud and rebellious, it's a harmless, cooing reaffirmation of boring middle-class values.",The Graduate
457,fatherchristmas89,"Hello, Benjamin",7,11 November 2014,"I enjoyed this film, but not as much as I thought I would. I found Mrs Robinson to be very persuasive, and this worked well with Benjamin's naivety. The balance between her controlling, manipulative, flirty manner and Benjamin's naive, innocent, infatuated character worked well. I like the development with their relationship, but I think it could have been developed further. The change with Ben from being a high achiever as college to having an affair was very good. Mrs Robinson's daughter was briefly mentioned, and then quickly became part of the plot. The development between the daughter, Elaine, and Benjamin felt very rushed. The marriage proposal after such a short time, even though it was in the 60s, felt again rushed. Elaine had no reason to be so infatuated by Benjamin as he treated her horribly. The soundtrack was very good and captured the mood wonderfully.",The Graduate

How he worries about his future, the by weird twists of events he becomes someone who he is not, and its not like he chose it, it just fell upon him.

If the Graduate was released today for the first time it would be as good, maybe even better, as it was back then. Mike Nicols revolutionized film directing. The timing of the acting is impeccable between the chemistry of Hoffman and Bancroft. The soundtrack is easily one of the greatest if not the best. The script perfectly reflects the sexual revolution of its time. The dialogue and situations are poetically offbeat and hilarious.

Another important aspect of this film is the music from Simon and Garfunkel which heighten the experience of watching this film.

I find it hard to come up with anything negative to say about this film. The only real negative that I can come up with is that you'll probably never want to listen to Simon & Garfunkel again. It is rare for an actors first role to do so much for their career, but Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of Ben cemented his role in cinema history. Anne Bancroft is the delightfully manipulating Mrs. Robinson and Kathrine Ross is her daughter and Bens love interest, Elaine. The direction and camera work are good. The camera work aids in giving the audience a dose of what Ben is going through as a recent college graduate.

For you see, anyone can see them self in the character of Benjamen Braddock. The Graduate altogether, makes a statement about the generational gap between parents and their children. Not just in the plot of the film, but in a grander sense. It's almost as if each of the characters are symbolic of the previous generation or the current one. The film is filled with fine performances, especially from Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. Hoffman is so laughably awkward in the film that it's not hard to find him likable. Bancroft is sensational as the seductive Mrs. Robinson who ends up becoming quite the villianess as the plot gets deeper. The writing is sharp and witty and nicely adapted from the novel. The cinematography is ingenious, shots have been utilized in this film that have never been seen before, such as the scuba p.o.v. shot and the famous ""leg"" shot. This is also an early film to include a type of pop soundtrack to it, the folk rock duo Simon & Garfunkel.

When no one listens to him while he goes to scuba dive, I thought he was going to drown himself. I thought he would remove the breathing apparatuses, and stay underwater.

469,gnc98,Masterfully Mature Comedy,8,11 May 2017,"(ABSENCE MAKEUP REVIEW) Similarly to Bonnie and Clyde, The Graduate is a film during the ""New Hollywood"" era. This meant defying the older ways of Hollywood by portraying often graphic scenes; and while The Graduate certainly doesn't go into the violent territory of Bonnie and Clyde, it's arguably equally mature. The film follows Benjamin, a recently graduated college student who's having difficultly realizing what he wants in life. His parents are well off middle-class folk, but he doesn't want that, and his friends constantly try to goad him into telling them what he plans to do in life, but he can't answer so he ignores them. Enter Mrs. Robinson and suddenly Benjamin is given a distraction from his responsibilities, which he hesitantly accepts after considering it for several days. The scene between Mrs. Robinson and Benjamin is not only humorous, but also the most ""Old Hollywood"" defiant. Robinson attempts to seduce Benjamin into having an affair with her, or to at least consider an arrangement between the two. The chemistry between Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft in this scene is fantastic, as Benjamin fumbles around trying to understand why the sexually more experienced Mrs. Robinson is attempting to woo him into her sheets. It's funny and racy, and way beyond what used to be depicted in older films. Something that's done masterfully is how the relationship between the two begins to grow stale for Benjamin, with some great editing to tie it all together. One part in particular stands out, where Benjamin is putting on a shirt and entering his house after leaving the pool, and a match cut is made where we see Benjamin entering a hotel room where he lies on the bed and Mrs. Robinson begins to undress him. It shows how he's trying to balance his normal activities with their affair, and the look on his face as Mrs. Robinson unbuttons his shirt shows how uninterested he is with his partner. It's a great example of show, don't tell. Eventually Benjamin finds that he's interested in a new woman, Elaine, Mrs. Robinson's daughter. Things escalate from there till we reach the climax, but the thing I want to focus on is the maturity of the story. While The Graduate is a comedy, it depicts its characters and situations with grace, and doesn't push the funny moments too much where things begin to feel unrealistic, which is a difficult medium to reach. Later on, Benjamin is accused of rape; a serious accusation, and the movie handles it as such. It isn't utilized as a segue into a joke, nor is it presented as humorous. It shows that the screen writer knew when to be serious, and it pays off with a very real and human response from the actor portraying the character. There's a certain finesse to it that I think should be applauded. Overall, The Graduate is a smart and funny film that tells a mature story without relying on the comedy too heavily. It was definitely a trail blazer for the industry.",The Graduate
470,Verbal-20,Highly overrated. Really.,1,26 August 1999,"This movie doesn't deserve to be on any Top 10 or 100 list, unless it's a list of Horribly Overrated Movies. Movies like The Graduate are why I don't like low-budget movies. First off, the sound editing is so bad that occasionally you'll have serious trouble hearing what the actors are saying--and not when it's intended for you to be deaf to the dialogue. The film editing is even worse, and it goes hand-in-hand with lousy jobs in the direction and shot selection categories. This is probably the worst feature of The Graduate because it complicates watching it. The angles of the shots often go so close up to the actors' faces that you can't tell if they're walking or standing still. It looks ridiculous. The way it's directed and edited make the film annoying to unwatchable. The script is also a mixed bag, ranging from weak to implausible (the ending is just plain stupid). And Dustin Hoffman's performance is NOT that good. Definitely not indicative of the talent he'd later show in Lenny and Rain Man. This movie is seriously overrated. Do yourself a favor and see a more disturbing movie. They're generally better done. This comedy was about as funny to me as The Silence of the Lambs.",The Graduate
471,kaleidoscope_eyess,dark side of the counterculture,6,2 July 2020,"Joni Mitchell, having personally gone through the hippie movement of the '60s, expressed her gratification in full with the album Blue. ""Carey"" is about a hippie community in a Greek island in Crete, and even Paris pales in comparison with ""California."" Yet Mitchell gives a clue about her loss of a child as well. Being ""dirt poor,"" she had to give her child away for adoption.Women's living condition was the dark side of the '60s counterculture. With the supposed liberation, women gained sexual freedom at their own expense. As long as they were not regarded as equal beings by men, women still had to pay the price for the mishaps in a relationship, abortion being an obvious case. Mrs. Robinson, the middle-aged woman holding cigarettes and stretching her legs in stockings, is an archetype of a femme fatale. She is, indeed, ""the most desirable of all my [Benjamin's] parents' friends"" -- and perhaps of ours too. She is smart, resolute, self-conscious, honest about her desires, and owns up to her mistakes too. Mrs. Robinson is a liberated woman of the '60s, mediating between her two roles as a respectable mother and an attractive sexual partner -- the latter, though, not in the capacity of wife.In The Graduate, the protagonist Benjamin had the pleasure of exploring his life choices by the exact virtue of being a man. Having already had an affair with Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin now devote to Elaine, Mrs. Robinson's daughter, his passion. Now Elaine, a lady-like girl, goes to Berkeley for college. Adamant about her love for Benjamin, she endures his careless mistakes. Like her mother, Elaine rebels against traditional womanhood without completely breaking the constraints, but they nevertheless both fell victims to a reckless man's hunting for beauty, innocence, charms, submission, etc.What was Mrs. Robinson like when she was young, and who would Elaine become when she grows older? What lays under the sweet disguise of swimming pools, folk music and decadent youth is the exploitation of brilliant women across generation by a witty wasted young man.",The Graduate
472,varunthedragon-931-766034,"Hello Darkness, My Old Friend",8,31 January 2011,"Thus begins the famous Simon& Garfunkel song ""Sounds of Silence"" which plays as the movie opens on a plane. Based on a bestselling novel by Charles Webb, ""The Graduate"" is the story of Benjamin ""Ben"" Braddock, a twenty-something college graduate. He is at a loss what to do with his future. After a series of events, he starts having an affair with one Mrs.Robinson, the wife of his father's business partner & family friend. He doesn't particularly like her or anything but he has the affair for lack of something better to do & Mrs.Robinson is in it for some excitement in her meaningless life as a trophy wife & partly because she pities Ben. When Ben starts to obsess over Mrs.Robinson's daughter Elaine, it triggers a series of events which leads to both of them taking the path to a highly uncertain future.Speaking as one who has been there, Dustin Hoffman does a brilliant job of portraying Ben's insecurities, disenchantment, alienation etc. But as far as acting goes, the best is arguably Anne Barcroft as Mrs.Robinson. She practically rules every scene she is in, outperforming Hoffman in all their scenes together. Katharine Ross as Elaine is,admittedly, the weakest performance in the movie but that's comparing Hoffman & Barcroft.The movie's screenplay is remarkably ahead of its time. I would comment more on it but I'm the kind of person who is more interested in story.The issues addressed in the movie like the ones mentioned above as well as rebelling against conformity & so on are real enough. The movie also does nothing to justify any of Ben's actions but you can imagine it happening given the circumstances as well as Ben's state of mind. Now, my biggest problem with the movie is probably the same one many others will have: the figurative ""second half"" taking place in Berkeley. The problem is the last 45 minutes seems far too rushed for comfort. Ben's stalking of Elaine in Berkeley, her marriage subplot etc. could've been taken slower & the first hour with Mrs.Robinson could've been cut short but of course, that would've changed the movie for better & worse. On the bright side, the parting shot is one of the best remembered moments in film history although you could attribute it more to Hoffman & Ross. It wouldn't be as memorable if they were just laughing & grinning till the screen cuts to black.Overall, this was a very good movie which, while admittedly a product of its time, still holds the power to appeal to a large audience. My rating-8/10",The Graduate
473,s-striar,Captivating and Funny,9,8 May 2012,Very funny movie dealing with intertwined relationships and romance. Camera work and lighting is virtually flawless and might be the best seen during this time period. Movie draws the viewer in by making him sympathetic for the main character as he deals with troubling situations involving a family friend. As he falls in love with the daughter of his affair things turn for the worst as she will not accept defeat. Some of the humor is very outrageous yet fits perfectly in the picture that the director painted for the viewer. The main character is a very animated person and does a very good job holding interest in the viewer and also developing a personality that people can relate to.,The Graduate
474,DrJoTab,But the best parts are . . .,10,21 October 1998,"I must have seen this movie three dozen times, and every time I find something new in it. While the script is wonderful, the acting first-rate, and the soundtrack evocative and beautiful, I still have to say that the best parts of The Graduate are the cinematography and editing. During the long musical interlude halfway through, we watch Benjamin drift aimlessly from one assignation with Mrs. Robinson to another, lying to himself, lying to his parents, just plain lying . . . around. He walks through a door in the hotel room to find himself in his parent's den. Then he walks from the den into the hotel room--and so on. I don't think a director has ever evoked the pointlessness of a character's life better than Mike Nichols does in this one scene.Also, when Benjamin finally tells Elaine who the married woman is, the camera slowly pulls her face into focus as she realizes the impact of his words. It just doesn't get any better than this.Two tidbits: (1) I don't think the movie is dated at all; and (2) isn't it more than cool that we never find out Mrs. Robinson's first name?",The Graduate
475,aeboynton,The Graduate,10,11 April 2010,"This film not only deals with current issues of the 1960's and 1970's but also makes the same intense impact on audiences today. This is one of the reasons I think this film still resonates with audiences today. The editing was not trivial in that it was a character all in itself; it played just as an important role as a Ben or Mrs. Robinson. This is one of the few movies I have seen that causes the audience to reflect on their own decisions and their own livelihood in a way they might have never before. The graduate was made post hays code and therefore took full advantage of the decreased restriction policies. This may have also drawn people at the time to this movie because it was at the initial stages of the new ""second golden age."" Dustin Hoffman's character ""Ben,"" plays a college graduate who is finding himself and what he wants in life, not necessarily listening to only what he thinks he should do according to his family. He does a fantastic job at convincing the audience of his innocence as a young man and his good intentions that actually make him look (to outsiders) like a liar, cheater, and a little bit nuts. I think this movie was about listening to what you truly want to do and not necessarily just going with the flow of what you think you should do. It also exposes issues that are not necessarily being talked about (especially for that time) and possibly opens up dialog about these issues among friends and families. Not only do you watch this movie and think ""what a great story that was, I really enjoyed it,"" but it also causes the audience to reflect upon themselves and their decisions in life in a way they might have not done before.",The Graduate
476,coolsharpharp,Transcends Time: A True Classic,9,25 February 2006,"This film is nearly 40 years old but the themes raised in the film are as relevant today as they were then. The basic premise is that Benjamin Braddock (Hoffman) comes back home from school in the East as a scholarship winner. His parents, friends and relatives all believe that he is a young man of substance with a great future ahead. To avoid a party that his parents held for his triumphant return he reluctantly drives back Mrs Robinson (Anne Bankroft)to her home. She seduces him and they have a summer affair. However, he falls in love with her daughter Elaine Robinson and that is when the fun and games truly begin.For me the most fascinating part of the film is the way in which Benjamin violently rejects the pigeon holed view of the future that his elders have in mind for him. He is from a wealthy family and the American Dream is their for the taking as long as he continues on the right path. I think he realises that he cannot become a person in his right right until he has some experiences on the wrong path. Halfway, through the film there is a scene where he just lays in his parents pool doing nothing other than waiting for his next sordid night with Mrs Robinson. The music by Simon and Garfunkel is a perfect aid to help illustrate the lack of direction and purpose that Benjamin is feeling.Through his parents insistence he is forced to take out Elaine Robinson at the express forbidding of Mrs Robinson. He strikes a relationship with Elaine and is willing to forget about his affair with her mother. However, Mrs Robinson does all that she can to keep them apart. This includes sending Elain to Berkely, alleging that she was raped by Benjamin and setting up a quick marriage for Elain, to a young man she met at college.This is the moment that Benjamin's lack of direction, purpose and lethargy disappear and he knows what he really wants in life. He pursues Elaine to Berkely University and lets no obstacle get in his way to gain her love and companionship. This involves many hilarious scenes and especially the crazy ending which is totally unbelievable but fun none the less.Dustin Hoffman Puts in a solid performance as the misdirected young man trying to find his place in the world. However, the star of the show is Anne Bancroft as the bored housewife posing as a super confident, stylish and refined mature lady. Although in reality she was only six years older than Hoffman, she was able to convey far more experience and worldliness, to make it believable that she was old enough to have been Benjamin's mother.This film is a true classic as it has stood the test of time and in my humble opinion will continue to stand the test of time. The main theme of the film transcends time and will captivate any audience in any time. That theme of course is the difficulty we all face to find our place and purpose in this world.",The Graduate

Truth be told... I will probably watch it several more times in the future.The storyline about a young college graduate having an affair with his parent's close friend, Mrs. Robinson, then soon falling mutually in love with her daughter is a great idea, and I must say that the story played out very well. It was unexpected that Mrs. Robinson would become some cruel and heartless in the end, but they also never thoroughly explained her reasoning behind it all.

After he started hooking up with Mrs. Robinson he started to get a cooler sense of being able to go with the flow and not be so nervous all the time. Then things started to get a little weird with him starting to like Mrs. Robinsons daughter and wanting to be with her. Then he starts turning into a stalker and going a little crazy over this girl. the ending was a little bland it was like OK she ran away with him but now what.

On top of the brilliant acting and beautiful unmatched cinematography the soundtrack was beautifully done. Simon and garfunkel provide the perfect peaceful backdrop to the turmoil of the story and all of the mezsed up details behind the characters personal relationships.

It's only real fault is that it isn't exactly believable at times, but it's to be expected from a comedy.Besides it's excellent comedic appeal, the soundtrack, The Sounds of Silence by Simon & Garfunkel, is not only a phenomenal choice due to being a good song, but also fits the story perfectly. The Graduate is good for anyone who can appreciate a good movie or could use a good laugh. If there's any testament to the quality of this film, it's the quantity of parodies it has.

I have always liked Dustin Hoffman, and, admittedly, I love some of his more recent work as well as his older work, but, I just think that he is a great actor. When I finally got to see it a few weeks ago, I was all eyes and all ears. I needed to pay full attention to it, because I had this great opportunity and I wasn't going to waste it. And I sang along with the songs that I already knew and throughout the movie, I could not stop smiling like an idiot. My favorite scenes were when he was a bumbling young man in the hotel at first, and trying desperately to hide what he was actually doing there, but failing to be non-suspicious, as well as the first scene that he has alone with Mrs. Robinson, which I thought involved some comedic editing and cinematography techniques.

It wasn't the nasty character of Mrs Robinson's behavior that made me feel ill. I kind of ENJOYED that. It was having Simon and Garfunkle that made me feel ill. Their attempts at singing and playing musical instruments, and the nursery-rhyme nonsense-lyrics that they made up especially for the movie - that weren't especially relevant to the move - the lyrics that made no sense at all - those are what made me feel ill.Even better than Anne Bancroft nasty behavior is Norman Fell's depiction of a nasty landlord. Here, a few years before he does a limpid, watered down version of this role in Three's Company, he depicts a wonderfully obnoxious landlord to perfection.God bless Norman Fell, he brings some class to this otherwise quite bland movie. I didn't find him quite as sexy as Anne Bancroft but perhaps you might. Who knows. In any even, it doesn't matter. His performance was juicy.Dustin Hoffman does an indecisive interpretation of Ben, an indecisive young man. He hasn't figured out what to do with his life; he hasn't figured out what to do with his pedookie either. His ""sex-interest"" is Mrs. Robinson; his ""love-interest"" is Mrs. Robinsons daughter Elaine. Elaine is just a love-object, she is not an actual character. She is just a one-dimensional objet for Ben to stalk. Does Ben have any interest in having sex with her or does he just kind of have warm feelings for her and like being around her? Maybe he just has a stalking instinct? I think that's it. The writers haven't decided. I don't care.",The Graduate

Many people of that time and even today can agree that older generations have a hard time understanding younger people and their interests. This theme is very apparent in the film and it makes one think about social progress and the role that younger people have played in it. In terms of the film itself Nichols does some very clever and beautiful things with the camera. He allows the viewer to not only observe the scenarios but also what the characters are thinking and struggling with. The acting by Hoffman is truly spectacular. He comes off as very awkward but this makes Ben come off as more relatable and funny. The soundtrack could've included more songs but the music that was in it worked very well. It made the movie very serious or very light hearted which made the scenes more emotionally captivating. All in all this film is a classic down to its core. It is a pure work of art that is beautifully filmed, scripted, and acted that deems this film as iconic.",The Graduate
486,dlaferriere,Water symbolism,8,26 January 2006,"In this movie there was a great use of symbolism but the one that stood out the most was the illusion of water. Every time there was water in the movie it meant that Ben was trapped and something bad was about to happen. This went on throughout the whole movie consisting of his fish tank, his pool, and when it was raining out. Every time there was something to do with Ben getting caught or getting trapped into doing something there was water around him.The first occurrence of this is right at the beginning of the movie when Ben first meets Mrs. Robinson. She convinces him that he needs to drive her home and this is when their whole affair starts because she tries to seduce him. In this scene Ben is looking through his fish tank when she walks in, like he is trapped in it, and then when they leave Mrs. Robinson throws the car keys in the tank and he gets them out and right then it shows that she has him trapped because she can get him to do anything she wants.Another strong water image is when Ben and Mrs. Robinson decide to talk in the hotel room instead of do what they normally do. They talk and end up fighting and Ben is so close to ending it, but she convinces him to stay by manipulating him. So once again she has him wrapped around her finger. The illusion of water comes in this scene because there is a picture of a tsunami wave above the bed the whole time, so it is like he is trapped under the wave and can't get out.When Ben goes to pick Elaine up the next day after they had a great night it is raining out. When he pulls up to Elaine's house, Mrs. Robinson gets in the car and tells him to drive and threatens to tell Elaine about the affair they are having. It is pouring out in this scene and it seems like Ben is trapped in the car because it is raining so hard out. Then he does go outside and gets soaked to tell Elaine what happened between him and Mrs. Robinson because he is in love with her and wants to be with her. Elaine gets mad at him of course and his happiness ends, just like he was happy and dry in the car before Mrs. Robinson got in and then he got soaked. It was good in the car but once he got out everything got worse.There are a few other scenes when the use water as a symbol for being trapped, like when it is raining out when Mr. Robinson confronts him about the affair, and when Ben goes underwater when his mom says that she is going to invite all the Robinsons over, but those three are the strongest. It was definitely a movie with many symbols in it, but the using water to symbolize being trapped was a good idea. It was well represented and really added to the feeling of how Ben would have felt in the situation he was in. It showed how trapped and how deep he really was, and how he couldn't get out.",The Graduate
487,kwalsh2-1,Stuck in a corner,10,26 January 2006,"Despite having a terribly flawed plot line, The Graduate's actors and direction make this film one to be loved by all. Mike Nichols did an outstanding job with portraying Dustin Hoffman as a confused graduate suffocating from the pressure of the real world after college. The start of the movie shows him going through the motions of life without a motive. Benjamin Braddock desperately tries to find meaning or a purpose in his existence, but ends up settling on the wrong option. Mrs. Robinson seduces him at his lowest point, and when he is vulnerable enough, he gives in to the pressure of boredom by starting an affair. Water plays a huge role in the image of entrapment that Braddock feels. In the first scene we see a fish tank behind his head symbolizing the contained amount of pressure he feels upon first graduating. However, once Mrs. Robinson throws his keys in the water, showing how she throws him in over his head, Braddock is now shown in his pool. This is a much bigger fish tank to stifle him. The scuba outfit given to him for his birthday provides a comic image of the pressure he is feeling from all angles because he does not know what his future holds for him. There is only a small window with no sound but the heavy breathing apparatus. He is pushed back into the water by his father, which places appropriate blame on where most of the pressure in his life is coming from. The most poignant theme of water was the bathroom scene. He is standing at the mirror shaving with the steam surrounding him. His mother walks in and questions him about what he is doing with his nights. She is cornering him in the steam of the bathroom. Eventually he cuts himself with the razor when the conversation has gotten to the point of his mother being in danger of finding out about the affair. This parallels the people cornering him with questions about his future. He is backed up as far as he can go, until he starts to hurt himself with the affair. By hurting himself, he also ends up hurting those that he loves by losing the trust of his mother, and respect from Elaine.Nichols direction with this film is incredibly appropriate for depicting Dustin Hoffman's character correctly. There are many scenes where Braddock is shown from afar coming toward the camera, whether it is walking to the hotel room or running to the church. He is the focus of the movie, but the camera, like all of the other people in his life, could care less about him. In sync with the attitude of people in his surroundings, the camera allows people to walk in front of him. At the zoo even the monkeys take precedence over the focus of his face. One of the most powerful images for me was Braddock shown between Mrs. Robinson's legs telling her she's trying to seduce him. Nichols also highlights the mindlessness of the affair with the talking scene. Ben wants to have a conversation with Mrs. Robinson, but she has no interest in him finding out about her shattered life. The light turns on when he realizes why she married him as if a light bulb turns on in his head. After the fight, the lights go off, showing the return to a meaningless relationship.",The Graduate
488,gleebs75,Small acts of youth rebellion,9,26 January 2006,"The Graduate is generally praised as one of the ultimate youth rebellion films of the 1960s. True, it was made in a time when many teens were searching for some way to rebel against various aspects of society--parents, government and other standard conventions of American society. However, it is not entirely as rebellious as it is made out to be. Benjamin Braddock is a college graduate, confused and lost. There are many occasions throughout the film where the audience can sense his feelings of entrapment and confusion. ""I'm a little worried about my future,"" is a line that is consistently repeated in the beginning of the film when he is seemingly trapped at his welcome back party. The entire party sequence is filled with images of being trapped. The camera is extremely close to all of the people, every time Benjamin tries to get out of the room where he is he is blocked off by another guest, and he is being flooded with others' acknowledgements of his past successes. When Benjamin finally escapes to his bedroom to drown out the noise of the party, we get the sense that he is truly lost and very worried that he will be a disappointment to his family and all the people who are at this party. The opening sequence of the film, when he is in the airport on the moving sidewalk and ""The Sound of Silence"" is playing, we get the sense that up until now he has just been kind of floating through life, being told what to do and being taken in one direction or another without having any real say in the situation. The three acts of rebellion that seem apparent during the film are this: his relationship with his father's business partner's wife, Mrs. Robinson, his feelings for her daughter Elaine Robinson, and the waste of his mind. The relationship with Mrs. Robinson is very rebellious in the sense that it's an affair, and an affair with someone whom he has supposed to be respecting and looking up to during his life. Mr. Robinson gives Ben advice in the beginning of the film and it is at that point that we really understand why it would be so truly radical if he slept with Mrs. Robinson (besides the fact that she's old enough to be his mother). Later on, after being told to stay away from Elaine by Mrs. Robinson, he falls in love with her anyway and goes to extreme lengths to be able to share his future with her. It is apparent that he really just needed a connection with someone more his age who could understand all of the decisions he had to make and the confusion that he was suffering from. After he meets and talks to Elaine it is clear to him that although he may not know what he wants from life, he knows that he wants Elaine in his life. The biggest act of rebellion that is seen in this film seems to be the waste of his educated mind. Benjamin wastes away his summer floating in the pool of his parents' house and sneaking off to a hotel to have sex with a married family friend. He does not use the education he has just received to try to find a job or to make a difference in some way. Instead he feels comfortable with his life, at one point telling his father ""I would say I'm just driftingit's very comfortable just to drift here."" These ""rebellious"" acts are not entirely the same acts of rebellion that the real youth of America were performing at the time this film was made. Benjamin does not have long hair or dress in any way to make him stand out like the hippie generation of the time, he does not make any political or radical statements with his rebelliononly rebellion from the conventions of suburbia during this time. It is clear that he does not want to become like his parents, it is clear that he does not want to look at life as though he is looking through the lens of the scuba diving suit that his father bought for him. He is not trying to make any radical change in the world, but in himself, and that is really where the rebellion comes into pay.",The Graduate
489,howard-30,How disappointing the 2nd time around,5,16 February 2006,"We decided to see it on television Saturday night remembering fondly the first time we saw it. Boy, were we disappointed! Parts of the beginning were funny and that remained. ""Plastics"" is still a great line.But the characters and the plot were very weak. For example, after the catastrophe in the strip club, Elaine just wants to go home. Benjamin forces a kiss on her and she just falls in love. Shades of James Bond, Hoffman just isn't that overwhelmingly sexy. Benjamin's character is never explained. He is a track star, a good student and managing editor of his college newspaper, yet he has no friends, no old girl friends, no interests at all except Mrs. Robinison. There is no development at all.I stopped watching about half way through. I wish I hadn't watch and could still remember it fondly.",The Graduate
490,Kurtz9791,A Bridge Over Troubled Waters,10,5 March 2005,"The Graduate (1967/Mike Nichols) If ever a song were more appropriate for a film, besides 'All Along the Watchtower' for ""Apocalypse Now"", it is 'The Sounds of Silence' preformed by Simon & Garfunkel in Mike Nichol's ""The Graduate"". The song, nearly word for word, describes the inner turmoil that the characters of ""The Graduate"" face. They are lost and confused, stuck on the bridge of life, two crossing into adulthood, and one into old age. And that's just one way to look at it. ""The Graduate"" is one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure to witness, and I only wish I were alive when it was first released. Dustin Hoffman, in his first major film role, plays Benjamin Braddock: the epitome of the confused and isolated young adult male. He sits in his room and does nothing. He lies around in his parent's pool for hours on end. Ben, who has just graduated from college, is home for the summer. Then, after an awkward sexual encounter with a friend of his parents named Mrs. Robinson, a one night stand turns into a summer romance. But betrayal soon follows as Benjamin falls for Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine. Nichol's directorial genius (he won an Oscar for the film) really shows in the opening party sequence celebrating Ben's arrival home. There is a close-up of Ben's face as he stumbles his way through the event, listening to advice and shaking hands with the faceless (much like his future) masses. The camera moves in such a way that a feeling of claustrophobia comes over the viewer. They are overcome by what is going on around them, much like Benjamin is at this crossroads in his life. Another example is when Ben first arrives at the fateful hotel where he meets Mrs. Robinson for sex. He walks around the lobby, suspicious that the desk clerk is on to him, and then he attempts to walk into a room. Only a large group of the elderly walks out, and Benjamin stands there holding the door for them. Then he proceeds inside, only to be passed by a group of high school students. This image once again reinforces the crossroads that Ben is at in his life. After finally viewing this classic, I realized that many of my favorite directors to emerge from the 90's (mainly Wes Anderson) were greatly influenced by this film. What's more interesting is that ""The Graduate"" was a landmark film for American cinema and the decade in which it was released, sharing the same themes that Benjamin experiences throughout the film. Most of American cinema was very conventional up until the 60's. Nothing extremely scandalous was shown in a film, and many serious topics were not widely addressed through cinemayet. ""The Graduate"" is the perfect mix of old and new. It's the 'bridge' that separates the standard American films from the more experimental ones that would emerge all throughout the 1970's. The same can be said for the decade of the 1960's. America lost its innocence the day Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963. For the next five years, the country went through a spiral of events that led to the sexual revolution of the late 1960's. And ""The Graduate"" separates the white picket fences of the 50's and early 60's from the Rock and Roll and drugs of the late 1960's and early 70's. It's a crossroads in the middle of the most turbulent time in American history. In one of the films most ironic images, a tired and lonesome Benjamin slumps on a bench on the Berkley campus (an important place for the sexual revolution) under an American flag blowing in the wind. The flag still waves, but Benjamin is beat. He represents the fall and eventual metamorphosis of the American dream. But aside from all its serious themes and deeper meanings, ""The Graduate"" is a comedy at its heart. It contains one of the funniest and most exciting climaxes in cinema. And the final image is a knockout. It shows Benjamin and Elaine sitting at the end of a bus filled with elders, looking ahead blankly, at the road and at their future. Then the bus drives off in the distance. They do not know where their future is headed, or where the bus is even going. It was the same circumstance for America in 1967. The film closes with the same song it opened with: ""The Sounds of Silence"".",The Graduate

The edit when Mrs. Robinson is coming into the room naked and it lets the viewer see some of her body flashing back and forth was very interesting, I think that was the best edit throughout this film.

Nonetheless, this is one of the best and funniest movies I've seen.Unlike should-be flop ""Virginia Woolfe"" every character puts effort into his or her role and literally becomes their assigned character (so much so it's easy to forget Hoffman is 30 an Bancroft is only 35.)  What makes this feature of the cast more compelling is that it is made up almost entirely of second-choices.  What the cast gives in acting, Nichols doubles in directing, catching the emotions of every seen from Ben's timidness and confusion on the first night of his affiar to the chaos that ensues when Elaine's wedding is hilariously interupted in a completely anti-Christian way.It is best to watch this movie while your young as Ben will seem to alienate himself from you farther.

496,ethanmidd,Definitely One of the Greats,9,8 June 2015,"Man did I have an awesome time watching this movie. I was interesting with this from beginning to end. Part of it was just because the story was not your typical love triangle type of story. This type of stuff is shown mainly on television shows and even if it is part of the plot in some movies, it doesn't hold up to what The Graduate did. At the time, it was an original story, and it's inspired many other writers to make stories like this.However, what really makes this film astounding are not the performances, not the soundtrack, and not even the story. Yes all three of those are incredibly well done and do help make the movie something unique, but what really stood out in a good way was the cinematography and editing. That's what made me fall in love with this movie. This movie showed things in a way that I could have never imagined. The movie also doesn't show your average scene with an normal shot. No, every scene was shot in a way that I wouldn't have thought of. If you are interested into filming or photography, I recommend you watch this movie since it also does a great job on the rule of symmetry.The performances were something as well. Dustin Hoffman had this performance that I was able to relate to because his character is timid and not a very outgoing type of guy. Anne Bancroft was very good too since she was very calm, gave a sexy vibe, and also was very intimidating at times. My only complaint about this movie is Kathryn Ross. It was just whenever she was in a tempered mood or just yelling in general it got annoying.If you haven't listen to this soundtrack either, go do that. Simon and Garfunkel made the music and it just has a lot of their classic songs and it's adds a lot to the movie.There are many pros to this movie. The editing and cinematography are definitely the biggest highlights for me. For some people it might be the original story, the great and subtle performances from the cast, or it might be the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack. This is definitely something that every movie fan needs to watch. This is something that I will buy on Blu Ray and watch it over and over and over again.",The Graduate
497,tpion,I Love Mrs. Robinson,10,26 January 2006,"The movie The Graduate which was directed by Mike Nichols in 1967 is a great story about a young boy and an older woman next door becoming intimate lovers by having an affair. Benjamin Braddock who was played by famous actor Dustin Hoffman is a boy who has just graduated college and is just turning 21 throughout the movie. He then encounters his next door neighbor's wife, Mrs. Robinson who makes him driver her home and then tries to seduce him which is unsuccessful. Then they end up by getting a hotel and start their affair with each other. This goes on for a little bit and then Benjamin is forced out on a date with the Robinson's daughter Elaine. Mrs. Robinson is furious at this and tells Benjamin not to go and he tells her not to worry he doesn't want her daughter.He takes her out and she has such a bad time that she runs out crying from the strip club he had taken her too. He chases after her and ends up by kissing her and from then on he was in love with her. The difference between Mrs. Robinson and Elaine was that Benjamin liked the mother because she was beautiful and it was purely a sexual relationship. Elaine was different though he actually cared and loved for her and wanted to be with her. From there the mother confronts Benjamin and forces him to tell Elaine that he had an affair with her mother. She immediately cuts him out of his life and goes off to school. Where Benjamin finds her and tries to win her back, unfortunately her parents get in the way once again and she ends up by getting married to her boyfriend. He breaks into the wedding and interrupts the ceremonies and then Elaine and him see each other face to face and run away with each other onto a bus, with everyone chasing behind after them. I thought that it was interesting to see in the end that he acted the same way with Elaine as he did with her mother all along, and that was being silent or even secluding himself from the outside world. We saw him laying on the bed or the float in the pool seemingly forever throughout the movie. Then we see a different side of him when he starts hanging out with Elaine but then at the end of the movie it seemed like he was in his same state of seclusion as before. We see him just staring out into space sitting in the back of the bus with his lover Elaine right next to him. He didn't even look at her as well as not talking to her and that's how the scene ends. Also with the movie bringing in over 100 million dollars in sales with only putting in 3 million into the movie. Also with Simon & Garfunkel having numerous tracks in the movie corresponding with the narration was a big hit with the audiences back then, thus giving then even bigger genre of people coming to see the movie.",The Graduate
498,rhall-14,Can I Graduate?,9,27 January 2006,"This 1967 film directed by Mike Nichols portrays the story of a young man who has just graduated from college and is that awkward stage, a state of limbo, between his education and the real world. Right away we get the impression that Benjamin Braddock, played by a young Dustin Hoffman in the film, is being pulled inexorably toward an unwanted future, and he feels trapped in his current situation of confusion. We get a great sense of this through the camera work and the odd ways in which some of the scenes are shot.The opening scene of the movie, when the title, cast, and some credits flash by on the screen, we get a shot of Ben on a conveyor belt at the airport, after he has gotten off his flight to return home from the east coast. The camera moves with him as he is drawn forward on the moving walkway. Because of this shot, coupled with the empty, lost look on Ben's face, the viewer gets a very clear sense that Ben is being dragged toward a future and a place that he does not wish to face.In the next scene, Ben is forced by his parents to leave his room and go downstairs to his welcome home/congratulations party. Once he gets downstairs he instantly wants to get out, and tries to avoid conversations and the people in his house. However, whenever he turns somewhere to leave he is encountered by one of his parents' friends. This shows that he feels trapped in his parents' life, a life that he is doomed to lead if he does not figure out his future.Later, after Ben drives Mrs. Robinson back to her house and she asks him to come inside, we get more images of entrapment. Mrs. Robinson continues to corner him in her daughter Elaine's room, eventually, coming into the room naked and closing and locking the door behind her. This is an image of actual entrapment, but it still further exemplifies the theme that runs throughout the movie of Ben being trapped in an unwanted part of his life.A few scenes later, when Ben goes into the pool with the gift his father gave him (a full body scuba suit) we see a different scene of entrapment. As Ben enters the water, with all these people around him clapping and cheering (many of whom Ben hardly knows or cares about) he stays in the deep end of the pool, his back against the wall. The camera pans out a bit and we can see that Ben is staying there to keep away from this life that he wants no part of. In this case, he is choosing to be literally trapped under the water to stay away from this other life (the life above the water) that he has been trapped in.When Ben goes to Berkeley to find Elaine and marry her, the viewer sees another scene of entrapment, in this case because of some brilliant camera work by the director. After Ben follows Elaine to the zoo and sees Carl go off with the woman he wishes to marry, the camera shows a shot of Ben looking very defeated. However, it is shot from the other side of a cage in the zoo, giving the viewers that Ben is the animal trapped in a cage, his life consisting of this tight place that he can't escape from.In general, The Graduate is a film about entrapment, about a part of ones life where they are no longer young but aren't ready to be thrust into the real world. Nichols and the cast of this film brilliantly show how trapped a young man can feel during this time in his life, and how his world can fall apart and then be regained.",The Graduate

504,canozer123,"Overrated, perhaps... or too simple?",8,13 September 2016,"The Graduate is one of those movies which is glorified as an excellent example of an alternative classic movie by some. I was under the impression that what the first two Godfather films are to the gangster/mafia film genre is similar to what The Graduate is to the romance/early-20s-starting-a-life genre. Boy, I was wrong.I think it's a good film, and it deserves a 100 minutes of one's time even if it's only to be able to comment on such a popular and discussed movie.The film starts by presenting a theme of ""I've just graduated from college, but I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life."" One of my favorites, although it is only expressed in similar words in the movie and then forgotten. We only coincide into the theme two more times; one is a compulsory pep-talk from the father, and the other is the incidental ice-breaker topic of conversation between Ben and Ellaine. It would have been OK to use the theme as an ice-breaker both for the couple and for the movie as well. But its absence, or rather, its introduction and then absence, makes the character quite unrelatable and the topic quite irrelevant. Because there is nothing much interesting about some rich man living off his parents complain about the uncertainty he feels regarding his future.Since the whole drama of the film was based on this premise (exlc. romance), all that is left is a typical, ordinary romantic film where a young person has sex with an older woman, then falls in love with her daughter. The first half of the film is quite good for that matter actually. Ben and Mrs. Robinson are both portrayed as interesting, deep characters. Both develop over time. While Ben's development is rather obvious, we see that Mrs. Robinson isn't just some cougar who sleeps with young men, but has more to offer. Ellaine, though, is not even a character. She is there as if only to fill a void that's left at the script.Overall, I think the writing of the film isn't strong enough for it be a top-tier movie. Maybe it was for the standards of its time, but compared to some of today's films that could be studied under the same/similar categories, it fails to capture not only a relatable portrayal of the lives of the newly graduated, but also a sophisticated and complicated love story as they really are. I give it 7,5/10 on IMDb if I could, and that's only thanks to the great cinematography and to the marvelous soundtrack.",The Graduate

In Some scenes camera angle was spectacular whilst in some it was awkward. The Music cobination was Great. And the main charectar's acting was excellent. I really felt the realistic acting in Gas station scene, he actually looked devasted. And the portrayal of a subtle awkwardness in his charectar was on point. Mr and Mrs Robinson both charectars had good actors. Chruch scene could've been more logical and aslo Elaine's charectar development chould've been better. To be fair a lot of things could've been done differently but this movie is from the 60s. And it's surely great! Mike Nichols won an Oscar for directing this and rightfully so.

511,estella2,The Graduate: A Tale Almost as Tragic as Shakespeare,10,24 September 2006,"The Graduate was a defining motion picture at the time it was released in 1967. The film was based off of the novel by Charles Webb. It made quite an impression on the generation at the time.As Keith Lofthouse says, ""this was the film that became a symbol for youthful rebellion, which not only exposed the generation gap, but widened it."" A lot of people can relate to it in their own way. To me, it's a story about a young-adult learning the intimidating reality of life, love, and society. The Graduate is about a young man, Benjamin Braddock, who has just graduated from college. He comes home feeling stressed out about not knowing what he wants to do with his future. To top it off, everyone (his parents' and their annoying wealthy friends) keep asking him what his plans are. Lost and overwhelmed, he suddenly finds temporary solace when seduced by the wife of his father's business partner, Mrs. Robinson: a married, lonely, alcoholic woman, who seems to share only two similarities with her husband: a daughter, and a love of bourbon. Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson start off their affair by sneaking off to a hotel--- a ritual for them that will continue for the next few months. But the situation soon gets stickier than expected, when Benjamin finds himself forced by his parents to take out Mrs. Robinson's beautiful and witty daughter, Elaine. Mrs. Robinson makes Benjamin swear to her that he will never EVER take Elaine out---but under the continued pressure of his parents', Benjamin caves, and agrees to take Elaine out. After conjuring up the perfect date-from-hell to scare Elaine off, Benjamin's plan backfires, and instead of her breaking out the pepper-spray, she breaks down crying--- and if there's anything worse than pepper-spray, it's a woman crying. Being the real softy he is at heart, Benjamin ends up trying to stop her crying by kissing her, and then falls madly, head-over-heels, in-love with her---and here is where the real trouble begins!Dustin Hoffman delivers a spectacular performance as the nervous and confused Benjamin Braddock. He never failed to break character, and his continued sweating, jittering, and whimpering was converted into absolute hilarity. He also had a certain chemistry with Anne Bancroft that made their scenes together an absolute riot. Anne Bancroft was perfect for the role of the seducer who manipulates her way into Ben's life. Frankly, I could never see Doris Day playing that character, so let us 'thank God' she turned the role down. It's quite amazing that there was only a six-year age gap between Bancroft and Hoffman. It's really hard to tell because Bancroft appears significantly more mature than Hoffman in the film. Her mannerisms were perfect and those famous lines--- ""Do you want me to seduce you? Is that it? ""---was spoken so smoothly, so coolly...as if she was a snake slithering her way up Benjamin's pant leg! Katherine Ross (Elaine) is incredibly beautiful, but she wasn't considered the best actress by many critics and members of the crew. She had problems onset like not being able to cry on cue, so they had to blur the film in some scenes (Nesbit). ""She's a good screamer though,"" said Nesbit. The entire three were nominated for an academy award that year--- along with Mike Nichols,who won for best director. For photography, there was use of clever techniques with angles and lighting. Some say that these techniques were used without much purpose, but when you see it on screen you don't recognize any inconsistency; you only notice how incredibly beautiful it is. Cameras frequently zoom in on faces to show emotion, and follow Benjamin Braddock wherever he goes. At the beginning of the film, we follow Benjamin on an escalator at the airport. The camera continues to stay on him for almost two minutes, and then switches its focus over to a suitcase on a luggage carousel. Normally, watching something as mundane as this would be boring, but it ends up being captivating and bringing about the mood of the film.The music for the film was almost entirely created from the artists Simon & Garfunkel who had been a huge hit at the time. The songs had already been released on album, but the movie increased the popularity of the songs. David Grusin, who composed the jazzy score for the film, created special compositions that included several variations of the Simon and Garfunkel songs. Many critics, such as Nesbit, argue that 'The Graduate' is not only an out-dated film, but also a film that lacks reality. Nebit complains, ""How many can believe, that it's reasonable for a young man to pursue the daughter of a married woman-- who he's just had an affair with--and believe that the daughter would forgive him instantly without further communication?! And all of this after a single night's date!--- with Dustin Hoffman, no less!"" Even though I probably wouldn't do the same thing that Elaine does, I can still find the story reasonable. After all, normal people do things that don't make sense all the time. Is Nesbit now going to start to question the reasonableness of a classic like William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet because they got married after one date? The main purpose of this film was to break the rules of normality in society, although it embraces some of the same old themes of classic Shakespeare. It would be wrong to call 'The Graduate' a ""Romantic film"", because it ends as much a tragedy as 'Romeo and Juliet,'though in a less obvious way--watch the last scene of this film closely and you will realize this.**fun fact: The run to the church scene was a takeoff on the 1924 silent film ""Girl Shy"" starring Harold Lloyd, and Lloyd actually attended the filming of the scene to assist Mike Nichols.",The Graduate

I'm probably way younger than most on this site, but I love movies and this is a great one. First: You have Simon and Garfunkel doing the soundtrack. Both of their #1 hit songs, Sounds of Silence and Mrs. Robison; which was written for the movie, are on this movie and really flow. Second: Dustin Hoffman is top-notch as Ben. He really seems uncomfortable and really shy throughout the whole movie. Well maybe not at the church but most of the film. Third: The camera angles are some of the best I've seen. The side-shot at the beginning of the movie and the 1st-person view when he is in the Scuba gear. Fourth: The story is something way different from what we usually see. Affairs were way more taboo then and I bet it shocked a lot of people. Well this is a classic and well-deserving of a viewing and I would recommend this to all movie fans.",The Graduate

The incredible directing and camera work alone makes this movie a must, and even if one isn't looking for any deeper, artsy meaning they should find it incredibly entertaining.

Also a line that was said where Benjmin said ""God damn it"" was not allowed had this movie been made 3 or 4 years previous. This whole movie was really about an affair.

517,Patsandsoxfan,Echo the sounds of Brilliance,10,26 January 2006,"My lasting memory of The Graduate is of the many images of entrapment used throughout the film. Benjamin Braddock is trapped into his life as a college graduate and most of the movie deals with ways in which he escapes this entrapment. Whether it's a torrid affair with his father's law firm partner's wife, or it's the subsequent ""engagement"" with said wife and partner's daughter, Ben slowly breaks free from his square family's strict rules of conduct and sets off on his own life's trail. Director Mike Nichols and editor Sam O'Steen (who also edited films like Cool Hand Luke and Chinatown) really tell more of Ben Braddock's story than even Dustin Hoffman does. Let's look at the party scene at the beginning of the film to see some of these images of entrapment created solely by the camera-work. The party begins with Ben alone in his room, and the sounds of the party downstairs can be heard. His room is dark and plainly decorated, and a dartboard hangs quietly on the wall. Ben's father, played by William Daniels, bangs on the door and eventually enters Ben's room to confront his son. He's wondering why a party in honor of the new graduate does not have the graduate in attendance. Ben responds simply that he needs to be alone for a while. The only thing Mr. Braddock can say to convince Ben to come downstairs is that these people at the party have know Ben for most of his life, like Ben owes it to all of them to make an appearance and thank them for always being there, when in reality these people are here more because of their relationships with Ben's parents than they are to support the graduate. Ben's being physically forced by his father to go down to the party, to continue the charade of a life that his parents want him to. All Ben wants, though, is to be alone.The most memorable scene of entrapment though, is Ben's scuba gear incident at his 21st birthday party. His father has forced Ben to put on this ridiculous diving suit and to stand at the bottom of their pool to show his father's guests how the suit works. Ben is trapped into the suit on his birthday, completely against his wishes, and eventually decides to humor his parents by stepping into the pool. Ben then jumps in and looks back at his father. The frame of the camera is now showing the view from the mask of Ben's father, who proceeds to take his hand, cover the mask, and push Ben down under water. It's as if William Daniels is pushing the camera underwater. Brilliant.Later in the movie, after Ben is entrenched in the affair with Mrs. Robinson, Ben's spending his days lounging in the pool when his father confronts him, and we see the following exchange, Mr. Braddock: Ben, what are you doing? Benjamin: Well, I would say that I'm just drifting. Here in the pool. Mr. Braddock: Why? Benjamin: Well, it's very comfortable just to drift here. Mr. Braddock: Have you thought about graduate school? Benjamin: No. Mr. Braddock: Would you mind telling me then what those four years of college were for? What was the point of all that hard work? Benjamin: You got me.Ben's beginning to break away from his parent's traps. He's meeting Mrs. Robinson at the Taft Hotel every night and not explaining to his parents where it is that he leaves to each night. He's literally doing nothing except having his affair and lounging by the pool, and it's been going on for weeks. Where Ben was trapped in the darkness during the beginning of the film he is now soaking in the sunshine, but still he's trapped. Now it's in a torrid affair with a family friend and in his backyard. He's still within his parent's world, and that conflict of trying to be free in that world, free to sleep with the partner's wife and eventually to court the partner's daughter, his freedom is in a world where he's still just a kid. This will be troublesome as the film progresses. I've not said enough of the editing of Sam O'Steen. Briefly I'll say the montage of Ben moving from his bed to lounging in the pool to laying on top of Mrs. Robinson and back and forth and so on, all set to Simon and Garfunkel's bittersweet symphonies is one of the most well done sequences I've ever seen. The editing tells the story, and that in itself is exciting.The last scene of the film shows Dustin Hoffman ripping a giant gold cross from a church wall, jamming it into the door to stop Elaine and Carl's wedding party from chasing Ben and Elaine on their escape from their parent's world, and then getting onto a community bus, setting off on a lifetime together. Simple, elegant, brilliant. ...Hello darkness, my old friend ...I've come to talk with you again ...Because a vision softly creeping ...Left its seeds while I was sleeping ...And the vision that was planted in my brain ...Still remains ...Within the sound of silence",The Graduate

519,Fandango137,Cultural Climax and Peak Materialism,7,10 July 2020,"Cultural Climax and Peak Materialism
posted 2 days ago by Fandango (303)The Graduate is an interesting analysis into the end of the American zenith, the final decade before its gradual dissolution. The 50s and 60s are ubiquitously regarded as the civilizational peak of the country, yet this film paints a very different picture. Despite lauded freedom, the film is presented in a claustrophobic, suffocating manner, with the bureaucratic undertones making the audience feel as though Benjamin is not as free as one may think. He is being limited by the success-driven mindset that permeated American culture, carrying the remnants of the Protestant work ethic as he leaves behind the decade of conservatism and enters the period of liberal sensibilities.Benjamin, being presented as one of the early baby boomers (born likely around 1945), is the first to experience the transition from post-war America (peak materialism), into a more socialist entity (idealism). The contrast here is seen throughout the film where Benjamin's composure, neat appearance, and clean car throughout the course of the film become sullied and dirty. This is the shedding of materialism that was seen in hippie culture. Benjamin and Elaine are the counter-culture. They are programmed by traditional shibboleths, and experience a constant cognitive dissonance when the old world is at an impasse with the new world (e.g., Mrs. Robinson, a symbol of the Silent Generation, and her infidelity). Benjamin's sweat throughout the film reaffirms the idea that he is uncomfortable with the world around him.The black and white of the families is indicative of the post-war American idealism. They exist within the confines of this structure, while Benjamin is at odds, because that period is over. Despite his entry into this new world of liberal beliefs, the visual aesthetic presented with the vastness of the landscapes serve as a reflection of the emptiness in Benjamin's soul. His options are opening, but they lead to nowhere, much like the old world. This is again reaffirmed in the end, when after Benjamin and Elaine sit down on the bus, their smiles turn to emotionless expressions, as they realize that despite doing what they ""felt"", they're still vacuous.The conclusion is simple; as Benjamin and Elaine leave the old world of traditional institutions, built up standards, conformity, and appearance (materialism), and enter the world of feelings, ideals, liberalism (idealism), they're still existing in a spiritually vacuous world. They have no purpose beyond the fulfillment of their base pleasures. Where the Silent Generation found those pleasures in material excess (50s and 60s and its elevation of materialism as the highest goals in life), the Baby-Boomers sought to seek contentment through beliefs and ideals. In the end they were both wrong, because any mode of thinking revolving around personal contentment stiffens spirituality and, as a result, dilutes moral imperatives.America, here, is presented as spiritually empty, focused only on success and the rat-race as a means of hedonistic supply. Benjamin and Elaine dislike this ideology, and inevitably decide to embrace a more laissez-faire attitude, which is ultimately just as morally bankrupt.",The Graduate

When I saw it as an adult I walked away from it realizing that it was brilliant.Dustin Hoffman's performance is hilarious but nuanced and genius at the same time. The direction style was unprecedented at the time and it change cinema forever - there have been many copycats since. It also was a sort of generational groundbreaker. The soundtrack is classic - simply great - by the then relatively unknown Simon and Garfunkel.All of the performances are really funny yet amazingly nuanced and done with such care and scrutiny.There is nothing sappy about the movie and it's not a typical feel good movie - people often rate movies on how good the movie makes them feel.

The movie is as perfect as the movie should be. If they had to make a remake of this film, it wouldn't be as good as this one. This is possibly the only romantic comedy I know that has no flaws whatsoever. Basically what the movie is trying to tell people is that Ben Braddock is a teen who doesn't know what to do with his life. Many people of his age can relate to that. But when Ben is seduced by Mrs. Robinson and at the same time in love with her daughter Elaine, it becomes something much more and Ben must realize what to do with his problems. There's a couple of scenes where Ben is in the pool, looking like as if he's drowning. To me this means that he truly is ""drowning."" Drowning from his external problems... the pressure from his parents, from Mrs. Robinson, and the pressure from Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine. He really doesn't know what to do with his ""life."" The movie is just pure brilliance. It has enough comedy, romance,tragedy and symbolism for most to enjoy without hesitation. My rating: 4 stars out of 4.",The Graduate
525,yanda_ever,I don't get it...,4,16 June 2011,"The Graduate is about a recent college graduate, Dustin Hoffman, who is unsure about his future and I am left unsure about the movie. The movie is produced and set in the late 60's, probably one of Dustin Hoffman's first movies. Hoffman starts an affair with his dad's business partner's wife, however he falls in love with her daughter and things turn pretty complicated. Because I wasn't very sure how I felt about this movie, I read few reviews on IMDb and to my surprise people are pretty split about this movie as well. Lets start with what I liked, first I thought tackling the idea of being lost, unsure or worried after college is very impressive for that time. the first half of the movie was intriguing and if you are a recent graduate you will probably connect to Hoffman's situation. Although I whole heartedly believe that Dustin Hoffman is a brilliant actor, I thought he was okay in the movie, good acting but not really inspiring. Here I must give it to Anne Bancroft, she was the only one who showed extreme professionally in that movie, she was cold and bold and just a pretty good actress. One of my fav scenes was showing how suffocated Hoffman was.I thought there were good camera angles, lighting, but what I really liked was the editing! for the 60's that movie was really really well edited. I liked the ending how although Hoffman got what he wanted (or maybe thought he wanted) he had this expression on his face of now what? and the music plays my fav track in the movie (though the rest are as good) The Sound of Silence OK...lets see what I didn't like. Well, I thought the movie had really shallow parts and thought Katharine Ross was a bit dumb. I literally laughed out loud at the ending scenes were she started running towards him in the church and the close ups of angry faces that were more of cartoon like expressions with no real emotions. I also thought that Hoffman falling in love with Ross was freaking fast, they had one date! And the second day she knows he was sleeping with her mother, and somehow by the end of the movie she forgives him! how will that even be possible?To wrap it up, I wasn't very interested nor entertained to tell the truth. Yea maybe it was a different movie in the 60's but its not really a classic and I wont recommend it nor do I think it deserves all these Oscar nominations nor being on that top 250 list.",The Graduate

In the same way, the emblematic final scene, marked by the anguished faces of the young, past the euphoria of transgression, to the sound again of The Sound of Silence, is between the basic moments of the cinema of New Hollywood, precisely because it contains in itself the hopelessness of a generation, the doubt about the future, that remains, regardless of the changes undergone. Really, a masterpiece.",The Graduate
530,dporter2-1,Sensational in '67 ... Disconcerting in '05,5,29 July 2005,"In 1967, The Graduate caused a stir  and understandably so. It went where, I believe, no one had gone before  both in style and content. It is considered a classic and the music by Simon and Garfunkel definitely puts it in that category all on its own. At the height of the swinging sixties, I imagine audiences that were gearing up for the ""Make Love, Not War"" Hippy days, would have been applauding at the end.But is it a good movie? Although there's no question that many LOVE it, I have to admit that I'm not one of them. Perhaps I didn't look deeply enough into the symbolism  who knows? All I do know is that at the end of the movie I felt as though I'd just watched something uncomfortably outside of reality and was left feeling a tad confused and more than a little bit cheated from the experience. In fact, I found myself shaking my head several times thinking, ""As if!"" Many would probably argue that the charm of the movie is that it switches gears mid-stream. However, I found it disconcerting. Perhaps that was due to the fact that I had always believed this movie to be a comedy. Again, some would say that it is, but I felt the reverse was true. Although there were some quite humorous moments, I found most of The Graduate to be quite depressing. Even the ending, which should have been a joyful high point, left me feeling flat, due to the way the characters were presented in the final moments.I guess The Graduate will always be considered a classic and a milestone in movie history. No doubt it led to others, like ""The Summer of 42"" and songs like, ""Summer the First Time."" It earned its place in cinema history, and it is probably worth watching by most adults at least once. I've done that and am more than happy to just leave it at that.",The Graduate

532,nsutherland-1,A definitive movie in the 60s,8,26 January 2006,"The drama/romance/comedy The Graduate, by director by Mike Nichols, was as exciting to watch as a suspense thriller in the sense that you really couldn't tell where the story was going at any point in the film. From one scene to the next it was awesome to follow what each character would do next. For example, would Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) really have an affair with a woman twice his age? Is he actually falling for a girl whose mother brought him into maturity? I was asking myself questions like these throughout the film.The opening scene begins with a close up and pulling back shot of the protagonist, Benjamin Braddock. This type of centralizing cinematography seems very useful in elucidating Ben's feelings of being cramped and held in a place he can't get out of. There is an incorporation of ""pop"" music as Ben is being moved along a set path by a standing escalator. At this time he is having orders being commanded at him from a loudspeaker and it is truly a metaphor for his life. He is a college graduate who doesn't know what he is doing with his future because it seems he has always been told what to do, and how to do it. This is the film's recurring theme, one of youthful alienation and the feeling of entrapment by society. Benjamin had been living a life of preparation, but hasn't seemed to decide on what he is preparing for. This movie depicts his struggles with breaking free from the life he has been made to think is his, and the challenges of finding his own path to follow.In the beginning, Ben is magnificently melancholy, and the environment of his household only increases his feeling of despair. His parents are overbearingly proud of him, and are waiting on pins and needles to see what he is going to do with his life, but Ben doesn't even feel like he has a life. Then Ben is re-introduced to a family friend, Mrs. Robinson. As an ex-alcoholic seductress, she opens a whole new world to Benjamin, and the way she does it is oh so thrilling to view. She is unbelievably sure of herself, and the means in which she uses her age and figure to solidify her affair with Ben are purely ingenious, and the power she has over him are at times nothing but comedic.Their affair continues throughout the summer, until Ben is faced with a decision that he has sworn to Mrs. Robinson he has already made, to go on a date with her daughter Elaine. Although he tries his best to give her the cold shoulder, love prevails, and he ends up succumbing to his heart. Everything of course falls apart, because who can really have an affair with someone's mother and not think that everything will come to the surface at some point, especially when one of the parties in the affair develops such animosity towards the other. It is at this point where the theme of water really comes to light. Again and again Benjamin finds his escape in water. Whether he is gazing into his fish tank or submerging himself in his pool this theme of escapism is really apparent to the viewer. Ben is incredibly passive aggressive, and water becomes his safe house. Under the water he can hear no one, and he can be truly alone. He escapes all the pressures that are coming down on him, even if it is only for a brief moment.At this juncture in the movie Ben really comes into his own. He makes some rash, yet full hearted decisions, and it is revealed to the viewer that he is finally capable of breaking away and doing what he wants. He breaks through his passiveness and makes the journey to claim his love, Elaine. The final scene is extraordinarily energizing. Benjamin crosses a line of no return, striving for the one he loves to the point of breaking up her marriage ceremony. In one of Dustin Hoffman's most memorable scenes, he takes the dive of putting his entire self on the line, and wins! The whole last scene is filled with excitement, yet when the two finally get away they are engulfed in pure solemnity. Which leaves the viewer asking, what's next?",The Graduate
533,Kinglink,Possible the greatest movie ever made....,10,19 September 1998,"This movie has changed my life, from a careless person to a person who always tries to succeed whenever there is a challenge.  This is the greatest movie, I have ever seen.  It has a good story line, wonderful music, unbelievable acting, and cinematography that is unsurpassed.   My most favorite shot is the zoom out of Mrs. Robinson(Anne Bancroft) at the Robinson home.  I highly suggest that anyone who does not know where their life is going should see this movie.",The Graduate
534,MADBOY,This CLASSIC can change one's life,10,14 January 2000,"This movie is everything one can expect from a classic, but it's still MORE. Excelent actings, wonderful cinematography, astonishing direction, and most important of all, touching story.What makes of ""The Graduate"" a real classic is the conflict in the carachter's life: how a fool and intelligent guy turns into a smart and decided man; how can such a sensual woman use a man to get sex and then take him off her life; how can a girl, seemingly presented to us as being so boring, conquer the heart of that fool guy and make him change his mind.What makes ""The Graduate"" become a mark in my life is its poetry. It doesn't talk about a virgin guy who discovers the world. It's about a man who discovers himself, a man who finds himself after years trying to be what the parents, the neighbors and friends wanted him to be. Suddenly, discovering sex and love, The Graduate becomes a real MAN. If you haven't seen this movie, you MUST see. I never thought it could touch me at such a deep way, but it did. Go see this movie. Maybe you'll find out that a guy comes a MAN not when he makes sex, but when he learns to fight for the things he loves.",The Graduate
535,Cheetah-8,I thought this was real funny.....,9,20 March 1999,"I thought this movie was going to be quite a serious film to watch, but a few minutes into the film, I discovered the ironic humourous side to it. I think perhaps when this film first came out perhaps people didn't find it funny (I could be wrong though). Dustin Hoffman plays a character so naive as to be painful to watch - bordering on the Alan Partridge scale of things. There are several moments in this film where he puts his foot in it big time, and the poor guy really doesn't endear himself to the film's other characters. This movie has some really good direction and the music went quite well with it. The ending just has to be seen though - it has been lifted a hundred times over for use in other movies, but I thought this is still the best.",The Graduate
536,kentig,"The ""Generation Gap"" movie of its time",9,26 June 1999,"The trying times of youths, stuck between the innocent and promising teen years & the oncoming reality of adulthood is adroitly portrayed in this movie.  Benjamin Braddock, who has just graduated college with honors, is undecided about how he is going to spend the rest of his life.  Instead of finding answers, he is confronted with questions that he cannot respond to. So, he begins a sordid affair with Mrs. Robinson that leaves him bored, uncaring,& in his own words, ""just drifting"".  When he meets Elaine, he begins to see that his life has taken a purposeful turn, only to be stymied in his quest for her love by the jaded Mrs. Robinson.  How Ben emerges from a scenario that is ""completely baked"" is both a hilarious and poignant trip for movie watchers.  Perhaps my favorite scene in the movie is when Ben is attempting to get a room at the hotel & feels as though a plethora of suspecting eyes is upon him. While this is to be Dustin Hoffman's breakout film, it is also to me by far the pinnacle of Anne Bancroft's distinguished career.  She is both sexy and pitiful. I am also, in retrospect, surprised that Katherine Ross' film career went nowhere after this (although she was in Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid a few years later).  Simon & Garfunkel's music permeates throughout the entire movie, &  the theme of alienation that is so prevalent in Mr. Simon's words seem to have been indeed written for the movie (even though, in reality, songs like Sound of Silence & April Come She Will preceeded it by a few years). What's also interesting is how fresh & undated The Graduate remains today, over 30 years after its release. One funny note: After having seen The Graduate in the theater for the 1st time (I saw it 18 times in the theater!), I told my parents to see it, & advised them to listen carefully to the words in the songs, for they were meaningful to the storyline.  After they did see it, my mother remarked to me that what she got out of it was that Mrs. Robinson's first name was ""Rosemary"".",The Graduate
537,mjs3p,great but often misunderstood film,10,25 May 2000,"Many people who saw The Graduate on its original release, including critics like Roger Ebert, have misinterpreted the main point of the film.  Ben Braddock is NOT a hero that is supposed to glorify the rebellion of the 60s generation.   The viewer is NOT supposed to stand up and cheer after the final scene.  Ben is supposed to represent the confused state of a college graduate stuck in between youth and adulthood.   As best depicted by the scene where he holds the hotel door open for both the elderly group and the younger group, he feels alienated from both generations.  He does not want to hear the loud music of the car next to him at the drive-thru, nor is he interested in `plastics' or the materialistic pleasures of his parents.He has no idea what he wants out of life, and only thinks that marrying Elaine will be the solution to this problem.  As the last shot depicts (which may be the best final shot in film history), Ben only seems to be happy for a few seconds after he and Elaine get onto the bus with no money, no prospects, and no certain future.  In fact, Nichols cleverly uses Paul Simon's Sound of Silence, and drowns out much of the background sound to show that Ben's is in the same position at the end of the film as he is at the beginning.  He has not found what he really wants to get out of life and is as confused as ever.   This scenario is not dated nor is it only appropriate for the 60s, it can apply to anyone who is lost or has no idea what to do with his or her lives.Nichols' brilliant direction reinforces the complex exploration of confusion and uncertainty.  The flow of shots after he first sleeps with Mrs. Robinson is incredible, as is his use of the swimming pool to enforce his entrapment. He effortlessly switches in and out of focus at different depths of each shot to emphasize certain characters and dialogue.  It goes without saying that the performances by Hoffman and Bancroft are first-rate.  Add Paul Simon's haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting.  As a recent college graduate who was not even born in the 60s, I can say that this film has not dated, and is deserving of its #7 ranking by the American Film Institute.",The Graduate

Im not going to waste any more time on minor criticisms this is still one of the great movies of the 1960s, great acting and superb images particularly one of the all time great opening shots (Tarantino borrowed it for Jackie Brown) also a terrific soundtrack. 9 out of 10.",The Graduate

I was intrigued by this movie, especially the first half. Ben's relationship with Mrs. Robinson was crafted brilliantly and the dialogue was perfect. The chemistry between Bancroft and Hoffman (in an early role) was so good, so believable. I especially loved the crisp dialogue in the beginning when Mrs Robinson begins her seduction of Ben. Although I do agree with some others that the second half was not as good as the first, I think it did serve its purpose to show the haphazard behaviors young people make without thinking them through (being 20, I understand). Altogether, a must see film.",The Graduate

I haven't seen great technical effects, I haven't heard great sound effects. I do have seen very sudden aggressive camera-movements. Still, the film gets 8/10 from me. That's because I love the story (great adaptation from Charles Webb's novel)and I love the soundtrack sang by the great Simon & Garfunkel (Sounds Of Silence, Mrs. Robinson,...). The plot? A graduated student starts an affair with one of the friends of the family (the woman has the double age). They are having an affair for months and then he falls in love with the daughter.

How he comes to know both of these women was a little too quick for me and their relationships change too quickly. The film did not portray exactly what was going on in the main guy's head. However apart from that the film is great. Using music from Simon and Garfunkel which fits the film almost perfectly, the film portrays the main character in a strange light which is unusual but refreshing. The characters are played very well, especially Dustin Hoffman as the main character. This brings magic to the film. The camera is used in a very rare way but a way which gives the film a different aspect. The plot is decent with a lot of sways and turns but focused a bit too much on the main character. Overall a good film but I hope the classic story in the last half of the film does not bore or disinterest viewers.",The Graduate
543,ericcaers,The Scourge of the Sixties,10,25 March 2006,"""The Graduate"" scourges the shallowness of the sixties, kicks against its smug and sanctimonious middle classes: xenophobic, materialistic and spoiled. Mrs. Robinson is the epitome of the devil-may-care LA bourgeoisie and represents the darker side of America's American Dream that is sedated by pills, desensitized by liquor, mind dulled by television, sanitized by the latest Tupperware and gleaming colors to sugarcoat the humdrum of suburban life (Mr. McGuire: I want to say one word to you. Just one word. - Benjamin: Yes, sir. - Mr. McGuire: Are you listening? - Benjamin: Yes, I am. - Mr. McGuire: Plastics.). The adulterous relationship between Mrs. Robinson and Ben is sex for sex only and is cast in terms of indifference, coldness and vulgarity. Mrs. Robinson is like a beast of prey, hungering for sex, absorbing young men's bodies to fight off the specter of old age, hysterically suppressing the anxiety that it causes, keeping her young daughter, whom she regards as her competitor and therefore, adversary, neurotically at bay. The true love between Elaine and Ben, on the other hand, surpasses the tasteless, the absurd and offers hope of a better generation to come (Mr. Braddock: What's the matter? The guests are all downstairs, Ben, waiting to see you. Benjamin: Look, Dad, could you explain to them that I have to be alone for a while? Mr. Braddock: These are all our good friends, Ben. Most of them have known you since, well, practically since you were born. What is it, Ben? Benjamin: I'm just... Mr. Braddock: Worried? Benjamin: Well... Mr. Braddock: About what?

545,danstatham,Timeless masterpiece,10,28 April 2020,"No only is 'The graduate' a brilliant satire, it is also a strange yet comforting tale of a confused and overwhelmed man. Dustin Hoffman delivers a hilarious performance as Benjamin, a graduate without any clear plan or structure to his life.Following a party with his parent's friends, Benjamin is approached by 'Mrs Robinson', a middle aged woman in a surprisingly similar situation to Benjamin himself. The similarities between these characters come from their loneliness; Mrs Robinson doesn't sleep with her husband anymore and Benjamin struggles to find anyone he can relate to. When Mrs Robinson tells Benjamin that she is 'available', a bizarre affair ensues. The comedic situation is further developed when Benjamin takes an interest in Mrs Robinson's daughter...The majority of the humour in this film comes from Hoffman's character. When Benjamin is first approached by Mrs Robinson, he seems intimidated by her interest in him. Hoffman perfectly displays Benjamin's social awkwardness- ""I think you're the most attractive of all my parent's friends."" Part of the reason why many are so fond of this movie is the relatability of Benjamin. We can all identify a moment in our lives where we have felt like him.The warmth of the story is emphasised by an iconic soundtrack from Simon and Garfunkel, the most notable song of which, being 'Mrs Robinson'. The soundtrack elevates simple moments within the film into highly expressive moments of cinema.'The Graduate' mixes comedy with art.

Back to the graduate, let's talk a little about the feeling, floating in the pool, dull but deep aching, the presentiment of something important there, the detatchment from the world, the singularity of it, it is the soil of greatness, the state which allows for great love that is not bound by conventions of society...It's a blue movie too, a good color blue, and a great soundtrack also; I love Elaine, don't we all?

The young Dustin Hoffman was made to star as Benjamin, a college graduate who finds himself with too much time on his hands.  He finds himself seduced by Mrs. Robinson--a family friend--stunningly portrayed by Anne Bancroft.  Conflict erupts when Benjamin falls in love with Mrs. Robinson's daughter despite the elder Robinson's words to stay away. I found myself mesmerized both by Hoffman's superb acting as an innocent young man but Bancroft steals the show as the sly, wicked seductress who must keep him away from her daughter at all cost.

Fortunately, I never saw it listed in a TV guide all these years, so was not tempted.I was given the video for Christmas. Tonight I ran it! No, I was not embarrassed by the story or the title character. I was embarrassed by my naiveté. This time around I found the movie hilarious, and Katharine Ross the idealised woman of my adolescent expectations in the 60s. Mrs. Robinson is despicable! (but not much more so than the other 'adult' characters of decadent Southern California portrayed so brilliantly).I'd forgotten the movie had a so-called 'happy ending'.Oh, and one other thing.

Director Mike Nichols' visualization of this post-collegiate anomie--Hoffman floating in a pool, virtually catatonic, or waddling helplessly through crowds of gawking adults in awkward scuba gear--are unforgettable, as are Hoffman's and Anne Bancroft's touching performances...Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson, her hardened aggressiveness concealing the hurt of a child, is particularly fantastic. Nichols' takes us along on Benjamin's journey from Mrs. Robinson's burnt-out, cynical embrace to his sudden realization, under the red lights of a seedy strip-club, that some things are still pure and unsullied. In the end, Nichols' direction elevates Benjamin's ensuing struggle to something broader, more profound--we feel Benjamin is fighting not only for the girl he loves, not only against her cynical parents, but for a life with integrity against a bankrupt and wasted society.",The Graduate

To begin with, it's hard to find any film in that time period that dealt better with the subject of someone coming of age being so alienated from the society around them, this reflected so well in the character of Benjamin Braddock(played superbly by the tour de force performance of Dustin Hoffman). And I'd add that the same great acting was also true for the other actors(Katherine Ross, Anne Bancroft).This theme of alienation is also evident with the character of Mrs. Robinson(Anne Bancroft's character) living the sad, lonely, alcoholic existence she does and whose seduction of Benjamin is a desperate ploy to overcome the malaise in her life.The average viewer would think that such a pathetic schlemiel like Benjamin couldn't possibly hope to make it with a glamorous gal like Elaine(Katherine Ross)but alas when all seems lost and against all the odds, he finally gets the girl in the end.

As we all know there were plenty of changes in society at this time, political protests, womens rights, animal rights, etc. etc. This movie seems to be based off the sexual rebellion that was so prevalent during this time. I'm sure the success of this movie was because of Dustin Hoffman's character. It was very popular in the 60's to experiment sexually (ie sex before marriage). In the movie, Ben, was like the king of sexual rebellion. Not only was he having sex before marriage, but he was having it with an older married woman!

At the time, it probably did a decent job of reflecting the angst and worry of the young upper middle class.  Now, however, it seems very dated.  Its sense of alienation is pretty quaint compared to the problems young people have to go through today.  The scenes where Benjamin tries to win Elaine's heart are outright freaky now that people have a better grip on what stalking is all about.Dustin Hoffman has a lot of screen presence, which keeps the movie from being a total turnoff.  But the character of Benjamin is ultimately an empty one, and you strangely find yourself disliking his parents not because they're too rigid and old school, but because they're too pampering and soft.  Mrs. Robinson's explosive anger toward the end is the only emotion in the entire movie which feels genuine, and despite its best efforts, the film can't quite manage to squelch the fresh air that her rage brings to the stuffy set piece of The Graduate.",The Graduate

We feel the emotions of his character he is not sure about is future and he search for himself. Mrs Robinson play the perfect and original milf ( i think ). When he met Elaine the story take place and as the film goes we see that Elaine and Ben have to make a choice between their love and their family. The end of the film is the best i have ever seen Ben who scream ELAINE ELAINE ELAINE and when they go on the bus with the sound of silence of Simon and Garfunkel. It is the most amazing thing i saw in cinema the whole movie take place for me they were happy when they climb and has the song goes their smile faded and my interpretation of it is that they think of the choice they made between love and family and they don't regret it but they are sad to have been obligated to make this decision Thanks and an other timeBest Soundtrack ever i am usually not a huge fan of the long minutes without speaking but the way they act go so well with the song that i find it beautifulsorry for the bad English Max !,The Graduate

But than he falls in love with her daughter Elaine(Katharine Ross). I liked the story and especially the great performance of Dustin Hoffman. It has great scenes and the music, by Simon and Garfunkel, fits great in this movie. And I really liked the end scene. The look on there faces and the music is just great! I recommend this movie to everyone, especially Dustin Hoffman fans!Also the extra's on the DVD are nice to watch.

559,ankit_n_gokhale,Weird. Irritating. Unfunny,2,26 December 2015,"Yeah, well.This is one of those rare but unavoidable instances where critics (especially Roger Ebert) and audience together vehemently love a movie and I vehemently abhor it (another one was 'The Big Lebowski'. I know, crazy right?)Well, what can I say? I found The Graduate to be irritatingly unfunny and mind-numbingly boring. And weird too. Now, I am all for boring and weird (I loved 2001: A Space Odyssey), but this was a little too much. Let's start with 10 stars.->Shoddily/Weirdly Written Characters a. Dustin Hoffman's character 'Benjamin' is supposed to be very smart and reasonably rational (in accordance with his college accomplishments, as declared by his parents in the beginning of the movie). But each scene reveals him to be an Idiot and a douche-bag. His character acts upon random emotions, is careless, fearful, shy, inconsiderate, lacks basic reasoning ability, gets infatuated with Katherine's Character, then stalks her, all the while worrying about his future but not doing anything about it. All through the film he repeats a same pattern: Act upon impulse, worsen the situation, then apologize profusely for his action. Rinse and repeat.Now I am all OK with dumb characters (as long as it's a comedy film), but I found it impossible to relate to 'Benjamin' He was just a little too dumb for a supposedly-smart guy, not to mention a little hard of hearing too - it caused cognitive dissonance. And he has sex with the hottie Anne Bancroft (more on her later) with the lights off! Are you serious? 2 stars deducted. 8 remainingb. Katharine Ross' character is no different. She is the female version of Benjamin. Shown to be attending Berkeley (so you assume she has a well built top floor) but is stupid to the core. Any reasonable girl would have instantly rejected a boy who takes her to a strip club for the first date. But not her. After a profuse apology and an non-consensual kiss by Benjamin, she is all fine and dandy. Even falls in love with him (why? because he is the main character?) and then agrees to his marriage plan (there is no actual proposal shown) without any thought or consideration. What a stupid girl. 2 stars deducted. 6 remainingc. Minor characters are also weird. Like Katherine's dad, who is unconvincingly insistent on making it happen between Benjamin and Elaine (Katherine's Character). Like Benjamin, he is hard of hearing. So, he always, pours Benjamin Scotch when he asks for Bourbon. Friend's of Benjamin's parents declare how proud they are of his accomplishments in the first scene which strikes a little too unrealistic. Now I am from India, where unless you take your family out of poverty, it is rare to hear those words even from your Parents. But I have a funny feeling that this (friend's declaring their pride to be a friend of parents of an accomplished boy) does not occur anywhere, even when they want to fake it. 1 star deducted. 5 remaining.->Weird and unconvincing scenes. There are many: Church scene, strip club scene, college scene, every other scene. 2 stars deducted. 3 remaining.->Stupid and Weird music. I found myself wanting to punch my laptop every time they played the 'bla, bla, bla, Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and thyme, bla bla bla' song. And to my misfortune, they played it just too many times. 2 stars deducted. 1 star remaining.-> Pointless Cinematography and editing. Like the scene where he turns his head to see nude Mrs. Robinson. I know they wanted to emphasize it. But it doesn't work. The scuba dive suit scene. The same. The changing background scene where they show Benjamin to be living a normal life and have sex with Mrs. Robinson. Seems superfluous. The scene where he strolls into Berkeley seemed too long. God, there are many scenes which I hated. 1 stars deducted. 0 stars remaining.The good. 1. Anne Bancroft's character Mrs. Robinson. She played it so well - the quintessential confident MILF. I almost became a fan of her. She is the reason I survived through the movie. 1 star added.2. Dustin Hoffman's acting. Again, superb performance by him too. Played the stupid, confused character well. 1 star added.Overall rating: 2 stars. I didn't like it, but I didn't regret seeing it. But you are not me. You may like it. May even become your favorite. Just watch it so that you don't regret.",The Graduate

OK i buy all this but why she wouldn't want ben to be with her sister? i mean whats wrong? or whats inappropriate? this vague concern begins with the start of the movie just before they haven't met with each other and keeps still in the end with the result of escaping them of the wedding. as i said, characters in the movie show off the utmost point of their attitude unreasonably. but all this, film is good in general besides i like old and cliché movies. just because i appreciate the effort driven by cast i would give 9 points to film, also keeping the Oscar in mind. it is worth watching for it!",The Graduate
561,jbaker4-1,Ben stays in the fish tank,5,27 January 2006,"Jeff Baker Prof. Niemi New Amer. Cinema 27 Jan 2006 The Graduate ""You're not one of those agitators?...one of those outside agitators?"" ""Oh - no sir.""Although some have made The Graduate (Mike Nichols, 1967) out to be a film of social rebellion, the main character Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) remains just as trapped at the end of the film as he is at the start. Besieged by 'the normal life' of an upper-middle class milieu, Ben seeks the blank pleasure in just ""drifting here in the pool"" after graduating from college a track star and Frank Helpingham Award Scholar. He is ""a little upset"" about his future, which seems void of anything real or substantial. In an ominous exchange during his graduation party in the beginning of the film, Mr. McQuire tells him, ""There's a great future in plastics,"" and it is clear to the audience that Ben views his future as an expanse of plastic thereafter. He attempts to 'rebel' against this inevitable-seeming future, but manages to simply run away and generate a whole new slew of problems for himself and Elaine Robinson (Katharine Ross).The beginning of the film has Ben being passed by on the people-mover at LAX by a fair amount of interesting characters, most notably a sailor and a cowboy. Ben is just cruising along there on after having just finished college. When he arrives at home to find his parents have thrown him a party and invited all of their friends, he asks his father (William Daniels), ""could you explain to them that I have to be alone for a while?"" Ben needs time after four years of intense academic achievements to digest what he's just done. He needs to focus his experiences and make sense of them all in order to figure out what's next. Everyone thinks he'll go on to graduate school, but he doesn't seem too enthused about more school. And he doesn't want a job in plastics, which is what his parents' friends are into. Aligned with the spirit of the late '60s, Ben is mortified at the thought of becoming his parents. So instead of continuing school, he decides to just float on his raft and to float on Mrs. Robinson, metaphorically speaking of course (in reference to the jump cut that starts with Ben jumping onto his raft and cuts to him landing on Mrs. Robinson).But Ben wants more, or at least thinks he does. So he tries to drop his fling with Mrs. Robinson and take off after Elaine Robinson. He realizes that a relationship with Mrs. Robinson is hopelessly off limits to him in any conventional sense, but Elaine is. She is a younger version of her mother and by going after her, Ben is rebelling against his pseudo-parents, the Robinson's (Mr. R. told be he thinks of him as a son). This strange incestuous rebellion keeps him within the familiar, within the family unit and he doesn't need to extend himself out into society for love or relations.In the end, when Ben and Elaine run off from her wedding to Carl, they are both still trapped. They may be fleeing from their old suburban life, but where are they headed? She is now legally bound to Carl, but she is with Ben. This will lead to a reckoning at some point where she'll need to go back and sever the ties (or be sucked back in). And where is Ben? He's in another fishbowl. The imagery of the rounded bus, the camera looking in the windows at him elicits a sense of being adrift again in a fish tank (imagery from the beginning of the film). There is nowhere for them to go, and they haven't proved anything except their determination to provoke Mr. & Mrs. Robinson.",The Graduate

564,menaces,Definitely one of the best movies made,10,3 November 1998,"At the risk of continuing the 'whether this is a great movie' debate, few movies have captured the essence of a time period as well as The Graduate. I feel that anyone who thinks that it is stupid, overrated or the characters are clueless is totally taking the wrong tack.The film is brilliantly made and directed and it has a wonderful soundtrack. These two things alone make it deserve its spot in the top movies of all time.  While the characters are not 'realistic' particularly for today's values, they are representatives of something (as has been eloquently put in other comments).  Thus their actions per se are not terribly important; it is the reasons behind them that are.It is a film of dreams, and about rejecting the staus quo, not a realistic character based story.  Its message is one of doing what you feel is right in the circumstances.  It seems to me to epitomise all the new ideas of the sixties that have been washed away in cynicism and rationalism since.  It is a monument to youth, and to the youth of the sixties in particular.",The Graduate

I've since grown out of this, but the feeling of directionlessness, uncertainty and gradual understanding had a big impact. What you really want to hear as a teenager is that someone else has experienced what you experience.

Had sex with parents' friend's wife, multiple times, and was force into a young, healthy, good looking young girl, his sexual partner's daughter. Not sure if this should be a proper man's dreamed drama. He has zero feeling and compassion for the mom, and went thug by snatching the daughter from her wedding, with no job, no life, no sense of shame towards any other people affected by him negatively.I think this should be criticized rather than romanticized.Dustin's goofy and innocent behavior is too fake and cannot stand to the basic human reaction at all.Anne Bancroft played this character perfectly. The tempo of lines, the movement, the gesture, the facial expression. Every bit fits.Soundtrack is also a bit off and overly used. Try to create a atmosphere which is not at all presented by the plot.

570,Big_Bright_Green_Movie_Machine,Stand Up Tall Mrs. Robinson! God in Heaven Smiles on Those Who Pray!,10,8 July 2011,"The Graduate from 1967 is a masterpiece in almost all aspects. It features a phenomenal cast including Dustin Hoffman, as Benjamin Braddock, a shy and nervous college graduate who is uncertain about his future. Anne Bancroft, as Mrs. Robinson. A business partner of Ben's father. And Katherine Ross as Elaine Robinson. The daughter of Mrs. Robinson who Ben falls in love with.The film gradually starts as a simple comedy but then it becomes more deep into plot as trouble evolves. The basic story is about Ben Braddock, a recent college graduate who is seduced by Mrs. Robinson and they begin to have an affair. Then Ben goes out on a date with Elaine Robinson, Mrs. Robinson's daughter, much to Mrs. Robinson's annoyance. A relationship between Ben and Elaine blossom. But Mrs. Robinson does everything in her power to put a stop to the relationship.The directing is incredible. This film won an ""Oscar"" for Best Directing, and it deserved it. The zooms are done very nicely and the camera angles are way ahead of its times. The film also features a soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel. It's incredible. It's the best movie soundtrack I have ever heard. I bought the soundtrack. That's how good it is.All in all, The Graduate is a great film.

However, knowing that I was going to be teaching, it was still a rather scary time, not knowing what to expect, but also knowing I had to make it on my own. I couldn't relate to several of Ben's ""problems"" but I did see a lot of my college friends in Ben and their lack of direction, their lack of commitment. It wasn't the best of times, but it certainly wasn't the worst of times either. I couldn't imagine Ben's plight with the mom coming onto him, but I could have identified with his bumbling in getting a room, being totally naive about such things. It was a time of turmoil, not only with self, but with what was going on in the world at the time. No doubt all ""ages"" have the same types of problems, and kids aren't really ready to tackle ""life"" just out of school, and this movie just points out that the real winners are the ones who actually roll up their sleeves and get on with life, doing the best you can, and working towards a goal.",The Graduate

Look at movies that came before this one, and then all the movies that came after it, and you can see that this was a turning point for art direction and cinematography in films. The sound score provided by Simon and Garfunkel is simply beautiful, and is used masterfully throughout the film. Watch for the collage of scenes that have been beautifully edited and transitioned to the tune of ""Sounds of Silence.""

574,LadyJ47,Prequel to Rain Man?,8,9 January 2010,"This movie is such a timeless classic. From the trendy outfits of the sixties to the lovely Anne Bancroft, this movie is definitely a must see. The beginning of the movie is what I really love. The initial affair scenes. Anne Bancroft is outstanding as the sexy, sultry Mrs. Robinson. How she seduces young Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) is so cool with little to no effort. From the middle to the end of this film was great too, but mainly because of Katharine Ross' sympathetic Elaine Robinson. The interaction between her and Benjamin on their first date was so sweet and poignant. It made a wonderful contrast to the dirty and empty affair scenes from the beginning of the movie between Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson. It made for a wonderful lead in to what I thought was the best part of the movie. Elaine finding out Benjamin's other woman was her own mother. You have innocent Elaine joking around with Benjamin who has just rushed to tell her that he had been having an affair with her mother. Her mother goes to stop him. She stands in the barely open doorway just as Benjamin is going to tell her who he had an affair with. Elaine looks in the crack her doorway, sees her mother standing there dripping wet from the rain, and her face goes from giddy to a deep mixture of sadness and disgust. Classic.My ONLY 2 issues with this film were these. Too much Simon & Garfunkel. Too much. I love some of their old stuff, but it became a bit distracting with constant songs of theirs playing in the background of most scenes. Then there is the character of Benjamin Braddick. He was the most....hmmmmm, what's a nice word for retarded? He was the most special person I have seen aside from Raymond from Rain Man. It's no wonder Hoffman got picked to play that part. Some of his ridiculous statements, actions, and those sighs he kept making made me wonder what on Earth would these beauties see in him? He had an endearing quality about him, but he was so annoying. As a woman, I just didn't get it.

578,camadon,Brilliant,9,18 February 2006,"After hearing all the hype about The Graduate I wasn't expecting it to live up to my expectations, but it did. After seeing this parodied in so many films I expected it to be ruined for me, that I would be picturing those situations instead of focusing on what was happening in the film in front of me. This was not the case. I found the way in which this was filmed struck me more than any other film I have seen. There were some scenes that were familiar to me, not because it had been parodied in another film, but rather I could see where other films borrowed elements from this one. One example of this is when Benjamin first drives across the Golden Gate Bridge on his way to get Elaine to marry him. This reminded me of a scene in Cruel Intentions where Sebastian is on his way to get back into the good graces of Annette. In both of these films the camera zooms out from the car driving across the bridge (although it is not the same bridge in Cruel Intentions) while music plays in the background; Simon & Garfunkle in The Graduate and Counting Crows in Cruel Intentions. This is just one example of the incredible influence this film has made on contemporary film-making.The camera adds to the feeling of the characters from the very beginning when you see Benjamin being drawn forward by the moving sidewalk. Here the viewer can tell that this is a person who doesn't know his own direction, who stares blankly at the future which is pulling him forward, and he is not deciding upon himself.Another scene that is intriguing is during the party Benjamin's parents throw for him upon returning home. The shots are all close up, and at one point we see Benjamin walking away from two older women. We see him from over their shoulders, as if the camera itself is one of these people pushing in on Benjamin's life.Another instance similar to this is when Benjamin finally realizes what Mrs. Robinson wants from him. In this instance the camera is behind Benjamin looking at Mrs. Robinson, and we can see the right half of his head in the left side of the shot. In both of these instances the camera almost takes on the role of a character. We can observe the whole scenario but not from a wide angle which would show the characters, and the distance between them, but rather we can get a sense of how the characters feel because we become part of the shot.There are endless examples of the brilliance of camera angles in this film, but I will move on. Another thing that struck me were the transitions. In particular the one where Benjamin is in the pool with all of his scuba gear on and the camera starts pulling away as his image gets hazy to us. We then hear a conversation starting between himself and Mrs. Robinson, it then cuts to him in a phone booth at a hotel asking Mrs. Robinson if she would like to join him; implying that he has accepted her offer of having an affair. This transition adds to the way in which his life seems random and directionless, adding to the theme of alienation we get throughout the film. To top all of this off there is a quirky humor running throughout the film. This spans from the odd noises Benjamin makes when confronted with an awkward situation, to his vehemence in the pursuit of Elaine, such as when she leaves him in the hallway going into her class, and he stands there until she comes out again resuming their conversation right where it left off.This is a brilliant film with the combination of the stylistic elements, humor, and in general the feeling you get when watching this film. No wonder it has been parodied and borrowed from in so many contemporary films.",The Graduate

But the risque theme falls flat now.There are many other flaws in the movie. Dustin Hoffman does not come across as a star athlete for one. Also there is a jerkiness in the plot. Elaine mysteriously seems to guess that Benjamin is having an affair. Also Benjamin moves suddenly from avoiding Elaine to loving her and wanting to marry her. This is not even 60's.. It seems out of the 19th century.

Okay-Buck did come up with the ""Plastics!"" and "" are you here for an affair?"" lines; as well the sight gags of the smoke Ann Bancroft exhales after the first kiss and the car skidding on the sidewalk at the mention of the Taft Hotel-and of course the 3 main Paul Simon-aka ""Mr. Alienation""-songs used in the film.

But then years have passed since they talked. Is this is guy movie or what!?! To me its a gender/bender movie, one of the few masterpieces. If a woman who sees this moves does't click to it she can go all the way to Hawaii and not back without me paying! If that's the case, this woman is without humor and the main blood vessels. The characters are made of flesh and blood, people are put in surreal circumstances, especially Dustin as the timid graduate, tortured by his every-demanding parents, Bancroft as the lonely neighbor in need of company, drinking her problems away, and Ross as her innocent, oh so beautiful daughter. But then the mother is so also. Dustin is so right for this part and you can't imagine anyone else playing it. Just try to image Robert Redford in this part, but he didn't qulify because director Nichols sensed that Redford was too much at ease with girls. Thinking about directors with sense! Nowadays it's the producer with the biggest budget who calls the shots - Jerry what? So is Ann Bancroft who has never been lovelier or more aggressive in an amusing way. I love this movie, every bit of it. It's not only terribly funny, it's also painfully funny. It's surreal. Mike Nichols is the director but I want to mention the main producer, Joseph E Levine, who was an outsider in Hollywood; it was made and distributed by AVCO - something you don't see anymore. Made by an independent producer. The Graduate was made in 1967, the box office in those days was 104 millons dollars and is number 18 on the all time list (boxofficemojo.com) - meaning the newest craze on the stupid box office list, Pirates II, for all its glory and money making sounds, is no 50. (Just for you knowledge, adjusted for ticket price inflation The Graduate stands at 547 millions dollars). Those were the times. You cannot leave this movie without listening to the soundtrack by Paul Simon, which happens to be made solely for this movie. It's the perfect soundtrack, each song fitting the scene. As I understand it the soundtrack was made for the movie as an LP, meaning whole, individual songs, not bits and pieces scattered all over the place. It's a great shame they don't make movies like this anymore. What are the studios afraid of? Good stories? Great material? Seeking only the maximum box office impact the first weekend? And they are surprised that more people are watching movies in the comfort of their homes with the newest equipment. I for one have a DVD system and am ever expanding my DVD collection. New movies don't interest me anymore. I long for good movies. As things are, most of them are in the past.",The Graduate
589,solear75,In Defense of Pure Intentions,8,15 September 2006,"The interesting thing about this title to me is how often the plot is misunderstood and how very relevant it still is today. Of course the story is about becoming ""a man"", and an adult, etc. That is the basics, The Graduate 101. What I'm often struck by is how many people watch this movie and think the script is about breaking with conventions, whereas in the end what Benjamin really wants is to do the conventional thing -- except that he wants to do that conventional thing with pure intentions.At the beginning of the movie he spends much of his time realizing that the 'approved' life for a middle class boy like him (graduate school,expensive toys, and 'sowing oats')is anything but satisfying. The purposeless pursuit of distinction and pleasure is not something which can satisfy this overachiever for too long. He feels boredom and sets out to satisfy that boredom by doing the 'off-limits', only to discover that it too is conventional and boring in its own way. The adults around him are deep in their own cynicism(drinking, affairs, keeping up with the Joneses!). On the other hand, Benjamin desperately wants to talk with someone who is not cynical or jaded, with someone who can still feel pleasure at the small things and pain as well. What he most wants is to share ideals and he eventually figures out how to do that. It would have been easy for him to walk away when he finds his ideal but he doesn't. (He is still innocent enough himself to appreciate innocence.) The growing moment and the moment of heroics comes for him when he has to own up. He has to become responsible for his past and future in order to fight for his ideals. (He is after all is the only one insisting on good intentions and truth, not just show and tell, no matter whom it inconveniences.) Some final symbolism is pretty heavy. But I suppose that its those same people who think this movie is about breaking away from convention, who think its ironic that Benjamin makes use of it.",The Graduate
590,the_jackofhearts,A Absolute Classic,9,9 July 2001,"After viewing this film, I fell in love with it!  The film not only launched Hoffman as one of the greatest actors of all time, but was a wonderful film that not only was a serious drama, and touching romance, but also a slap-yer-knee funny film!  Although it was nominated for Best Picture in 1967, it lost to ""In The Heat of the Night,"" which I haven't seen yet, and can't say if it's better!What was most enjoyable about the film was how I could relate with Hoffman's shyness.  He didn't like being around his parents friends, and the acting was so wonderful to show how bashful he really was.If you have not seen this film yet, rent it tonight or buy it!  You won't regret it!",The Graduate
591,Marchbanks,Absolutely amazing!,10,24 May 2002,"I first saw this movie after my freshman year in college, and it hit me like a freight train. I have never felt more able to relate to a movie in my life, and this film's combination of humor, romance, and poignancy remains unequaled by any of the hundreds of films I have seen in my lifetime.If you watch a movie for the actor's performances, you'll love this one. Dustin Hoffman nails the character of Benjamin Braddock in all his nervous vulnerability. Anne Bancroft is absolutely wonderful as the vampish Mrs. Robinson, bringing her insecurities to light at the same time as she presents us with Mrs. Robinson's hard-boiled facade. Katharine Ross as Elaine is the perfect compliment to Hoffman's Benjamin, and the complete antithesis of Mrs. Robinson.If you watch a movie for the director's insight, you'll love this one too. The camerawork in this film is simply breathtaking. The cross-cuts between the Braddock house and the Taft Hotel are mind-blowingly innovative, and the scene capturing Benjamin's point of view in the scuba suit is sheer brilliance. If you're a repeat viewer of the film, try catching all of the symbolism in the film, but be warned: there's a lot of it, so pay attention. (I particularly love the ""Do They Match?"" sign in the opening scene).Finally, if you love the music that goes into a movie, there is no better choice than this film. The Simon and Garfunkel songs fit the movie perfectly, and I can't imagine this film without them. The point at which Benjamin drives out of the tunnel and the vocals on ""Mrs. Robinson"" break in is amazing. I can think of no other film (with the possible exception of ""Easy Rider"") where the soundtrack fits the film so well.But why are you still reading this review? Go out and rent this movie! It is a true cultural touchstone, even for people like me who didn't grow up in the '60s. I give this film an unreserved 10 out of 10, and I'm pretty hard to please...just check out my review of ""Night of the Hunter"" and you'll see what I mean.",The Graduate
592,mailikai,"A subtle, insightful, multi-layered satire",8,18 September 2005,"Who is Mrs. Robinson? The first time I saw this movie as an adolescent, I didn't ask myself this question. Early on, Mrs. Robinson was sexy and mysterious. I wanted Ben to sleep with her. Then I was ready to forget all about her when Ben met her daughter Elaine. I fell in love with Elaine, and from then on wanted Ben and Elaine to live happily ever after. I started to hate Mrs. Robinson, because she tried to keep them apart. At the end, (spoiler alert!) when the camera shows her silently cursing as Ben breaks up Elaine's shotgun wedding, I felt a vindictive pleasure.It's different for me now. My mind fixes on the stilted hotel room ""conversation"" between Mrs. Robinson and Ben. She keeps Ben at arm's length with distant answers to his naive questions about her life. Ben doesn't see her face here, but we do. And we have a chance (one that I missed on my first viewing) to see much more clearly than Ben how much Mrs. Robinson is actually revealing about herself.She married Mr. Robinson in an era before The Pill and legal abortion. They had sex in Mr. Robinson's Ford and the pregnant, future Mrs. Robinson had little choice. For the sake of petty bourgeois respectability, they got married, and Mrs. Robinson began playing the role assigned to her of wife, mother, and cocktail party attendee.Mrs. Robinson tragically made a deal with her devil. She will make her husband breakfast every morning. She will smile graciously at social engagements with his business associates and their wives. She will drown her sorrows in alcohol. She will distract herself from her boredom by having an affair with young Benjamin--perhaps not her first. And if anything were to upset the uneasy balance of this, she may be expected to sacrifice her own daughter on the same altar (literally) of social expectations.Elaine escapes her mother's fate. Mrs. Robinson screams, ""It's too late!"" as Elaine and Ben are fleeing the church, but Elaine answers, ""Not for me!"" Too bad nobody tells Mrs. Robinson that it's not too late for her, either.The only problem with the film is Elaine's character. After Ben stupidly humiliates her at the burlesque club on their first date, we suddenly cut to the now happy couple chatting away at a burger joint. What happened in between? Why didn't Ben's cruel behavior end the date right there? The filmmakers don't seem to know. Elaine runs away with Ben at the end without ever mentioning that it might have hurt her when he broke up her family. It's another inexplicable, unearned forgiveness. What real woman acts like Elaine does in this movie? How could someone so flighty and spineless make the stand that Elaine does at the end of the movie? It's as if the filmmakers, like Ben, don't know how to behave themselves around a pretty girl.I would understand if this ruins the movie for some viewers. I personally can forgive the filmmakers because, even if they don't understand Elaine, they understand Ben perfectly and show a surprising level of (accidental?) insight into Mrs. Robinson. These strengths, along with a whole series of unforgettable visual moments, help me to appreciate the film's satire and philosophy.Director Mike Nichols has said that the last scene in the bus was more or less an accident. Bewilderen by Nichols' fierce directions, the actors gradually stopped laughing and started looking around blankly, not knowing what to do next. It was inspired for Nichols to decide to keep these reactions. By getting on that bus, Elaine and Ben made a thrilling getaway. But where are they going? They don't know. They're young and they still have a lot of things to figure out. Hence the stares. This ending alone earns this film ""classic"" status. At their age, neither Elaine nor Ben is ready to make any sort of lifelong commitment, let alone the carefully calculated marriage and career commitments that their parents expect them to make. And they sense something artificial, something ""plastic"", about their world that they find abhorrent. That's the rebellious thread that so many viewers have identified with while watching the movie. Mrs. Robinson's tragedy is the role she reluctantly plays in propping up the institutions that Elaine and Ben rebel against. Mrs. Robinson would stand to gain a lot from the very same freedom that Elaine and Ben seek, but do not know how to find.",The Graduate

As a result, it had a great impact on him. Although I was only in high school when I first saw it, I feel anyone going through a stage of transition can relate to this movie. The character of Benjamin is clueless, confused, but lovable. His innocence makes him endearing. And though it deals with mature themes, the movie will most likely have you laughing out loud. The film's visuals also made a great impression on me. It was one of the first times, along with Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, that I noticed how much cinematography can enhance a film.

598,PheebsBueller,"Seduced by the Allure of ""The Graduate""",8,3 December 2006,"This film, about an unsure college graduate who gets himself into a complex, beyond-repair situation, is a classic for a reason. It is introspective, unforgiving, and sincere. I admit the first time I saw it I thought it was just about the weirdest, nonsensical film I ever saw, but now, every time I'm in the mood to hear some mellowing Simon and Garfunkel music, it never disappoints. It's a great movie to put on when you feel like thinking and when you don't feel like thinking. The characters, despite their problems, are relatable and sympathetic. The direction is powerful, especially for the time. The soundtrack is perfect on so many levels. And, I have to admit as a sucker for happy endings, it has probably one of the greatest, most realistic last couple of shots in a movie. Dustin Hoffman plays Benjamin Braddock, a college graduate who comes home to his comfortable, lazy lifestyle after overachieving for four years. He feels pressure from his parents and their well-to-do friends, and at his overwhelming graduation party, he runs into Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson, a bored housewife, the wife of Ben's father's business partner. She gets him back to her house and tells him that if he ever wants to sleep with her, he should feel completely free to. Ben objects, but when his confusion about his future overruns his mangled good judgment, he takes up her offer and they continue to ""see"" each other for several months, a secret that they conceal quite perfectly. Things start to go sour when Mrs. Robinson's daughter (played by Katharine Ross) is thrown into the mix. Ben takes her on a purposely awful date to appease his parents, but then he discovers that in a time of vagueness and boredom, Elaine Robinson is the only person who really understands him. Once he falls in love, everything unravels. Everything about this movie is symbolic and cyclical (the beginning and end seem to be parallel, for instance, with the somehow appropriate S&G tune 'The Sound of Silence' playing hauntingly in both scenes, depicting how Ben is just as alone and confused in the end of the film as he was in the beginning). All of the actors are perfect in their roles, stirring sympathy at parts and disdain at others (Bancroft, for example, exudes such vulnerability during her a scene with Hoffman when he insists that they talk before they ""leap into bed together"" that one cannot help but feel for the seductive, married woman). The music ties it all together, so calming and even eerie that the songs come out like thoughts of the characters, which I believe is how they were intended to be presented. A final thought: as a teenager brought up on the movies of this day and age, I applaud Mike Nichols for this old breath of fresh air. Bravo.",The Graduate
599,tkasup1984,Lacanian look at The Graduate,9,30 January 2006,"The Graduate was an amazing film. The shots in the filmed seemed very modern, and the montages were amazing. This film also had a lot of symbolism along with the theme of youth rebellion. I also feel that this film can be linked to Lacan's theory of the symbolic order and the imaginary in a culture. Ben represents the imaginary trying to break into the symbolic order but is being held back. The soundtrack for this film was also amazing, and I feel that ""Sounds of Silence"" by Simon and Garfunkel was the perfect song for this film. This song's first line ""Hello darkness my old friend"" describes what Ben is going through perfectly. He is trapped and wants to break free from the darkness.Water is a huge symbol in this film. I feel that it symbolizes Ben feeling trapped by his family and his life in general. He doesn't want to become like his father and mother, but he feels that it is inevitable. This forces him to rebel throughout the film, and do exactly what people don't want him to. Water is found in many of the scenes in this film, and it always represents the same thing. When Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft) confronts Ben about not seeing her daughter anymore, it is raining out. Mrs. Robinson threatens to tell her daughter everything that has happened between the two of them. She is trapping him emotionally, but he is able to break free. Water also is present when Mr. Robinson (Hamilton) confronts Ben about sleeping with his wife. Ben is also being trapped here. Ben's parents also get him scuba gear for his birthday. This to me represented them not wanting him to escape, or break free. He is able to stay under the water now, and that's where they want him to be.This film can also be loosely connected with Lacan's theory of the symbolic order. This theory can be used for many films, and this film had many of the elements of this theory in it. First of all, Ben is in the imaginary and is trying to break into the symbolic order. He desperately wants to be accepted for what he is, but he can't be accepted. At the bar in the hotel, for instance, the waiter doesn't hear or see Ben when he wants to order a drink. This is because he is not in the literary world, and is stuck in the imaginary. Mrs. Robinson has no problem ordering a drink in the bar because she is in the symbolic order and can be heard. The only way that Ben is recognized in this film is when he calls himself Mr. Gladstone. He is pretending to be in the symbolic order, and is momentarily heard and recognized. Ben isn't heard throughout the film, and I feel that this is why he thinks that he falls in love with Elaine (Ross), because she is the first person that actually hears him. Elaine is also going through the same thing, and they are able to understand each other because they are both in the imaginary.I felt that this film was amazing. The shot framing in many scenes were great and the montages where very innovative. The story was also unbeatable. My favorite part of the film was when Ben and Elaine get on the bus to run away from everyone, and they both realize that they didn't actually love each other, and made a huge mistake. I thought that was a great ending to the film. My link to Lacanian theory may have been far fetched for this film, but I felt that it had many of the elements of this theory. All-in-all I felt that this film was flawless, and is one of my favorite films of that period in New American Cinema.",The Graduate

Now, after more than 35 years as a cinematographer and film teacher, I still marvel at Mike Nichols' and Robert Surtees' work every time I see the film. Almost everything you can do with a camera can be seen in this film, and everything is perfectly right for the story. The Graduate is groundbreaking in more areas than the photography.

A great deal of activity goes on with no words spoken, just the sound of Simon and Garfunkel. Dustin Hoffman is brilliant as always, playing Benjamin with quiet intensity. Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson is not very likeable throughout most of the film, but there are moments when we learn more about her (as when she and Benjamin talk about her marriage), and we understand better why she is who she is.

607,wrighj-18893,Finding your own way,9,1 August 2019,"Finding your own way:
The movie ""The Graduate"" is a movie about a college student finding his own way after graduate and understanding that every decision has a set of consequences that could either be good or bad. Dustin Hoffman plays Ben Braddock who has recently graduated and feeling pressures of life from father, friends and casual acquaintances. Anne Bancroft plays Mrs. Robinson, who is a sophisticated wife of Ben's father partner in business who has her eyes set on Ben. Katherine Ross plays Elaine Robinson, who is Mrs. Robinson's daughter and Ben's love interest. This was a great movie that has many funny parts but, also has serious parts that is meant to make people think about their decisions prior to taking action. It is a movie about the innocents of a young man named Ben whose is on the verge of having a panic attack from the pressures of what he will do after graduation. Mrs. Robinson is an ex-acholic with narcotic tendencies. Elaine Robinson is a college student who seems to have her life in order until a forced date by Ben's parents that Mrs. Robinson has made Ben promised not to date Elaine.
Mrs. Robinson asks Ben to drive her home from Ben graduate gathering held by his parents. Ben does not want to but, caves after the insistence of Mrs. Robinson. This is the first decision Ben makes that has consequences that Ben never considered. This part of the movie reminds me of ""Indecent Proposal"", it all refers to the consequences of one's decision.
In ""The Graduate"", the angels used when Ben is in Mrs. Robinson house after driving her home, showing Mrs. Robinson sitting high and Ben sitting low, showing that Mrs. Robinson in the position of power and Ben in the position of vulnerability. The lighting (lack of light) in the first hotel scene shows the shyness and innocent of Ben.
This movie shows the consequences of every decision that a graduate makes in deciding what their next step will be. It also shows that each decision leads to another(alternate) decision that will be made. With this kind of understanding, I believe the movie was trying to enlighten the graduate to really consider their decision before acting upon it.
I believe unless you are really looking to understand this movie, you will think that it is just about the innocent of a young man and the freedom of a women's sexuality in the sixties.",The Graduate

This movie goes definitely into my top ten. It was full of symbols to. Take for instance the aquarium, or the fact that Ben started smoking after Mrs Robinson hit on him. Another great scene was at the Zoo near the monkey's cage, after Elaine left and in the corner appeared the sign: ""Do not tease"". I thought this was fantastic. Katherine Ross was great to.

All its about is a guys life right out of college who is just hanging around and ends up falling in love and goes to the extreme toget back that love against all adversity. There is nothing much better than this which is why this movie will always be a classic. In a way its like shakespere, it is dealing w/ human emotions, back stabbing, love and all that good stuff that is timeless. sure there are alot of instances to the time it was made, such as the famous plastics scene but in 50 years this movie will still be great to its auidience where as other classics such as Godfather may not. Another aspect that also makes this piece timeless is its use of someone doing something we all wish we would do but never would. In other words, a man laying it all on the line for something he believes is right. Deep inside us all we always want to do that, but rarely we do. Those who have seen it know what i am talking about, those who havent go see it then you will understand. Finally, this movie is so well directed and acted it has the ability to transcend time barriers. I am a 16 year old and when i first say Elain she looked hot, that can not be said for many actresses in that time period, but her look and dress could still be perfectly acceptable in todays world. Dustin Hoffman is incredible, hes the classic underdog kid, like Rudy, except the game is replaced with his life and he beautifully portrays it. He plays the perfect alienated youth. The directing is awesome, the camera angles, the scenes in the hotel room where it switches from the house to the room are so well done and so thought provoking. When you get right down to it, this is just a great movie, even to a cynical 16 year old. I loved it, i know in 50 years kids my age will love it. GO SEE IT IF YOU HAVENT ALREADY!",The Graduate
614,juliegoldberg-18948,Good movie with one stupid scene,8,25 December 2020,"I was 16 years old when the movie was released.
I thought it was a great movie and I still do, but I view it with a different perspective. There was one stupid scene in it.
Mrs. Robinson told Benjamin almost violently that he was not to date her daughter.
In spite of this he shows up at her house to take her daughter out on a date.
Now here is the stupid part:
Benjamin tells Mrs. Robinson that he's taking her out because his parents told him that he would have to host a party if he didn't. HOW INCREDIBLY STUPID.
AND
Do you remember what Mrs. Robinson was doing in that scene?
She was watching TV. Do you remember what she was watching?
Johnny Carson on the Tonight Show.
That TV show was aired at 11:30pm around most of the country.
WHO PICKS UP THEIR DATE AT THAT HOUR ESPECIALLY ON A FIRST DATE?",The Graduate
615,steffic-97866,Classic film of Hollywood Cinema,10,6 February 2021,"This is a classic 1960s movie and rumoured to be about a true story! This is a film adaption of the book ""The Graduate"" written by Charles Webb (great book!) The majority of the film is strikingly similar to the book featuring world class actors, Anne Bancroft & Dustin Hoffman who made his film debute. Probably a classic film that not many of today's generation will appreciate but the movie at the time signalled a shift in Hollywood's transition from making high budget films to low budget films featuring new coming actors like Dustin Hoffman that were targeting a younger audience. Great plot that was quite risqué to show for that time in 1960s America. I really loved the way Mike Nichols directed the film. His style of directing is very reminiscent of the 60s era and Nichols really captures Benjamin Braddock's (main character) struggle in finding out what he wants to do with his life. Even if new movie watchers don't totally like it, I still believe it is a must see film of what classic cinema once was.",The Graduate
616,fundraiser1000,this was an awful movie,1,23 October 2007,"this was one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. with little character development other than Benjamin. you never get to know any of the other characters and see the whole movie though his eyes and ill i see him as is a spoiled brat. the movie had bad cinematography and almost no set. there was little attention to detail and the only redeeming thing about the movie is that it is pretty easy to write a paper on. this movie was horrible and very little happened throughout the entire movie. with little action, a hard to find climax and no character development this movie has made a genre of its own a bad one. i have nothing more to say about this movie because there is little to talk about other than what happened through out the movie and i don't have the patience to type that many numerous problems throughout the film even if anyone would have the patience to read them all. this movie sucked.",The Graduate
617,andre_meulen,The difference in time.,8,25 January 2008,"The graduate gives you a story with a taboo and tries to break it on a certain way with a charming main character. Nowadays, the taboo isn't such a big problem anymore, though it does feel a little strange. But would this movie still be interesting now time has changed? Something that really makes its mark in this movie is the sound. Almost all the songs are performed by Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel, which were quite popular after the song from this movie, called 'Mrs Robinson'. Probably a wise choice to use their music in this movie since its quite similar to the Beatles, a band who were quite popular in the sixties. Nowadays this music probably gives you a classic nostalgic feel.Another difference between this movie and more recent movies, are the camera shorts. The camera shots are much longer than the ones of the modern days. At the beginning of the movie this certainly feels a bit weird, sometimes even a little annoying. But it sure does create more suspense, since you are wondering what still could happen in the shot.Furthermore, this movie probably was groundbreaking during the year of release. In the sixties things were, especially, in the beginning all quite structured, and with the rebellic youth that came on its way, this movie probably still came as a shock. It could be seen as a way for the director to explore the boundaries and push it a little further. This is what we can see in the plot as well.Considered all points, I come to the conclusion that his movie is still a good one to watch. But keep in mind that it has lost all its impact, which the movie used to have.",The Graduate

The problem I had with this rank is that the film was not comical. It had it's moments for a chuckle, and that I credit to Dustin Hoffman's performance.  I actually would never think to classify the film as a comedy...it evokes more drama.  If you want to watch a masterfully directed and edited film, this is one you shouldn't pass up.  Just don't anticipate to roll off your seat in a fit of laughter because you'll surely be disappointed.",The Graduate

The starting of the movie is fine, seems funny, a 'mamas boy' stuck to doing what his parents want. His only escape to become a real 'man' and independent is by having an affair with Mrs.Robinson. That part is also fine, and funny too. But when Elaine gets into the picture, things move without any sense or plan in mind. One scene Elaine is mad with Ben(and this is the first time we see her), then next she wants him to kiss her, then they want to get married..suddenly Mrs.Robinson his calling the cops on Ben ( mainly because she had asked him to stay away from Elaine and he did not, now why he was asked to stay away is questionable )...full of unanswered questions and no solid plot....

620,Sone05,Oh that soundtrack,10,29 November 2015,"The soundtrack totally got me. It seemed to me that songs were in fact written for this movie. They fit so perfectly in the beginning. The lack of purpose in life. Combined with lack of communication. Brings the build up of ""love"" in Dustin's character. But that is only bringing up false and rather fake pursuit. The pursuit of woman he thinks he loves. When in fact it is just a goal. Goal that he needs to reach in order to eliminate boringness from his life. Which is so obvious in the ending scene. Great ending but this movie was made great by the accompanying music.",The Graduate
621,averybutters,A Masterpiece of film and music.,10,30 December 2009,"With The Graduate, Mike Nichols created a sharp, engaging portrait of bourgeoisie life and the struggle for agency endemic to youth. Simon and Garfunkel's soundtrack proved a vital aspect of the film's strategy, both reflecting and imbuing meaning throughout. The opening sequence, for example, has our protagonist arriving at LAX to the strains of ""The Sound of Silence"", a haunting meditation on spiritual introspection. We may note how the words occasion Braddock being moved along a tram as an intercom dictates the various travelers' permutations through the airport. The juxtaposition creates an internal life for the character, one of deep confusion and introspection, as the forces around him (the tram, the intercom) reflect his lack of agency. He is, figuratively and literally, a young man being moved involuntarily towards a predetermined destination. This metaphor is underscored throughout; note Mrs. Robinson's ruse to lure young Benjamin into her home: ""I don't like entering a dark house alone"", or when young Braddock is asked if he wishes to make love ""in the dark"". It's here that the song appears for the second time as Braddock turns out the lights before consummating the affair. One can't help but notice that the reappearance of the melody is reflected literally here (note how the words ""left its seeds while I was sleeping"" correspond with young Benjamin laying asleep upon a pool raft), an exclamation that imbues the songs presence with new meaning. The effect is to suggest that the protagonist has undergone change. In the scenes that follow, he slowly morphs into a more sexually reassured and aggressive young man. This overall strategy compels the viewer to be more acutely aware of the film's use of song. We note how ""April Comes She Will"" plays over a montage indicating the elapse of a number of months, how the cacophony of a nearby car radio forces Ben and Elaine to close their convertible, compositionally suggesting a deeper level of intimacy, how ""Scarborough Fair"" accompanies Benjamin's sojourn to Berkeley, and how the tempo of ""Mrs. Robinson"" is married to the action of Benjamin driving, then running to thwart Elaine's marriage (the guitar strum that follows a beat after Benjamin slams his hand down on a work table is an especially powerful touch). Finally, we arrive at the denouement where Benjamin and Elaine flee their bourgeoisie lives on a decidedly proletariat bus, and sit contemplatively as the ""sound of silence"" returns. Here, the song makes clear the circuitous route young Braddock has taken; he enters unsure of a potentially hollow future, and leaves the same. However, as the film fades he and Elaine have wrested a moment of brilliant, audacious self control from a world that had very specific plans for them. They leave different, but the same.",The Graduate

The film starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft is an incredibly made film. This film is Dustin Hoffman landed his first major role in this film where he plays the part of Benjamin Braddock. Benjamin is a new college graduate that returns home from college and has a love affair with the wife of a family friend Mrs. Robinson played by Anne Bancroft. Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson have a summer affair when at the request of his parents he goes on a date with Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine Robinson played by Katherine Ross, and soon falls in love with her putting Benjamin in the middle of a love triangle. This film is a comedy, drama, romance that's theme is a combination of love, sex, relationships, deception, and insecurity.The movie starts out with Benjamin Braddock recently graduates from college and returns home. His parents have a party at their house in his honor. When the party is about over Mrs. Robinson asks Benjamin to give her a ride home. Once they are at her house she invites him in for a drink. Before the evening is over Mrs. Robinson propositions him, she is straight forward about what she wants from him she wants to have a love affair. Benjamin is very nervous and is soon able to leave the house, but Mrs. Robinson's proposal of a love affair has him thinking about it. It doesn't take him long before he calls her and takes her up on the affair. Mrs. Robinson is quite forward about wanting to seduce him. Benjamin is a young inexperienced man trying to find his way in the world. Since he is young and inexperienced with sex he has some insecurities about himself and his life. At first for Benjamin he was flattered by Mrs. Robinson's seduction, but soon becomes ashamed of what he was doing. When they got together there was no talking they just jumped in bed to have sex. Benjamin wanted more than sex he wanted a relationship to go along with the sex. Although not talking bothered Benjamin it didn't bother Mrs. Robinson. Mrs. Robinson is clearly comfortable with just having sex with Benjamin and is all right with the deception in what she is doing.The secret love affair between Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson goes on all summer when Benjamin's father Mr. Braddock, played by William Daniels, encourages Benjamin to go on a date with Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine. On their date Benjamin is sure he doesn't like Elaine and at first tries to make the date miserable for her. After he succeeds at making the date a mess he feels bad when she starts crying. Something feels bad about the way he behaves and apologies to her and then they start the date over again. They end up having a great time and begin to like each other. Benjamin soon falls in love with Elaine and wants to marry her. He is determined to put his affair with her mother behind him and marry Elaine. When Elaine finds out about the affair, at first she wants nothing to do with him. Benjamin doesn't give up on her wanting to be with him. He starts following her around starting with going to the college she attends. Elaine resists him for a while even after Benjamin asks her to marry him. Elaine eventually gives into her own feelings when Benjamin comes to get her on her wedding day, she is about to marry someone else. Benjamin and Elaine run away together just before she is to be married to someone else.The movie ""The Graduate"" directed Mike Nichols has won an Oscar, 19 other awards, and was nominated for 13 other awards. I can certainly see why this film won the awards and is considered a classic today. I'm not sure it is the story that makes this film so great or the editing of the film. The filming, editing, and the music all contribute greatly to the effects of the film. This film is wonderfully edited, the scenes flow smoothly from one scene to another. This film is full of great scenes. The film draws you in from the beginning and keeps your interest to the end of the movie. There are many wonderful scenes in this movie. One of my favorite scenes is when Benjamin walks out of his house, he is thinking about Mrs. Robinson, he dives into his pool and comes out of the water to slide up onto his raft. The scene shows him coming out of the water and starts sliding up on the raft and the next scene he is on top Mrs. Robinson. The next scene he is back on his raft and his father is talking to him. This is a great scene that shows illusions of what he is thinking or dreaming about. All the shots are put together to where the transitions of one shot to another flow together. The music in this film is very fitting to the movie's theme. Simon & Garfunkel's song ""The Sounds of Silence"" is a perfect song for this film. This song goes along with the mood of the characters in the film. The other of Simon and Garfunkel's songs ""Here's to you Mrs. Robinson"" is another song that goes along with the movie.I think Mike Nichols 1967 film ""The Graduate"" is a true classic and one that will be watched for generations to come. In the movie the filming, music, and acting all worked wonderfully together to make this film a huge success. This film is more than a good movie especially when you look at the time era in which it was made. This film being made in 1967 when the technology is not what it is today, there is no doubt about it this film is a work of art.",The Graduate
623,suzbowbooks,Overall a good but unexpected plot,7,17 September 2010,"The theme of this movie is coming-of-age, making mistakes, paying for the mistake, and ultimately doing what you want in the end. The main plot of this story is the coming of age of a recent college graduate that you would have expected to have already had the happen in his life earlier, but you find that Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) is shy, backward, and naive. The major character in the film is Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) who seduces Ben who is initially mortified and confused but after literally months of ""meeting"" with her actually wishes to have intellectual conversations with her that backfire. Eventually, his father convinces him to take Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross) out on a date which for him is humiliating because he's sleeping with her mother and dating her was forbidden by Mrs. Robinson.After the first date however, Ben realizes he really likes Elaine and wants to continue dating her. However, as soon as Elaine finds out about Ben and her mother she breaks off the relationship and returns to college. After a short amount of time Ben follows her up to Berkeley and begins pursuing her. If you don't like ""stalker"" kind of films, you may not like this movie, even though it's not a violent stalking, it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Eventually things all work out but the end of the movie truly is priceless. Elaine and Ben are happy and smiling but after a few seconds they both look forward and it's almost as if it dawns on them what they have done.I have heard about this movie forever, and I really was surprised even disappointed at the plot but I did really enjoy the acting. Anne Bancroft is incredible and Dustin Hoffman is great as a quirky young man. The soundtrack is dated and the use and reuse of the same song over and over (Simon and Garfunkel soundtracks) did drag but if you like movies that are funny, dramatic, romantic, and crazy all the way through with editing and camera work then you'll enjoy it. The editing is used to give vision to the confusion and absolute panic Ben feels when Mrs. Robinson first seduces him after all we all know ""Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?""If you like May-December ""romances"", with older-woman, younger man plots this will be an attraction to you as well but it is sometimes distasteful and in fact very forward for the time. There really hasn't been another movie to compare it to except maybe Goodbye Again or In the Bedroom but neither offer the complication of the mother-daughter-man (except maybe Rated X films which are plot less).",The Graduate

Soon after, Ben finds himself being seduced by Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), the wife of his fathers' business partner. Ben's guilt-ridden affair with Mrs. Robinson goes on for months before she forbids Ben dating her daughter, Elaine. I believe the theme of this film is about fighting for what you really want. Ben wants to be with Elaine and he is not going to let Mrs. Robinson's acts stop him. Although he had made a questionable decision by having an ongoing affair with not only a married woman, but also the mother of his love interest, he knew Elaine was someone he wanted in his life.

625,seger01,Film Appreciation,8,28 October 2010,"I think everyone young and old has heard of Mrs. Robinson and for some reason or another associate the name with lascivious romance. Well the film The Graduate is where Mr. Robinson was immortally derived. In the transition from the 60's to the 70's, her character fits right in with many a young man's desires.Dustin Hoffman plays a college graduate named Benjamin Braddock. Benjamin is very concerned with his future. He is anxious and doesn't really know what to expect or what is expected of him. At his college graduation party a long time family friend, Mrs. Robinson, played by Anne Bancroft, approaches Ben for a ride home. He agrees reluctantly. When they get to Mrs. Robinson's home her husband is not there. She tries to seduce Ben, but he runs away scared.After a few days he nervously calls her and sets up a secret meeting at the Taft Hotel. After working through is fears and nervousness, he proceeds with sleeping with her. It then turns into a several month affair. The conflict arises when Ben falls for Elaine, Mrs. Robinson's daughter, who is played by Katherine Ross.The major theme of this movie is a moral or philosophical riddle. There are smaller themes can be picked up on like social changes of the 60's or coming of age, but those themes are hard to relate to in this film in this day.One motif throughout the movie is that everyone is asking Ben what he is going to do. Mrs. Robinson is the only character that is assertive and actually tells Ben what to do. Also, there are superb transitions of Ben climbing onto a pool float and then the film instantly cuts to Ben climbing onto Mrs. Robinson.The camera angle is used extensively to follow the emotion or the film. In the beginning the camera gives you a sense of anxiousness as it follows Ben throughout the party. There is also a scene where the camera is stuck in a wetsuit with Ben as he dives in the pool.This film has influenced many films since 1967. If you were born in the eighties, you've probably seen Wayne's World 2. If you were ever wondering where the heck they came up with the ending for that movie where Wayne intercedes on Cassandra's wedding, Wayne stole it from Benjamin Braddock.",The Graduate

Dustin Hoffman's character, Benjamin, is WHOLLY unrealistic.  How could he have fallen in love with Elaine after ONE STINKING DATE?

Believably, Elaine doesn't want to see him anymore.  And then, let the stalking begin..  he moves to Berkley to get Elaine to marry him?  This would be acceptable and even interesting if the movie then detailed his legal troubles and psychological issues surrounding his incarceration for harrassment, but no, the UNBELIEVEABLE happens.

When Benjamin realizes he is in love with Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, he has a sense of loneliness. Because Benjamin has to decide whether or not he should tell Elaine about the affair he had with her mother. The Graduate uses dim lighting during the scenes when Benjamin is alone. The lighting also because dim during Mrs. Robinson seduction to Benjamin. The music for the film was mostly done by Simon and Garfunkel. ""Mrs. Robinson"" is a pretty well known song by Simon and Garfunkel. The music used throughout the film expresses the characters and their actions. The Graduate has many themes and deeper meanings. But it also provides us with comedic relief. During many scenes of loneliness a comedic comment or action will take place as well. The Graduate uses comedic events when Benjamin realizes he is in love and what one would do for love.

Not only is it a great love story, it is an icon of American Culture.  The story is quite long and gripping with a very good climatic ending.  It demonstrates themes of adultery, over-protectiveness, temptation, and doing the right thing.  The soundtrack is wonderful.  Simon & Garfunkel did the entire soundtrack for the movie which is truly splendid (In case you didnt know, if you've seen the recent teen movie ""Old School"" the part where one of the frat guys falls into the pool and they play ""The sound of silence"" is a spoof on ""The Graduate""Well anyway, this a true masterpiece, a definite must-see.9/10",The Graduate

630,warner22,"Plot, Theme, and Techniques",8,5 February 2011,"The Plot: ""Ben"" played by Dustin Hoffman begins an affair with an older woman ""Mrs. Robinson"" played by Anne Bancroft. Through this affair, Ben begins to grow in his personal life after college by finding himself. The compromising situations occur throughout the film and Ben becomes emotionally restrained.The Theme: The theme is the coming of age after college life. The affair between Ben and Mrs. Robinson is the plot, but the emotions and growing direction of Ben's life is the theme. The soundtrack, by Simon & Garfunkel adds to Ben's emotional state and expectations from his parents.The plot is further compromised when Mr. Robinson continually tries to set Ben up with Elaine, their daughter. Elaine is an insightful character that falls for Ben until the affair with her mother is discovered. This plot ties into the theme by further confusing Ben's emotional state. Another film with relevance to The Graduate is Footloose. Although, the relationship is not between an older woman but a preacher's daughter. Footloose follows forbidden love between two characters in a small town. A full-length soundtrack, similar to the one used in The Graduate, helps to develop the characters and emotions. One technique used in The Graduate is color. This film would not be as effective if filmed in black and white. During a scene in which Ben's father has developed a scuba diving suit, Ben must plunge into a pool to show how the suit operates. The audience sees Ben in a black suit and mask with an air tank, submerging into a brilliant blue pool. Once in the water, Ben must acquaint himself with remaining underwater for a period of time. The camera zooms out and the audience is able to see the whole pool with Ben standing on the bottom. If filmed in black and white, this scene would not have been as emotionally powerful.Another technique used throughout the film is sound. Provided by Paul Simon via Simon & Garfunkel, the music adds to Ben's turmoil of entering adulthood. Many scenes are enhanced emotionally by the music. Lighting is effective in bedroom scenes by being completely black. Ben prefers not to have the lights on because he is awkward and nervous. Each technique is evaluated to make The Graduate one of the greatest films of all time. Recently, it has come to my attention that several acquaintances have experienced similar situations to that of Ben's and Mrs. Robinson. While seeming taboo during the time the film, late 1960's early 1970's, The Graduate explored different perceptions of the coming of age era.",The Graduate

That's exactly what happens to Dustin Hoffman's character, Benjamin Braddock, in the film The Graduate. Directed by Mike Nichols, this film puts a whole new twist on friends with benefits. This film may have been shot in the late 60s but it has the drama and scandal ism that excites the youth of any day and age. Benjamin Braddock just graduated from college and has no idea what to do with his life. His family and his family's friends are very wealthy and upstanding citizens. This in turn creates even more stress for Benjamin to be as equally successful. This is a big connection to everyone who has been at a crossroad at least once in his or her life. But then he then gets the opportunity of a lifetime after driving his father's business partner's wife, Mrs. Robinson, home one late night. He has an affair with this woman; what is meant to be a one-night stand turns into a complete summer romance. Benjamin is now living the life. He's just graduated, has no job, lounges in his parent's pool for hours on end, and has a woman at his beck and call. The best part about this arrangement is that nobody knows. Nichol's directional genius throws in a twist for the entire audience when Ben realizes the chance of a lifetime isn't scoring with Mrs. Robinson but getting together with her daughter Elaine. Now Benjamin's confused out of his mind and the audience is getting pulled deeper in the drama of this film through Benjamin's anguish and confusion. What's Ben going to do now? He can continue the affair with Mrs. Robinson or create a new relationship with Elaine. Of course if he chooses Elaine, he has to tell her about his and her mother's secret hook-ups. Without surprise that's exactly what he does and what's expected of Elaine besides to slap him across the face. By this time, we as the audience are wondering how this film could get any better. This is just an entire soap opera season channeled into a two-hour film. Benjamin can't give up on his love for Elaine that easy. He must prove to her that he is worthy to have her hand in marriage, despite what he did and the lies Mrs. Robinson told to escape the talk of her affair. Only more surprise and heartache comes to Benjamin when he finds Elaine is already engaged to another man. He follows Elaine to college in hopes to win her back. He follows her around campus and gets an apartment in her same city, and stalks her for quite a while. The suspense just keeps building. Though with everything Benjamin does, Elaine still can't forgive his transgressions. It all comes down to Elaine's wedding day with an exciting act by Elaine. The happy but somewhat confusing ending falls into place and Elaine and Benjamin can live happily ever after. This film drives an audience crazy. Mike Nichols sure brings down the house with everything you'll ever need in a movie: sex, lies, excitement, love and a romantic ending.",The Graduate

The repetition of the same three Simon & Garfunkel songs over and over became annoying very quickly.   Although I understand the symbolism behind many of  the scenes  and techniques  (i.e., the scuba diving, the disjointed perception of sounds and voices, etc.), they seemed unrealistic. Also, I found myself not sympathetic of, but rather irritated by the character of Benjamin. He seemed less like a fool in love, and more like a creepy stalker, and I started to wish that he would leave Elaine alone, for his sake and hers. Maybe it's just me, but I really don't see this film as brilliant, or representative of confused, disaffected youth.   Perhaps I'm from the wrong era.

Though Ben starts with good intentions and declines Mrs. Robinsons advances he soon finds himself very alone and reaches out to her for companionship. Ben soon becomes fixated on nothing but his artificial relationship with Mrs. Robinson and loses focus on everything else that he once thought was important. After Ben realizes that his relationship is no more than an affair and it is not fulfilling his needs for companionship he turns his attention to Elaine Robinson, portrayed by Katharine Ross, the daughter of his adulteress. As Ben continues to pursue Elaine the new of the affair emerges driving them apart. Despite Elaine's lack of interests for Ben he continues to pursue her with an unhealthy obsession including a valiant attempt to stop Elaine from getting married. Even though when Ben arrives at the church the ceremony has already taken place Elaine ignores convention and runs away with them both sitting in the back of a bus in the last scene of the movie.The theme throughout the film focuses on ones need for companionship and encompasses how we can create artificial relationships in an attempt to make up for a lack of substantial ones. Ben has a very abrupt realization of this when Mrs. Robinson refuses to have a conversation with him during one of their evenings at the hotel, as Ben push's the issue he indicates that he has interest in Elaine which provokes Mrs. Robinson to reveal that she does not believe he is good enough for her daughter. At this point Ben realizes that he has no attachment to Mrs. Robinson and that he is utterly alone. In that specific scene I though the use of lighting was very important, Mrs. Robinson desire to turn off the room lights leaving only the lighting from the windows have a true sense of distance between the two characters as Ben was pushing for an emotional connection and Mrs. Robinsons only desire was to disenfranchise herself from him in all but a physical manner. While Ben's numerous attempts to illuminate the room gave the viewer the sense that he had considered his affair to be an attempt at companionship even though it was in bad faith. I think that this is a universal truth that is portrayed in many films, American Beauty did a great job at this as well with the relationship between Lester Burnham, Kevin Spacey, and his daughters friend Angela Hayes, Mena Suvari.The use of ""Sound of Silence"", by Simon and Garfunkel as a motif throughout the film was able to further drive home Bens loneliness, as it was used each time he had realized that what he had been striving for was a fabrication and that he continued to be nothing but himself. It was able to truly portray his feelings and give the viewer the sense that everything in his world had been a fabrication. In the end, as the bus drove away we saw the excitement fade from Ben and Elaine's face and we were left with their disembodied feeling of regret. As they each realized that now that they were together they had no real substance to their relationship.",The Graduate
634,jessemkennedy,Quick Overall Summary,7,29 May 2012,"I quite enjoyed this movie. I think a lot of young adults and teenagers can relate to the main character and lot of the themes employed by in movie. I would overall rate it a 7 out of 10. It is definitely worth making some time to watch. It is still applicable to a lot of viewers even in this generation.Positives : The movie's main theme focuses a lot on uncertainty and worry about one's future. This is problem that every person has gone through, especially high school and college aged young adults. Not knowing what to do with your life and not being motivated are huge problems for people, especially those is the previously mentioned age bracket. The movie is fairly tame when it comes to sex, violence, and profanity, and yet it still is very relate-able to even modern young adults and teenagers because of this central theme. I also think it was very comical movie. Ben, played by Dustin Hoffman, was unbearably awkward and embarrassed. It's very funny watching him deal with all the situations he is put in. Another thing I like about the movie is the ending. I enjoy how vague it was. You don't know how the couple will end up. It could be a happy ending because they finally get together, or it could be a completely different type of ending, with the characters throwing their lives away for a quick feeling they had.Negative : Falling in love after one date with Elaine, and then stalking her was very creepy and unbelievable. I don't think anyone could really empathize with that situation. That part was very difficult to look past and accept. Another problem was (while I love Simon & Garfunkel) I think they overused a lot of the songs in the movie. At first, I thought ""The Sound Of Silence"" was utilized very well to compliment the scene in the movie. Towards the end of the movie that song, and a lot of other Simon & Garfunkel songs, had gotten to just be repetitive and not really adding anything to the movie.This all just my opinion. Let me know if you agree or disagree. I am currently in a film studies course at Sinclair Community College in Dayton, Ohio.JMK",The Graduate
635,pettit09,Older but good film,8,16 September 2012,"The graduate is a good comedy. This film was produced in 1967 by Mike Nichols and had a fabulous soundtrack. The music played is perfect for this film and it is played at just the right moments. This movie stars a very young Dustin Hoffman as Ben Braddock. Ben is the main character in this film. The movie's theme is about Ben's search for what he wants to do with his life. He is just out of college and he is lost. He has no idea what he wants to do with his life. His parents are so proud of him and they do so many things for him but, he has no interest in anything. His parents are played by William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson. Ben is rather bored with his life when the opportunity to have an affair with a family friend comes along. He is rather seduced by the friend whom is an older lady named Mrs. Robinson. Mrs. Robinson is played by Anne Bancroft. He ends up going out on a date with Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, who is played by Katherine Ross. Ben quickly falls for Elaine and his has nothing but trouble from there. Elaine's father, Mr. Robinson, played by Murray Hamilton wants to strangle him and takes his daughter away to get married to someone else. When Ben first gets home, there is a party there waiting on him. The panning of the camera makes it seem as though everyone is in Ben's face and coming at him at once. It also shows that he has no interest in anything anybody has to say. There were many motifs that contributed to this film's theme. At times, it was hilarious and other times it made you feel just how the characters were feeling. There is one scene when Ben's parents make him put on a Scuba Diving outfit and go into the pool. He does not want to but he is forced to by his parents. The camera in the water and the way it was shown was terrific. It made you feel as though you were in the water and feeling the same feelings that Ben was suffering from. One thing that I thought was strange about this film was the cover of the video box. It shows Mrs. Robinson putting her hose on with Ben in the background. The cover of this film reminds me of a different type of comedy. The type of comedy about teens partying and getting into trouble. It reminded me of the movie ""The Bachelor Party"" starring Tom Hanks and the Porky series. The Bachelor Party was a great film but, it is nothing like The Graduate. The cover really does not do the movie justice. This film was very well produced. The producer did a great job showing the theme. This was shown many times in the beginning of the film. The way Ben is laying around the house and in the pool makes it very clear. Many of his expressions also show this.",The Graduate

637,Steelederbeast,A Cinematic Watershed,10,20 September 2015,"1967: arguably one of the greatest year for movie-goers across the globe enjoying classics such as Cool Hand Luke, Bonnie & Clyde and the Jungle Book. But audiences flocking to see Mike Nichol's 'The Graduate' in such huge numbers that it remains the highest grossing film of '67. But why did this modest drama starring unknown an new- comer - Dustin Hoffman - captivate society? The Graduate epitomises the sexual revolution in the most elegant yet audacious manner. The film oozes symbolism from the fantastic screenplay to the striking direction. Not only do all three leads - Hoffman, Bancroft and Ross - deliver tremendous performances, but they embody this new generation of post-war America: seeking sexual liberation to fill a void left by the disintegration of familial bonds in the wake of a resort to materialism.Needless to say, this movie evokes a broad array of reactions within the viewer - only emboldened by the incredibly iconic and poignantly ambiguous finale. You'll by no doubt have heard the soundtrack, which is brilliant in it's own right whilst cementing 'The Graduate' as (in my humble opinion) a perfect film.",The Graduate
638,srife001-671-246740,Generation Gap,8,30 April 2013,"The film The Graduate is about a young man who has recently graduated college and returns home to find himself stuck between figuring out what he wants to do with his life, and what his parents expect him to do. The film stars Dustin Hoffman as Ben, the recent graduate, Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson, the seductive family friend that starts Ben's rebellion, and Katharine Ross as Elaine Robinson, Mrs. Robison's daughter who Ben ends up falling in love with. This film shows a young man's confusion, desire for isolation, and struggle against his parents and society's demands. The opening two scenes in this film set the mood for the theme with the camera angles and musical score. Simon and Garfunkel's 'sound of silence"" is playing as Ben is coming home on the plane and his trip through the airport. Even though there is much going on around him, the focus is on his expressionless face and the score can be heard along side the pilot announcing the landing and the chatter at the terminal; sounds of silence.Ben's desire for isolation continues into the next scene where his parents have thrown a graduation party for him; incidentally it doesn't seem to have any of his friends, just his parent's friends in attendance. The camera is focused close up on Ben as he bounces around the room like a pinball trying to escape the crowd and be alone. You can hear other people calling out for him, but the camera stays sharp on Ben. It is Mrs. Robinson that is finally able to hold his attention when she asks for a ride home, and eventually takes advantage of his self – confusion and manipulates him into an affair. I imagine this film identified well with the generation when this film was made. The 60's were a time of free love and rebellion against the rules and the establishment. This film adds fuel to that fire with Ben's parents, who care more about his accomplishments making them look better to their friends, and Mrs. Robinson who takes advantage of Ben so she can perhaps recapture a lost youth. Both of them are trying to control and own Ben. The rest of the film is Ben trying to break free of His parents and Mrs. Robinson's control and do what he wants to do, and be with whom he wants to be with.",The Graduate

Ben confides in Elaine that her mother is the one he is having an affair with. To no surprise Elaine throws Ben out. When Ben is leaving Mrs. Robinson is standing soak and wet against a white wall in the corner looking defeated and scared. The angle of the camera makes it seems as if she is innocent. When Elaine went back to Berkley, Ben decided after much thought that he was going to marry her. He drove to Berkley and sat in the common ground of the school. In this particular section of the movie motif was used. Ben repeated the same action for days of going to school, watching Elaine and going home. Finally after confronting her on the busy he repeatedly asks her to marry him until he purchased ring. The same a day Mr. Robinson was sitting in Ben room waiting for him, little did Ben realize that Elaine was rushed off in the middle of the night to marry Carl Smith. This movie seemed to have a unified plot, with its continuous strands of event that all relate. The movie starts with infidelity, then moves into deceit, and end with love of course. Love conquers all. The acting was definitely something I am not used to seeing, seemed bland and dis interesting, but that contributed to the character.",The Graduate
640,johnkangas,The Graduate is a classic film and a very interesting movie. It is a great example of how sound and editing enhance a film.,9,4 May 2013,"The Graduate is a story about a young man trying to figure out what to do with his life after college. It is a common theme even today, a young man or woman tries to find his or her way and ends up getting taken advantage of and manipulated.Benjamin Braddock, played by Dustin Hoffman, just returns home after graduating college. Benjamin's parents are proud of him and begin his homecoming by parading him before all their closest friends. Benjamin is pursued and ends up in an adulterous affair with Mrs. Robinson, played by Anne Bancroft. Katherine Ross plays Elaine Robinson, the engaged daughter of Mrs. Robinson and Benjamin's childhood friend, returns home from college and throws a monkey wrench in Mrs. Robinson's affair. Elaine discovers the affair and wants nothing to do with Benjamin. Benjamin continues to pursue Elaine until Elaine leaves her own wedding and runs off with Benjamin.The film portrays Benjamin as naïve, impressionable, lonely and lost. Benjamin wants to take some time off but everyone wants to know what he will do next. Mrs. Robinson is there to lend a helping hand or in this case her whole helping body. She manipulates him into having an affair with her and soon everything goes wrong for Benjamin. This movie can draw parallels from Risky Business. In Risky Business Tom Cruise plays Joel Goodson, a teen who is unsure about life, is left alone by his parents and soon ends up way over his head in trouble.The film uses many songs to tell the inner story of how lost Benjamin was. The Simon and Garfunkel song, The Sound of Silence, is used in a scene in the hotel room when Mrs. Robinson and Benjamin are first alone. The film jump cuts to complete darkness and the only noise playing is the song. This song expresses Benjamin's inner story of being lost and unsure if he is doing the right thing.The film makes great us of visible sounds. Benjamin and Elaine are leaving on a date in Benjamin's new red convertible. Benjamin was racing the car down the street. The sounds of a car racing and shifting really enhances the scene. Elaine's hair blowing in the wind also contributed to feeling of reckless speed.Several times in the film, Benjamin was under water. Once in a scuba suit and other times just with a mask. These scenes have all the dead space filled with water and Benjamin standing up on the bottom of the swimming pool. These scenes are nice examples of slow motion techniques used to intensify the loneliness that Benjamin felt. Slow motion editing was also used to intensify the nervousness Benjamin felt when he was walking from the hotel bar to the hotel registration desk to secure a hotel room.The Graduate is a great film. It is full of examples of how sound and editing enhance a film.",The Graduate

I guess these young studs want to pursue the same brand of beauty in youth as they experienced and liked in the older version of the choice of brand. So, to answer the question of, ""Is this story realistic?"" Again, yes in some circles, no in others. Such is life. I think it's very realistic. And depends on what season in life you are in as to whether you enjoy it or are shocked by it.The unreal aspect of the movie, in my eyes, is that the daughter would fall in love with Benjamin after he was with her mother. In real life, the daughter is usually disgusted by the mother's actions and wants nothing to do with these tainted men.",The Graduate

Just two years later he would star in Midnight Cowboy, which is as different from The Graduate as you can get. What makes this film so iconic is the way it is filmed.

An also excellent direction by Mike Nichols, in the pool scenes, in the scene when Ben sees Mrs. Robinson nude for the first time, in the wedding scene all possible by the great cinematography. The writing was excellent with phrases like ""Plastics"" or ""Mrs. Robinson you're trying to seduce me aren't you"".

Being born in the year 2000 I am 20 myself now and I don't think there will ever be a movie to which I can relate more. Besides the entertaining main plot it refers to many aspects of the verge from youth to adulthood. A lot of those references a very subtle and metaphorical built into allegories and dialogues which makes the movie all the more interesting and deep. Being 20 myself I can fully understand his feeling of not belonging neither to the noisy teenagers nor to the superficial older parents and their friends.
Of course also the performances by Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin and Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson are just spectacular. Furthermore the film is accompanied by the music of Simon and Garfunkel which just rounds the perfection of the film off.
I strongly urge anyone to watch this movie, especially if you are also in that weird stage of life between youth and adulthood as it is a timeless classic as well as being a turning point for the Hollywood cinema industry.",The Graduate
649,loomis1981,An aggressive 60's movie,10,28 December 2005,"Let me start by saying I'm in my mid twenties and ""The Graduate"" is pretty much out of my chronological frame. Plus I'm not really a fan of 60's cinema.But this film I've gotten to like. Its a clear abandonment of the innocence of the times that really makes ""The Graduate"" stand out. There is an unbridled mean-streak among the characters, and the boldness of it I really enjoy. Lead protagonist Ben Braddock is just pathetically eager-to-please and hes hit with exploitation and cruelty wherever he goes. But he goes the extra mile (Bens a track star, no pun intended) to get what he really wants: Elaine Robinson. Anne Brancroft (died recently) is on top billing but this is widely considered to be a Dustin Hoffman film and the story's focus is on Ben. Although its not clear why his uncertainty about his future would lead him to have an affair with the mother of Elaine, Mrs Robinson, an affair of this kind really precursors the Ashton Kutcher-Demi Moore marriage and this whole trend of dating older women.A little bit of drawback here: the story loses its ""graduate in confusion"" pretext somewhere along the way, so I was left wondering what Ben's goal really was and what kind of life hes going to live after it (the film) was through. The dated music may be hard to swallow but me being a guitar player with no genre limitation I savor the flavor. All in all, great movie.",The Graduate

Yes, it is a master class in it's use in photography & cinematography and the abundance of techniques on display makes for a wonderful tool in teaching a variety of concepts to budding filmmakers. Yes, it is thematically sound as well as having a decent plot to make everything understandable while still providing a lot of depth in its storytelling and something that you could pick apart endlessly. It's a standout film of its time, shining a big bright light on the direction that American society as a whole seemed to be headed, successfully being both deconstructive and even predictive of what kinds of conflicts people of the film's generation would undergo. The writing, camerawork, and symbolism is some of the best you'll ever find in a single film.I just think it has absolutely zero entertainment value.Direction is where you could start to find the cracks in the wall. While technically sound on every level, The Graduate is slow, plodding, and probably only got a pass at the time of its release due to the subject matter. There's a telephoto shot of Hoffman running towards the chapel that makes him look like he's running in place for about 20 seconds. It's cool from a production and cinematography standpoint, but its 20 whole seconds of ""get on with it"" that I can't shake while watching it. Awkward party conversations, Hoffman wallowing in self-pity and uncertainty, a slowly decaying love triangle that gets more cynical as it goes along. Great study material and one of the foundations of how I've come to understand films and other media. I just don't think I could ever enjoy watching this film on my own time.",The Graduate
652,melissabeman,No Doesn't REALLY Mean No,1,2 August 2018,"Benjamin Braddock returns home just after graduating college. I gather he is supposed to be playing someone the typical age for graduating college, early twenties, but is very clearly close to 30. Although he is described as a distinguished student, president of the debate club, and a talented athlete, his character's personality does not possess the elements of drive, confidence, dedication, or maturity accomplishing those things would typically take. At a party thrown in his honor by his wealthy parents and their friends to celebrate his accomplishments and welcome him home, he attempts to avoid the event by hiding in his bedroom. When his parents convince him to come downstairs, he demonstrates annoyed indifference to the guests congratulating him and offering him advice. He then ducks out again up to the comfort of his bedroom where Mrs. Robinson- a beautiful woman that in real life is clearly only a few years older than he is, but is unconvincingly playing someone about 20 years his senior- who asks him to drive her home. He does, amid the continued whining he has displayed throughout the entire party. Once he takes her home, she manipulates him into walking her in and staying with her until her husband arrives home, claiming to be 'afraid' of waiting in the house alone. She then continues to try to seduce him against his objections and clear discomfort. Eventually confronting him naked in a bedroom, ignoring the basic decency of 'no means no' and encouraging him to reach out to her any time for sex. He hears her husband arrive home and flees.Later though, he reconsiders her offer and decides to ignore her predatory and disrespectful behavior and calls her up to have an affair. They meet at a hotel and he continues to produce a whiny, awkward, monotone energy and she continues to produce a practical, abrupt, impatient attitude. He thinks better of sleeping with a married woman up in the hotel room, so she insults him into having sex with her by indicating he only doesn't want to have sex because he is inadequate as a man rather than any possible moral concerns. So he gives in and has sex with her, presumably to prove that he can.An overdone by today's standards, but perhaps original in the 60s, montage then plays indicating the passing of time as he continues his emotionally empty affair. As time goes on, his parents encourage him to date Elaine, Mrs. Robinson's daughter. When he tells Mrs. Robinson this, she gets angry and insists he promise her that he will not date her daughter, to which he agrees. All it takes for him to change his tune is another pushy conversation of encouragement from his parents and he's off to take her on a date. Mrs. Robinson is understandably upset, but he has a plan to ensure the date goes badly. He is incredibly rude to her and takes her to a strip club where he ogles the performer until Elaine starts crying and runs out. Clearly upset by his disrespectful behavior she asks if she has upset him. In order to comfort her, he kisses her which, inexplicably, she welcomes, even though her face is still wet from the tears caused by how badly he treated her. It appears to be more evidence that in this movie, giving clear verbal or non-verbal indications that you do not welcome romantic or sexual attention has no bearing on whether that attention is given. He decides to be nicer to her now, presumably it was a good enough kiss, and they finish the rest of their date. Tears forgotten, she's now sincerely interested. So much so, that it does not faze her in the least that he admits to having recently had an affair with a married woman.They make another date, but Mrs. Robinson confronts him and insists he must not date her daughter. He refuses, so she threatens that she will tell her daughter of their affair. He sprints to Elaine's bedroom and barges in despite her objections that she isn't dressed. Again, I guess objections are made to be ignored. He starts to tell her there is more to the affair and one sight of her mother's horrified face tells her the rest. She screams for him to get out and in this one instance in the movie he respects her decision and leaves.But not for long! Even though they have only had one date, he has decided he is in love with her. His illicit affair with her mother and her specific request that he leave her be are but petty obstacles to be completely ignored. He begins stalking her, literally watching her from the bushes. Once she leaves for college, he announces to his overjoyed parents that he and Elaine are getting married. Their joy diminishes quickly when he admits that she hasn't consented to marry him, nor has he even asked. But again, these are but petty details.He then follows her to college, rents out a room, and continues to stalk her. Eventually he confronts her on a bus ride to meet her date, and in keeping with the overarching theme, ignores her request that he leave, and instead tags along until she meets up with her date, Carl. Later she appears at his room, though it's unclear how she knows where he was staying since the movie doesn't indicate she was counter stalking him, and asks him to leave town. She doesn't want anything to do with him after he raped her mother. He objects that he didn't rape her mother and says that Mrs. Robinson came on to him. Elaine screams and plops down on the bed. He brings her a glass of water and she is instantly mollified, no longer bothered about her mother's violation, and actually apologizes for being so inconsiderate to the man she believes has raped her mother as to have screamed. Before leaving his room, she asks him not to leave town, all concern raised by the rape accusation blissfully forgotten.She then shows up later at his room and asks him to kiss her. He does and immediately proposes to her and she halfheartedly says she might. This quick turnaround from screaming at him for sexually assaulting her mother to saying she might marry him, despite them having only gone on one date was the most ridiculous and nonsensical part of the movie. Over the next few days, he then constantly pesters her for an official yes. She tells him she is still is unsure and has been considering marrying Carl instead.Mr. Robinson shows up at his room having found out about Ben's affair with Mrs. Robinson and confronts him. Ben assures Mr. Robinson that he shouldn't be bothered by the affair because it was only about sex and that really he is in love with Elaine. Mr. Robinson isn't comforted by this assertion and tells Ben to stay away from his daughter. Ben speeds to Elaine's dorm and is informed she has left school. Her roommate brings him a letter from Elaine saying that her father is angry and she needs to break off their connection.Not to be deterred by her wishes, he sets off to confront her in person in true stalker form. At night, he hops a fence and sneaks into her parent's home where he finds Mrs. Robinson rather than Elaine. Mrs. Robinson calls the police and Ben takes off in search of Elaine. He shows up at Carl's frat house and finds out that Carl and Elaine ran off to get married. He lies to a few different people to manipulate them into giving him the location and rushes to stop the wedding. He runs out of gas en route and runs the rest of the way. He is too late to stop the marriage, but makes a huge, awkward scene banging a window and repeatedly screaming Elaine's name. She looks stunned and then screams his name in return.This seems to be some sort of agreement between them that the fact that the groom literally kissed his bride not moments ago is yet another petty detail immediately and easily ignored. The two fight their way through the crowd of angry wedding guests toward each other with Mr. Robinson attacking Ben and Mrs. Robinson attacking Elaine. Ben then picks up a large decorative cross and starts fighting off the crowd. Yes, that's right, he literally fights off a church full of a now angry mob by swinging a cross at them. They then slip out a door and use the cross to barricade it in a scene that seems more like a cheesy action movie where the hero fights off the mass of bad guys to protect his love rather than a dramedy. The movie ends as they sit next to each other on a bus, riding away from her less than ideal wedding. Being born in the 80s myself, perhaps I'm missing the nostalgia necessary to make this movie not seem like it was romanticizing making unwelcome sexual overtures. The main characters demonstrate a disturbing and illegal lack of appropriate boundaries- from exposing yourself inappropriately to someone against their objections to literally stalking someone to the extent you take up residence in a new city. But the message is that it's all okay because the other person will really wind up wanting it in the end. Heartwarming.",The Graduate

For instance where Ben is at the party and the camera is up close in his face you really get a feel of how crowded with people Ben felt. or when Ben is at the Robinson's house and ms. Robinson's leg is shown while looking at Ben, That was new and awesome for that place in time to be playing around and trying different angels throw the movie. I also thought the plot was very original. Over all the movie was about a man; Benjamin who just got out of college and is now trying to figure out what he wants to do with the rest of his life, then Miss Robinson comes on to him for ""pleasure"" which is not very common in movies during the 60's that i know of. And after getting with ms. Robinson he then falls in love with her daughter that she has forbid him to see. To me it was just an awesome movie. I loved it.",The Graduate
654,bluedduke,The Graduate mystifies me,10,28 April 2006,"This movie is my personal favorite movie of all time. The first time I viewed it, I knew about the infamous 'Mrs. Robinson' but I never imagined the brilliant camera work or the symbolic archetypes in this movie. The symbolism, which range from the adults being called Mrs. and Mr and the youth being called by their first names showing the generation gaps to the time when Mrs. Robinson throws her keys and 'kills' the scuba diver and later Ben dresses up as a scuba diver. (Wow, can you say run-on.) Not only the symbols, but the zoom ins and outs of the camera and distortions are so existential and original to the time that it is just amazing to watch.Lastly, Simon and Garfunkel's soundtrack to this movie is mesmorizing. The first song, ""Sound of Silence"" is one of my favorite. ""Mrs. Robinson"" is also a good song although you don't get the full song (Only four lines).Again, this is one of my favorite; no, my favorite film ever made because of all the elements to a film. Character development, shot angles, symbolism, plot conflicts, etc. ---Grant",The Graduate
