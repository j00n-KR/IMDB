0,MartinHafer,Amazingly sterile and disconnected,3,1 April 2007,"Bill Murray plays a famous actor named Bob who goes to Japan to do an ad campaign for big bucks. The problem is, he's experiencing a bit of a crisis before he arrived (a sense of disconnection with his wife and kids), and being in a totally alien culture, he is even more lost and alone. Some of the observations about the way that the Japanese do business and behave are pretty interesting, but there aren't enough of them after the first twenty minutes or so. Having a Westerner come to Japan and feel lost and overwhelmed is an interesting starting point for a film. Unfortunately, the film never really seemed to go anywhere after this interesting start. Plus, the characters (especially Bill Murray's) ultimately turned out to be rather selfish, so I really didn't care about them.The main theme of this movie is a sense of disconnectedness. Unfortunately, in making the two leads (Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson) feel alone and disconnected in Japan, the audience, too, feels pretty much the same way about these leads as well as the movie as a whole. As a result, the movie is extremely somber, sterile and moves at a snail's pace. Both Johansson and especially Murray seem to almost sleepwalk through their roles--showing very little energy or emotion. Overall, it's a sometimes interesting but sleep-inducing experiment that failed. After seeing this and THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU, it seems Murray's career is stagnating. While critics might enjoy these films, they are NOT what the average person would enjoy. As for me, I much prefer the funny Bill Murray of WHAT ABOUT BOB? and THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE.By the way, if you DO like seeing Murray play a zombie-like character like he did in this film, then I suggest you also watch BROKEN FLOWERS--another recent film where he gives an identical performance with absolutely no emotional range.",Lost in Translation
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Sad, funny, magical and irresistibly moving",10,13 April 2011,"I had been well aware of this film's reputation as a masterpiece for some time, and when I finally saw it I was so glad I did. I have seen it three times now, it improves each time. Lost in Translation is a brilliant film, but also a film you need to see more than once to appreciate it.Lost in Translation for example is a brilliantly written film. The script is wonderful, with a healthy balance of energetic humour and bittersweet soul-searching. The story, driven by its characters, is slowly-paced but purposefully so, any faster it would have detracted from any magic and poignancy and also would have made the title irrelevant. And I love the ambiguous but very meaningful ending. Lost in Translation manages to be both sad and funny, but it is also in its tone a magical and irresistibly moving film.I can't say I am a fan of Sophia Coppola. I can say though Lost in Translation is her best written and best directed film, and probably the only one I would consider a masterpiece. And speaking of Coppola, she makes some risky but wise decisions such as the balance of the humour and the bittersweet poignancy and altogether it is a rock-solid directing job.Lost in Translation looks absolutely beautiful too, with its skillful lighting, beguiling location work and stunning cinematography. The Japan-pop soundtrack creates a big emotional impact, and just adds to the authenticity Lost in Translation has.The acting is marvellous. Bill Murray gives a delicate, restrained and masterful performance in the lead role, and from his performance here you would never guess he is the same Bill Murray who starred in broader films like GhostBusters. Scarlett Johanssen also gives one of her best performances as the younger woman trapped in a loveless marriage, not to mention she looks lovely here and shares a believable chemistry with Murray.In conclusion, a masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Lost in Translation
2,Leofwine_draca,The worst thing imaginable,1,14 September 2021,"One of the worst things I've ever witnessed in my life. I can't imagine anything worse than spending time with these vapid, self-obsessed, wafer-thin characters going on tediously about nothing. A shame as both Murray and Johansson have been fine elsewhere, so I'll blame the director.",Lost in Translation
3,SnoopyStyle,wonderful and beautiful,8,4 September 2015,Faded movie star Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is in Tokyo to shot whiskey commercials. He's getting $2 million to endorse the whiskey. He's married for 25 years with kids. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is in Tokyo with her photographer husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) of 2 years. He's constant working and she feels lost. She's a recent philosophy graduate. She finds a fellow lost soul in Bob at the hotel bar. They both have difficulty sleeping.Sofia Coppola made a gentle beautiful movie. Scarlett is dressed down a little and she looks gorgeous. Then there is Bill Murray. He's having some fun and making little wisecracks. It's not anything terribly big. I love the hospital scene mostly because of the two Japanese women behind him. It is surprising how much of the movie is the two leads apart. They work well together.,Lost in Translation
4,Hitchcoc,"A Quiet, Personal Film",8,8 August 2005,"Being in a profession where there is constant noise, I enjoyed this movie for a very odd reason. The characters are pulling away from a hyped up society, away from a world, much of which is based on needless, trivial noise. Everywhere they go there is more numbing action. Watching the director of the commercial gyrating, trying to act like a real film director, despite the fact that they are doing a 30 second liquor commercial, typifies some of what this movie is about, a world where people are worn into the ground by a type A culture that is as vapid and unnecessary as we can imagine. I thought the Bill Murray character developed tremendously. While this trip to Japan was excruciatingly dull (money isn't everything), I believe that he began to see things he hadn't seen before. I liked that while he was struggling with his marriage, the crises were simple, day to day things that living brings to us. The young woman he meets shows through a whimsical kindness, that he is worth something. She is refreshing to look at an to be with. He, like many middle aged men, has self doubts. Because she has a sense of purity and can talk to him honestly about her world and his, he should go back to his life a little more sustained.",Lost in Translation
5,Prismark10,Big in Japan,5,6 March 2019,"Written and directed by Sofia Coppola, this is a bittersweet tale of two Americans who come across each other in Tokyo. They seem to connect like lost souls but maybe that was because they felt stranded in a foreign country.Bob (Bill Murray) is faded movie star filming a lucrative whiskey commercial in Japan. Away from his family, he feels lost in Japan.Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) has arrived in Tokyo with her photographer husband. While he is busy working on a photo shoot, she is at a loose end. When both Bob and Charlotte meet at a bar they explore the Tokyo night life and have fun together.I first watched this movie on a place soon after it was released. I gave up after 10 minutes because nothing much was happening.It does take a while to get going and it works mainly because of the two stars. The combination of the jaded Bob whose career is in decline and maybe his home life is troubled. He is rather self centred as he has no issues picking up women. Charlotte is younger, only been married for a few years and is still trying to figure out life.I once heard someone say that Tokyo is a place where you know you are in a foreign country and it is easy to feel disconnected if you are a westerner. That is what has occurred to Bob and Charlotte. If they bumped to each other in New York for example, they would just then passed each other by.The film is not much of a comedy and I think Murray who was Oscar nominated for his role is not exactly stretching himself here.Director Sofia Coppola adds a few flourishes such as two women giggling behind Bob as a Japanese man talks to him in a hospital waiting room.",Lost in Translation
6,claudio_carvalho,Overrated Tale of Loneliness,8,6 October 2004,"In Tokyo, Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a bored middle-age famous movie star filming a commercial of a whisky for two millions dollars. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is a bored and lonely wife of a photographer lodged in the same hotel as Bob. Together, they find the company of each other to supersede their loneliness in a foreigner country, and their proximity becomes in friendship and repressed love. 'Lost in Translation' is a sensitive movie, with a great performances of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. The direction is precise and secure and the screenplay is quite original. The situation of Bob and Charlotte is very easy to be understood, if the viewer has had the experience of working expatriated alone in a country in the Orient, where the language, culture, behavior and social customs and habits are totally different from the Occident. He certainly will miss his family, sometimes will feel bored and confused, most of the times will have difficulties even to order the meals. I found 'Lost in Translation' a beautiful, romantic and melancholic uncommon American film, since it looks like an European movie, but overrated, maybe because of the name of Sofia Coppola. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'Encontros e Desencontros' ('Meetings and Failure to Meet')",Lost in Translation
7,classicsoncall,"""I hope you've had enough to drink. It's gonna take courage.""",7,17 April 2018,"I did better with this movie the second time around. The first time was in the theater upon release and it just didn't strike me as having any relevance at all, which is usually a sign that I might have nodded off from time to time. What we have here is something of a bittersweet but unrequited love story between a late middle aged, has-been actor (Bill Murray) and the twenty-something wife (Scarlett Johansson) of an up and coming photographer on assignment in Tokyo. I say unrequited, but the relationship never really approached physical expression because I believe both parties were well guarded against getting into something that they would ultimately regret. As Charlotte's (Johansson) husband, we almost never see Giovanni Ribisi's face, which lends support to the idea that Charlotte had a marriage in name, but one in which she was not an active participant in. In Bob Harris's (Murray) case, we never even get to see his absent wife, as she's back home tending to the family while Bob's pursuing a paycheck. Watching the film can be an exercise in frustration because nothing much happens, while all the time one wishes that something would. Bob and Charlotte would make an interesting couple if not for the age disparity, or for the fact that their personal commitments lie elsewhere. Writer and director Sofia Coppola cleverly throws that scene into the end of the story where Bob searches out Charlotte in heavy Tokyo traffic for one last good bye, and he whispers a message into her ear that seems to assuage any consternation over his departure. It would be cool to know what he might have said, but better for us that it not get lost in translation.",Lost in Translation
8,gavin6942,I Was Lost in the Eyes of Scarlett and Bill,8,4 September 2005,"This is a film, written and directed by Nicolas Cage's cousin, about either absolutely nothing or absolutely everything. Two strangers meet in Japan where nobody speaks English - not even subtitles - and both conspire to cheat on their spouse, though neither of them admits it or ever really acts on it. Bill Murray plays a washed-up alcoholic actor who suffers a mid-life crisis and enjoys long walks on the beach. Scarlett Johannsson also stars, being primarily a scantily-clad young vixen who is placed in this film for no really obvious reason other than to sexually frustrate the male audience for months on end. Despite the fact she is hideously deformed in real life, her Hollywood beauty shines through in this film. Anna Faris appears playing Cameron Diaz and being just ditsy enough not to be appealing or interesting. Lots of really cool things happen, but the bottom line is that life is simply a series of phases - in one, you love ponies - in a second, it's photography - and in the third phase, you lust over a wrinkled old lush twice your age. This movie is really highly recommended by both myself and the critics, though damned if I know why.",Lost in Translation
9,lee_eisenberg,Tokyo holiday,7,18 October 2005,"Obviously, when we go to a foreign country, we're likely to experience some unexpected things. I guess that there's nothing outlandish about the possibility of a burnout actor and a neglected wife growing attached to each other. In ""Lost in Translation"", that's just what happens to Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). Alone in the glitzy world of Tokyo, these two souls find in each other just what any isolated person seeks.Along with being a relationship story, ""Lost in Translation"" is also a look at Tokyo, much the way that ""Roman Holiday"" was a look at Italy's capital. My favorite scene was the commercial scene. Maybe this movie wasn't any masterpiece, but it certainly was an interesting look at how surroundings - and previous experiences - can affect peoples' relationships, whether positively or negatively.",Lost in Translation
10,jboothmillard,Lost in Translation,10,12 September 2005,"Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Sofia Coppola, daughter of famous Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, has created a very simple but very effective idea for a film. Basically Bob Harris (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Bill Murray) is a famous actor doing photo shoots and adverts in Japan for a scotch drink. During his work related trip he meets Charlotte (gorgeous BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Scarlett Johansson). They become really close friends, and if they both weren't married there could have been a closer relationship. Also starring Scary Movie's Anna Faris as Kelly and Giovanni Ribisi as John. The best sequences include Murray looking like Roger Moore's James Bond, and getting stuck on the exercise machine. But the intriguing moment is when Bob is about leave, and he whispers something you never hear in Charlotte's ear. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Editing, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Kevin Shields and Brian Reitzell, Best Cinematography, Best Original Screenplay, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and Best Screenplay.

11,ccthemovieman-1,"Give It A Second Chance, If Needed",8,17 February 2008,"I admit I found it disappointing on the first look but I decided to give it a second chance and was glad I did. Only then did I appreciate Bill Murray's great performance and the wonderful photography in this movie. The vivid colors in here are really something to see. It's odd how some movies are so much better the second time around.This is a very, very low key film about loneliness and about being in a culture that is totally foreign to you where few people speak your language. In this case, it's Americans - or at least the main character of film (Bill Murray) - trying to cope in Japan.The film is almost two-in-one: a travelogue and a story. The former because you really get the feel of what it is like to be a non-Japanese speaking person in that country and what the customs of the people are in Japan, at least to some degree....and it's interesting.Murray is the star of the story and any plaudits he's received for his performance are well- deserved. His facial expressions alone are classic! Scarlet Johannson is the female lead and she, too, is interesting to watch. These two make for a fascinating ""odd couple.""",Lost in Translation
12,Tweekums,Two strangers in a strange land,9,20 January 2015,"Actor Bob Harris is past his prime so instead of making popular movies he is shooting an advert for whisky in Japan; he doesn't want to be there and what is more he can't sleep. The much younger Charlotte is another American staying that the same hotel; her husband is working as a photographer and she is rather bored and also can't sleep. Bob and Charlotte seem an unlikely pair but they get chatting over a drink and start to explore Tokyo together.At first one would expect this to end up a romance despite the fact that they are both married and she is much younger than he is neither seems that happy in their marriages and films are full of older men involved with younger woman; this however is different it is just two people enjoying each other's company.The story is told at a gentle pace; some would say slow but I was never bored despite the fact that boredom is one of the things that drives our protagonists together. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson both do fine jobs; there are other characters but these two are very much the centre of attention. Their characters are believable if not totally likable. There are a good number of laughs to be had along the way; many due to their difficulties understanding Japanese but not entirely. The way Tokyo is filmed, mostly at night or twilit gives the film a slightly claustrophobic atmosphere that adds to the feeling of being somewhat lost in its alien culture. Overall I found this bitter-sweet film really enjoyable although I can see how others might not be such fans.",Lost in Translation
13,moonspinner55,A movie with aimlessness at its core...Murray is grounded but film intentionally meanders,6,5 September 2005,"Despite an occasional misstep, I felt writer-director Sofia Coppola's sure-hand throughout this slight, occasionally lovely film about isolation finding an outlet in admiration. While not a love story per se, ""Lost in Translation"" is charming and almost-romantic as it ambles along, bringing two kindred spirits together. Coppola seems to excel in a forlorn melancholy that is as beautiful as it is perplexing (you may wonder, ""where is she going with this?"", but then just as quickly realize that a schedule here isn't the purpose). Bill Murray has some funny moments, and he is surprisingly at home with Coppola's low-key approach. There are a few awkward stops (an outburst at a party is perhaps more fuzzy than anything else), but Murray is comfortable in his scenes with quiet, dreamy-eyed Scarlett Johansson, and their repartee is beguiling. The simple plot--about the alienation any human being would feel in a foreign country--is character-driven, so it seems very slim (particularly in retrospect). Coppola lets sequences breathe and take their own shape; she stays out of Murray's way, but also manages to keep the actor grounded. The alt-rock soundtrack is moody and interesting, and the picture has an unfettering eye for the craziness of a desperately with-it Tokyo. **1/2 from ****",Lost in Translation
14,dbdumonteil,take the time to relax yourself a little with this little pearl,9,9 December 2006,"In 1999 Sofia Coppola made a breakthrough in the landscape of North-American cinema with ""the Virgin Suicides"" in which she walled up 5 lovely female teenagers in silence due to their severe parents and notably their mother. 4 years later, Francis Ford's daughter moves to Tokyo in Japan but keeps the theme of loneliness to give it to her two lost main characters as a means to assess their lives.So, Tokyo constitutes the backdrop for this bitter story. It's a city brimming with lights and people and from a Western standpoint, one often imagines the image of an uptight city. Sofia Coppola rather showcases us a laid-back, carefree vision in which the modernism of the city symbolized by a highly advanced technology and tall buildings is next to a preservation of old traditions and customs. Japan has a strong power of fascination on Western society and I've heard several times some of my peers that they would love to go there. If their dreams come true one day, it is highly likely that they will feel puzzled on the first days of their stay, just like Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). The former is a prestigious, seasoned actor who came to Tokyo to pocket a few millions of dollars for a whiskey brand while the latter is a fresh philosophy graduate from Yale who hurriedly married a young photographer. Both are somewhat jettisoned by their native close relatives. Both wind up in a four-star hotel amid a country with a culture and a language they don't understand and both are sleepless due to jet lag and in prey to a deep inner turmoil. Nothing at first lets suggest the success of this May-to-December relation but each of them found a soul mate to provide them solace and relief. Charlotte doesn't know what to do with her life but perceives Bob as a solid rock while Bob who is at wits' end considers Charlotte as a reminder of his youth.From the arrival of the two heroes in the chic hotel to their first moments together to their exploration of the city through the mob, colorful places and with their mutual support, Sofia Coppola reused a formula which proved its worth in her precedent work and here it shines again to give astounding results. Everything in her directing breathes delicacy, fragility and she favors a low-key cinematographic language. So it entails a sort of complicity with her two leads. A good pack of her sequences rings thoroughly true like for example when Charlotte rings her mother to tell her her first day in Tokyo. Then, the fax and the telephone are the sole means of communication with their native country for her two heroes and lets the audience suggest the state of their own relationships, especially with Bob whose private life and particularly his marriage goes unravel. Looks, gestures have a big intensity while the suggested has a meaty part in the dialogs. To make the dish more appealing, the female filmmaker had also recourse to a discreet humor like when Bob tries to follow the Japanese director's instructions through the interpreter. Sofia Coppola was right not to steer her film towards a well-worn master plan which would have seen the two characters almost at once in each other's arms. Actually, I must admit that I didn't think of this perspective during the major part of the film. It's much more novel to see two human beings finding their bearings in the throes of a whirlpool shrouding a noisy city and a seemingly indecipherable culture that they timidly tame.The evocative original soundtrack is in perfect adequacy with the images and was discerningly chosen. The lyrics of ""More Than This"" by Roxy Music could apply to Bob (you have to see his performance on a karaoke) and Charlotte. Specialists of noise such as ""My Bloody Valentine"" and ""the Jesus and Mary Chain"" are a perfect musical illustration of the urban chaos in which the two characters happily wrestle.This is also Bill Murray's most ground-breaking role since ""Groundhog Day"" (1993). Like in this ingenious comedy, he acts a cynical man who eventually transmits joy and happiness to the ones he meets. Here his deadpan humor and his sense of restraint could justify the screening of the film. Beside him, Scarlett Johansson epitomizes grace and fragility. This trip to Tokyo was bracing for them and also for the viewer. This prizewinning indie remains etched on his or her memory and this is one to ponder.",Lost in Translation
15,Quinoa1984,Murray and Johansson are a fine pair in a good movie- B+,7,30 September 2003,"Sophia Coppola's Lost in Translation isn't a film that moves at a particularly speedy pace, and I suppose I should've expected that. A lot of times her characters seem to be enclosed within the city of Tokyo, the buildings and Asian ambiance shining onto the American characters like some kind of alien presence they're not used to. I liked her usage of the atmosphere of the city, and how she took time to tell the story.  Although at times some of the conversations between the characters either a) weren't too interesting or b) the answers to the questions they asked each other were sort of self-explanatory when we see the characters by themselves within their hotel rooms for stretches of time. While she didn't make a great movie, she did do a competent enough job as a director to let her two leads, Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson, give off the some of the most touching performances of the year.In fact, this is a film that Bill Murray fans have been waiting a while for (his best work at getting inside a role since 98's Rushmore): a character who is has humor, yet only because it helps him (as well as us) feel comfortable around such odd people. He plays Bob Harris, an actor who can't get work in the states and, like other real life actors, goes to appear in advertisements in other countries. In the hotel bar, drinking the whiskey he helps to sell (regretfully, we learn, as he wants to act in plays), he meets a complete stranger names Charlotte (Johansson), who is tagging along, more or less, with her celebrity photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi). They befriend each other, hang around each other out of something between boredom and loneliness, and the film chronicles their encounters, a small event or two that would be expected to come out of real life, and it's done without romance one would expect in any conventional story. There is humor in the film, which helps ease the feeling that the film lingers longer than it should here and there, but it's executed with a sweetness, a reality that proves again what makes Murray one of the best of the post-SNL actors. For example, there's a scene where Charlotte goes to get a black toe examined, and Bob waits in the waiting room next to a weird little Japanese guy who's just smiling. He starts to talk to Bob, giving a gesture with his finger to point out something about the world, and Bob follows along imitatively bringing out some earned laughs not at the little guy, but with him like Bob does. Such moments could've made Lost in Translation a great movie, and in terms of film acting it nearly is. Maybe I just saw too many moments where there was pandering, or lingering for the next good scene.",Lost in Translation
16,ComedyFan2010,A little bit different soul mate movie,8,14 January 2014,"Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a fading Hollywood actor who goes to Japan to film a whiskey commercial. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is a young woman recently graduated from Yale who accompanies her husband on a business trip. They both are lost by being not sure about themselves and where their life is going as well as having trouble to fit in. So while being in this amazing city they have trouble appreciating it hanging out all the time in the hotel until they meet each other and spend time together giving each other a certain support in self exploration.The movie isn't so much about plot as it is about looking at the characters. We go through their feelings and see them struggle with something within that is lost in translation to the outer world. I didn't like the movie when it came out, I was a bit too young for it. Now about a decade later I could see things that I didn't see before.Being set in Japan offers a beautiful analogy of being in the world that is so different from yourself where you stand out and being unable to communicate with it. People who consider it to be racist must have missed it. Look, I am not an American, but seeing this as making fun of Japanese culture and American superiority arrogance is a bit of a paranoia. For the most, when it comes to the cultural/language scenes we mainly laugh at the characters who are out of place, or better yet we laugh at the situation,not the Japanese who happily live their lives in one of the most exciting places in the world and obviously don't all speak English. I especially enjoyed the scene with the whiskey commercial. It is a great parallel to trying to act in this world when you have trouble understanding what it wants from you. And having read the translation to the dialogue makes it so much better.One thing I couldn't see was Charlotte being neglected by her husband. The movie tries to present it, but considering that he is on the business trip it is hard to blame him for concentrating on work. While I sympathize with Charlotte feeling lost and lonely, he doesn't strike me as a negative character. I see him more to be in his own world, away from her, the world of his work.I like to see the relationship between Bob and Charlotte. It is strictly platonic, even though you can feel some sexual tension develop. It is also interesting how they are so different yet in the same place at this moment.By place I don't mean physical place, more like their mental place. Both are at different stages of life yet lost to the point that they have no problems understanding each other and connect.Good acting by both main characters. I never saw Bill Murray in such a movie before and think he did a great job. Also impressed by Scarlett Johansson who was only 18 when the movie was made. Amazing how she was able to catch this character. I was 2 years older than her when it came out, but found it dull because I didn't get it.",Lost in Translation

19,sunwarrior13,One Of The Best Films Ever Made,10,16 September 2012,"Lost in Translation is a film written and directed by Sofia Coppola. Her second feature film, after The Virgin Suicides, it stars Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. The film revolves around an aging actor named Bob Harris (Murray) and a recent college graduate named Charlotte (Johansson) who develop a rapport after a chance meeting in a Tokyo hotel. The movie explores themes of loneliness, alienation, insomnia, existential ennui and culture shock against the backdrop of a modern Japanese city.Bob Harris is a well-known American actor whose career has gone into a tailspin; needing work, he takes a very large fee to appear in a commercial for Japanese whiskey to be shot in Tokyo. Feeling no small degree of culture shock in Japan, Bob spends most of his non-working hours at his hotel, where he meets Charlotte at the bar. Twentysomething Charlotte is married to John, a successful photographer who is in Tokyo on an assignment, leaving her to while away her time while he works. Beyond their shared bemusement and confusion with the sights and sounds of contemporary Tokyo, Bob and Charlotte share a similar dissatisfaction with their lives; the spark has gone out of Bob's marriage, and he's become disillusioned with his career. Meanwhile, Charlotte is puzzled with how much John has changed in their two years of marriage, while she's been unable to launch a creative career of her own. Bob and Charlotte become fast friends, and as they explore Tokyo, they begin to wonder if their sudden friendship might be growing into something more.A relationship picture with elegant connective tissue; it's brittle and real, focused on the nuances of body language and unspoken desire, while indulging in a cheeky bit of knowing absurdity when the mood strikes.This exhibit Coppola's talent as a director.This picture in itself is so good that it compensated whatever mess she created when she made The Godfather Part III.Anyway,the film effectively balances humor and subtle pathos as it had a moving, melancholy story that is also highlighted by the great showcase of talent for both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.In summary,Lost In Translation is one of the best films ever made.",Lost in Translation

The relationship between the two main characters feels genuine and there is no doubt that the final scene is both highly romantic and beautiful even without words being said.For me though there were one too many slow moments and scenes that didn't add particularly that much.

Lost in Translation has proved to be a most divisive picture, but outside of its overuse of stereotyping Asians for its laughs, I personally don't see any faults. In a time, both then and now, when blockbusters were {are} the main stay of bread winning cinema, Sofia Coppola's film is the perfect anti-dote for those tired by sledge hammer cinema. Blending themes such as fidelity and generational divides is a neat enough premise in itself, but cloaking it in commercialism and a hazy jet lagged fog is something of a masterstroke from Coppola {who also wrote and produced}.What makes this such an intriguing and delicate film is not that it's essentially two different people finding each other, because anyone can make a love story, doomed or otherwise. But that in a film that its detractors claim ""nothing is happening"", it's in fact saying so much. Coppola, by way of two top notch performances from Scarlett Johansson {Charlotte} and Bill Murray {Bob} transports complex ideas superbly. Hope springs eternal for our characters, the problems of communication around them are evident, but in their newly formed world it folds together nicely, secular can be such a special and uplifting thing. The joys of pop music is also brilliantly put on to the screen by the makers, including a quite lovely sequence set around karaoke. Here the beauty of a human connection is well and truly realised.The comedy, of which there is loads, is made to measure for Murray and his sarcastic line in grumpy mid life crisis-with Coppola showing great restraint by knowing when and how to drop it into the mix. The soundtrack is first rate, with the use of The Jesus And Mary Chain's sumptuous ""Just Like Honey"" at the films pivotal moment, being pure genius, and the Tokyo location is a ball of light feast for the eyes. But ultimately it's because of its elegance and its multi stranded themes that Lost In Translation won so many fans back in 2003. I myself am glad to now count myself as one of their number. 9/10",Lost in Translation
22,jotix100,Sleepless in Tokyo,10,25 September 2003,"What happens when one arrives in Tokyo after an extremely from a long flight? Either one goes to sleep, or one ends up with a severe case of insomnia, as Bob Harris, finds out to be the case. What does one do when one is trying to catch up on some badly needed sleep in a foreign hotel? One watches television. But what if the language is Japanese and one can't comprehend a word of what is being said? One heads for the bar, if it is open, and proceed to get drunk and get into trouble...Such is the premise of Ms Coppola's incredible incisive film. It's curious how she has gotten inside the character of Bob Harris. She knows him very well. It is to her credit that she has balanced all the right elements to come out with this magnificent film that has a look of someone with a lot of film experience behind.I was not a fan of her previous film, The Virgin Suicides, but this one has its heart in the right place. She really knows what she is doing, which, for a second time film director to have achieved, it's a lot.Ms Coppola has been able to get magnificent performances from her two principal actors: Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson. Bill Murray, above all is perfection personified. His take on this has been Hollywood actor, Bob Harris, is so true that it hurts. There are layers upon layers that Mr. Murray brings to his portrayal of this lonely man who has seen better days, and now has to go make commercials in Japan to make a living since probably no one at home remembers him.On the other hand, the Charlotte of Scarlet Johansson is a triumph as well for this young actress. She exudes such an intelligence that one might think she is a much older person than what she really is. She is in a hopeless situation married to a photographer who obviously is in his own little world to realize what a precious gift he has in his wife. It is inevitable that these two lost souls are drawn into each other in this strange place where they don't seem to even fit. The film is a bittersweet comedy. Bob and Charlotte communicate in ways they don't seem to be able to talk with their own spouses. The attraction is mutual. One can see they belong together despite the age difference. At the end there is a hint that maybe they will be united after all.Ms Coppola's view on the culture differences are hysterical. Her take on the Japanese may not be politically correct, but it makes a lot of sense in the context of having the tables turned on the Americans that are in that country making millions, and never taking a moment to try to understand what is in front of them. It is only Charlotte who shows a spirit of adventure in enjoying the magnificent scenery of Kyoto and other religious sites in Tokyo.Great things are in store for the viewer in future films directed by Sofia Coppola, I am sure.",Lost in Translation

26,Boba_Fett1138,Character comedy.,8,14 August 2005,"This movie is an unique movie that I would describe as a 'character comedy'. This is not a comedy with forced humor in it, it is a comical, yet ordinary observation of two different people in a strange foreign world, who are growing more and more towards each other. The humor and warm feeling of the movie is in the every day things and the strange but yet realistic characters. This movie is just like real life; slow and not every thing is always making sense or requires explanation. Sometimes things just happen, whether you like it or not.This is a movie that relies heavily on its two main characters played by Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray, two totally different characters who yet are 'attracted' to each other. It's obvious that at lot of parts in the movie moments were improvised, especially in the Bill Murray sequences. But somehow director Sofia Coppola manages to restrain Murray (something that most definitely is not an easy thing to do) and molds him into the character she want him to be. The fact that Murray perhaps plays the role of his life is thanks to Coppola's directing. Coppola and Murray should definitely make more movies together in the future.It's logical that this movie received an Oscar nomination for best picture, since this type of movie is new and yet works so well and feels so familiar and honest. I'm sure of it that in the near future we will get to see more movies like ""Lost in Translation"" being made.Perhaps not the must see everyone makes you believe it is but still an unique, warm movie experience that surely is recommendable for everyone to watch, at least once.

There's no ick factor here due to the age difference, because Coppola's screenplay does not fall into the cliché of having this be a romantic adventure. Instead, it's about two different people who find a friend in an unlikely place just at the point in their lives when they both desperately need one.Murray's trademark hangdog humor is put to perfect use, while Johansson gave us an early indication of her acting chops.Grade: A+",Lost in Translation
28,ferguson-6,A Visual Masterpiece,8,22 September 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Director Sofia Coppola has created a true piece of visual art.  She has a gift of telling a story with very dialog.  Her shots of Scarlett Johannsen (who is outstanding) looking over the Tokyo skyline from her hotel window are wonderful, as are the ""peeping tom"" shots of her exploring this fascinating world.  Of course, what really makes this film work is the hound dog look and mannerisms of Bill Murray. He has the ability to appear ALMOST beaten by life, but still have a gleam of hope in his eyes and on his face.  The scenes between the two lead have very little dialog, yet speak volumes for many in the audience.  So many looking for who they are or what they are meant to be.  The lifelong quest we all face.  Did think maybe the marriage between Giovanni Ribisi and Scarlett could have been handled a little differently, but we do understand her pain.  On the other hand, we never see Bill Murray's wife, but have a total understanding of his desire for more.  Coppola uses windows and television to great effect as the two leads are always looking for something to connect with.  This is real life touched with humor and sadness. Johannsen has 4 films coming out over the next year and I anxiously await each to see how she progresses as an actress.  And Sofia Coppola has won my admiration for her talent and I will be first in line with her next project. Last thing, I know it is difficult to watch Bill Murray sing karoake without flashing back to his SNL days, but these are poignant moments and should not be spoiled by his baggage.",Lost in Translation

It stars Bill Murray as a movie star in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial. Scarlett Johansson plays the young wife of a workaholic photographer whom she joins in Tokyo but it seems that he hasn't time for her. She and Murray encounter each other at the hotel bar when they cannot face their isolation any longer. They form a unique friendship that is just this side of an affair yet their ages wedge between such a fate. Well written with a satisfactory conclusion that couldn't end any other way. Insightful direction by Sofia Coppola who previously made The Virgin Suicides. This is easily one of Murray's greatest performances particularly his lack of understanding to the language around him. Solid performance from Johansson who drifts from a routine marriage and experiences forbidden freedom. Giovanni Ribisi as Johansson's husband is too brief and obvious and seems only to function to leave. Why not just write Johansson as single, or find a more constructive manner to write in the husband. Anna Faris provides a brief but fetching performance as an action star who strikes a connection with Johansson and company. It regards the language of communication in a film worth getting lost in.

31,Wuchakk,True love transcends sexual expression,9,30 August 2011,"RELEASED IN 2003 and written & directed by Sofia Coppola, ""Lost in Translation"" was a big hit in 2003-2004. It's about an aging actor, Bob Harris (Bill Murray), who's in Tokyo doing commercials for a week. His home-life is mundane and he's experiencing a bit of the mid-life crisis. He runs into an attractive 20 year-old something woman, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who's in Tokyo with her photog husband (), but he's gone most of the time and takes her for granted.This is a mature, semi-arty film and you have to be in the right mode/maturity level to appreciate it. I said ""maturity level"" and not ""age"" because some people are pretty mature at 16 while others are completely immature at 50. For me, the story, music and visuals pulled me into these characters' temporary world for the 102-minute runtime.The film succeeds as an amusing social commentary and a deep love story, as well as a visual/musical delight. I'll only focus on the deep love element. It's been noted that the story originated from Sofia's experience with an aging actor when she was younger, possibly Harrison Ford. Sofia is obviously Charlotte, while Charlotte's husband is Sofia's ex and Anna Faris plays the role of the other woman, which would be Cameron Diaz in real life. So there's a lot of reality in the picture.But it's not just a cathartic piece. Sofia has some potent insights to offer on the nature of true romantic love. For one, love transcends age difference (Bob is about 35 years older than Charlotte). For another, it's possible to be married and experience romantic love for another. Not that this ever justifies adultery, it's just a fact. As the story progresses you'll see how comfortable Bob and Charlotte are with each other, how they look into each other's eyes, the windows of the soul, in a profoundly naked sense. This can happen in the flash of a moment where the two people just KNOW, or it can take place over a period of time, as is the case with Bob and Charlotte (which is a handful of days). They see the same things and speak the same language, and I don't mean English. But this presents a conundrum for Bob. Bob COULD take advantage of Charlotte because she's so lonely in a sea of people, which is one of the movie's themes; she's also inexperienced and vulnerable. Will he or won't he take advantage? ***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read further if you haven't seen the film.If Bob loves Charlotte so much, not to mention his wife & kids, why does he have a one-night stand with the lounge singer (Catherine Lambert)? Bob slept with her to release sexual tension that had been building up between him and Charlotte. This was a moral failure, but keep in mind he was drunk (another failure but, have pity, he was going through a mid-life crisis). While all this is obvious, it goes deeper...Bob could have taken advantage of Charlotte if he wanted to but didn't because he genuinely loved her, which is revealed at the end. Bob could sleep with the singer because he didn't love her (not that it justifies his actions). Simply put, true love transcends sexual expression and sexual union does not equal love.The ending is powerful and tear-inducing. No CGI, explosion or action stunt can compare. It's just an older man and a too-young woman embracing in the midst of 20 million strangers. Tears flow, kisses are given and unheard words are whispered. They could never be a couple, even if they weren't married, and they know they'll never see each other again, at least on this physical plane, but their love has been expressed and will be treasured for eternity.GRADE: A",Lost in Translation
32,safenoe,It is what it is,6,10 January 2017,"A lot has been written about the alleged cultural insensitivity or even racism towards Japanese in Lost in Translation, but really, Lost in Translation is what it is. Lost in Translation was written and directed by Italian-American Sofia ""The Godfather Part III"" Coppola (who is related to Nic Cage). Sofia has every right to write and direct her movie how she sees fit for better or worse, even if she perpetuates stereotypes and so on.If say a Japanese filmmaker wrote and directed a movie about a Japanese actor taking up a lucrative advertising job in the USA, the filmmaker can be forgiven if there are stereotypes about obese and loud Americans. Or if the film was set in the UK, there would be stereotypes about Brits with bad teeth and so on if you know what i mean.",Lost in Translation
33,The_Void,Not the masterpiece it claims to be,3,31 July 2004,"With The Godfather part 3, Sofia Coppola proved that acting isn't her forte. So what about directing? Well, Lost in Translation is my first taste of Ms Coppola behind the camera, and let's just say; if her other films aren't as good as this, then I hope this is my last taste also. Lost in Translation is the tale of two people that suffer from insomnia and have hit a dry patch in their lives. The two are in the foreign land of Tokyo, Japan. They are outcasts in this land, not just because of the language, but the culture too. So what we basically have here is a story of two fish out of water that find romance. You may notice that my plot analysis isn't very detailed, and that has a reason; this movie has very little plot. It has a premise, and that's all; and all it does is play out from that premise. The movie is very random as it doesn't follow a set formula, and although that can work for some movies because it can be spontaneous; it doesn't work here. The film is very subdued, too subdued in fact, and after a while you are instilled with a notion that nothing out of the ordinary will happen in this movie; and it doesn't. This will be to the movie's credit in some people's opinions, because, as we all know, movies that are slow are ultimately more intelligent than anything that is entertaining. And as you should have gathered from that last sentence, I was being sarcastic. That's my first major criticism of the movie; it settles into itself to a point where after a while you forget you're watching a movie, and it just seems like you're simply watching a fish bowl with two people in it; and although this is good in terms of realism, and I don't doubt that Sofia intended it that way; movies are supposed to be an escape from reality, and although some people would disagree; movies are also meant to be entertaining, and I for one don't watch movies to not be entertained; Lost in Translation fails in both of those respects. In it's bid to realistic; Lost in Translation is ultimately a hollow movie experience. It's a simple tale of two people, and that's all that can be took from the film. The characters lack depth; he's a bored middle aged man going through a mid-life crisis and she's a bored wife that is doubting her two year marriage; we don't learn anything about the two characters other than this, and a few minor details such as the fact that he has a wife and kids. In one scene, through dialogue, Bill Murray gives Scarlett words of wisdom regarding children; and this is as deep as the film gets. She says that the advice he gives is different from everything she's heard regarding the subject, but it's merely blatantly obvious advice that any fool with kids or an imagination could conjure up; and this film does that a lot. Two people have empty lives, they find love and they like it. Yes, that's great; now where's the point? I imagine that people with empty lives can relate to this film, but I can't see why. Had the film have had depth of character, it would have improved it vastly. Take Brief Encounter; a similar film along similar lines, but it worked. It worked because it was fleshed out; we can see the main character's predicament clearly, which enables us to get inside of her head and see why she wants to spice up her life by having an extra marital affair. Here, we have none of that. Scarlett Johansson's husband is about as much use in the film as the taxi driver that took them to a party, or the waiter that served them drinks; here's there so we know he's there, but we don't learn anything about the couple's predicament, so why should we care if she finds her life empty and hollow? We know nothing about her. It's similar with him; he's a big movie star that is past his prime and now he's advertising whiskey in Japan, so what? We're supposed to empathise with this guy why? That's another major criticism of this film; the characters have no feeling, they're just there. Despite the review so far; Lost in Translation is not completely void of positive aspects. It has one in particular; the cinematography. Although I don't think the way Tokyo was photographed in this movie is among the best examples of location shoots of all time, and it certainly isn't enough to carry the film; it is good. However, although it is well photographed; Tokyo is not a nice place. Take Roman Holiday; another similar film along similar lines. That film also made the best use of it's surroundings to increase the impact of the film, the only difference is that it's locations were beautiful. Rome is a beautiful city; the style of the architecture, the relaxed feel of the city is incredible; Tokyo looks cheap and nasty. This is very much an opinion; but Tokyo is a hive of plastic rubbish and is overall a place with a very low quality feel. The town is not beautiful; in Roman Holiday, the location almost took on a life of it's own, and it increased the potency of the film; here all we have is an awful metropolis that offsets the potential beauty of the story. The hosts of the film; the Japanese, were also not portrayed in the best light. Onto the acting, then. Both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson were praised for their performances in this movie, and they both got the essence of their characters right. Bill Murray did, at times, look like he was trying to be funny and never really pulling it off, though. However, I cant give any plaudits for the acting. The characters in the film are, like the rest of the film, subdued, and I'm sorry; but anyone can do subdued. I can mope around looking solemn and bored, and so can anyone else; it's the roles that require charisma and the actor to work that should win the awards; not stuff like this. This is typical awards fodder, however; and I'm afraid it will continue to be like this and I will continue to be baffled by it. But neither Scarlett, nor Bill won the award; and neither Scarlett nor Bill deserved the award. Sofia Coppola can create a picture that's memorable; the shot where a pink wig wearing Scarlett puts her down on Bill's lap sticks out in my memory, as does the scene with Bill on the bed; but when it comes to creating a scene, Sofia doesn't do memorable, I saw this film a little under two hours ago, and I've forgotten bits of it already. This is mostly due to the fact that in it's 95 minute (or so) running time, nothing really happens; and if a movie is forgettable, it cannot be a masterpiece. And forgettable, Lost in Translation is. The scenes tend to lack things which would make them memorable because they're so subdued and they fade into each other; which although this creates fluidity in the scenes, it discredits the movie because nothing really stands out from anything else. Overall, Lost in Translation is not an awful film; it does have its plus points, but it's not a great film either. Lost in Translation is forgettable, it doesn't stand up, in any way, to the Romance genre's true milestones; Casablanca, It Happened One Night, Roman Holiday etc. It left me feeling cold at it's conclusion. And that's not a note that a masterpiece should end on. Lost in Translation is not a boring film, and it does have enough to hold the audience's interest throughout, but once the movies ends and the curtains close, does Lost in Translation really have an impact?",Lost in Translation

But how often do you see Tokyo seen as a mystifying culture as confusing as it is dreamlike? I guess ""Black Rain"", but this is a much more subtle (and unnerving) depiction.

36,JamesHitchcock,Is that It? A comedy without Humour and a Drama without Action,4,3 April 2004,"Contains spoilers`Lost in Translation' is a film about two Americans who meet while on brief visits to Tokyo. Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a famous film star who has gone to Japan to make a whisky commercial. While there, he meets and forms a platonic friendship with Charlotte, the young wife of a photographer, who is staying in the same hotel. Then they return to America and. well, that's it, really.This is clearly a film that has sharply divided public opinion. On one side are the Academy who nominated it for several Oscars, including Best Picture, and all those who have voted it into this site's top 250 films. On that other side are me and my wife (although I see from a number of negative comments that we are not quite alone), who just could not understand what all the hype was about. When the film ended and the final credits started to roll, we looked at one another and asked `Is that it?'
The title `Lost in Translation' would suggest that this is a film about cultural misunderstandings and differences in outlook between different races, but this element in fact played only a small part. Certainly, Harris often seems bewildered by what is going on, particularly in the scene where he is being shouted at by the Japanese director, but it hardly seems a profound insight to point out that if you travel to a foreign country where you don't speak the language, you are going to miss out on a lot of what is being said. The Japanese dialogue is not subtitled, so a Western audience will not understand what is being said any more than Harris does. There are a few picture-postcard shots of Mount Fuji and old temples, but this is not really a film about Japan or about American/Japanese relationships. Sofia Coppola is more interested in the relationship between Harris and Charlotte.
Unfortunately, that relationship is not a very interesting one. Comparisons with `Brief Encounter' are not very illuminating. David Lean's film has always been, in my opinion, something of an overrated classic, but at least it did tell the story of two people's genuine love for each other, even if that love was not expressed sexually. Harris and Charlotte, by comparison, never get as far as falling in love, let alone making love. All we have is the story of a brief friendship between two people bored by their stay in a foreign country. Not only is the relationship uninteresting, the two main characters arouse little interest either. Bill Murray plays Harris as a grumpy middle-aged man suffering from a severe case of culture shock. He seems to wear a permanent expression of morose surprise that Tokyo is not an exact replica of Peoria, Illinois. His only interest in Japan is in the money he will get for his commercial. Rather than take the opportunity to explore a new culture, he simply retreats into himself and clings to a fellow-American like a safety blanket. As for Charlotte, I found her character difficult to believe in. She strikes up a friendship with Harris because she is feeling ignored by her husband, but it seemed unlikely that anyone would ignore a young woman so obviously beautiful and intelligent. Scarlett Johansson's luminous performance in `Girl with a Pearl Earring' came close to perfection, but in `Lost in Translation' she seemed much less assured.The film is sometimes described as a comedy, but there is little humour in it, and what there is is often crude. The scene with the call-girl struck me as being particularly tasteless, and I found it difficult to believe that a film supposedly made for adults was trying to get laughs from the way foreigners speak English. (`Lip my stockings'). Ten-year-olds might still crease themselves at the thought that the Chinese eat `flied lice', but I thought we stopped laughing at Orientals who confused `l' and `r' sounds after leaving primary school.Although I thought that `Return of the King' was a worthy winner of this year's `Best Picture' award, I find it incredible that the Academy rated `Lost in Translation' above such excellent films as `Girl with a Pearl Earring', `Big Fish' or `Cold Mountain'. I found it a slight, inconsequential film, a comedy without humour and a drama without action. I still find myself asking `Is that it?'. 4/10.",Lost in Translation
37,StevePulaski,"The equivalent of cinematic fishing - once you're hooked, the film isn't letting you go",8,29 April 2015,"Lost in Translation details the kind of wayward search for human connection many of us go through in life, sometimes young, sometimes old, or following a traumatic event. It's the time in our lives when we feel the most lost, and truthfully, many of us don't want answers as to how to better our situation, but just want somebody to go along for the ride. We'd like to find someone to empathize with, embrace on a frequent basis, and know that somebody cares about us and our wayward ways and to reciprocate such feelings.With this, Sofia Coppola writes and directs a film about that search for human connection and what it can exactly amount to. We are immediately introduced to Bob Harris (Bill Murray), an older American movie star who travels to Tokyo to film an advertisement for Suntory whiskey. Bob has found himself in the mix of a souring marriage and no real close friends, and it is in Tokyo where Bob sinks deeper and deeper into a midlife crisis. Meanwhile, we also meet Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a college graduate whose husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) is starting to lose interest in her in favor of all the models he works with.Later on, Bob and Charlotte finally meet and immediately recognize each others unfortunate situation. They spend sporadic amounts of time together, often not talking and simply speaking in fragmented sentences and lying next to one another. They aren't very concerned with long conversation; they simply let their lethargy in their current situations carry their relationship along.Over time, sexual tension between the two builds, though both of them are still caught in relationships, regardless of how mediocre they are. In addition, neither of them are quite sure how to conjure intimacy with one another. The two are much more in tune with being static beings and platonic. This is one of the few dramas I can recall that allows the presence of the characters to take over rather than their actions. Coppola sits back and watches with a keen eye and a sense of mannered restraint how Bob and Charlotte get close over the course of their visit in Tokyo.Coppola's interest lies in Bob and Charlotte's situation moreso than the progression of their relationship, which is a difficult thing to pull off in film without working with more of an impressionistic style. The brushstrokes Coppola paints this story in are more or less minimal, but they craft just enough out of a little so that we can recognize these characters, their feelings, and their current state. They have transcended living life into simply existing within it, rarely getting excited and scarcely finding any kind of mutual contentment.Again, in these situations, all you need is another soul who feels the same way you do, and in this case, that's bottled up angst and complete and total uncertainty. The title represents a lot of things and the cultural gap Bob and Charlotte experience is only a small part of it; these two souls are lost within the translation of life. Life has keep going and two formerly active people who could keep up with the bustle have let it all pass by, letting sadness dominate their lives and fogginess encapsulate the remnants of the future. The translation lost is within the characters here, and that's sometimes scarier than not speaking the same language of the community.The only issue that arises from this is that we get the impression that Coppola either doesn't understand Japanese culture or simply doesn't want to, what with the abundance of cheap stereotypes and archetypal Japanese characters played for nothing but laughs here. Coppola opens by ostensibly getting most out of her way, thankfully, however, through the use of subtle humor, but sporadically doubles back to throw in another jab or two, which can briefly throw the film out of whack. It reminds me of when a really artsy film wants to try and pander and connect with the audience when it thinks it has lot them, and, as shown here amidst others, the action has the opposite effect.However, Murray and Johansson craft wonderful, low-key chemistry here. Murray's subtle sarcasm and overall cynicism are downplayed but in force here, as he employs facial expressions that speak louder than words could. He fully shows how he can be a hilarious comic presence and a fascinating, real dramatic presence and merge the two in one project, proving nothing but great range and ability on his behalf. Johansson, who was only eighteen during the time this was being filmed, bears mannerisms and a self-assured aura that would be more expected from someone ten years older than her. Such lofty material is presented and she handles the task of not being too theatrical or obvious very well, and it's a performance that requires both actors to place a reliance on their body language and facial expressions. This was by no means an easy role for Johansson, yet she breaks out with it and becomes a force all her own.Lost in Translation details a difficult time in a person's life and, in the process, doesn't sugarcoat it. The lack of human connection and the feelings of hopelessness, regardless of short-term or long-term, are debilitating to a person, and this film goes on to show to reiterate my idea about life: if we didn't have at least one of these things - a passion, a good relationship with family, or close friends and people to connect with - we would jump out a window.Starring: Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, Giovanna Ribisi, and Anna Faris.

38,=G=,A mirror of nuances,9,3 February 2004,"""Lost in Translation"" is by all accounts a huge film. Telling of a 50-something married man (Murray) and a 20ish married woman (Johansson) - both Americans stuck in a hotel in Tokyo with too much time on their hands - who come together to soothe the yearning they both have for companionship, ""Lost...."" is a sometimes funny, sometimes poignant, and always sensitive look at the importance of being human. Masterfully struck from little more than nuances with slick art and technicals, this Coppola coup will tell you more about who you are than about the two principals. ""Lost in Translation"" will speak most loudly to anyone who has ever experienced the love which could never be. (A)",Lost in Translation

Plus it features one of the screens most underrated actors nice guy Bill Murray and the young beauty Scarlett Johansson adds a nice sugar and spice mix to the tasty picture.Set in Tokyo, Japan it involves Bob Harris(in one of Murray's best and most memorable roles)an actor who's washed up and past his prime as his days of big movie roles have past, now it's whiskey, and wine commercials in the land of the rising sun. And to pass the time away from his wife and kid Bob spends plenty of time bar drinking, until he meets another American and that's Charlotte(Scarlett Johansson in a heartfelt role) a young lady who just graduated college who's still trying to find herself in the big world. Charlotte has made the trip with her photographer husband(Giovanni Ribisi)who's shooting many things all over Japan. And both Bob and Charlotte are restless and unable to sleep only fitting their paths cross one night in the hotel bar.This meeting later becomes friendship as fun and ventures with the citizens of Tokyo are soon discovered, as some of the encounters are touching yet many are memorable and certainly funny. It shows that in life that friendships and encounters are unexpected yet possible with endless possibilities.Overall great film from Sofia it's touching, moving, and it's connected with fun and laughter. It proves it's important to make a friendship connection even if it doesn't involve sex or romance it's still special because it touched a life and most of all it's memorable, because it doesn't matter if it last or not a memory is the most important thing!

40,MovieAddict2016,When Bill Met Scarlett...,10,26 February 2004,"This review has been seriously edited to remain within IMDb's word limit. Please refer to wiredonmovies.com for complete, and much better, review.""I just don't know what I'm supposed to be."" ""You'll figure that out. The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less things upset you.""Dialogue from ""Lost in Translation""When you're young you think you know what you want to be. When you're out of college you suddenly realize that what you wanted to be was an unrealistic fantasy. Then, when you're old and frail, you look back upon your life and see that you wasted everything with worry and ended up becoming something you never wanted to be. You could have been what you wanted to be all along--you were just too scared and naive to realize it. In a way, you were at your smartest when you were young, even though you thought it was the exact opposite when you were older. And now that you're really old, you realize that you're also a lonely old person who wasted their life.I imagine that 50-something Bob Harris looked at 20-something Charlotte and saw a bit of himself in this woman. Their relationship wasn't so much physical as it was subtle and romantic. Their conversation about the future and what it holds is one of the fine points of American cinema. The people who say, ""He's too old for her!"" miss the point. Love knows no bounds. But they're not just feeling love anyway--they identify with each other, something they don't with their current spouses. (""I don't know who I married!"" says Charlotte. She isn't married to Bob Harris but she knows him more than her own husband by the end of the film.) Indeed, the film's true points are lost on many viewers who see it is a film bashing Japan, or a boring character piece, or a stupid metaphor for some larger picture that audiences don't care about. They should. Because a lot of true things about life are in ""Lost in Translation."" The title implies more than it seems to after an initial glance.Sure, it has to do with an older man falling in love with a younger woman, but there relationship is never Hollywoodized. They both know there's a boundary they fear to pass. Look how they stare at each other with hesitation at the closing of each meeting. They want to express their true feelings, but marriage and age are both holding them back.Harris is played by Bill Murray. He's a frustrated, lonely, sad, droopy, middle-aged, washed-out actor visiting Tokyo to promote a brand of Japanese whisky. (""You know Rat Pack?"" his Japanese director asks him. ""Oh, yeah, sure. A ring-a-ding-ding."")Charlotte is played by Scarlett Johansson. She's a young lady who is visiting Tokyo with her husband John (Giovanni Ribisi), who is a photographer and leaves her in a fancy hotel for a few days when he must leave for a photo shoot session.What essentially follows is an unconventional love story in the vein of ""Harold and Maude,"" only more realistic. The two main characters soon find themselves falling for each other, although not at all in the way that you are undoubtedly imagining after reading that sentence. No, the two people in this film--and I call them people because they are more than just characters to any person watching the movie--are too real to fall into the clichéd Hollywood love story rut, where there's a lot of romantic discussion and some passionate interludes. Without spoiling much at all, neither of these characters sleeps with each other. We don't know if they're going to sometimes, but to see such a refreshingly original and realistic love story--where the two people don't fall into a bed caressing each other minutes after meeting--is exciting. It's as if we've returned to the core of all romance films. Finally, no more stupid Hugh Grant rubbish--here's a real love story. Tender, intriguing, interesting, and realistic, powered by two alarmingly convincing performances. (Murray is somewhat himself in this movie, but also adds some more sadness to his character; Johansson, really a 19-year-old actress, is amazingly mature and acceptable.)Many of the characters from ""Lost in Translation"" are supposedly based on true people. For example, Charlotte's husband, John, is based on Sofia Coppola's ex-husband, Spike Jonze (director of ""Being John Malkovich""), who directed Cameron Diaz in that film and, according to her fans, had an affair (somehow I doubt it, but...you never know). Kelly, the ditzy blonde movie star, is allegedly based on Diaz--which has not been confirmed, of course, but just reported in interviews and from fans who ""overheard her talking."" Hmm....We'll never know for sure, but the caricatures are seemingly blatant enough. No translation is needed to separate the facts from fiction.Whether or not Sofia Coppola is just trying to tell a mass audience that she was an abandoned wife is up to speculation. Some may cringe at the way she so blatantly molds her characters after real people. But whatever her purpose was with ""Lost in Translation,"" she has certainly succeeded, creating the best film of the year--more touching than any installment of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" more dramatic than ""Big Fish,"" and funnier than a lot of the crude comedies you're likely to find out there. Here's a movie that refreshes the audience in a way that makes them unsure of what they're feeling. The climax is a sort of loose end, as if Coppola is letting the audience translate what is going to happen to these two characters for themselves. Each to his or her own, I suppose. Either way, we're not supposed to undoubtedly know what is going to happen. And for me, that is quite brilliant.5/5 starsJohn Ulmer",Lost in Translation
41,KineticSeoul,Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson has some good chemistry together,8,22 October 2009,"The premise of this movie was hysterical in a good way, and will find it more hysterical if you are a foreigner cause of the different atmosphere. It's a down to earth story that gets the audience to know the depth of the characters more and relate to. Bill Murray was great in this movie although he played the a similar character he is in a lot of his movies, with his expression of ""what the hell am I doing here?"". I ain't that fond of Scarlett Johansson, but she was amusing to watch in this film and played her role well with just the right amount of emotion. I couldn't help myself but laugh out loud at a lot of the scenes when the characters aren't even trying to be that funny or over the top. Especially at Bill Murray expression when he feels and acts like he is in a place where he don't belong. Although the story only revolves around mostly 2 characters Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, they are just lovable to the point it don't really matter if the other characters are like cardboard. ""Lost in Translation"" is a story about Bob Harris(Bill Murray) who is an American actor that comes to Tokyo in order to do a whiskey commercial to earn 2 million bucks. And while staying there he meets up with Charlotte(Scarlett Johansson) who has a newlywed photographer husband, but isn't sure why she is even married to him. But the chance meeting between Bob and Charlotte affects the lives of both and they start to somewhat bond. The comedy is lighthearted and fun, as Bill Murray plays a confused actor who is also quite sarcastic, but also lonely. Surprisingly I was never bored while watching this film, it really does grabs the audience from beginning to end without anything blowing up. The chemistry between Bob and Charlotte work really well, cause if it didn't the film wouldn't nearly be as good. This was a story that sucks you in from the beginning and ends with a good finale. My complaints was that most of the comedy was Bill Murray acting awkward and confused most of the time, but his sarcasm is hilarious this time around that it's forgivable, including the lack of plot. The title of the movie is ""Lost in Translation"" after all. This is a existential romance movie about two characters that are unhappy and lacks a sense of direction when it comes to their lives. About them meeting and experiencing life together for a week in japan. Although they both come from different backgrounds from one another. One being a old movie star and the other being a recent college graduate. This is a movie about discovering a different culture and discovering parts about themselves. 8.3/10",Lost in Translation
42,sddavis63,Enjoyable And Innocent,7,29 November 2009,"What's most appealing about this movie is the innocence of the relationship between Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). The opening half hour or so of the movie sets the stage well for what's to come. Both Bob and Charlotte are essentially ""fish out of water"" characters. Bob is a movie star who's in Tokyo to shoot some commercials, while Charlotte is a young and recent Philosophy graduate who came to Tokyo with her photographer husband who then leaves her for a photo shoot. They're both lost in this strange, foreign city, and while they share that, they're developed very differently. Bob's story is semi-comic, watching him trying to understand his Japanese director and generally adjust to this bewildering city while at the same time contemplating what seems to be a more and more distant marriage, while Charlotte is more of a sad character, alone and lost and also questioning the direction she's taken and her marriage. Eventually, the two of them meet in the hotel bar and develop a semi-romantic and yet always innocent relationship as they help each other deal with their loneliness.This probably could have been developed as a straight romance. In spite of the obvious age difference, Murray and Johansson worked well together and seemed to share a real chemistry, and yet going the innocent route was the right decision. There was a sweetness and even innocent intimacy to their relationship. The innocent intimacy shone brilliantly in a simple scene where they lie fully clothed beside each other in bed, Johansson curled up in a sort of fetal position and sharing her fears of inadequacy, while Murray merely reaches down and strokes her foot. To me, that summed up what they were about together as they helped each other cope with their plights. I found myself wondering if their relationship was going to move to a physical level, and yet spent most of the movie hoping that it wouldn't because that would have spoiled what made this movie work.Murray and Johansson both offered excellent performances in a movie that is simply enjoyable to watch. 7/10",Lost in Translation
43,thesar-2,Whispering Heights,10,22 August 2010,"I admit, I had just finished a relationship, got fired – sort of and had one helluva time with some emotional/financial moments back in late 2003, so it wasn't too hard to attach myself onto one of the most emotionally charged films of all time: Lost in Translation.Maybe that just opened my eyes and helped me both understand and appreciate the beauty of this masterpiece. It hit all the right moments: from loneliness, to isolation, to comedy, to heart. And all the stars were aligned with the only two actors who could pull off the emotion and the brilliant script as well as direction by Sofia Coppola. The movie's not just centered on washed up actor, Bob Harris (Murray,) but he had to hit every note perfectly. Mission accomplished.Unfortunately for Mr. Murray, he is the owner of the biggest upset in Oscar history. He lost out on his one Oscar chance for Best Actor, as not only was this the best performance of the year, one of the best ever, it was also his best acting in his long-standing career. (Brokeback Mountain losing Best Picture in 2005 was the second worst Oscar upset next to this, probably because due to the ignorant and homophobic voters, it was almost expected.)This is not to take away from Scarlett Johansson. This is where I first noticed here and absolutely fell in love. She was ideal and perfect in her role as well. You felt every bit of her anguish and her character, Charlotte's youth versus Bob's experience. She concluded the circle between them: if things don't change, you'll go from A (Charlotte) to B (Bob.)Bob's been summoned to Tokyo to film a whiskey commercial. He doesn't want to, but he probably doesn't know why he accepted the offer – it doesn't appear he likes to make too many choices. He's just tired. So tired. And we're not talking about insomnia, though, that's on the horizon. In fact, what starts as jet lag ends as a long week of sleeplessness.You know who also can't sleep? The somewhat equally lost Charlotte, who's staying in the same hotel with her new busy, busy husband. She doesn't know why she married him, but she knows she does love him. She is lost, and it's not so much that he's the problem, but he is the target.Eventually the two meet and form a bond that both need, to get through a week-long bit of despair. They are truly lost in translation, and are sincerely spiraling out of focus.During their encounters, or even alone, the script manages to throw in a bunch of comedic moments, mostly from Bill Murray. It's a perfect blend of humor and tragic drama.I know, if something doesn't change in my life soon, I will end up like Bob Harris. I can see that. He's wildly sarcastic, but I don't think he's trying to be mean. He's just tired, bored and he's finding both humor in his surroundings and he's trying to amuse himself, as if he truly is all alone. Some people don't necessarily find me funny, and that never bothers me when I spout out my own brand of humor. 90% of the time, I'm doing it, just like Bob Harris, to simply amuse myself and relieve the boredom of life around me.Some might be put off by the pacing of the film, but I loved it. It gave us every bit of a chance to walk in these people's troubled lives, not to mention the fun they were having – but probably wouldn't admit it. I loved the score, the music – ""Just Like Honey"" by The Jesus & Mary Chain is one of my all time favorites following this and Bill rejuvenated the song ""More than This"" by 10,000 Maniacs (I didn't grow up on the Roxy Music version) for me.Furthermore, the cinematography and landscaping, yes, even in the hotel rooms, was wonderful. I've never been to Japan, but this makes me feel like I have.The lines, like the messages, in the movie are vast and deep. I had to watch it a few times to absorb everything and then more on DVD just to really get into Bob's bantering. The two leads are just beautiful together and they are written so well, that Coppola broke all sorts of clichés and made the movie real.The part all viewers are expecting, including myself, didn't come. I truly believed it had to happen as all these types of movies have that (no I won't mention what that is, but it's not hard to figure out when you're watching it) and honestly, I was so enthralled in the story, so captivated and wrapped in the film, I wouldn't have minded a cliché or two.Instead we are left with a secret. A whisper. And though none of us will find out what was silently passed on, I loved it.This movie is a work of art, through and through. If you have not experienced it, you are hereby ordered to take place in how movies should be made.",Lost in Translation
44,cherold,so-so movie with a good performance by Japan,6,30 September 2003,"First off, I can't figure out why all the reviews I read called this movie a comedy, since it's not very funny and doesn't seem to be trying to be a comedy.  Second, it's just as overrated as Sofia's last movie.  She seems to be one of these mediocre talents who for some incomprehensible reason become critical darlings (i.e. Robert Altman).  The movie is perfectly watchable but is really only notable for its wander-tourist-eye's-view of Japan.  Monks and weird videogames, flashy lights and flower arranging, it's an interesting place, so the movie's not a total loss.  But it's only fair.",Lost in Translation
45,ElMaruecan82,So Far Yet So Close...,9,24 April 2017,"Twelve years ago, I stopped ""Lost in Translation"" right in the middle because nothing ""happened"". Now, I'm married, I have a child and I'm as close in age to Bob (Bill Murray) as to Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), I'm in a position to contemplate the passing of time as deeply as they do and to appreciate Sofia Coppola's bittersweet romance. I guess they call this 'maturity.Using a hackneyed reviewer's observation, this is one of the film where the setting plays like a central character, I've never been to Japan but from what I heard from friends, it's one of these places so remote from the rest of the world that they seem unreachable even when you stepped your feet on it. From the language to the frenetic and culturally engulfing technology that still spared a few peaceful philosophical and cultural remains, a year of immersion would still make you feel like an alien, let alone a ""trip"". And the two central protagonists don't even care for immersion, Bob is here for professional reasons, he's one of these obsolete stars coping with the decline of their fame even if it means selling your soul to some Japanese brand, the awkwardness is a small price when millions are at stakes, and Japan is so far away Many stars like Harrison Ford or Alain Delon indulged themselves to such compromising stunts, with a face that said, ""Drink this whiskey"" but in subtext you could read ""what the hell am I doing?"" This is the unique purpose of Bob Harris' presence in Japan and Bill Murray was the perfect choice to embody the discomfort of this situation.Remember Murray as Phil Connors in ""Groundhog Day"", a weatherman forced to work in some godforsaken yokel place and trying to look professional. Murray is perfect when it comes to say something while thinking the whole opposite, and even a diplomatic smile (confronted to these exaggerated bows) can be an anger directed toward himself, that's the ""wisdom"" built on years of marital repression. This is not a hazard that Harris isn't just some actor questioning his career moves but also in the middle of a life crisis, wondering if this trip wouldn't affect his marriage, as if one couldn't recover from that solitude in the hotel, that the poster magnificently conveys.The hotel setting is perfect for the film because there's this neutral and impersonal touch that can only encourage self-meditation. The contrast also works between the hotel and the tumultuous life of the city while both Bob and Charlotte are busy trying to find a meaning to their life. Charlotte is the perfect counterpart to Bob, she's young, she's beautiful, but she only came because she had recently married a photographer (Giovanni Ribisi) and maybe thought it was a nice opportunity to ""test"" the couple. But her husband is all business, and can't resist flattery from some B-actress (Anna Faris) and dedicate all his time to the calls of the job. If he's not escaping from something, he encourages Charlotte to evade the couple.Never has loneliness been so vivid in a film and as if the style embodied some Japanese Zen philosophy, it takes its time to build the bridge between the two lost souls who find themselves as soul mates as the plot move forwards. But this is not your typical romance, it's not about love, but about two persons who are so disconnected in real life that they find the connection in their similar situation: alone and aliens, and manage to dig deeper in their own existential issues. They're estranged from the world to such a degree that they can't be estranged one another, their similarity is the catalysis of a growing complicity, one everyone who's married yet chatted on the Internet or shared a few confidences with a total stranger, alcohol helping, will understand.The film illustrates a fascinating reality seldom explored in movies: we're never as honest and transparent as with persons who have nothing to do in our life. It's like the language of the soul that can only be understood by the person who'll be able to listen. The film features a funny moment where the ad's director gives indication to the female translator but this works like the typical gag (one used in ""The Great Dictator"") where a long sentence in one hand is translated into a very brief sentence, but once you get what the director said, you realize that Bob was right: ""more was said"". The title ""Lost in Translation"" is a great fit because it's not just a matter of languages.Feelings can be lost in communication due to haziness or habits. One can see more difficult communication between Bob and his wife and Charlotte and her husband than any language issue, and once Bob and Charlotte go to their night escapade, for a brief, enchanted moment, they're finally fishes in water. And it doesn't escalate to a sex scene, the film teases us with many shots of Charlotte's body but the most intimate moment will occur in a tender bed discussion where Bob shares his sincere exhilaration to be a father and delicately holds Charlotte's toe. There's a truth in the film that sometimes, one stranger can be the mirror that reflect the truth about yourself, in such a way you can communicate them, or at least learn how to communicate it. But Sofia Coppola who directed and wrote the screenplay (and won the Oscar) doesn't fill the film with complaisant clichés, and find the perfect note to end, that the final line said in the film, the one that seals the romance in a touching bittersweet way, is unknown to us. We never know what the whisper was, but maybe saying it would have lost its impact, it's like the film applied its own title.And maybe I was too young to enjoy it, something was lost in my own personal translation.",Lost in Translation
46,paul2001sw-1,Brief Encounter,7,8 May 2007,"'Lost in Translation' is almost like a modern version of 'Brief Encounter': two lonely people meet, and fail to have sex. And if the absence of (implied) sex made David lean's film unusual, then 'Lost in Translation' is even more of an oddity, in today's hyper-sexualised world (and especially in the hyper-hyper sexualised world of the movies). But there are some differences: train travel has been replaced by plane travel (although distance from home is a key part of both films), there's a lower key feel (no romantic music) and, most crucially, the element of tragedy is missing. In 'Brief Encounter', the sense was that the two protagonists really should have had a wild affair; in Lost in Translation', by contrast, although they could have had an affair, there's no sense that their lives would actually have been enhanced by doing so: they're world-weary rather than repressed, even at Scarlett Johansson's tender age. And for me, this took the sting out of the story: it was hard to invest anything emotional in the plot, because the plot's self-evident point was that it wasn't going to go anywhere. The connection of the protagonists wasn't even very deep. Perhaps it felt just too like real, every-day modern life to me (except for the wealth and beauty of its characters). I spend a lot of time travelling, some of it lonely, making brief but essentially insignificant connections. I don't expect anyone to make a film about me! Beyond that, the movie takes a few liberties in inaccurately merging the sense of alienation that comes from being abroad with the very different sense of alienation that comes from staying in a five-star hotel; but that's forgivable, and I like the indirect way that the movie depicts their experiences. Bill Murray deadpans his way through the story skillfully but neither of the two lead characters appears to possess any notable qualities, beyond being alone and in Japan.

The result is a feature that meanders around without ever kicking into gear and ultimately feels almost entirely improvised in a way which seems more due to a lack of proper planning than a spontaneous on-set spark. The focus is placed solely on the relationship that forms between the two protagonists but, while this is certainly a believable and relatively compelling connection, it never felt enough to carry the weight of an entire movie especially since it is painted as platonic for most of the run-time until suddenly the pair - who are separated by a large age gap and are both already married to different people - silently decide it is more than that. There's nothing bad about the flick, though. The almost dream like direction and spur-of-the-moment feel combine with the understated performances to make a film that feels subtly realistic. It's just that there's nothing particularity gripping about it, either. 6/10",Lost in Translation
48,dromasca,"Sensible and complex, sometimes boring",8,6 April 2004,"I believe that Sofia Coppola is a real talent - she has a different voice and vision and with time she will hopefully become  the mature and great director that her name deserves. 'Lost in Translation' is a complex story about two characters looking for a change in their lives, almost touching this change, but never really catching the opportunity. The scene is set in Tokyo, the characters are American, and they feel physically jet-lagged and culturally estranged. Although some of the lovers of the japan may find the kitschy rendition of this great culture non-balanced, the film makes the point that the blame lies with the American characters, never eager to explore the different culture, rather attracted to the same 'Western' sub-culture they know from home. I liked the ambiguity of the relationship - life is never clear cut as the Hollywood movies try to make it. I loved the characters, I salute the acting. I do not remember Bill Murray from other movies - I probably need to go back and do some research. And Scarlett Johansson - what? she is not even 20? She acts with sensitivity and maturity, she is beautiful and smart, and I wish her to become the big star she promises to be. Yes, the film is sometimes too long, and the repetition of some of the messages may look boring. But so is life sometimes. It reminds me some of the great films of Michelangelo Antonioni - same alienation, same beauty.

49,gbill-74877,Lost in Transition,9,21 August 2019,"Transitions in life are stressful, and it seems to me that what this film is really about is being 'Lost in Transition.' A middle-aged actor (Bill Murray at 53) is in Japan to do a whiskey commercial against his better judgment to do something more meaningful with his time, when he meets a young woman (Scarlett Johansson at 18) who is recently married to a photographer and involved with the glitzy world of show business. Johansson's character doesn't really know what she wants to do in life with her philosophy degree, and isn't really sure she fits in with the people her husband works with. Murray's is disillusioned with the choices he's made in life, and mostly just wants to score a big payday with the commercial and then get home, at least until he meets her.It's all a little strange with these two people so far apart in age, meeting in a cheesy hotel bar and somehow connecting, as they sense a genuine person on the other end of their initial awkwardness. Being in Japan, jet-lagged, and with all of the quirky cultural things surrounding them adds to the surreal bubble that the two find themselves in, and they know they're like ships passing in the night, both in where they're heading in life, and their ages. I love how director Sofia Coppola used restraint in what they do with their time, in particular, holding back on physical intimacy, and even holding back on letting us hear what he whispers into her ear in a big moment. Not only does it feel incredibly real, but it also heightens the magic they somehow have, and makes it all the more beautiful and tragic.Coppola also gives the viewer some fantastic shots in streets and clubs of Japan, evoking a sense of what it's like to be there as a foreigner. I truly wish she and Murray had not used the 'R' and 'L' crap as much as they did, as it's such an insulting stereotype and an unoriginal cliché besides, so unfortunately there are some bits that are problematic. Aside from that I loved the film because of the great performances from both lead actors, Coppola's direction, and that devastating ending.",Lost in Translation
50,g-bodyl,Overrated!,7,29 December 2012,"Lost in Translation is a pretty good movie but I don't know if I could like it as much as other people do. It's simply that there is not much happening in this movie. I thought it was slow at times despite some heavy, well-meaning dialog. It was also hard to get used to dramatic acting by Bill Murray as I'm used to him being in comedy roles.This film is about how the fates of a washed-up actor and a wife of a photographer were destined to meet while they were in Tokyo.Don't get me wrong here, but I thought Bill Murray was really good as a dramatic actor. He also gave me a few chuckles here or there. The young Scarlett Johansson was also good in her role. There were good supporting nods by Giovanni Ribisi and Anna Faris as well.Overall, this is a good film but overrated to some degree. This film was obviously made by a talented director, Sofia Coppola. But, I wanted more to happen. It just seemed like nothing happens in this movie except people meeting each other and being friends. Maybe I'll have to watch it again to fully appreciate it. I rate this film 7/10.",Lost in Translation

What the audience is exposed to is a slice of informal life of the real Japan and this movie comes across more of a documentary without narrative about two people who find themselves in Japan. Without much of a script in appearance, this slow moving, more evocative feeling sensual movie is more about sensations than about drama or storyline.

53,The-Sarkologist,Two Souls Connecting,10,5 June 2019,"A part of me feels as if this is one of those must see movies, especially with the end scene where Bob whispers something into Charlotte's ear and the only two people in the entire world that know what was said are Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansen, and neither of them are talking (though apparently some techy geeks have managed to find out what was said, which sort of does spoil the magic of the moment). Yeah, this film is actually pretty good, and certainly deserves a place on the mantle piece of cinematic classics (something that not many movies these days come even close to).The story is about two people, Bob Harris and Charlotte, who happened be in Tokyo. To say that neither of them want to actually be there is an understatement. Bob is here because he is being paid two million dollars to appear in some Japanese commercials, while Charlotte is here because her husband is doing some photo shoots. However, Charlotte seems to spend her time puttering around the apartment, and occasionally going out, but quickly becoming bored.It is basically about two people who are lost in an alien world, and yeah, you really can't get any place that is more alien than Tokyo. What is interesting is that in one scene we see the colourful neon lights that make up the city, but from another angle we discovered that this is really only a surface covering of a city that in reality is pretty dull and drab. The views from the upper levels of the hotel really don't show a city that is really all that great.Also, being Japan means that there is something that is, well, lost in translation. Bob struggles to be able to even understand what his employers want him to do, and he is basically counting down the days until he can get away from there. Charlotte, well, she just really seems to be hanging on the tail coats of her husband, not really being able to connect with his friends. Bob also seems to exist in this bubble, where the only reason people actually interact with him is because he happens to be this famous movie star, one whose glory days are long gone (which is probably why Bill Murray was chosen to play the role).It turns out that the only connections that they have in the city is with each other, yet there is also this tension that seems to exist between the two - is there a sexual attraction between them, and is one of them going to make the first move, and if so, who will. Once again, while this tension exists, neither of them is willing to act on it, because, well, there is a problem with the language, and also the age barrier. In fact, it just does not seem right that there would exist anything beyond this - this is what makes the film so good - the tension that exists, and a tension that we know neither can actually act on.Yeah, this is actually a pretty good film, one that is certainly worth watching, especially for that final scene.

54,eddie_baggins,A lightning in a bottle look at love and Tokyo,8,29 January 2020,"The little film that could, Lost in Translation somehow managed to make a friendship/romance between Bill Murray's downtrodden actor Bob Harris and Scarlett Johansson's meandering Charlotte be both believable and lovable, as the two kindred spirits find solace in one another's company against the backdrop of the sights and sounds of one of the world's most vibrant and unique cities, Tokyo.From humble beginnings as a $4 million dollar film, through to a box office worldwide smash and Oscar winning critical darling, Sofia Coppola's considered and heartfelt love letter to the Japanese city and lost souls that can inhabit it holds up today as deeply personal and affectionate drama that would be hard to repeat and features arguably career-high moments for all involved.Following up her well regarded debut The Virgin Suicides, Coppola instills Translation with a sense of wonder, everyday pondering and minuscule, yet wonderful as we witness the birth of a friendship between Harris and Charlotte that comes about through a mutual feeling in each of their lives that something is not quite as it should be, extenuated by the fact the alive, bustling and colorful city of Tokyo has awakened their feelings of loneliness and unhappiness in a life altering moment of time that will see the two's lives changed for ever.The film is lovingly directed by Coppola, there's not a lot of flash or pizazz here, Translation is very much an intimate film but by placing it within the surrounds of Tokyo, every inch of Translation feels alive and filled with moments of gentleness, wonder or whimsy that is memorably played out by its two leads.It could be justifiably argued that Translation features the last truly great Murray performance, with the esteemed comedic actor fitting perfectly into the shoes of the deadpan Harris while Johansson has gone on to feature in some of the era's biggest films, there's a vulnerability and rawness to Charlotte and her performance that hasn't been mined to the same depths since Coppola did here with the two A-listers enjoying their time playing out a script that won Coppola a well-deserved Oscar.One could watch this Oscar winning film and say that not much happens, there's a lot of time dedicated to both Bob and Charlotte wondering around experiencing the sights and sounds of Tokyo or simply stuck in a dive of a hotel bar with bad cover singers, while the two main characters don't even really interact till around 30 minutes into the film but there's a dreamlike quality to what Coppola has done here, allowing us as an audience to be swept away by the otherworldly like nature of the city in which our on paper mismatched duo find themselves in.Come the films emotionally charged and much talked about and debated final segments, you quickly begin to realise that Translation has the powerful ability to grasp the viewer into a daze like state that's meaning and heart become more apparent as you sit and ponder the one-off magic of Coppola's lightning in a bottle film.Final Say -Lost in Translation isn't a perfect film but it's a heartfelt true to life tale that acts as not only a showcase for its director and two leads, but the magical city of Tokyo that represents another world entirely filled with hope, dreams and the potential to find oneself in amongst the flashing neon lights and bustling streetscapes.4 angry barman out of 5",Lost in Translation

We are presented with the situation of two presumably lost souls, searching for meaning in their lives. Bob Harris (Bill Murray), is being paid $2 million to spend a few hours making a Japanese whiskey commercial. Bob--take the money and run.You're never going to play Macbeth. (Neither are you, Bill.) We are also meant to have sympathy for Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). Let's get this straight--you are young, beautiful, intelligent, an Ivy League graduate, staying in a luxury hotel in one of the world's great cities. Why are you sad? Poor thing--you took your degree in Philosophy and it never occurred to you that you'd need a PhD to teach the subject? Your husband is a jerk? (OK--he's a jerk. No one made you study Philosophy, and no one made you marry the jerk, and no one's making you stay with the jerk you married.)My advice to Charlotte--stop with the angst and leave Bill Murray alone. Go home, get a divorce, go back to college, study law, social work, or education. Get a degree, get a job, get a life.My advice to movie buffs--stay away from ""Lost in Translation.""

This film, with constant ramblings about loneliness, the meaning of love and the feeling of being lost (in life, in a city, in a marriage...) is certainly one of those films, unsuitable for those without the proper intellectual and philosophical disposition. Everything revolves around an actor and a young woman who, in the midst of their own frustrations, find themselves in the same hotel in Tokyo. They don't speak Japanese, they don't understand culture and mentality of that people (at the same time, innovative and traditionalist) and, after some talks, they understand that they're feeling the same yearnings for ""something more"", missing in their own lives. Chemistry between both characters is evident, it makes the public think that they will be lovingly involved at any moment, but not. It is an intellectual and sentimental chemistry that does not involve sensuality or romance. The biggest problem of the film is that it does not have much more to offer us and it has a very slow pace, lined by a slow soundtrack, to the taste of the director, Sofia Coppola. This will surely drive away the commercial audience, who usually wants entertainment and not a movie that makes them think.",Lost in Translation
57,howard.schumann,"Contrived, lacking a core of conviction, purpose, or authenticity",7,4 January 2004,"In Sofia Coppola's comedy of cultures Lost in Translation, Bob Harris (Bill Murray), a middle-aged American actor, is in Tokyo to film a whiskey commercial and earn two million dollars in the process. When he is not filming, he watches television in his room, goes to the bar, gets faxes and FedEx packages from his wife but there is little connection either to his family or to the world around him. When he meets recent Yale graduate in philosophy Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), the wife of a distant workaholic photographer (Giovanni Ribisi), the scene is set for romance but the only thing that meets is their minds. Both feel a sense of cultural isolation and there is always the suggestion of an adulterous romance but for a reason that is not explained, neither go there and there is little emotional content to their conversation.Bill Murray is one of my favorite actors and he is in top form, using his trademark dry wit to portray a jaded character but the film never really came alive for me, and I was uncomfortable with the many set pieces poking fun at Japanese language and culture. While we know that the attitudes are part of Harris' mindset, nonetheless the outlandish behavior of talk shows, incompetent translators, over-the-top Japanese masseuse, exaggerated stereotypes, and endless use of ""l"" and ""r"" language confusion only feed the fires of smugness and condescension. The director spent some time in Tokyo and experienced what it felt like to be alone in a foreign culture. While her experience may have been authentic, something has been lost in translation. I found the film to be contrived, lacking a core of conviction, purpose, or authenticity, a sorry contrast to Tsai Ming-liang's films about urban alienation that ring with a truth based on a profound understanding of place and time.Bob and Charlotte have the resources and time to travel, to discover their own humanity and the beauty of the culture they are in. Instead, all they do is go from one party to another desperately looking for fun. Coppola shows us the city's garish entertainment scene, its pachinko parlors, video games, talk shows, and karaoke but does not show anything that is endemic to Japanese culture. What we do see has been reduced to a class in flower arranging, a Buddhist temple, and a ride on the bullet train. In one of the few scenes that was genuinely moving, Bob and Charlotte sing at a karaoke club with Bob mouthing the words to Roxy Music's ""More Than This"". The moment comes alive but there is little more than this. Other scenes show promise but leave the viewer hanging. At the end of a party, Charlotte is wearing a pink wig and lays her head on Bob's shoulder as both stare into space to seemingly no purpose. Another sequence is at a golf course where Harris practices his swing against the background of the magnificent Fuji Mountains but the scene quickly switches to another as soon as he hits the ball.There are hints of a message but no coherent vision. The characters are lost but make no attempt to find each other or themselves, limiting their probing to a nighttime `Where are you from?' conversation that leads only to Bob's placing his hand over her foot. They watch La Dolcé Vita on television suggesting the comparison between the empty pleasures of Tokyo and Rome but no point is made that the artificiality reflects the influence of Western culture. Lost in Translation has some insightful moments as well as some very funny ones. What is sad is that Ms. Coppola misses every opportunity to allow her characters to grow or to experience something deeper about themselves and the world around them, content to display ennui as the only possible outcome.",Lost in Translation

Never before has Tokyo been portrayed as a playground for Western indie antics, but that's what this film is about: two essentially boring but likable characters at different crisis points in their lives finding each other half way around the world. Tokyo isn't celebrated here as much as it's meant to be a flashy gargantuan metaphor for everything Westerners like in their little independent dramas.The film stars Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, two actors clearly representative of an age gap, which adds a nice touch to the film. Murray recognizes he can't play the same parts he used to and continues to portray older men with a dry sense of humor, out-or-work actor Bob Harris here being no exception. Bob is in Tokyo filming a commercial for a Japanese whiskey brand that will earn him $2 million. Johansson plays Charlotte, a young married woman accompanying her photographer husband who isn't sure if she's made the right choice. Both characters are troubled by their predicament in Japan and want out, but that changes when they meet each other.Their unlikely friendship borders on the non-platonic and Coppola wants your formula- drugged Western mind to go there as she plays up the tension: one way of maintaining your interest in an otherwise uneventful film.It's not that ""Lost In Translation"" is boring, it's just subtle in its themes and asks too much of the viewer in terms of how much work must be done to get something meaningful out of it, at least for the bulk of the film. A long wide shot of Murray playing golf by himself with a Japanese mountain in the background has a lot of meaning when you internalize it for a bit, but it doesn't engage the viewer quite like a good dialog. The movie is so quiet sometimes, yet when it speaks it has great things to say -- it just needs to be saying them a bit more.""Lost In Translation"" futzes around indeed, but in its uneventful glory, it comes across as one of the more honest depictions of a relationship, especially of one between two people at such different places on the age continuum. With the exception of a few overtly bland lines too many when trying to get across the monotony of Bob's relationship with his wife, everything feels substantially more real. Murray pulls this off surprisingly well and Johansson, well, she's a gem. Knowing her now as Woody Allen's 21st Century muse, I've no doubt that this performance got her those parts.So Japan just becomes a lost character in a sense, a way to compound the frustrations of a horrifically Western lifestyle with its eccentric citizens and obvious language hurdles. It's not one of the most brilliant inclusions of a setting as a character, but it provides a rich new way to tell a twist on the different age but similar life destinations story.",Lost in Translation

Thus there seem to be two kinds of people: those who love this movie for its ability to tell a story with minimal plot and those who hate it because it's boring and nothing happens.I'm somewhere in the middle. I didn't think that nothing happens, but I actually thought that it lacked something. There are a lot of shots where people just seem to exist side by side, sitting somewhere or lying around on their beds. Sure, those shots are needed, because they relate the feeling of having nothing important to do, one of the key themes of this film, but they're not very interesting to witness. And that's this movie, intellectually interesting and yeah, I can relate to these characters, because I've had days when I've felt like they do throughout this whole film, but the film is a bit boring.So, is it a bad film?

This was billed as a comedy, but this is NOT a comedy. It is more a character study than anything else, and as such, I cannot say it was even well made, despite my understanding of the marketing problems, which occurred.Murray is way off his game here. They say he tried something new and did well at it. I say, regardless of his trying something new, he stunk UP the place, and should have been pulled from this project. I LIKE Murray, but his dialed-in performance did nothing to further endear, and did a lot in the way of putting me off him.There ARE a few elements which make this worth watching. Owen Wilson is great, and comes off more like the Bill Murray that Murray fans grew to love and have become disgruntled with in the past decade or so. Scarlett Johanssen was another element which made this viewable. She is a delight as a neglected newlywed who forms a weird bond with an egocentric aging actor (well, at least the typecasting worked for Murray). Anna Farris is also present, but you only see her for a few moments.All in all? I can not for the LIFE of me understand how this won an Oscar! I was bored, bored, bored. The performances were stilted, the dialog delivery was halting and unconnected, and the overall feeling of the film itself was like something out of the late 1970's, but perhaps that last item was the catalyst int hat Baby Boomers bought into it.

66,jtindahouse,A beautiful film that respects its audience more than most,9,2 June 2020,"I like reviewing older movies because I feel more comfortable doing spoiler reviews for them, and with 'Lost in Translation' that gives me a lot more freedom to talk about the things I need to. Prior to watching this I really felt like I could fall anywhere on the spectrum with this one. I had heard a lot of people over the years say it was boring and unwatchable, while others said it was a masterpiece. Having a very slow and eventless film is a risk, because if the charisma of the characters doesn't come off then you have nothing to fall back on. Luckily for 'Lost in Translation' it worked perfectly. The result is an incredibly unique and beautiful film.I saw someone make quite an insightful observation about the film that I really liked, and so I will borrow it, that Tokyo is almost like a third main character in the film. I've seen a lot of films set in foreign cities, but in this one the fact that they are in Tokyo plays into things big time. It adds immensely to the lonely vibe that the film so expertly creates. It's such an immensely foreign culture that it really feels like it is these two against the world.The thing I love most about the film though is that it can mean different things to different people. The spoiler I wanted to talk about was that in the two lead character's final interaction Bill Murray's character whispers something unheard by the audience into Scarlett Johansson's ear. I love the respect this scene pays to the audience, but I also love that it implies what was said should be different to everyone depending on their view of the film. This isn't a conventional love story, and some could even go as far as to say it isn't a love story at all. Where you fall on the spectrum should determine what you think was said. That instantly became one of my favourite scenes I've ever seen in a film.The people who find this film boring, or uninspired I don't think are missing the point - I simply think they can't relate to it. I believe this is a film for anyone who has ever been lonely, or travelled abroad and felt aggressively homesick, or been in a bad relationship. If you don't get it that is probably a good thing and you should feel blessed in a way. But equally if you can understand the beauty of this film then that is a unique gift all of its own.

67,dfranzen70,Outstanding.,9,25 April 2004,"Lost in Translation is a bittersweet story of two disparate Americans temporarily in Tokyo. Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a has-been actor who's relegated to pitching alcohol in a TV ad; Charlotte (Scarlett Johanson) is the somewhat-neglected wife of a photographer (Giovanni Ribisi) who's in town to do a shoot.Charlotte and Bob are staying at the same hotel, and both are living through the same experience of getting through the day as fish out of water. Living the life of a tourist-American isn't always fun and games, you know. Bob just wants to finish his commercial shoot and then get home, even though the marriage with his stateside wife is devoid of passion, and Scarlett isn't quite sure what she wants. It's not improbable that these two should wind up spending some time together, especially since in Tokyo they stick out like the cliched sore thumbs (especially Murray, who's much taller than any of the Japanese around him at all times). They decide to hang out together, to make the most of the time they have to spend in a foreign land.One of the biggest complaints I've heard about this movie is that it's too slow, but I consider that to be its most engaging characteristic. This is not an action movie. This isn't a smart-alecky comedy with rapid-fire hilarity. In essence, it's a two-character study.A good film for comparison is Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise (1995). In that movie, Jesse (an American) and Celine (a Frenchwoman) meet on a train traveling from Budapest to Vienna, and we witness their relationship gradually ascend from that of slight acquaintances to full-blown amour. Bob and Charlotte's relationship progresses much the same way, but it's even more subtle (believe it or not). Charlotte, the lonely photographer's wife, and Bob, the unwilling participant in a disaffected marriage, find in each other a true kindred spirit.This isn't something easily expressed on screen, and even on the printed page it's difficult to pull off. But the masterful Oscar-winning script by Sofia Coppola (who also directed) is so superb in its attention to detail, along with the perfectly nuanced performances of Johansson and Murray (nominated for an Oscar) are the ideal combination. The audience is utterly convinced that these two characeters are meant for each other, at least on some level.Not one note of this movie rang falsely for me, but it is not for everyone. Don't let the multiple Oscar nominations sway you - if you do not like quiet, subtle movies, you probably won't like Lost in Translation. For the rest of you, it's a true gem.",Lost in Translation

Miss Coppola transmits this information to us almost before we know it,whilst we are being distracted by the garish aspect of the city itself which becomes the third character if you like,a vital component in the movie and the catalyst that slowly but inexorably brings Miss Johansson and Mr Murray together.He is superficially pleasant enough to encourage strangers to talk to him in a bar but withdraws very quickly.When Miss Johansson walks over to him he is willing to endure a two minute encounter but not much more.As their paths cross by accident or design in the claustrophobic world of the hotel they become more aware of each other's situation.Tentatively,very tentatively,they begin to reach out to one another. They are refugees from ""The City"" both as in Tokyo itself and the ""city"" as in the values system as exemplified by the culture that encourages a young man to make a living sucking up to rock stars and photographing them and an old man to make $2000,OOO by drinking iced tea and pretending it's whisky.They are companions in disenchantment and alienation. They hang out and just talk together about anything and everything,trivial or important,impersonal or intimate.It soon becomes clear that by movie conventions they should fall in love or at least have sex together,but Murray knows more than Johansson that what they have is too precious to risk.He is not averse to extra - marital sex as he demonstrates by sleeping with a bar singer,but he is wise enough to know the difference between sex and love. In the end of course they have to part,which they do stiltedly and formally at the hotel as he gets a taxi to the airport.On the journey through the city he spots a blonde head in the crowd and orders the driver to stop.As he follows the girl you begin to wonder whether Miss Coppola will use the movie cliché and have her turn around and be someone else,but no,she's too honest for that .They hold each other and kiss for the first and last time.Words pass between them but are lost in the sound of the traffic,perhaps a last comment on how big city life has suborned all human feeling and that human beings themselves have become merely a small and not particularly important part of a great noisy,overcrowded corrupt and corrupting inferno.",Lost in Translation
69,ackstasis,"""Let's never come here again because it will never be as much fun.""",8,30 July 2007,"'Lost in Translation' is a story of feeling lonely in a megacity of 12 million people. Tokyo, Japan is a city constantly on the move, never stopping to rest and always abuzz with flashing lights, loud music and happy and frivolous inhabitants. However, both over-the-hill actor Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and photographer's wife Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) find themselves in the midst of this frenetic chaos, and yet they both harbour that empty feeling of boredom and purposelessness. It is only via an intimate  though entirely platonic  relationship that the two trapped beings are able to discover a certain level of satisfaction, and to carry on their lives with an air of meaning.The film was directed by Sofia Coppola, daughter of acclaimed director Francis Ford Coppola ('The Godfather' trilogy, 'Apocalypse Now'), who is fast becoming a respected cinematic figure in her own right. 'Lost in Translation' has a very distinctive film-making style, courtesy of Coppola's intelligent, thoughtful screenplay and Lance Acord's hand-held cinematography. The camera does exceedingly well in capturing the lights and colours of a hectic Tokyo, creating the impression of a city that is very much alive, and yet strangely isolated from the viewer, as if in a dream. This follows very well with the general theme of the film, as the two main protagonists struggle to fit into a confusing and unfamiliar foreign environment. One scene highlights this alienation hilariously well, as an exasperated Bob Harris (Murray) takes instruction from a Japanese director about the filming of an advertisement for Suntory whisky. As the director spouts off a long series of commands in his native tongue, the translator returns with a single very brief instruction, to which a confused Harris declares, ""Is that everything? It seemed like he said quite a bit more than that.""When it comes to deadpan humour, Bill Murray does it better than anybody since Buster Keaton. Here, he uses his talents to great effect, conveying in very few words his character's feeling of being completely and utterly lost. Amid a very strained relationship with his resentful wife, Harris feels that his career has long since fallen to pieces, and he begrudges the fact that he has resorted to foreign celebrity advertising to make a living. 'Lost in Translation' also secured the career of a budding young actress in Scarlett Johansson, whose Charlotte is often left alone and forgotten whenever her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi) has work to do. The relationship that the two adults develop, despite the significant age difference, is never anything less than completely believable. Perhaps surprisingly, given its modest budget of $4 million, 'Lost in Translation' proved a convincing commercial success, and did very well at the 2004 Academy Awards, winning the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, in addition to nominations for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Murray), Best Director and Best Picture.",Lost in Translation

Director Coppola's masterpiece piece will receive great fortune cookies, I mean fortunes, come this award season. Bill Murray stars as Bob Harris, an aging American actor who travels to Japan to endorse a whiskey. This whiskey business is very lucrative for Bob not to pass up even though he must travel zillions of miles to appear in tv commercials & print ads in promoting the liquor. Scarlett Johansson co-stars as the beautiful Charlotte, a newlywed who accompanies her photographer husband on a business trip. ""Lost in Translation"" fixates on Bob & Charlotte's relationship in glorious, but yet, isolated Tokyo. They are lonely souls finding compatibility in an incompatible society. The upper echelon scenes of ""Lost in Translation"" are set in a hotel cocktail lounge & a karaoke watering hole. Murray's karaoke rendition of Roxy Music's ""More Than This"" is remarkable, and more than I expected. Young Coppola's chic direction glamorizes not only the city of Tokyo but also our 2 solitary protagonists. Sofia, daughter of legendary Director Francis Ford Coppola, is clearly on her way in being hailed as the ""godmother of young female directors"". I am sure that she will be offered remunerative monetary projects that she won't refuse. Scarlett Johansson was near perfect as Charlotte. Hopefully, her dexterous work will not be forgotten and be ""gone like the wind"" during award season. Frankly my dear Scarlett, I will give a damn if you are not recognized. ""What about Bob?"" You ask. Simply stated, Bill Murray as Bob delivers the best performance of his celebrated career. ""Lost in Translation"" es una de las peores peliculas de esta temporada. Hey! What happened?

The entire film takes place in an hotel. This is just fine but by showing some shots of a Tokyo skyscraper hotel heaven only knows what Ms. Coppola wished to convey. May be she wanted to depict that as people live in high buildings their feelings,emotions become low. A word about the bewildered American in Japan oh no Tokyo. Bill Murray looks utterly lost as if he has not been paid his salary for playing the part in the film. Scarlett is fine but she could have done better. The worst thing about this film is that Japanese people were caricatured. It is as if all the Japanese people use very long sentences even for expressing simplest of ideas.

There he meets Charlotte, the bored wife of a photographer on assignment ( Scarlett Johanssen ) and the two spend of the rest of the picture alternating goofing on the Japanese and treading lightly around intimate feeling. Writer, director Sophia Coppola infuses Translation's melancholy bent with some striking imagery, energized editing and carefree nature as the two leads contend with Tokyo neon and culture in basically an action-less film where confusion and monotony is the catalyst. The late night bar scenes at the hotel create an ideal atmosphere for quiet desperation and tempered by Murray's craggy face dead panning evokes Antonionni with a sense of humor. The simmering sexual tension between the two begins to wear thin after awhile though and Coppola's compromising positions and pregnant pauses begin to repeat and fail to move the story forward. The open ended climax informed by an inflated music score and a step up in the emotion department simply fails to register or live up to the film's first hour and Lost just wanders to its mottled conclusion.",Lost in Translation
73,Chris_Docker,There's more than one way to find yourself . . .,9,20 January 2004,"There's more than one way to find oneself', but many of them involve taking oneself away from the slipstream of daily life, the never-ending succession of familiar things, faces, events and corresponding thoughts  the sum total of which we often, for shorthand, think of as our life'.Crossing the desert alone, quite literally, or spending hours in meditation, are two ways of going to a place where one becomes intensely aware of one's own limitations, one's own self.' Another is immersing oneself in a traumatically alien culture.This is exactly what director Sofia Coppola's characters do in Lost in Translation  although hardly with that intention.Bob (Bill Murray) is a film star who has been paid a huge sum to go to Japan to endorse a whisky. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is a young philosophy graduate who is accompanying her photographer husband. Both are fish out water, isolated by their own sincerity and the barely intelligible culture gap, and trying to make sense of their lives.The film is adept at avoiding clichés. Much is left unsaid. The inner struggles of the characters are portrayed more in what they don't do/say than what they do do/say (although some suitably deep ideas penetrate the silences and underline the substance of what is going on). Moreover this is a rare glimpse of modern day Japan  from the high-tech intensity of Tokyo to the more tranquil beauty of Kyoto. Instead of being thrown into a mythical past or mad kung-fu scenes, we are confronted with the incomprehensibility of institutionalised karaoke, picture menus in restaurants that convey little about the food (often the photos are photos not of the food but of plastic mock-ups of the food), hectic TV that seems almost a caricature of itself, vigorous but ill-informed attempts at Western politeness, and very wordy sentences that somehow get condensed into a single phrase when translated'.The characters reactions to all this are very much like my own were on my two or three trips to Japan. In spite of its attempts to learn western ways, it is one of the most culturally isolated countries in the world. If anything, the alienness of Japanese life is toned down in the film, not exaggerated. After a while, you just feel like crying out for something, anything, that is vaguely western, vaguely recognisable.This incongruous setting is the backdrop for a moving tale of a sensitive friendship between two strangers. Nothing is polished up to make it more entertaining: the realism of the engaging characters, who come to realise that less in their lives can be more, makes it a major cinematic achievement. It is not mainstream, but many audiences will be deeply moved, and rightly so.",Lost in Translation
74,jimbo-53-186511,"Some decent moments, but I fail to see what a lot of the fuss is about",5,1 August 2017,"Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a faded movie star who is in Japan promoting whiskey - he is just about recognisable enough to gain this endorsement. He has a troubled home-life with a wife who seems to both harass and undermine him constantly. Staying in the same hotel is Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a young married woman who is in Japan with her photographer husband John (Giovanni Ribisi). Charlotte feels neglected and unloved and when her husband goes away for a few days she spends a lot of her time with Bob and it turns out that they both aren't so different...Many of the problems with this film are confined to the first half of the film where proceedings are drawn out painfully slowly; clearly this approach has been employed as a way of developing Bob and Charlotte as people and to show their own personal struggles, but to be perfectly honest I didn't find either of their characters or individual story arcs to be all that interesting. The second half of the film is much better when Bob and Charlotte begin communicating with each other and hanging out together - there is a genuine warm bond between the pair and it is quite touching watching them on screen together; I could genuinely see that there was some chemistry there and I felt that there was an attraction between them in an unconventional sense.Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray were both good here and their wonderful and natural chemistry together does go a long way in making many of the scenes where they appear together to be rather enjoyable.One thing I will applaud Coppola on is that she does do a good job in developing Bob and Charlotte's friendship and rather than cheapening the film by showing the pair lusting after each other we're given reasons to believe why they may be drawn to each other. I think their similar personality traits are what draw them to one another more than anything else which does make their relationship slightly more involving.Lost in Translation unevenness is what lets it down slightly and whilst it undeniably has its strengths and moments some of the dull spots it encounters here and there prevent it from being as great as all of the hype suggests it is.",Lost in Translation
75,MissSimonetta,Great film about the modern condition,10,27 February 2016,"After falling in love with Sofia Coppola's stylized character study Marie Antoinette (2006), I was hungry for more of her films. I admit I found The Bling Ring (2013) disappointing, but Lost in Translation (2003) was as amazing as I had been led to believe. Few contemporary films so acutely depict modern alienation as this little romantic drama.Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are the unlikely friends who find themselves at a crossroads in their lives. Murray's washed up movie star has hit a midlife crisis and a low point in his strained marriage; Johansson is fresh out of college, unsure about where to go from there, and to top it all off unhappily married. Coppola throws the two lonely Americans into 21st century Tokyo, turning the city into a modern Wonderland of electric lights and fleeting pleasures in the forms of arcades and night clubs. Disconnected from themselves and unable to understand Japanese, Murray and Johansson find their alienation made manifest and cling to one another for solace. A few scenes focus on Buddhist priests and the natural beauty of Japan, denoting an elegiac longing for an older world, but as the melancholy ending shows, there is slight chance for escape, though it is left ambiguous as to whether or not the characters will ever be able to find peace. We leave them at the crossroads, unsure of which road they will take.About the only flaw this film has is the occasionally troublesome depiction of the Japanese characters. I can see where some critics were coming from when they called LIT a spectacle of Otherness for westerners. Aside from this problematic element, the film really is a masterpiece, Coppola's best to date, though I would argue Marie Antoinette is really close.",Lost in Translation
76,Cristi_Ciopron,"Murray's tour De force, and the delightful aftertaste",9,14 May 2008,"The famous Romanian director Tocilescu said that LIT is a movie that you can be in love withas with a girland also that it's one of his top favorite movies.Indeed,one of the first things that can be said about LIT is that it's a movie to be enjoyed, savored, delighted in, cherished, it leaves a delicious aftertaste. The few different fine things do add up to a coherent and homogeneous whole. It probes the things that deserve to be probed.I greatly appreciated and liked the lead's performanceyet much less the (intensely dis-likable) girl (Scarlett Johansson) that he's teamed up with.Teachout pointed to this category of actors whose excellent _expressivity is accompanied by a certain narrowness; i.e., they are very fit for a certain type of rolesthey are _prespecialized, like Spacey and Murray. Today these remarks about the congruency of a cast might be displeasing for the fanmentalities. Yet there are such actors who,unable to prove their universality,do shine in certain classes of rolesSpacey and Murray are like this. Lost in Translation is a movie to savor;the taste it leaves is relevant. Or,to put it so:Murray's role here has a giant humane relevance, it is humanly relevant (--while Spacey's role in A. Beauty was a tour De force, esteemed as suchyet humanly irrelevantsheer antics ).Brando was perhaps the only actor who was humanely relevant while being totally clownish; all the rest have to choose.I think that Murray's role here can be compared with that of Spacey that I have indicatedand that Murray's superiority, artful intelligence are patent. Murray's role is as a matter of fact an European role,of a Gabinian conception. Understated and very sharp. (And not by the fake sharpness of Spacey in A. Beauty.)Murray's role could be one of the notable roles in the artistically significant cinema.Mutatis _mutandis, Lost in Translation is a masterful demonstration of what something like,say,American Beauty should have beenor should of looked like. The unobtrusiveness of the style is all the more _praisable.More exactly, this is how a theme and a subject like A. Beauty's should of been treated, approached. And maybe this is the main point hereone of the two main pointsthe pertinence and sense of the approach. (The other being Murray's role,which was not a difficult oneyet it required finding quickly that right note and key to it .) In a word,I enjoyed the movie,highly rated Murray's role,and do praise the aftertaste. Tocilescu put it exactly--Lost in Translation is not Fellini (as it is not Welles, Antonioni, Visconti, Bresson,etc.);yet,it's truly and intensely enjoyable.Good movie,more such films would be welcomed;it is psychologically tactful and lucid,it finds the naturalness that most of the comments about this film simply loose or ignore or distort .It firmly handles the subject,it perspicaciously explores its content. (In literature,this would be Maugham, Maurois, France, AC Doyle,Cronin,Barring,A. Daudet it's not l'Isle Adam, Tournier,Wells,Rabelais,Jarry ,but it ain't cheap fun, eitherit's a thing of savorgood already classic stuff.) One more thingit is said that the kiss at the end was not in the script,and that this was added to the primal script. I would have liked it better without this stuff, anyway.As for Murray's roleeverybody liked itTeachout, myself, my boss in the hematology clinic, and Ebert and ""many accounts"".",Lost in Translation

Once again, we seem to be suffering from a case of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"".   Do we need an innocent bystander to come by and tell us that we are really witnessing plenty of thin air?Ms. Coppola's ""Virgin Suicides"" was rich and involving, with enough tension and conflict to drive its entire length.  In ""Lost"" I remained lost for the entire movie, as at first I couldn't even see the action.  To this day I can't understand why many people confuse style with underexposure.  There are many beautiful films where natural lighting serves a purpose. In ""Lost"" the only thing I might get out of this poorly lit film is a new eye-prescription.  Is there a shortage of electricity in Tokyo?  Are they rationing power after midnight?  Is there a reason why the film looks so murky and blurry??? even in the daytime.  Maybe it's supposed to be a metaphor for the state of their souls, but in my opinion they would have made a better point if we could at least see their facial expressions while the main characters suffered.Not all is lost in the movie, and the leads do what they can with the material, but it's hard to sympathize with such a minimal exchange.  How in the world can anyone relate to another person with the exchange of less than a dozen words?  It is more puzzling when there is such an age difference! There have been other films when two the leads' age difference is overcome by better direction and a more solid script.  In here, we are asked to fill in too many holes and assume too much.  Bill Murray mopes around, so he's lonely.  Scarlett is abandoned by her boyfriend, and she's in need of male companionship.  Where's the background?  Where's the story?  Where's the character development?Overall, I was so utterly shocked by what I saw that the people that came along with me, were even more shocked because they couldn't believe I didn't say ""It sucks!"" when the film ended.  I didn't have because they already knew it, and apparently most of the audience in the theater were still in stupor as they slowly filed out of the auditorium, with no audible comments.I would like to know if there was another print shown at the critics' screenings because I am sure the reviews we're reading most be addressing a masterpiece, but that film is missing, somewhere in the murky presentation, lost in its own translation.Read the book.

In the hotel where he is staying he meets Charlotte (Johansson). She is unhappy and alone because her husband is out working (?) all the time. In their combined unhappiness they enjoy each others company and some sort of relationship starts to form as they hang out in the Japanese night-life. There, I'm sorry, is the complete movie, as I see it. Nothing really happens and everybody just seem to be more or less unhappy. And soon I really lost interest in the movie.In addition to the poor story, there was some very peculiar editing. The movie runs at only 102 minutes (fortunately), which I reckon might be considered rather short. Still the movie contains a lot of small scenes that is completely pointless, which was either cut short or should be cut out entirely. There is no real (as I see it) development in either character, and interesting potential conflicts, issues and characters that appear throughout the movie simply disappear, never mentioned again to make absolutely sure nothing ever happens.I cannot see why this is praised, I found it very dull, but that was the whole point, heh?3/10",Lost in Translation

Here is a movie that is intelligent enough to avoid the clichés in a story. In a lesser movie certain things would have happened, but not in this movie.Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is an American actor who is in Tokyo to shoot a commercial for a brand of whiskey. He is in his fifties and seems almost bored with life. He speaks his wife on the phone but she hardly listens to him. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is in the same hotel with her husband John (Giovanni Ribisi). He is a photographer and has to leave for a couple of days. It is clearly he thinks his wife is only in the way. She is in her early twenties.Bob and Charlotte meet and from that moment they spend most of their time together. They wonder through the city of Tokyo, they go to parties, they sit at the bar in the hotel. Every moment between Murray and Johansson is perfect and the last moment they share together is one of the most beautiful moments I have seen in a movie. Although many people have mentioned that moment I will not spoil it if you don't know it yet.Although the movie doesn't sound anything like a comedy, it definitely is. Murray in his best performance, the best of this year as well (although Sean Penn in 'Mystic River' comes very close), stays in character every single moment. There are moments he could become Bill Murray and try to create the funny moments, but he stays Bob Harris the entire time and the comedy comes with that. Scarlett Johansson is almost as good and it is a shame she wasn't nominated for an Oscar (for this movie or 'Girl with a Pearl Earring').Director Sofia Coppola has given us a wonderful movie which I loved in every single way, from the opening shot that makes sure it has our attention until the last final moments between Murray and Johansson.

Bill Murray, a washed-up actor now, is visiting Japan to film a few commercials on a Whiskey brand with a nagging wife absent physically but very much present through her flustered calls, faxes and FedEx deliveries. Scarlett Johansson, on the other hand, is a fairly recent university graduate and also a relatively recent newlywed to a photographer husband on an assignment who seems to be away a lot and not really present for her mentally, leaving her miserable and lost.It is a humanistic portrayal of how two strangers meet. Sofia Coppola directs and writes this downbeat, subtle, short-lived romance between two lost souls who meet in a foreign land dealing with it's culture and language differences and share their mutual feelings of feeling abandonment and loneliness.

The other nay votes do have a point: this movie shows one too many scenes of cultural isolation / modern ambivalence. On the other hand it's just like life in it's lack of overall momentum and it's quieter moments. It's really free from Hollywoods dirty fingerprints, which makes it remarkable for a second film. The score and the sentiments are gentle, which is why a young audience can't make heads or tails of it. Gentleness has no place in American culture anymore: It couldn't be sold to anyone for a profit.There are too few films made about friendship. Unfortunately while Scarlett Johanssen looks lovely and Bill Murray is a national treasure, this movie stays in the average pile. The movie seems chronically underwritten. The script says something about being adrift in various ways. It just doesn't say it very rapidly.I used to think that people like Murray used humor to bring people closer, but now I realize it's way of keeping people at bay by never letting them see even a hint of who he really is. I begin to wonder if this is Murray's problem, an observation he brougt to the character or both.

I saw a few movies using this kind of mood, but they mainly use it with a US city backdrop setting such as New York or Chicago. I like how this movie always comes back to this mood depiction even after all those scenes that indicated a climb in the mood. The coloration also helped much in bringing this mood at the fore. But all in all, the story feels very much flat. There's no real change in the characters or their relationships, particularly as they end the movie just the way as they started it. It made some characters felt like they're only there as mannequins to complete the story angles. The acting overall is good.

Not that I am crazy about her acting abilities, but although she was resourceful, Sofia was treated so viciously by viewers and by most mainstream critics, that she must be laughing out loud now that she knows better, especially with the reactions to her second movie. People have loved this film, but in my case I think it's a fine movie that's overrated. Sometimes it's just plain blank, with a couple of sequences and many single shots that could have been left out of the final cut. It is a joy to watch Bill Murray in an excellent performance, and seeing Scarlett Johansson grow from the days of ""Eight Legged Freaks"", but after a while the Japanese jokes become tired and the emotions between their characters become redundant. It may be new to those who have never even considered the possibility of establishing a relationship like the one described here, of friendship between a man and a woman and an older man and a young woman-, but not to those who have always respected the opposite sex on the same level and as their complement. It could have been a better film with 20 minutes less.",Lost in Translation
89,gazzo-2,"Slowish, decent movie but not a classic....",7,12 January 2005,"......am always happy to see that Bill Murray is back to being in the headlines for his movies and etc--what, the last time before this was 'Groundhogs Day' in '93? That's a while back. Here he plays Serious Bill, essentially the same thing he tried in '84 w/ Razor's Edge and Theresa Russell. That time it didn't come off too well, some were saying he was too young to be having a midlife crisis.Well, at 52 or so, he sure is at that stage, and here brings it off quite well. I also enjoyed watching Scarlet, she seemed to be so lost in the big Foreign City, and feeling trapped. I bought that-her performance was pretty good though I kept on thinking 'Kirsten Dunst' whenever she squinted to the left as she does.Fun Cameron Diaz sendup by the 'Scary Movie' chick here--nails the typical airheaded starlet quite well. Good scenery though it's true the 'Stranger in a Strange Land' bit has been quite done to death by now.I had a feeling at times--the party, the nightclubs, etc--that I was watching a pseudo-late 60's flick, it was slow, too long, chaotic and semi-random in places. I wanted to see them DO something besides shuffle around Tokyo and tearfully part too, her wearing his coat, etc. But that's me, I guess.Anyways that's my take on this. It's decent but hardly the classic Oscar bait flick we kept on hearing about a year ago.*** outta ****",Lost in Translation
90,Movie-ManDan,"Overrated, But Still A Good Movie.",7,11 March 2021,"I totally understand the appeal this movie gets. What I don't get is people calling this one of the year's best and one of the best ever. In no way does this movie push the envelope for what cinema can do and in no way does this elicit extremely strong effects on the viewer. The effects on the viewer are normal, but nothing huge.Francis Ford Coppola's daughter, Sofia, already made a name for herself as a director with the highly impressive ""The Virgin Suicides"" in 1999. Four years later, she makes her most decorated film-a movie that isn't really about anything, other than exploring loneliness.Bill Murray shines in arguably his best performance (this is his most serious) as famous actor, Bob Harris. Tired and bored, Bob spends a few weeks in Tokyo doing a commercial. We get to know Bob pretty well.Bob soon meets young Charlotte, played by Scarlett Johansson. A recent college grad, she is in Tokyo with her husband (Giovanni Ribisi) who is a photographer for a band touring the area. He is always with his clients, leaving her lonely too.Bob and Charlotte's relationship is completely platonic. A blossoming romance would have been too awkward since they are really far apart in age. But a normal friendship is a good change of pace between a man and a woman.Bob and Charlotte doing various activities together that are mildly interesting. Alone, what they do is also mildly interesting. (There is a scene with Bob and some Japanese woman pretending to be raped by him that is one of the most random scenes in film history).One thing that this movie really has going for it is the lovely Tokyo setting. It is almost as if Coppola tries to make this avant-garde, making the setting a character that reflects Bob and Charlotte. If that's what she tried to do, she didn't do that good of a job. The bright lights are nice to look at, but that's it.While we get to know Bob and Charlotte well, the movie goes nowhere. It is just a series of random events that make these two lost souls feel less lonely. That actually sounds nice, but the way Coppola conveys it is decent but not amazing.Truth is, there is nothing amazing about this. The two leads are impressive, the look is nice, and that's it. Everything else is much too mild to spew over.3/4",Lost in Translation
91,rosscinema,This film translates extremely well,8,2 November 2003,"This is the second film directed by Sofia Coppola and she has proved  to be a director of enormous skill and passion. Story is about a famous American actor named Bob Harris (Bill Murray) who has come to Tokyo, Japan to make a whiskey commercial for a lot of money but he hates himself for it. He is staying at a posh Japanese hotel and having a difficult time getting any sleep because of the jetlag. His wife from home sends him carpet samples Fed-Ex and when they speak on the telephone they skirt the issues of their marriage woes. Also staying at the hotel is Charlotte (Scarlet Johansson) who is married to John (Giovanni Ribisi) and he's a photographer on assignment. Charlotte has come with him to Tokyo but he leaves for extended amounts of time and Charlotte has nothing to do but ponder the troubles in her two year old marriage. Charlotte and Bob bump into one another from time to time and even share a drink but finally Charlotte asks him if he wants to go out someplace else besides the hotel bar. He agrees and they go to meet some friends of hers and they hang out at karaoke bars and finally seem to be comfortable. For the next few days they share meals and watch television and even fall asleep but they don't get intimate though, they're relationship is more about companionship and being comfortable with each other while they both discuss they're marriage woes. Sofia Coppola's first film was the dreamlike ""The Virgin Suicides"" and in that effort she created some incredible atmosphere which she does here to some extent also. Both films have a slow and deliberate pace and while some may find that to be a glaring fault I thought otherwise. This is a film about two lonely people in a foreign city that have found each other and together they seem to function better by being able to talk to one another since neither can communicate well with they're spouse. The film is enhanced tremendously by the two performances of Murray and Johansson. Murray has slowly developed into a very good actor and his maturity was evident in the comedy ""Rushmore"" which was also a very good performance. Coppola likes to have the camera linger on her characters and this allows a natural performer like Murray to excel and in those scenes where the camera stays on him we get those trademark ""Murray-isms"". This may be his defining performance that people will always point at but I have a feeling that we'll be seeing other terrific performances from him in the future. This also is a breakthrough role for Johansson who has been solid in smaller roles in her career. As good as she was in ""Ghost World"" this is her biggest role to date and she's up to the task. She displays both maturity and poise in a role that could have been played in a one note effort but she shows more layers to Charlotte than we would expect. Its a solid performance that should open a lot of eyes from people who are not familiar with her. I'm not convinced that this is a great film and one of the reasons is that with Coppola's style of filming it at times leaves the characters emotionally distant and its hard to embrace these characters at times. But this is a minor gripe because this is a very good film with two exceptional performances. Coppola has once again directed a film with a very unique visual style and she really has emerged as one of the more interesting directors.",Lost in Translation
92,nycritic,Lovely and Nuanced.,9,23 April 2005,"I have not seen Sofia Coppola's first film THE VIRGIN SUICIDES as of this posting but I can tell that from her exquisite direction on this, her second film, she has delivered something truly delicate and rare like a mini-rose. LOST IN TRANSLATION is a wonderful, absolutely beautiful movie. There isn't a false note in this contained story in which two people with a marked age difference meet in an extremely foreign country and slowly discover their feelings for each other. Scarlett Johansson delivers a performance made more haunting and touching due to the simplicity in which she plays Charlotte who is going through an odd time in her life: married to John (Giovanni Ribisi), who may be having an affair with Kelly (Anna Faris), she feels displaced and alone in her hotel, and that is an emotion that can really hit someone, especially when so far away from home and familiar surroundings. Bill Murray's Bob Harris is an actor who is also going through his own baggage and who, in meeting Charlotte, has found a connection. His own performance is very restrained, very delicate, a man who has lived a lot who is intrigued by this young woman. Much in the style of stories by Marguerite Duras or French New Wave, or Michaelangelo Antonioni, there is a lot of subtext and implicit eroticism in the simplicity of Bob and Charlotte's affair in LOST IN TRANSLATION which comes through in its reflective but not intrusive nature, and this elevates their love story to one which will stay with the viewer long after the resolution has come and Bob has told Charlotte those last words that we are not meant to hear. After all -- it is their private moment.",Lost in Translation
93,Easygoer10,Sofia Coppola's First,9,14 April 2019,"I remember seeing Ms. Coppola in Godfather 3, opening night. I was living in NY City (Soho) in a tiny flat; 4th floor walkup. I thought she was poorly cast (not her fault; her father's). Regardless, she has a terrific eye, which is a valuable tool, for her job. This film, which I did not see until years it's release, totally blew me away with it's overall vision. When you consider this was made on the tiniest of a budget, with a very small cast and crew; plus it is all shot on location in Tokyo (and surrounding areas), and stars Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray: This is quite a feat. Of course, the actors, which also include Giovanni Ribisi, who is very good at playing a workaholic photographer married to Ms. Johansson's character (woefully oblivious to the needs of his brilliant and beautiful wife). I know Ms. Coppola is helped by people who know her father. By this, I mean it must help her in the choices made for her crew and casting. That noted, I don't care who her father is or isn't; she is extremely talented as a director, which is proven by this film especially (her first, no less), and her subsequent work. Looking at the money only, I noticed the budget was only $4 million, but the worldwide gross is well over $100 million. That is a tremendous success financially. This is great, but from my standpoint as a seriou film fan, (and I'm sure hers, as well), she has made a remarkably good film that anyone would be proud of-I surely am. Having met Bill Murray, (a co. I owned in NY City worked for him in 1990), I can tell you he is a truly authentic actor: What you see on the screen is pretty much what you see if you talk with him for a couple of hours. He is a hilarious and charming person; no pretension at all. I know how good Bill Murray is. Scarlett Johansson truly stunned me, considering she was only 17 years old when this film was made, and, first realeased. It is a special, one of a kind film; a must see.",Lost in Translation

He is a photographer and had some work opportunities in the Kimono land, but he doesn't have time to spend with Charlotte since he is so busy working. Bob Harris(Bill Murray) is a famous actor who came alone to Japan to make whisky commercials. Even having so many people around him, he is alone inside.

96,bandw,"Entertaining, but functions on deeper levels",8,10 December 2005,"There are a lot of things at the surface level in this movie that make it quite entertaining, but it functions at deeper levels as well.Some of the humor is up front, like the visual effects regarding the height differences between Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and the average Japanese shown when he is in a crowded elevator or adjusting a shower head. Or the Japanese TV show that he appears on that is way over the top, and the scary thing being that I think it may be for real. There are a lot of little one-liners like when Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) tells Bob that she has a degree in philosophy and he says, ""Lots of money there."" For those of us who have not been to Japan, this movie also serves as somewhat of a travelogue. The Tokyo scenes convince me that I don't want to go there - its neon jungle is isolating and repellent. It puts Las Vegas to shame. The video arcade that Charlotte visits is so outrageous that it creates a strange fascination. One of my favorite scenes is the dance a young Japanese boy is doing with his video game - his movements are so fluid and perfectly timed that it is almost a ballet. The sensual assault of the City is put to good use in its effect on the two protagonists - they are alone in a strange land and the looks on their faces as they drive through the City give evidence to their isolation. However, there are oases of grace as when Charlotte visits a temple or a beautiful garden, or the kaleidoscopic effect of multiply colored umbrellas carried on a busy walkway.The heart of the movie is the affectionate relationship that develops between Bob and Charlotte. It develops at a gradual pace and it is perfectly believable. There is a sexual tension between them tempered by a respectful restraint. You get hints about their deepening feelings rather than being hit over the head with it. Bob decides to stay for an extra day to do an interview on a TV show that he really does not want to do and he has a one-night stand with another woman, more his age, but keeps his sexual distance from the younger Charlotte.The obvious meaning of the title applies to the cultural and language challenges anyone faces in visiting a foreign country where he does not speak the language. But a deeper meaning of the title applies to the inability of friends and spouses to understand and listen to each other. Charlotte's husband is a self-centered ass who has no real interest in what his wife is saying, or what she feels or thinks. He is too busy on an ego trip with his career. Charlotte calls a friend of hers back in the States and tries to have a conversation, but soon gets a ""Gotta run."" And Charlotte is not the great communicator either - when asked how things are going she says it's great, when in fact she is lonely and bored. Bob experiences very similar interactions on the phone with his wife. She is more interested in his choice of tile color than what he is thinking. But there are times when Bob and Charlotte do talk, and that is one of the things that attracts them to each other. In the final event, though he is tempted to stay, in an act of acceptance of reality Bob leaves to go back to his family. There is that famous final scene where he whispers something into Charlotte's ear (which is not even subtitled) and they part - he aggrieved and she with a smile. I think he simply offered Charlotte thanks and encouragement that she would find her way in life.Bill Murray is perfect for the part of an aging actor on the downward slope who is hawking a whiskey for sizable money (Orson Welles comes to mind). The beauty of his acting here is in his reaction shots portraying a mildly depressed middle-aged man who is struggling to deal with a crazy world. At the end you are wanting to know more about Bob and Charlotte - more about their pasts and their futures.And what was with that golf scene?",Lost in Translation

Nevertheless the story in itself is well told and Bill Murray makes an excellent imperturbable and somewhat phlegmatic typical American including in some funny situations like the one when he is visited in his hotel room by a modern geisha trying to offer him her massage ability in which he seems not to be really interested. There is not much more to say about this movie whose development including the final scenes, is predictable. We have seen this same theme of an impossible love developing itself in a combustion without flame in many other movies. We'd like to stress however, to its credit, that the story shows remarkable chastity avoiding the trap of the too easy outcome of lovers going hurriedly to bed with each other sometimes and in some movies in a nonsensical way like if sex, which is undoubtedly a very important thing, were the most important thing in this world and always unavoidable.

It has the perfect duo, and a very endearing love story. Wether it's platonic or filled with sexual tension, there's nothing creepy or uncomfortable about it. Despite the huge age gap between both protagonists. Played by the best choices the director could have ever made. Bill Murray is irresistible, and carries the comedic timing throughout the whole movie. Scarlett Johansson is both innocent and provocative, and really showed what a great actress she was about to become. Even Anna Farris cameos are gold. Personally, I'm not a big fan of Giovanni Ribisi, so I thought his character was the wallflower of the bunch. The Japanese actors gave great performances too, especially the one playing the call girl. She was hysterical. And that's where the other shoe drop. The stereotypical and ridiculous way these people are shown throughout the movie would be considered offensive, nowadays. And I really regret that. It's the point of the whole thing.

101,DeeNine-2,A Platonic May-September affair,9,5 December 2005,"I don't know why I had trouble with this movie. Old guy gets young, beautiful girl ought to work for me, being an old guy myself. Maybe I was jealous. I couldn't do karaoke the way Bill Murray does it. And after a night on the Tokyo town, I couldn't carry Scarlett Johansson home in my arms and tuck her into bed and turn out the light. Well, I couldn't carry her. And she does have pretty eyes and nice legs and beautiful skin. And she's a good actress, although this part did not stretch her or even challenge her. And after a fashion one gets used to the slightly arrogant Bill Murray style. His character is, after all, an action hero who gets paid $2-million to make a whiskey commercial.Whiskey. I think that is what it is. I don't like whiskey or cigarettes and I usually don't like people who like cigarettes and whiskey, although I recall a song from my parents' time: ""Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild women/They'll drive you crazy, they'll drive you insane."" (I'll take the wild, wild women.) Such might conquer the boredom felt by out-of-towners in a high rise hotel in downtown Tokyo that director Sofia Coppola (Francis Ford's daughter) was at great pains to get across to us in the opening scenes. I also don't like bars and I think that people who spend their time hanging out in bars are mostly lonely alcoholics. Ditto for gratuitous smoking in movies and obvious product placements.So I almost gave up on this, but the DVD jacket does say, ""OVER 80 FOUR-STAR REVIEWS."" (That would five stars on Amazon.) Something must be wrong with me. Or maybe there is a big contrast coming in the second half of the film, and all this 21st century, big city, international First World ennui is necessary to set that up. But isn't it a little heavy how Scarlett hangs around in her panties waiting for her husband to return, and when he does he either goes to sleep or off to doing something else. Wow, one would think he would NOTICE. The camera surely does.Okay, I saw the rest of the film and ...There is a lot of artistic shtick in this movie. In fact it would be an art movie if it weren't aimed so directly at the mass mind--well, the mass mind over thirty. The long pauses and the way the camera lingers to SHOUT: notice this scene! how excellent it is, or to punctuate a point, how profound or how prosaic.But I like the clumsiness of their relationship and the way it is drawn out.The shots of Japan are wonderful, like a travel log. Mount Fujiyama in gray in the background; Mount Fujisan in the background in full color and snow cap. The games arcade in Tokyo, the game machines like Vegas slot machines all in a row. The clean, straight lines of the bars and the exercise rooms, black and whites; the square wooden bowls out of which they drink the wine; the lights at night on the boulevard, outdoing Times Square in their gaudy neon-ness. The touristy feel to the movie. The Japanese untranslated. The sleeplessness as though they were near the Arctic Circle with twenty hours of daylight. The easy Hollywood feel to the psychology: our hero's pix on the side of trucks drinking Japanese whiskey, suavely; the need for the hero to hide from his public; his obviously dyed hair; the ""satire"" of the blonde mediocre starlet who affects anorexia; the sense that Sofia Coppola lived something like this. One can imagine her boredom, and then the interested older man.I also liked the bit with the semi-talented lounge singer, again like Las Vegas--her picking him up, so to speak, he too drunk to protest or to remember. Again the Hollywood idea of the pecking order. The banality of the glamorous life.It is also to Sofia Coppola's credit that she got the relationship exactly right: she knew how the old guy felt and she knew how the young girl felt, and she knew what was right and what would be the right ending.I guess I should say why this movie affects me and brings out the impatience in me and calls forth my sardonic nature. It is that I have been there where Bill Murray's character was and I played it the same way. I am not so sure I did the right thing. I tell myself I did, but I am not so sure.See this for Sofia Coppola who made her father proud.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

104,KUAlum26,No Translation Necessary{spoilers possible},9,6 December 2006,"At least there was none needed for me,as I thought this film was a pleasant,thoughtful and intelligent study in characters.Bob Harris(Bill Murray,reaching a new frontier in his long career:that of the quietly despairing middle-aged white male)is completely out of his element. He is alone,on a commercial shoot in Tokyo. He knows no one there,keeps to himself and drinks to fill the voids. He is an actor who(we are to deduce)at one time had a much more successful career,but he's making the best of things now. He is separated from his family and probably would feel a disconnect from them even if he weren't separated by an ocean and hemisphere.Charlotte(Scarlett Johanssen,matching the character descript almost to a T)is married to a photographer(Giovanni Ribisi,not really in much of the picture)and her reason for being in the Land of the Rising Sun is fairly simple:her husband is doing a long and extensive photo shoot there and he wants her along. Of course,he doesn't bring her along for his work,and it gives her plenty of time to stay in her hotel room and get bored. She's married young,and(we are also led to believe)she feels like maybe she's done the wrong thing,as much as she loves her husband. Also lonely,unable to speak a word of Japanese and restless,she roams the Hotel to break the monotony.This is how our two main characters meet,and through their meeting,they develop a sort of bonding that's just short of sexual and a little past emotional. To call this an ""Affair of the Heart"" might be over-simplified,but it seems like it might be the closest thing to what is at play here. As the movie progresses,the two understand each other and become quietly pushed to make a decision about that.Very solid acting performances,great imagery(I was in Tokyo once,over twenty-five years ago,and although it was for a very short time,one could get a sense that they were dwarfed in that city even for a short stay!)and a smart,seamless direction and script from capable director Sofia Coppola make this movie unique and valuable.

105,frankde-jong,One of the best (and weirdest) romcoms I have ever seen,9,11 December 2020,"""Lost in translation"" is a very beautiful and poetic title. It gives the impression that the film is about cultural differences.Partially this is true. The film is situated in Tokio and the two main characters are lost in this big metropole in which they have great difficulties in communicating with the inhabitants. At the same time we see Japan trying to imitate Western culture. They import an American actor (past its peak) to make a commercial for an originally Western product (Whisky) and in the bar of the hotel a Western singer performs the worst version of ""Scarborough Fair"" I have ever heard.The intercultural confusion is the ""comedy"" element of the film, and this is in my opinion not the most important element. The film has also a tragical component. The two main characters are not only lost because they have difficulties communicating with the inhabitants of Tokyo. Also the communication with their partners leaves much to be desired. Bob Harris (the aged actor played by Bill Murray) is alone in Tokyo and the only thought he has by the frequent phonecalls of his wife is how he can end them as soon as possible. Charlotte (played by Scarlett Johansson) is in Tokyo together with her husband. Her husband, who is celebrity photographer, however forgets his wife completely when one of his clients comes in close.With Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson the cast has an established star (Murray) and an upcoming star (Johansson). For Scarlett Johansson ""Lost in translation"" was her breakthrough role as a full grown actress. She is playing very well and is undeniably beautiful. Not a perfect kind of beauty but a natural kind of beauty. Nevertheless ""Lost in translation"" ultimately is the film of Bill Murray. His character can be funny, but most of the time he is too tired to do so.Despite the age difference something beautiful grows between Bob and Charlotte and the film takes on the character of a romcom. It is however one of the most strange (and one of the best) romcoms I have seen, because all the genre conventions are violated. Bob and Charlotte do not have sex, but all the same Bob feels guilty after having a one night stand with the afore mentioned singer at the bar. In stead of having sex Bob slightly touches the foot of Charlotte when they are talking in his hotel room, and (believe it or not) this is far more intimate then it sounds. There is also no happy ending between Bob and Charlotte. In saying goodbye Bob whispers something in the ear of Charlotte. What does he say? That's none of our business!",Lost in Translation

Charlotte is a typically aimless young soul who peripatetically bounces between wanting to write or photograph, & seeking an outlet for her philosophy degree from Yale, while Bob is a lethargic middle aged man who's not so much in crisis mode as he is in ennui to the cosmos. Still, as stated, the movie's visuals are its real charm- the scenes of Tokyo's night life, neon, the odd angles that Charlotte looks down upon life from in her hotel room, and especially a beautifully filmed, yet hauntingly lonely shot of Bob playing golf in the foreground of Mount Fuji, add almost enough poetic resonance to the characters that the script lacks to pull off a viewer's belief in their romance. Sofia's brother made a far superior film a few years ago that dealt with many of the same themes of alienation. CQ, for whatever reasons, did not seem to strike a chord the way Lost In Translation did. The reason for that is probably because CQ was not as 'serious' an art film as Translation.",Lost in Translation

No racism here either. The Asian culture is what it is, and this gives you an idea of two Americans from two different ages there. I found Scarlett what-her-whoits part even more of the same, nothing spectacular or memorable -- unless your a guy and like pink underwear and constant shots of her behind. Giggle, giggle, dry -- was her acting style. Bill Murray did a good job over all of this  and that's what made me give the film a five out of ten. Sometimes a viewer has to see beyond ""a woman director"" and call it as it is. A so-so talky film about two fish outa water that has been done, and re-done and will be done again.

'Lost in Translation' is one of those films. It did nothing for me and I thought it was very average and even forgettable.It doesn't matter to me how slow or subtle a drama film is, but I do expect it to connect with me and make me feel something. 'Lost in Translation' left me cold. I found it to be dull and uninspiring. The characters are wooden and emotionless.

111,emasterslake,Bill Murray's best roles,8,10 May 2006,"I fell in love with this movie after renting it.I like Bill Murray and Japan, which makes this movie unique to see.Lost in Translation has Bill Murray portraying Bob Harris, a washed up actor who's traveled to Tokyo to do some Wisky commercials, Charollet portrayed by Scarlet Johansen, a young women who isn't sure what do with her life.These 2 different characters both feel lost in Japan. Specially when they don't know the language and have nothing exciting to do. But when they meet each other, and start to know each other more, they'll find this vacation to be less boring. Bob and Charollet will have a blast by running around Tokyo and enjoy the scenery even if they don't know Japanese.This movie has some great tips and advice when going to Japan. Which I hope to visit there one day. The plot and flow of the movie is good in my pointer view.After you see this movie you'll learn that being in Japan is like being on another planet. I think some of the Bill Murray fans will like this one.Rent it first and see if you like it.",Lost in Translation
112,hall895,Beautifully unique,7,27 July 2010,"It's the story of a man. A famous actor, middle-aged, not particularly happy in his marriage. And it's the story of a woman. Much younger, a recent college graduate, also not particularly happy in her marriage. These two Americans meet by chance in a Tokyo hotel. In most movies this is where a cheap, meaningless fling would ensue. But Sofia Coppola's script is much too smart for that. And so Lost in Translation is something entirely different. Something unexpected, a beautiful surprise. It's the story of two lonely people, two lost souls. And in finding one another perhaps they can find themselves.In playing this couple brought together by fate Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are superb. Murray plays Bob Harris, a hugely successful actor who is in Japan to make commercials for whiskey. He hates himself for it, he'd rather be home doing theater. But the money's good. And home's not all it's cracked up to be anyway. His marriage has grown stale. Bob's a guy in the throes of a midlife crisis. And Murray captures the character perfectly. The sense of loneliness, the sense of disappointment in life and in himself, it's all etched on Murray's face. So famous for loud and outrageous comedy here Murray does so much with simple subtlety. Meanwhile Johansson plays Charlotte, a young woman tagging along with her celebrity photographer husband on his trip to Japan. Even when her husband is around Charlotte feels lost and alone. When he's off working and she's left to fend for herself all the pain and doubt she is feeling threatens to consume her. She needs something to cling to and that something turns out to be Bob Harris. And as this couple embarks on an undeniably interesting and rather unusual relationship the young Johansson proves to be up to the task of matching the veteran actor Murray. The two stars turn in hugely memorable performances which really elevate the film.But as wonderful as Murray and Johansson are perhaps the true star of the film is Sofia Coppola. She wrote a wonderful script. And then she directed it so beautifully. She has a truly terrific visual sense, making the city of Tokyo almost a character unto itself with the way she captures it on camera. As Bob and Charlotte explore the city everything is framed so beautifully. And when the movie briefly veers away from all the excitement of the big city for a few moments in a much quieter, peaceful locale Coppola succeeds in making that perhaps the film's most beautiful scene of all. She has made a movie which definitely succeeds in drawing you in and making you care about its characters. It's not the most exciting thing you've ever seen. It's much more subtle than that, a movie which trusts itself enough to unfold at its own leisurely pace. And in this case that works. It's a great story of two people who initially are lost but end up finding something. What they find may not be exactly what they were looking for but this is a movie too smart for the simple answer, the easy way out. And that more than anything else is what makes this movie a success.",Lost in Translation
113,sharky_55,"For relaxing times, make it Suntory time.",5,30 July 2016,"Lost in Translation is a comfortable film. It's Antonioni-lite, it's existentialism 101, it poses these characters as tortured, angsty souls that can't seem to reconcile their desires of self-actualisation and the obligations of their privileged existence. It has become clear by now that Sofia Coppola has also found a comfort zone; she's visited this material before, of the upper-middle class citizen surrounded and disgusted by artificial excess and seeking solace beyond what is already granted to them by birth or status (Somewhere, and The Virgin Suicides). You can always make this work, but there is a very fine line between being genuine and being simply self-absorbed.The film sees gone to seed movie star Bob Harris and post-graduate/marriage Charlotte find their solace in each other, in Tokyo. Coppola relies heavily on alienation of the Japanese setting to whisk them away from their ennui; removed from the usual hustle- bustle of corporate America, they lose themselves in the night-life of the city and forget all their troubles. They are pretty and comfortable experiences; Acord shoots with energy and vitality, aligning his camera as a hazy participant itself, lost in the neon maze of Tokyo. Charlotte marvels at the many lights and gadgets of the arcade, as if she is relishing the childhood glee and freedom. Inhibitions are destroyed through booze and karaoke - a wild and once-in-a-lifetime adventure. But Coppola also brings in a rather bizarre side to the Japanese culture, which has led to accusations of racism. Offensive or not, the portrait she etches of contemporary Japan is a insulting elementary contrivance, which seems to serve the characters at every turn. Technological advances are demonised; the fax machines wakes him at four in the morning, the blinds automatically open against his will, the shower-head offers unwanted freedom, even the elliptical is against him. He is mocked at every turn. The commercial director spits a furious stream of instructions, which are simply translated for the bemused Bob. The missed opportunity for comedy (subtitles would have offered insight into the director's zeal, plus his eagerness and homage to Casablanca) creates another effect; instead of laughing at the idea of messages being lost in translation, we are merely laughing at the director and his gibberish. His passion turns into wackiness, which is then material for condescension. When Coppola tries intentional comedy, it fails spectacularly, dragging out the tired trope of the Japanese mixing up their l's and r's into ridiculousness. These are not Japanese characters, but silly stereotypes.The crux of the film is that the pair's situation has led them to this moment. Aside from Coppola's rather lazy imagining of the absent husband and potential infidelity (Anna Faris at her most annoying), their heartfelt connection is tenuous at best. Coppola never lifts it beyond your standard Hollywood fare; they have semi-meaningful conversations whilst lying in bed, they talk of the aimlessness of their lives at different stages, they comfort each other because they both have some vague dissatisfaction plaguing them (conveniently, neither have any other valuable friends or family to voice this to, and in their attempts to find it over the phone, there is always a task for them to run off to). But the real disappointment isn't in the predictability of the story. It's in how serious it takes itself, how their early or late life crisis, however vague, is elevated into some sort of heroic and torturous ordeal. Bob and Charlotte think themselves above all the other conforming Americans they left behind, but their story is not nearly as spectacular or special as they think it is. They merely have the luxury of being able to vacate to an exotic destination and escape for a while in their little bubble of angst. They sing just as badly as Kelly does, but are portrayed as wildly beautiful messes and bundles of insecurity. This difference in treatment reeks of navel-gazing self-importance.",Lost in Translation
114,CitizenCaine,A Quiet Breath Of Fresh Air,9,16 March 2004,"In 1999, Sofia Coppola's first film debuted at Cannes amongst a lot of fanfare, and for good reason. In Lost In Translation, only her second film, she fashions a jewel of a film. Like in her first film, The Virgin Suicides, Coppola expertly blends atmosphere, cinematography, mood, and music with a great original screenplay to reveal a special, perfect moment in time between real people. This is how it happens in real life, not in the typical Hollywood way with a super hunk. When Bob Harris leaves Tokyo and returns to his mundane family life, we believe that he'll recall this event in his life as one of those times where he made a real, genuine connection with another human being. It just so happens that the connection is with an attractive young girl 30 years his junior.Dispensing with almost all Hollywood clichés of similar stories, Sofia Coppola creates a unique film with characters and dilemmas so real it's equally both painful and joyful to watch. Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a mid 50's actor, who has been sleepwalking through his life. His marriage is ordinary, from what we can tell, and his professional life is has become just another event in his ordinary day. Enter Scarlett Johansson, a very early 20's girl, who feels lonely in a foreign country, and with a husband that seems too busy with working as a photographer with a silly girl, played by Anna Faris. Appearing in better films like this should do wonders for her credibility. Murray and Johansson meet accidentally a few times before drifting together in sort of a friendship that harbors them from the realities of their lives and being alone in a foreign country. The time they spend together illuminates both their lives and ours in positive ways. This film is about intimacy, emotional intimacy. The counter-culture writer Charles Bukowski once said that he didn't care if a significant other ever cheated on him by having sex with someone else, but he wouldn't like it if she kissed someone else. The reason being is that a kiss is a denotation of intimacy; where as, sex is just a physical act to him. In Lost In Translation, we see a friendship develop that is so intimate as to make us feel we are physically intruding, especially in the whispering scene. Coppola creates not only a special relationship between her characters, but one between them and us. And, that's something that most great films do. Sofia Coppola has established herself as a talented director to watch. ***1/2 of 4 stars.",Lost in Translation

The actress' delicate approach to her character delivers strong emotion as we feel for her, all alone in a strange place and not knowing where to go and what to do.The star of the show is Coppola, whose direction and writing help achieve these feelings for the characters. Coppola takes the genre and situation into account and with point of view and long shots help achieve the essential realism. The sweeping shots of Japan are very artistic and create a uniqueness and sophisticated look at the culture.The very brief scenes showing the characters travelling or just in their rooms show everyday routines and add a delicate feel to the character's lives.One of the main ideologies of this film is the Japanese culture, which was very intriguing to watch. As we follow Bob and Charlotte around, we are getting their interpretations of the surroundings, and are placed in different scenarios from America, such as a cook your own food restaurant, an eccentric mad talk show and the translation to be key.The way the Japanese speak and their language is triggered by interpreters, and creates some controversial black comedy, and the feeling the character's get is very genuine, and make you wonder how you would react under similar circumstances.Lost in Translation has everything a comedy drama needs.

118,TOMASBBloodhound,Pleasant and very well-acted.,8,27 September 2005,"Lost in Translation is not a film looking to dazzle its audience with special effects or make them burst out laughing at anything. This is a simple film about two strangers who meet in a Tokyo hotel and share some quality time with each other while trying to figure some things out. Bill Murray has never been better, and Scarlet Johansson more than holds her own opposite the legendary actor/comedian.Murray plays Bob Harris, a washed-up actor now relegated to doing whiskey commercials and photo shoots in Japan for his income. The film begins with him checking into a posh hotel and being enthusiastically greeted by a gang of hotel employees. After checking in, Bob is left with the predicament of having to find something to do in a strange place when he cannot fall asleep. He looks so helpless in the shot where he's just sitting on the bed staring back at the camera. Also staying in the hotel is a young woman named Charlotte (Johansson). She is with her photographer husband who is in town for a shoot. Even when they are next to each other, he barely pays her any attention. After a couple of days, Bob and Charlotte find themselves sitting at the hotel bar together and both feeling pretty lonely.The relationship that develops between them is deep and thoughtful. Both characters need one another while lost in this strange land. We see them going out to clubs, hanging out with some locals, and having dinner. The whole time we see them growing closer and closer. Thankfully the relationship never becomes sexual, or it would be harder to like these characters. They share an awkward kiss or two in an elevator, and a longer one in their final scenes together, but the relationship is more memorable for what they say to each other. They have one particularly moving conversation about children while lying in bed. Bob is able to shed some wisdom about something Charlotte has likely never given that much thought to before.At one point, Bob sleeps with the hotel lounge singer. He is a married man, but it isn't really clear who he feels the most guilty for. His wife or Charlotte. He is clearly embarrassed when Charlotte catches them together and his phone conversations back home seem less than cheerful. You get the sense that he'd much rather have Charlotte in his bed than the lounge singer.When it's time for Bob to go, he doesn't want leave. He knows he will miss Charlotte terribly and will most likely never see her again. A hot blonde hits on him in the lobby and he hardly notices. All he can do is watch Charlotte as the elevator doors close on her. Somehow as his cab is driving away, he sees her again on the street and he orders the cab to stop. Bob then tracks her down again and the two share a private moment together in the middle on hundreds of people. It's private because we cannot hear what he says in her ear, and we probably have no business knowing in the first place. It's just two interesting characters having a moment to themselves. By then you'll likely feel they've earned it.The film is beautifully shot and modestly paced, to say the least. Coppola has some genuine skill behind the camera, and she will likely have a long and successful career. The film is rated R, but take out a brief scene at a strip club and it barely qualifies for PG-13. With all the accolades this film received, it was bound to attract quite a bit of criticism, also. The best way to enjoy this film is to forget about all the awards and nominations and just take it for what it is. A simple, pleasant story of two people who happen to meet in a strange place far from home.8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Lost in Translation

124,itamarscomix,Gorgeous,9,24 May 2005,"Isn't it exciting to see a promising new talent blossom and grow? With 'Lost In Translation', we have the unique pleasure of watching three such talents bloom and find themselves. The first one is, of course, director Sofia Coppola, daughter of the grand master Francis Ford, and a proud collaborator in the family business. 'Lost In Translation' is only her second feature film, but all the promises made by her debut, the acclaimed 'Virgin Suicides', is fulfilled in this movie. Though it shares with its predecessor a kind of drowsy, atmospheric slowness, 'Lost In Translation' is a much better structured movie, and shows Sofia truly on her way as both director and writer. It earned her an Oscar for best original screenplay, and golden globes for best screenplay and best film (comedy / musical).The second is young actress Scarlett Johansson. I had my eye on Scarlett since I saw her in two of my favorite films of recent years - Terry Zwigoff's 'Ghost World' and the Coen Brothers' 'The Man Who Wasn't There'. She played supporting roles in both movies, yet I was still impressed, and not just because of her young age (in 'Ghost World' she plays a high school graduate along with Thora Birch, yet she is two years younger than Birch - she was only 16 when the movie was made!) This year, though, we can see her in two leading roles - in 'Lost In Translation' and 'Girl With Pearl Earring' - and in 'Lost In Translation', she really proves that she's a talent to be reckoned with.The third is - yes, that's right, Bill Murray. So, yes, he's been around for nearly a quarter of a century now, but we never really thought of him as much of an actor, right? Good though he was in 'Ghostbusters' and 'Groundhog Day', never before have I imagined him to be anything more than a comedian actor, and capable of playing a lead dramatic character successfully. In 'Lost In Translation' he is both funny and touching, and his performance is worthy of an Oscar.'Lost In Translation' is a beautiful, moody, atmospheric little piece of perfect cinema from a young director just beginning to show what she has to offer. It moves very slowly and has very little plot, but never gets dull. Altogether, it's one of the best and most intelligent films of the year. Very highly recommended.",Lost in Translation
125,TheNorthernMonkee,Admittedly biast as Scarlett is gorgeous!,9,23 January 2004,"SPOILERSDuring the year, I will go through stages of being desperate to see certain particular films. One will take my fancy and i'll be obsessed with going to see it. Often I'll build these films up to such a degree that I'm ultimately disappointed. So with this in mind, I admit to being both nervous and excited when I finally got to see this movie. Aided by the fact that I watched it at the last showing and excluding my six mates there were only four other people in the entire room. I sat, I took the film in, and truthfully, I really enjoyed it.In ""Lost In Translation"", Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a middleaged highly paid actor who is going through a mid life crisis. His wife is left at home and whilst we hear her voice, we never see her visually. Bob spends a lot of the film either in the bar or being miserable or both. He is at his happiest however when he begins to spend most of his time with a newlywed with nothing to do in Tokyo. The newlywed Charlotte (played with stunning genius by Scarlett Johansson) is just out of Yale after studying Philosophy and doesn't have a clue what she wants to do with her life. The two of them, as a result of being bored, miserable, and unable to sleep, spend the vast majority of the week together and a friendship slowly develops, before evolving into a feeling of love for each other. I won't state what happens in the end between the two, but the choices are obviously limited for those who haven't seen the movie.In ""Lost In Translation"", Sofia Coppola presents us with a beautiful story of two people who are lost and find each other. Bill Murray is brilliant as basically himself and will be nominated for an Oscar for definate. Whether he wins is a difficult question which I'm not here to answer, but I would be happy if he does. Scarlett Johansson however must be a sure fire thing. There are rumours abound at the moment that she is being placed in the Best Supporting Actress category as it will give her the best chance. I question this idea, not least since she's obviously a leading actress in this movie, but because I'd quite like to see her win the Best Actress award. Johansson is simply breathtaking at times in this film. Placed in a difficult character, she plays the part superbly and shows genuine affection for Murray's character.Other than the two main charactors and Sofia Coppola's direction, this film has an amazing soundtrack and some breathtaking views. One or two shots of Tokyo grind on me really, as do one or two of the people that the main characters interact with, but for those two minor faults, it's difficult to question this film.

This can come in many forms: action like in John Woo's films, terror like in Alien, or just intense drama like Summer of Sam or 21 Grams. In all those films there is something that constantly grabs you and provides and unrelenting urge to continue watching.This film has no intensity at all. Not one bit. It is a quiet and relaxed film. And I LOVED IT. The acting is top-notch, both from Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, the direction and cinematography is great, but it is the script that is the real winner. So rarely does a script come along and just shows the viewer into a character's heart and feeling.
The story centers around Bob and Charlotte. The former an actor who used to be known and is now deciding what to do with his life. The latter a newly married college graduate who is now deciding what to do with her life. Simply put they are lost. Bob's career seems uncertain, and Charlotte is uncertain what her husband doing when he leaves to go to work for long hours. The backdrop of Tokyo works beautifully with the story as the Bob and Charlotte are truly lost. A culture they don't yet fully understand and a life that seems like it has nowhere and everywhere to go at the same time.In the end, Bob and Charlotte understand one another. They don't realize they like the same kind of music or anything, but they, in a completely foreign land, they leave with a greater understanding of who they are and what they need to do. Never has such a simple realization of two people been put so beautifully on screen. This film touched my soft spot and you can bet it will touch yours. 10/10",Lost in Translation
127,FilmOtaku,Great second effort from Coppola,8,20 April 2004,"Sofia Coppola quickly went from being fodder (Godfather III anyone?) to garnering a lot of my respect after seeing `The Virgin Suicides' a few years ago, so before all of the hype about `Lost in Translation' surfaced, I was interested in seeing the film.  Unfortunately I didn't get around to it until recently, but I already had my doubts.  When there is a lot of hype about a film, I immediately doubt it until it changes my mind, so I wasn't even sure if it should have been a Best Picture contender.  Of course, after now having seen the film finally, I am positively certain of its merit.One thing about the film that I have heard more than once is that the viewer `didn't get it' the first time, and didn't understand the big deal, but when given a second chance, the film was fantastic.  After seeing the film once, I'm not sure why it leaves that impression on some because I found it to simply be a charming, romantic and thought-provoking little film.  The characters are extremely well written, and the Tokyo backdrop is at times both lonely and vibrant.  After seeing the films of Wes Anderson, I was not surprised by Murray's sincere and brilliant performance and I cannot imagine another actor playing that role.  Johanssen's casting was not as inspired, but she did a great job nonetheless.  While there is nothing overtly offensive about the film in terms of content, this film isn't for everyone, although the people who didn't like the film threw me, and surprised by those who did, so it's hard to pin down the `ideal viewer.'

It's important to write your own personal opinion, and that's why many people write the same things. We can think equally, sometimes, and can't help it. Because I have heard lots of things about this film and I have been desperate to see it since it generated all the buzz. ""A masterpiece"", said critics and movie fans (well, not every movie fan, because many have found this to be overrated). I can deny these both statements; this is not a masterpiece, neither an overrated movie. But it is really interesting to know what it accomplished because of the risks the people in it took. There are many points to discuss about this movie; it causes you to wonder. This is the type of movie I like to name ""personal experience"". Reality becomes a main character in this piece about characters.Although I haven't seen flaws in the movie (maybe some things were lacking), I couldn't say it is perfect. It has the great moments, the great times (Suntory time?). The script, for example. Winning an Oscar for a script that hardly shines and has an amazing lack of complexity. This is the type of screenplay that inspires me to write, because I like to, but I feel obliged to create emotion in words, and that stops me from starting. This is inspiring because it is not afraid of being simple, and as I said (well, didn't but...""personal experience""), treating with reality. Everyone is afraid of dealing with this. It couldn't work; but someone has to try. What I'd like to write about is real situations about real people, with words we use constantly in our daily lives. This fact itself justifies the awards the script received. It is like breaking the ice. There are not many words written, but the ones that are, are creating worthy sentences.These two characters have a whole world inside of them and destiny has joined them. To be together? I don't think so. Just to stop for a while and realize about their positions and objectives in life. One of them (Bob) has already lived, and does not have a clear objective. Just thoughts. She (Charlotte) is starting to live, but isn't please with life and sees that he could tell her the way it is. Their encounters are slow paced and naturally shot. The third time they meet, he tells her: ""I'm planning a prison escape; we first have to get out of this hotel, then out of the city, then out of the country"". She answers: ""I'm in"". This is the starting point of their relationship. They are escaping from a prison; the prison they are living in. Then they know each other, and their relationship grows into something you can't name. Love? No. Although it is the way we could see it, because of Charlotte's relationship with her husband, and because of Bob's weak feelings for his family. In a lunch scene, after Bob and Charlotte's relationship had been growing, Charlotte is jealous because Bob has slept with a singer (interesting, the thing about the band: ""Sausalito""). It could also be like a father and daughter thing.This is not romance. Drama for sure, and of course comedy. I'm not going to say the acting work is excellent, but it is without doubt funny. Bill Murray (Bob) creates faces. Faces that can make loneliness to seem funny. His faces resemble to the ones Jack Nicholson used to do all the time. Fun in this film comes naturally. This never happens in movies. If you're not laughing is because you're not paying attention to how sad and ridiculous can the life of a person become. Drama makes a place for comedy in this film. It is well handled. We can understand Bob's looks. It's human. Johansson is not great, as I heard she was (maybe because nothing in this movie is). But she has the charm and strength to play this role. She's lost; they're both lost. Stuck, Charlotte says in one scene: ""I'm stuck"". She asks Bob about marriage and kids. She thinks he is in a crisis. He just answers how great a family is, that kids are the joy of life. This is one of the best scenes I've seen. It's the best scene in the movie, also. I was talking about ""personal experience"", about reality. This is a realistic scene. The rest is also real, and that's what you should expect.One friend said to me, when we were talking about ""Lost in Translation"", that the film had no ""climax"". I should say that it doesn't need one. I wasn't waiting for it.",Lost in Translation

130,Pedro_H,Great piece of dreamy cinema - like a highly restrained Last Tango in Paris.,8,10 November 2005,"Bill Murray is in Tokyo for a whiskey commercial and the far younger Scarlet Johnson is in Tokyo because her photographer husband is shooting a hip pop group. Somehow -- and some way -- they get involved in a kind of non sexual affair.(Like a shipboard romance without a ship!) Americans in the main don't travel. The majority of Americans don't even own a passport. Americans in the main don't speak foreign languages and are frightened of places that don't speak English. They nearest thing they do is to go to the movies and so movie clichés is all they know about the world.I have travelled and I do know the world from first hand experience and let me tell you something -- I don't really like Japan. It is clean, polite and fairly crime free (in terms of violent crime anyway), but somehow they envy robots. The teach people robotic style and they live robotic lives. They have no natural resources of their own -- no oil, no coal, no gas -- and yet they have a Western style economy.Don't get me wrong I admire intelligence and hard work, but let us thank god that the whole world isn't like Japan. We'd have no rock and roll songs to sing badly (as they do in this movie) or most of the great arts: Things that are the product of the free thinker.I was first introduced to Sofia Copolla when she produced what was the worst performance I have ever seen in a major movie (Godfather III) and so thank the living lord she has other talents -- although this might be a lucky fluke. I didn't like the Virgin Suicides at all -- not one little bit, indeed I hated everything about it.Here she is lucky in being a beginner (look at the goof index!) that has fallen in to the company of pros. Bill Murray's face is not something I wished to linger on in his ""Meatballs"" prime and yet he has that something that no one can put their finger on. He is that laughing uncle that cheers up the family get together -- the kind that uses words as (secret) weapon. You'd like to be his friend.Nothing really important happens in this movie. It reminds me somewhat of Manhattan (the Woody Alan movie) in its Spring and Autumn pairing and sense of local exploration.It also reminds me of Last Tango in Paris (although this is far less graphically sexual) in its use of a novelty setting. The success of this movie demonstrates that the American audience (where it has done best of all by any mathematics) are using this film to go places that they wouldn't dream of going and experiencing things they wouldn't dream of experiencing.Why not pack a bag and go to Asia or places in Europe that are not tourist clichés? Then you can have experiences like this for real and find out more about yourself and how the whole world isn't -- and doesn't want to be -- an imitation of American culture.",Lost in Translation

Maybe that is why I give it an average rating. (The more I expect, the less impressed I seem to be).This film is not a romantic comedy. It has an element of romance in it, but I feel that it is more religious- a young girl who is trying to find her meaning in life. The comedy mainly comes from the differences of culture and the situations the characters find themselves in in Japan.Overall, I give it a 4 out of 10. Average",Lost in Translation

You get the feeling that the tale of this movie has not been contrived for entertainment purposes (although it is lively, funny, and moving) - but that we are being given a rare opportunity - a window into the lives of two fascinating people (both treated with equal understanding and compassion by Coppola - a rare thing in movies). At times you forget that you're watching a movie at all, it draws you in so well. It has the kind of brilliant direction that Orson Welles most liked in other directors - the kind that you don't notice, but that creates the experience and tells the story really well.Every moment of this subtle, moving story of two americans lost in Tokyo, alienated from everything else around them, is quite simply enchanting.",Lost in Translation

This is utterly a masterpiece, such a fascinating, heartfelt and romantic movie that I kept wishing that it was me that was lost in Tokyo, wondering the hotel and streets, wanting be to be found be someone or something, so I could ease my heart and mind. The wonderful silence and heartbeat of the movie is glorious in a unique way, and both Scarlett and Bill delivers grand performances, both worthy an Oscar statue if you ask me. And with the slow-pacing atmosphere surrounding the movie, it's the way it combines romantic drama with fine comedy that truly catches fire at times, making such a special movie and making it a must in any cinema-lover's collection. You would gladly stay up late with someone like Scarlett (since I'm a boy) as you can feel her depression and loneliness in those empty hours as her busy husband (fine supporting character by Giovanni Ribisi) leaves the hotel room early and returns late, and you can feel Bill/Bob's ""midlife-crisis"" and depression as he combines exercise with cigars and whiskey, wife-on-the-phone and ""kids getting used to him not being around"".

134,AhmedSpielberg99,Manhattan Of The 21st Century!,9,7 August 2018,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Her. Both of these movies have style, themes, or ideas which are similar to that Lost in Translation has. Therefore, either of them would make perfect bittersweet double feature with Lost in Translation. And I loved these two movies so much; however, I have some issues with each one of them.Don't get me wrong; Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's script is more genuine and creative, but the main issue I have with it is that it lost its balance between humor and subtle pathos at some point. Lost in Translation, by contrast, doesn't have this problem. In fact, the perfect balance between humor and melancholy. The movie deals with heavy themes such as loneliness, insomnia, emptiness, existential crisis, and more hefty themes, but nonetheless the movie never feels gloomy or bleak. Actually there are some funny moments due to the movie's smart dialogue that made me laugh many times.As for Her, I think it is a very unique, and has an idiosyncratic style and screenplay, except for its third act. It chose a familiar and conventional way to end its one-of-a-kind story. That didn't just disappointed me, but that also made the movie feels inconsistent near the end. For a moment, I felt that Sofia Coppola would make the same mistake in Lost in Translation. That's because at some point at the third there was a scene that feels if it sets a subplot that would end the movie in a stereotypical way. And I think this was an unnecessary and manipulative. Also, this is the only main issue I have with Lost in Translation. This movie is bittersweet, but its ending is Just Like Honey!Both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson at the top of their games. They may gave their best performances in their respective career. Scarlett Johansson did a great job in playing the Philosophy graduate Charlotte who is twenty-something. I felt she's really at this age. As for Bill Murray, his role is far more complicated, and he just killed it! I've never seen him giving such a powerful serious performance. His character suffers from something like a midlife crisis, and there are many great actors played characters like this before. But Murray's terrific comedic abilities adds to this character, and made it more complex, yet more amiable.Aside from the fact that this movie looks gorgeous, it's exquisitely directed by the talented director, Sofia Coppola. Just try to notice the visual tools, how they work, and utilized, and what they imply. You will find out that Lost in Translation is a well-directed as it's a well-written film, maybe the direction is what deserves the highest praise. Also, the movie is consistent in tone. As I mentioned, the balance between between humor and sadness, and while the smart screenplay has a major in that, the meticulous direction has a role that isn't, by any means, less important. The soundtrack is sweetly hypnotic! This is now one of my favorite soundtracks put in film. The words of every song match the current state in every different phase in the movie.I loved Lost in Translation so much! I can't praise it highly enough, or maybe I can, it's Manhattan of the 21st century!(9/10)",Lost in Translation
135,CountZero313,lost in transition,9,16 December 2013,"Travelling for work, staying in cookie-cutter hotel rooms, negotiating soul-crushing airport transit lounges, enduring forced bonhomie in stilted conversations with people we hope never to see again...Modern working life alienates and dehumanizes us on distant shores. At times like this, we may reach out and take succor in a human connection that could only be forged in such circumstances. Lost in Translation depicts one such connection.Charlotte and Bob meet in Japan. Some aspects of that arena are conveyed in ludicrous, hilarious detail - the uninvolved translator, the kitschy hotel lounge, the indecipherable menu. Other details are less well conveyed, such as a cringe-inducing and borderline racist depiction of a Japanese call girl. But the fact is this could be Dubai, or Bangkok, or Mexico City. Two troubled individuals wash up in an unfamiliar and alien land without the will or skills to navigate their way through. The landscape they explore is their own under-realised lives. They give each other the strength to go on.Subtle but powerful performances from the two leads, and an understated but steady hand from Coppola, make this a fine achievement. Some wonderful comic moments, especially a hospital encounter between Murray and a local that was surely ad-libbed, are finely balanced with pathos and emotional depth.

136,RJBurke1942,"As the saying goes, better the devil you know than the one you know not...",8,4 January 2007,"I was reluctant to see this film simply because I did not like Sofia Coppola's prior work that she directed and which I'd seen on TV (it was a forgettable TV flick about teenage suicides).However, as a big fan of Bill Murray, I finally put aside my prejudice about Sofia Coppola as a director, and sat down to watch it one evening recently.I'd read a couple of film reviews in newspapers, so I had a fair idea about the story. Or, so I thought... Yes, the bald outline is about a middle-aged actor (Bill Murray) in Japan to do some Japanese commercials, and it is about how he meets a somewhat neglected wife of a professional photographer, and then how the two spend time together enjoying the sights and sounds of Tokyo...and, ultimately, the sight and sound of each other.So, as a story, it's really simple: a week out of two people's lives who meet by chance and who probably will never meet again. But, as the song goes, the memory lingers on...Hence, this is not a romance. Instead, this story is a romance that might have been, or still might be. We'll never know  and that's the real romance and power of this narrative, because it's the sort of thing that can happen to any of us as we wander through life's trials and tribulations.As Bob Harris, Bill Murray is just perfect in the role; even when he is serious, he can be very funny. Scarlett Johansson, as Charlotte, whom I'd seen a few months back in Match Point (2005), Woody Allen's suspense thriller, is refreshingly plain, and portrays the waiting wife with studied skill. The rest of the cast, although necessary, is barely evident throughout the movie: nearly all of the camera work focuses on the two almost-and-if-not-for-other-commitments-might-have-been lovers. So, there is a slow build-up, as the two get to know each other casually, and then eventually learn how to reveal some of their innermost thoughts and feelings to each other. In fact, the first hour is very slow, and, once or twice, during that time, my resolve to see it through to the end nearly went. So, I'm glad I ignored my impatience...Sofia Coppola's theme is thus well played out between the two: life is chaotic and chance encounters can lead to big and better things; but, only if you have the courage of your convictions. That is, if you are prepared to pay the price, whatever that is. An excellent near parallel is David Lean's Brief Encounter (1945) with Trevor Howard and Cecelia Johnson that, if you haven't seen, is worth the time to see. Having said that, it would spoil this story to say any more about how this film ends.But, I'll finish by saying that I was impressed by Coppola's direction this time round, and I do recommend this film as a thoughtful and thought-provoking slice of life that could be yours, or mine, any day of the week.",Lost in Translation

But i just thought these things to myself, anyhow, i haven't seen any other film from Sofia Coppola, but from what i hear about virgin suicides and marie antoinette, i think Lost In Translation is her gem. I didn't think i would like a film like this, and i wasn't exactly obsessed with it like many people (film buffs) i know are, however i can't deny that its a great film.

The movie looks full of comic promise.The movie slows to a snail's pace, and nothing happens. At least a lot less of interest happens than on my own explorations of foreign cities.

There is no affection or sympathy for them. They are often portrayed as robots or buffoons.Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte was a good casting choice. She is extremely beautiful, without being flashy or glamorous. She has a unique wholesome look. She confused me only once when she donned a short pink wig, and I did not recognise her.

In Ghost World, she effectively played a senior in high school. Here, in Lost in Translation, two years after Ghost World was released, she plays a woman who has been married for two years. Johansson plays that role like it was even more natural. As she has said before, she doesn't take every role that she can; she doesn't want to become Shannon Elizabeth or anyone like that. After her role here, we can expect her to become one of the more larger stars of now.Charlotte (Johansson) is in Tokyo with her husband John (Giovanni Ribisi), who is a photographer who barely has time for her. He wouldn't have noticed even if she hadn't gone along with him to Japan. She is staying in the same hotel as Bob Harris (Bill Murray), a once-big movie star who is in Tokyo for a $2 million photo shoot for an ad for whiskey. Both suffering for jet lag and different stages of crises (Bob in midlife; Charlotte, quarterlife), they take to each other and become friends in their search for meaning in life.It's refreshing to see a movie that transcends the Woody Allen style of older man/younger woman relationships. Instead of the girl falling for the guy, they just become great friends, which is a whole lot more realistic. What helps with that relationship is obvious: the tenderness of the acting of both Murray and Johansson. They don't portray people just looking for a one-night stand, they need someone stable for their relationship. Writer/director Sofia Coppola really knows what she wants, and gives it to Murray and Johansson, who run with it and really make it work.What surprised me is how one scene could be so dramatic and sorrowful, and then jumping to a hilarious scene somewhere else. Often times, it doesn't work, but Coppola decided to take a risk. That was one risk that was worth taking. Murray is his usual deadpan self, but with a better grasp that this is a drama with comedic overtones, not the other way around as his other movies are. He stands out as the leading man, and he's what holds this movie together. Johansson, in my opinion, had the easier role. Her emotions were easier to convey and were more `out there'. She still excelled, though.It's movies like this that are hard to write reviews for.

146,WriterDave,Sofia Knows Movies and this one is Simply Amazing,10,7 October 2003,"It's so rare to see a movie like this (a simple two lost souls meeting in an alien land flick) work on so many levels, and it possesses a rare trifecta of surprises.  First, there is Bill Murray's performance, a most subtlety hilarious and heartbreakingly real portrayal of an over-the-hill actor named Bob still searching for identify and a way to connect to others.  Second, there is Sofia Coppola's direction.  It's both lovely and amazing to see her use the same dreamy fluidity in storytelling that she used in her directorial debut, ""The Virgin Suicides.""  There we were spellbound by her depiction of 1970's suburbia.  Here we are spellbound by her portrait of present day media-saturated Tokyo.  In both films, we revel in the characters lost in these mosaics.  The underlying continuity of themes in both films (which are very different stories surface wise) shows Coppola is a true auteur and could have just as compelling a career ahead of her as her father.  Thirdly and perhaps most surprisingly is the performance from Scarlett Johansson.  It's so nuanced, natural, and utterly compelling (those lips, those hips, that smile) that you can hardly believe such a mature performance could come from such a young woman.  Just as Sofia made me fall in love with Kirsten Dunst in ""The Virgin Suicides"" so I fell head over heals for Scarlett's lonely newlywed Charlotte and for Miss Johansson herself.There's a delightful array of small details and subplots to rejoice in here. The look at Japanese culture and their treatment of American tourists and celebrities is as entertaining as it is astute.  The little chats accompanying the slow progression of Charlotte and Bob's friendship ring true and are both funny and touching.  The silent moments in the film carry just as much weight as the ones filled with the wonderful soundtrack and dialogue.  And Anna Farris' hilarious send-up of Cameron Diaz comes across as frightfully truthful without ever seeming mean-spirited.  As of mid-October this is probably the best film of the year, and I suspect like Sofia's first film, it will age very well thanks to the rich details and truthful look at loneliness and the desire to be found.",Lost in Translation

Basically nothing really ever happens and you are left at the end wondering when it is going to begin. Bill Murray is NOT a good actor and he is NOT funny. The only good thing in the film is Scarlet Johannsen and that is just her beauty. The characters in this film are wooden and the story is virtually non existent. I firmly believe that some people are seeing things in this film are are just not there, in fact their reaction to this film reminds me of the way some react to so called Modern Art, they are just too afraid to say that it is rubbish. They seem to believe that it makes them more intelligent to act as if there is some hidden meaning. This film is incredibly dull and has no redeeming features whatsoever.",Lost in Translation

Bill Murray gives his finest performance to date and you can see that he could relate to the material. He plays an aging actor who has fallen on hard times and takes a job that will make him a lot of money but it is in something as undignified as a commercial.Coppola does a terrific job of showing us both Bob Harris, the character but she also shows Bill Murray, the screen character who has finally run out of gas. We even get a shot of a young Murray from an earlier film, with the old Murray staring in disbelief of what he is now.Scarlett Johansson is very touching as a woman who is totally confused about what she is and where she is going. Bob and her character Charlotte form a friendship and you can see that they might be falling for each other. One of the surprises of the plot was that it doesn't end with them having sex as is the normal standard in most films. Instead we get a shot of Johansson's disappointed look when she finds out that Bob has another woman in his hotel room.There are many exterior shots of Tokyo and it looks absolutely stunning and the way Coppola shows the Japanese people without condescending their culture, but still make it kind of funny is a tricky feat but she pulls it off.So what more can you say. Murray should have won the Oscar for this magnificent performance and Johansson should at least have been nominated.

154,ronakkotian,Simple but conveys so much,8,21 May 2021,"Sofia Coppola has made many interesting films but Lost in Translation is the one I hear about the most. Having finally seen it, I can say it's pretty great.Lost in Translation follows Bob, a married actor, and Charlotte, a young married woman, who form a bond after meeting with each other in Tokyo.It's crazy to think that a low budget film like this which was shot within a month with a relatively unknown actress at the time is still being analysed to this day. It goes to show how amazing stories can be told regardless of the budget you have.This is one of those films I feel will grow on me over time and with repeat viewings. There's so much to appreciate with the way Sofia Coppola made this film. Choosing Tokyo as the setting was a wonderful choice. Staying in an unknown part of the world as well as the language barrier present made me understand the loneliness felt by these two characters. The struggle Bob and Charlotte go through with their troubled marriages is conveyed beautifully by Coppola. It's done in a way that doesn't draw much attention to itself but we're still able to understand the thoughts and feelings of these two people. Coppola's script is also fantastic. The interactions between characters feel so real and play such an important role in creating and developing the bond between Bob and Charlotte. There were obvious routes Coppola could've taken with a story like this but I liked how she didn't resort to those clichés.The acting is extremely good. Scarlett Johansson did a great job conveying the loneliness and depression of her character. She really proved herself here to be an amazing actress. Bill Murray is the one who stole the show for me. His performance is not showy at all but so much can said about his character through the subtle expressions given in his performance.Lost in Translation is brilliant. Sofia Coppola proved herself to be a talented writer and director here. The only reason my rating is an eight eight now is because the film didn't connect with me as much as I would've liked. There are other movies like Her and Anomalisa which have resonated with me more but I feel after a few rewatches, Lost in Translation may bring out the same effect those two films did to me.",Lost in Translation

156,ruby_fff,An irresistible combination: Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson in a Sofia Coppola film set in Tokyo,8,8 February 2004,"Sofia Coppola's film ""Lost in Translation"" does seem like nothing much is happening. But beneath the nuanced, seemingly restrained, performance from Bill Murray as Bob Harris (very much his own movie star persona), much is happening. Scarlett Johansson's portrayal of Charlotte imperceptibly matches Murray with the right measure of sophistication. On the surface, it's like two lonely people, inadvertently met, casually chatting with each other, whiling away their time, and non-eventful events happen, subtly impacting each other's life. It all seem so naturally happening in the city of Tokyo, in and around the enclosed space of a high-rise luxurious hotel, 'home away from home' - there's an uneasiness at ease. It feels like a European film. There's no evident plotline or obvious story, yet I like ""Lost in Translation"" because of its delivery. Sofia Coppola has such a graphic visual eye. Just the beginning frame is impressive - the opening credits quietly appearing along a shapely curve - the on-screen image is alluring, inviting and prompts one wanting to know more. It's like a free fugue, the characters of Murray and Johansson floating between the hotel milieu and Tokyo by night. Gradually, we learn more about the two principals, and there's no barrier to the mutual affinity, age difference or not. It's Sofia Coppola's poetry in motion enhanced by the selective songs/music and (ambient) sound design, along with interspersed appearance by Giovanni Ribisi as Charlotte's husband John and a complementary Japanese cast making the viewing experience engagingly whole.  Cinematographer Lance Acord (Adaptation; Being John Malkovich) gave us the Tokyo that Sofia Coppola has in mind: people movements, graphic patterns - from the reflections in a passing car window, the dazzling neon from varying perspectives, the contrasting colors/moods of the locals vs. the foreigners, to the sidewalk parting at a crowded promenade where one 'disappearingly' lingers. ""Lost In Translation"" is an outstanding addition to Focus Features that gave us ""Far From Heaven,"" ""The Pianist,"" ""Talk to Her"" and  ""21 Grams."" It may not be for everyone, yet it's worth spending time with Murray and Johansson in Sofia Coppola's translated world if you appreciate the language of films.For more substantial story structure, try ""Miracle"" (the uplifting film about the 1980 US Olympic Hockey Team led by legendary coach Herb Brooks, convincingly portrayed by Kurt Russell), or ""Japanese Story"" (the intriguing Australian film with a distinctive lead performance by Toni Collette.)RESEND 2/8/04 ruby_fff",Lost in Translation
157,ruby_fff,The combination is irresistible - Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson in a Sofia Coppola film taking place in Tokyo,8,3 February 2004,"Yes, why do I like this seemingly 'nothing much happening' film? But there is a lot going on - the nuanced performance from Bill Murray in a sustaining restrained lead role not quite seen before. Psychologically, underneath - much is happening. On the surface it's like two lonely people, inadvertently met, wiling their time away. Bide for a while, and then a while. Time standing still for a while for these two souls on earth - nothing specific. Just be. Being there. The subtlety of it all. It's natural - there's an uneasiness at ease.If you ask me why I like ""Paycheck,"" I can quickly quip: I like Philip K. Dick's sci-fi short stories, and Uma Thurman and Ben Affleck is a new combination in an action movie directed by John Woo. It's not like at a social occasion giving a passing remark: Oh, I like it because. With ""Lost in Translation,"" can't respond in just a phrase or mere sentence.
It actually felt quite like a European film. The fact that there's no evident plotline or obvious story made it fall into non-mainstream category. However, hooray! it got recognized by fellow filmmakers/film professionals at the 2004 Academy Award nominations for the best motion picture of the year, best achievement in directing, and best writing, screenplay written directly for the screen - Sofia Coppola sure did, and YES, definitely, the best actor in a leading role by Bill Murray! Four nods are quite an accomplishment.Bill Murray's acceptance speech at the 2004 Golden Globes, right after Diane Keaton's zesty delivery for best actress nod in ""Something's Gotta Give"", was the second distinguishable highlight of the awards evening. His deadpan face, subtle words that were obviously biting and darn humorous, is simply delightful!What I like about ""Lost in Translation"" is in its delivery. Sofia Coppola has such a graphic visual eye. Just the beginning frame is impressive. (Reminds me of Woody Allen's Sweetland Films logo). How the opening credits appear along the shapely curve, quietly on the surface, yet the image on screen is intriguing already. It's refreshing. It's inviting. 'wanted to know more. The film is almost like a well-composed musical piece with its prelude, adagio, poi a poi, andante, dolcezza - it's free fugue for a duet, Murray and Johansson, floating between the Hyatt milieu and Tokyo by night. We get to know the two principals, slowly, by degrees, tempo picks up, flowing, pause, sweetness, softness felt - in spite of the age difference - there's no barrier to the mutual affinity. It's Sofia Coppola's poetry in motion.Johansson's portrayal of Charlotte is so unnoticeably perfect that it matches Murray's Bob Harris with just the right strength of subtlety. Cinematographer Lance Acord (Adaptation, Being John Malkovich) gave us the Tokyo that Sofia Coppola has in mind to share: graphic patterns, like the reflections in a passing car window, dazzling neons seen from different perspectives, the sidewalk parting at a crowded promenade where they disappearingly linger. The soundtrack of selected songs and music, and the sound designs certainly made the viewing experience whole.""Lost In Translation"" is yet another outstanding addition to the many films distributed by Focus Features: Far From Heaven, The Pianist, Talk to Her, 21 Grams.Another attempt at synopsis: two lonely souls, coincidentally met, drank together, casually chat with each other, and non-eventful events happen - impacting each other's life.

158,J_Batek_II,A Good Movie With Some Great Moments. Visually Interesting With Little Dialog.,7,20 July 2019,"To really understand this movie, you need to have had a vacation romance, or a 'summer fling', or met someone in a random airport bar, or met someone at camp as a teenager, or any other romance that was predestined to be temporary. Being in a foreign environment makes us emotionally vulnerable. When you connect with someone it seems extra special because you are in this special place under these special circumstances. Because it's temporary, you never get a chance to see the other person's flaws or shortcomings. A stranger can become an intimate companion in a matter of days. And, then they say goodbye.In my opinion, this movie gets a lot of things wrong. But, the one it REALLY gets right is the goodbye. The goodbye is always awkward. It's so hard. You never know what to say, because there is nothing to say that will ever make it less difficult. Sometimes you want to just avoid the goodbye, altogether - which is probably worse. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. Whether you ghost someone on the last day or you share an emotional goodbye in your final moments together, your heart gets ripped out either way.Despite all of the things that I might have found irritating about this film, Sophia Coppola created a sexy film with great shots of Japan, and she filmed a near perfect 'travel romance goodbye sequence'.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

160,DavidSim240183,Two people who lose and find themselves in each other,10,11 May 2006,"It's always a fascinating sight watching two people who don't speak the same language try to talk to each other. Even though they can't understand one another, they keep trying nonetheless. In the case of Bob and Charlotte in Lost in Translation, they can't decipher the cultural code of Tokyo, but understand each other's loneliness and dislocation.LIT makes the wise choice of introducing the characters of Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) individually. In fact they don't properly meet until half an hour into the film. Bob is a washed up actor who has arrived in Tokyo to shoot a commercial for whisky. Charlotte is with her husband, a photographer on assignment. She wasn't doing anything so decided to tag along.Since a lot of this film feels like we're observing these two, we watch as they go through the monotony of their routines, and how they eventually encounter each other. Bob shoots the adverts with no real enthusiasm, and is in it strictly for the money. His marriage feels even more distant than usual since he and his wife are occupying different time-zones. The culture clash of contemporary Tokyo is baffling to him, and he spends most of his time idling the hours away in the hotel bar or his room.Charlotte hasn't been married to her husband, John, for long and already she's beginning to feel she's made a huge mistake. They don't really have anything in common, and she spends her time either in her room contemplating her fate, or exploring the more serene side of Tokyo. Charlotte is a young woman wise far beyond her years, but her maturity is a mixed blessing, because although she sees the true reality of her marriage, she's at a loss what to do about it.Bob and Charlotte are staying at the same hotel, and they pass each other in lifts and crowded rooms, until one night when they can't sleep, they both find each other in the after hours of the hotel bar. Lost in Translation never makes any grand sweeping gestures, but allows the relationship between these kindred spirits to develop on its own.They exchange their reasons for being in Tokyo, their marriages, and their mutual confusion at the bizarre side of Japanese life. Despite their age difference, they sense each others loneliness and are driven to seek each other out.One of my favourite moments is when they go for a night out. Bob is wearing a very loud Hawaian shirt, which is an obvious cry for help. You'll notice that he turns it inside out, and keeps it that way for the rest of the night. Perhaps to symbolise his transition to introvert from the extrovert he used to be years ago. You'll notice some of the other people in similar shirts, and how different he looks. Again an example of how dislocated Bob feels.Bob and Charlotte explore the wild side of Tokyo's hot spots. Pot parties, pachinko parlours, and karaoke. If you listen carefully, there are hidden messages in their choice of songs. They hate the way their lives have become stuck in a rut of mediocrity, and will do anything to break free. The scene where they sit outside the party and just sit there in silence is a good way of showing that even in a crowded room, they still seek each other out.Spending more and more time together, they begin to share deeper confidences. Does marriage get any easier? What is important in life? The fact there aren't any easy answers only shows how astute Sofia Coppola's writing is.Bill Murray gives arguably his best performance since Groundhog Day. These are both similar films because of the way Murray is integral to their success. Bob Harris may as well be Bill Murray. Two middle aged actors who are at a turning point in their careers, and unsure of what to do next.Scarlett Johansson is equally impressive in her breakout role. She conveys all the right emotions of a young woman coming to grips with the harsh realities of married life, and generates an astonishing level of nuances with Bill Murray in terms of their relationship. She is quickly becoming one of my favourite actresses.Some of the observations about Japanese culture could seem borderline racist to some people. A demanding director, a camp TV presenter and a very odd masseuse spring to mind. But looked at beyond a superficial level, that is perhaps necessary to help establish the atmosphere of alienation and dislocation.Bob and Charlotte clearly have quite an impact on each other. Observe Bob's clumsy attempts to broaden his dialogue with his wife, or to willingly appear on a TV show that makes no sense to him. When he sleeps with a singer from the bar, you always feel like he's cheated on Charlotte instead of his wife.The scene in the sushi bar is very tense, and is the first real indication of animosity between these two. Of course they patch things up when the fire alarm goes off (possibly by Bob) and they share a last meal together.Then comes the day when they part company. That is such a fantastic scene because it crackles with sexual intensity just waiting to explode. The most talked about scene is when Bob whispers something in Charlotte's ear, but we don't hear it. It could have been any number of things, but I like to think its if Charlotte is ever feeling this lonely again, to come and find Bob.A touching, bittersweet ending to an unusual, understated romance that is all the more effective for its subtlety. You will need a fair bit of patience, because the pacing can seem deceptively slow. But given a chance, the crisp editing and keenly observed nuances will show you why Lost in Translation is hailed as a modern classic.",Lost in Translation

It's all in the mood, the images, and, in this case, the misunderstandings, the confusion. Nothing happens in this film, and that's exactly the point.

162,Flagrant-Baronessa,"Harmonic, tranquil... er, sedative, snooze-worthy",5,22 October 2006,"Some films are acquired tastes; there are readily-molded Hollywood blockbusters that leave nothing up for interpretation and then there are desperately quirky, off-beat and artsy 'gems' that leave everything up for interpretation. It is not rocket science to see that Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation mercilessly falls into the latter category. I have great difficulty in enjoying both extremes and tend to prefer more balanced films which is why I never truly took a liking to this film. That, and it sadly never manages to elevate itself above generic 'psuedo-indie' formula.Perhaps this label is unjustly applied because, on a basic level, Lost in Translation is a strangely enjoyable film about two strangely interesting characters. A 50-year-old man (Bill Murray) and a 20-something woman (Scarlett Johansson) find each other in the exile of the hotel bar in Tokyo; they are both lonely, jaded, and utterly bored with life and thus begin an unlikely friendship in the midst of having nothing to do. Unfortunately, Coppola never lets us get to know them besides that. Instead we follow the two only through an introspective zooming between them and their Tokyo environment, thereby pinning culture contrasts somewhere in between and the latter provides for some laughs in the film.The majority of this steadicam documentary stalking of Murray and Johansson is a listless, lifeless and pointless diversion that can only be entertaining to viewers who are totally oblivious to Japanese culture as the film clearly expects us to find the mere clichéd culture contrasts to be ""breathtaking"". Nevertheless, the photography is beautiful and seamlessly snaps up the locations in Japan; you want pick out every scene, frame it and hang it on your wall for the sheer cinematography of it. Soon this process plays on for far longer than it should and Lost in Translation wears out its welcome, clumsily falling back on a plot that is thinner than an Olsen twin. In other words, nothing else happens in the story besides harmonic visuals.This undoubtedly gives rise to a peculiar pace and this is where the 'acquired taste' truly kicks in. It moves slowly. Real slowly. Some say it epitomizes subtlety and Japanese tranquility and certainly it does; regrettably, it also falls prey to a truly sedative flow. If you were 'hypnotized' by this like many fans claim, it was probably because you were snoozing off. Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray certainly do not facilitate things plot-wise either. Here the film aptly showcases Murray's frighteningly limited range in inhabiting the 'poker-faced cynical middle-aged man' role that he recycles for every comedy and it pairs it with Johansson's comatose charisma and non-acting.As you can see, I am greatly conflicted when it comes to Lost in Translation. There is an admirable cinematic harmony in the film but it treads the balance between poignancy and pointlessness all too often and no doubt it tips over into listless nothingness a few times too many...5 out of 10",Lost in Translation

Well, I just can't pinpoint anything wrong with it. The acting is great (Bill Murray is always my favorite) and the directing is beautiful.

Then they could have renamed it: ""Lost In Litigation"".This movie is not only not funny, but the way it goes about trying to be funny is patently offensive. The only thing it's good at is showing how vacuous and shallow and addicted its main characters are. A washed up hack actor and a dilettante recent Yale graduate (in philosophy, no less) -- neither of which appears to be interested in anything, and as a result, neither one is particularly interesting. And we're supposed to believe that adding one loser to another loser ends up a winner? I don't think so.Murray's character displays no charm; he's self-absorbed; arrogant; can't remember his own son's birthday; can't sleep (which is interesting, since the more I watched him, the sleepier I got), and is the embodiment of a washed up, wasted life. About the only thing he seems interested in -- is drinking. There isn't much the script or camera can do to make this guy likable.Johansson's character represents the other end of the spectrum -- the new fresh faced Yale graduate who is mopey; anything BUT philosophical (or smart); stares out of windows and walks around video arcades; can't sleep; drinks a lot; and walks around a lot in her underwear. But now there's a difference between her and Murray -- the camera subtly seduces us with those not so subtle shots of Johannson in her panties. (There isn't much they can do with Murray in that regard.)Maybe the film should have paired Murray and Keith Richards -- then they could have had a contest to see which face had the deepest indentations and looked the most Jurassic, and then picked a winner.

167,supertom-3,Bill Murray in a good movie again? Thank God yes!,10,16 September 2004,"One of the films of last year in America, this came to our lovely British shores earlier this year. I have to admit I passed it by in theaters in preference of some more spectacle and action kind of fare. In truth I shouldn't have but this film does make great home viewing and doesn't lose anything whereas a big epic sort of film is always best viewed in the cinema. This marks a welcome return to form for Bill Murray as a leading man. Years have past since he did great films like Groundhog Day and it's a shame because he's a comical genius and a very good actor. As an actual actor I rate him higher than some of his comedy peers of his generation like Steve Martin and Dan Ackroyd. Murray is excellent in this film as actor Bob Harris, on the tail end of his popularity but on a commercial trip to Japan where he is still immensely popular (much like Hasselhof in Germany if you will.). So he is there earning money on making Whiskey adverts. He's bored, he's lost, he's in the middle of a mid-life crisis and is totally alone in a strange land. He then meets and starts a relationship with young, married Charlotte, played by Scarlett Johansson. Much has been made of Johansson with her success in this and Girl With a Pearl Earring and she is certainly one of the most promising young actresses around. She is uniquely gorgeous and has a distinct voice and very distinct looks, very beautiful eyes and lips and certainly is now a big Hollywood hotty. The film basically follows these two soul searchers as they spend time together and enjoy each others company. It's not sexual in any way initially, it's a pure friendship and there's almost a fatherly attitude from Bob. This film is very enjoyable. It's almost tragically funny at times and the characters are warm and likable. The biggest asset in this film is subtlety. The drama, comedy, direction, music and performances are all quietly contemplative and subtle. Sofia Coppolla, daughter of Francis (Godfather 1-3, Apocalypse Now) does a great job in directing this and as the scriptwriter she has created a heart warming and charming story of companionship through alienation. I loved the soundtrack in this too, all the music worked as did the scoring. This is most definitely one of the highlights of a primarily disappointing year. It's simplistic, not too taxing and nicely paced, it's just an immensely easy film to sit and enjoy. *****",Lost in Translation

169,Mike_Devine,Coppola's breakout film still translates nearly two decades later,7,8 March 2020,"The early 2000s were filled with films in which middle-aged actors who were perhaps just starting to reach the outer limits of their careers were recognized for quality work in indie films. 2003's 'Lost in Translation' is exhibit A of this trend, as Bill Murray played what could almost be considered a caricature of himself as a ""past his prime"" actor who finds work across the Pacific in Tokyo.Sofia Coppola's first major, critically acclaimed effort as director generated a lot of buzz (and biz) around its release, and its Academy Award for best original screenplay was well deserved. At the center of 'Translation' is the relationship that forms between Murray's Bob Harris and Scarlett Johansson's twentysomething Charlotte - a role that is really considered a breakout by many (sorry 'Eight-Legged Freaks'). Both Bob and Charlotte feel like prisoners in a foreign city, with neither of them really wanting to be there. Yet over the course of the film, we see an unlikely friendship develop, with some lessons learned along the way.The fact that 'Translation' is set in a city in which English is a second language also adds to its uniqueness, as it's another element that makes the two protagonists feel even more isolated. It's interesting that this film did not set off a domino effect of many others trying this out for effect.'Lost in Translation' is a little quirky, a little unorthodox, but a lot entertaining.",Lost in Translation

171,NoArrow,"Second only to The Lord of the Rings, this is the best movie of the year!",10,19 February 2004,"""Lost in Translation"" is Sofia Coppola's second film.  Her first was 1999's ""The Virgin Suicides"", which was a really great film...but it was super depressing, and didn't really make one want to watch it again.  Her second film, on the other hand, is a masterwork of inspiring romance, drama and comedy.  The story centers on Bob Harris (Bill Murray), a fading B-movie star who meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a young woman while the two are staying at the same hotel for a few weeks in Japan.Everything about this movie is wonderfully beautiful.  The acting, the locations, the writing, the cinematography, the direction...everything.  The story is so subtle in it's brilliance, it teaches a lot about life and love, and everyone should listen.The acting is also great.  Sure, we only really get to know Bob and Charlotte, but Murray and Johansson do so amazingly well.  By the end of the movie, you want to cry.  The Oscars made a very just decision nominating Murray (hopefully he'll win) and a very unjust one in forgetting Johansson. She goes all out and gets so into character...and really, am I suppose to believe that Diane Keaton did a better job in ""Something's Gotta Give""? Maybe if Johansson took her top off...""Lost in Translation"" is the only movie this year that I wouldn't mind if it beat ""Lord of the Rings"", a great film, I give it two thumbs up, four stars, and 8.5/10.",Lost in Translation
172,Mort-31,Strange encounter,8,18 October 2003,"My favourite actors are those who have their own special hilarious humour and do not completely lose it when cast in a so-called ""serious"" or ""sad"" movie. Bill Murray is such an actor. My favourite films are those like Punch-Drunk Love and Lost in Translation, where directors have used comical actors in non-comedies in intelligent ways, using their well-known kind of humour and playing with audiences' expectations. Coppola has written the role of Bob Harris for Bill Murray, and no one else yet known would have done a better job than him.But not only when you focus on its male lead, Lost in Translation is a wonderful film. Scarlett Johansson (of whom I admit I had never heard before) is young but strong, beautiful and mysterious, the perfect cast for the strangely fragile Charlotte she portrays. The ""chemistry"" between the two is fantastic, although they are of different age and experience.The first thirty minutes are funnier than most of what I saw this year. Afterwards the film retires a bit, becoming slower and more openly melancholic without giving up its humorous approach completely. How could it? The strange encounter between two strange people and a country which is even stranger must result in laughter at least a couple of times: be it a light or a depressed kind of laughter.And then there is Tokyo. I don't know how it comes but Coppola showed me this town quite like I imagined it to be (without ever having been there) but from very distant angles, which makes it appear really beautiful as well, not just gaudy, hectical and sterile.I think I should go to see this movie once again. But doing so, I believe, would only make me love it even more than I do now.And I should visit Tokyo.",Lost in Translation
173,kgprophet,An American in Japan,6,14 May 2007,"It took me awhile to get around to watching this Academy winning film. It certainly was not because of director Sophia Coppola or lead Bill Murray. But judging from what I had read about the movie, it seemed to be rather depressing, especially so for me. In 1989, I went to visit my girlfriend in Japan for three weeks. Americans there are gaijin, foreigners. Non- Asian foreigners stick out especially because you are tall and white, and have hair other colours than dark brown. A Japanese child will stop and point at you like you are a clown. If you walk into a shop, everyone will look at you. In this movie, being a symbol of the West as seen in movies and on television works to your advantage. Big celebrities, who don't want to appear selling out in the U.S.A., will appear in liquor ads and other products in Japan for millions of dollars. When I was there, I saw billboards and ads with Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, and Mickey Rourke. Bill Murray plays an action movie star, but really plays himself to a degree. He doesn't speak Japanese, and has a hard time coping with Japanese culture. Scarlett Johansson is also stranded in the same hotel, and they strike a platonic relationship. There were moments while watching the film that I could feel exactly what the main characters were feeling. My girlfriend also felt a similar disconnect from the surroundings while she lived there teaching English. The main past-time of singing Karaoke or playing games in noisy arcades was not my idea of fun. We spent a good deal of time watching movies instead. Of course, Japan wasn't always depressing, and my heart jumped during the scenes when Johansson visited Kyoto. Kyoto is mythical in it's beauty, and it was the most memorable part of my visit. In a way, I connected with both of these characters, because I was visiting while my girlfriend was working, but I also was the Lost American, trying to make nice with the natives. It was a sad time for me, I ended feeling like I couldn't wait for the 3 weeks to end and go home. I stayed the 3 weeks but we broke up the day before I left. **MAJOR SPOILER ALERT** In the final scene, there is some speculation about what Murray says to Johansson as they hug. I easily could tell, just by the tone of his voice. I believe he gave her the assurance that when she came back to the U.S. that they would get together again. That quiet and simple enough of a statement would elicit the smile and the comfort on her face. But it also allowed her to be comfortable with him leaving at the same time. **END SPOILER ALERT**Sophia Coppola wrote this story based on her own time in Japan while she was with music director Spike Jonze. She does a great job showing a rarely seen aspect about being a Gaijin in Japan. Murray gives us enough deadpan humour to offset the twilight zone time they spend acting like goldfish stuck in a fishbowl. For me, this movie translates well the feeling of being a foreigner.",Lost in Translation

I Can't Understand a Word!,7,16 July 2011,"Sofia Coppola writes and directs a tale of being lost, and how to come back to life with ""Lost in Translation"". Now, the story was interesting because it was brilliantly written and casted, and Sofia Coppola really brought a charm and a unique charisma to a story that involves friendship and fixing our life around. But to me it was just another well-written feature, and it just does not contain a real heart to the story, but the cast of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson created a well-known chemistry together. But even with great chemistry, writing, casting, and an imagination by the daughter of the 'Godfather' director, the film was kind of losing heart, and it was impossible to search for the love, but the message of the movie was uplifting. Anyways, the movie was kind of funny, but most of it was really trying to make me think that the movie was more like a comedy, instead of a heartfelt drama.

175,trpdean,Really disliked it,2,30 July 2006,"I agree with those who really disliked the movie. It was charmless. I cared for neither character because I never felt I'd any reason to like either one. Nor did I find them so beset with pressing problems that my pity was evoked - The man can routinely ring up his wife if he wishes to have a chat (though he's a way for a few days earning a few million dollars) and receives her attention with almost daily faxes and mail seeking his opinion on matters affecting them.And the young woman has a husband who seems to yearn for her company and seek to do whatever he can while there on business to make her happy.I felt I knew nothing of either of the principal characters - and never felt either had any serious problem with which I ought to be concerned.If I'd felt that there was a charm in the film -- some kind of wonderful dialogue or charming imaginative behavior in which the two engage, I'd have enjoyed it perhaps - even if I'd otherwise felt nothing for the characters -- but alas.(I do wonder sometimes why movies from 70 years ago seemed effortlessly to carry dialogue one would always remember (from Constance Bennett speaking to Cary Grant in Topper ro Myrna Loy speaking to William Powell in their 13 or so films -or Carole Lombard speaking to Fred MacMurray).Sadly this is just utterly charmless and flat.I am surprised I disliked it as much as I do - I'd not have seen it if I hadn't quite expected to like it.There really are quite good movies out there - don't waste your time.",Lost in Translation

177,smakawhat,gets it so right..,9,23 September 2003,"About 8 years ago I lived in South Korea for a short time.  There were three things that Lost in Translation reminded me of so much right away.  One was the very first things I saw while walking down a huge metropolis in 1995 was a giant billboard of Shannon Doherty selling perfume.  Another was turning on the TV and finding a very absent and different looking McCauly Caulken selling computers.Lost In Translation's story of a down and out actor shooting a whiskey commercial in Tokyo, could have just been about the absurdity of the situation.  But the main thing it gets so right, is the sense of culture shock and the sense that the little problems in life cause you great pain living and staying in a place you don't understand.  More importantly it becomes that time you pull through as one of the biggest life changing events you will ever witness.  That would have to be the third thing this film reminded me of so much.Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson are perfectly cast, as 2 Americans stuck in a world and time they don't quite understand.  Soffia Coppola's direction is superb, and is peppered with a great soundtrack setting the perfect mood. Then there are the little nuances that I could go on about forever that are done so well, the karaoke rooms, the temples, the hotel lounge, the endless concrete skylines, the overwhelming neon.. and so on..A film that stays with you, for a long time.Rating 9 out of 10",Lost in Translation
178,Hermit C-2,The reverse 'Gigli?',6,17 October 2003,"Being an ""art-house"" kind of guy, I was really looking forward to this picture, having seen the previews half-a-dozen times and taking in all the stellar reviews. So I was somewhat disappointed to find that when I actually saw the film, I spent a good bit of the time a little, well...bored. I'd give it a thumbs-up over a thumbs-down, certainly, but it wouldn't be an enthusiastic one.The big problem for me was the relationship between the two main characters. It just didn't click the way it should have. The character of Charlotte in particular seemed to me to be a little weakly drawn, and though Scarlett Johansson is definitely appealing, as an actress she doesn't look to me to be capable of turning in an outstanding performance yet. (Addendum: I was quickly disabused of this notion soon after when I saw 'Girl with a Pearl Earring!') Bill Murray's Bob Harris fares a lot better, but admit it, for all the praise he receives he isn't one of our greatest actors either. I found the ""evening out"" scene to be interminable--I knew it would be difficult if not impossible for the film to redeem itself totally after being so discomfited by it.I found Sofia Coppola's script to be far more the bigger problem here than her directing. Besides the characters and the relationship not really jelling for me, I was too often distracted by her minimalist (for lack of a better word) style that frequently cropped up. Too many scenes had scant dialog, music or even background noise for a film that was not profound enough to justify it.Having trashed 'LIT' pretty well, let me point out some of the good things in it, and there are a number. As intimated before, Coppola's direction is very nice in many places. The Japanese locale is not just a convenient exotic backdrop, it's an integral, indispensable part of the film. Her presentation of the country is wonderful. She captures the not only the marvelous sights so well, but also the country's culture, both the pure and the Western hybrid varieties. Oftentimes, to great effect, we see some odd happening going on and it's not explained to us. We stay just as bewildered as the characters, and this works very well indeed. And Murray's humor is made excellent use of also, whether he's tossing of the ""ring-a-ding-ding"" one-liners or, in the movie's funniest scene, trying to get rid of a gift of a Japanese role-playing hooker. Another great moment comes when Bob Harris is flipping channels trying to find something comprehensible on Japanese TV when he comes across his own image with dubbed-in voice--it's actually a clip of Murray from an old 'Saturday Night' show. Nice.It seems to me that this film might be a sort of reverse 'Gigli' for 2003: everyone seems as willing to believe the rave reviews about it as they were to accept unquestioningly all the bad things said about the Affleck/Lopez film. 'Lost in Translation' is an OK movie, certainly more good than bad, but don't feel like you have to act like it's a work of genius just because so many others say it is. You're not alone in your lesser opinion of it.",Lost in Translation

The two lead actors are great. The dialogue is very good. It´s everything cinema should be about. It seems to pay homage to Jarmusch masterpieces such as ""Down By Law"" although Lost in Translation is very different though. It´s so much like a trip to Tokyo. Not bad for the price of a DVD or a cinema ticket. And there´s no degrading sex-scenes or superflous emotions in the relations described. Everything is very credible like, say, in ""Good Will Hunting"". The examination of Buddhism´s role in Japanese culture is also very clever. The Americans basically doesn´t have a clue what Buddhism is about. The relations in this movie reminded me so much of my own relations to people.

180,bix171,A Bright Mix Of Story And Film,9,8 July 2004,"Sofia Coppola's efficient yet quirky romance is a very good engagement of two mediums, the short story and cinema. Using the technique of linking her converging story (two abandoned souls meet and form a gentle relationship while adrift in a foreign country) with short yet open-ended scenes, Coppola stays on course and doesn't descend into the dull trap of exposition--she succeeds in capturing the essence of a budding relationship, not the deep, complex flavor of it. Her script finds a popular American action film star (Bill Murray) in Tokyo to do some advertisements for a whiskey company; he meets the stranded young American wife (Scarlett Johansson) of a photographer (Giovanni Ribisi) and together they stumble into a relationship borne partly of their isolation and partly out of growing frustrations with their respective marriages. For all the usual observations and forced absurditities about foreign countries (naturally, the Japanese are seen as odd and other-worldly, pale imitations of Americans), Coppola's script is smart: she has insights that belie her youth and she circles the awkward relationship, allowing it to sneak up on you; by the end, even though it's still awkward, it's become accessible and you can easily infer what she doesn't want to tell you. Coppola gets an excellent performance from Johansson and a superior one from Murray; she seems to have captured him at a vulnerable point in his life--he's so in tune with his character's alienation that it appears to reflect his current point of view and not merely a function of the role. It also helps that he's frequently hilarious: his deadpan confusion gives the film a cinematic boost that makes Coppola's film seem less weighted down by its prose. It's a gently lulling picture, with unhurried rhythms; you never suffer the demand to feel that so many modern romantic films constantly thrust upon you and though there's an ambiguous, huddled ending, Coppola openly invites you to share your interpretation with her.",Lost in Translation
181,yris2002,A true love story: and the protagonists do NOT end up in bed!,8,2 June 2009,"After having seen Marie Antoinette and the Virgin Suicides, I came, as a result of a natural process, to see Lost in Translation, and I was so glad to find that same delicate, refined, and intelligent touch I had so much appreciated. Lost in translation is a movie, written and directed (let's not forget it) by a young director, capable of offering, despite her young age, intelligent and unexpected food for thought. What certainly surprised me, was the choice to portray the true love story between Ben and Charlotte without the predictable ending-up in bed, which really appears something rare, used as we are to cliché scripts, where each love story makes us predict that sooner or later we will have to see some sex scene. The scene where the two soul-mates are fully clothed in bed, talking about life is simply marvelous, and the sincerity and honesty of their words, leading to a single touch of the foot, is truly great. The accent is posed on the true and deep communion between two delicate and akin souls, on their capability to share emotions, thoughts, and the apparently boring and slow pace is aimed at giving value to such delicacy. In the end, almost as a miracle, everything remains in a perfect limb of the possible, of the unlived: this is not to say that sex couldn't have played a significant role within their story, but to underline how most important and spiritually binding elements come first, and that sometimes those experiences not lived until the utmost, but left uncompleted are still deeper and more real than those completely fulfilled, as if fixed in a perfect limb of the feasible. I would recommend this movie to young people, who encounter love for the first time, but not only, to people who think of love only as an experience to be consumed, and are not able to live and feel love, to understand that intimacy comes from within, and that there can be more complicity in a single touch or glance than in a sexual encounter. The male public will be maybe a little disappointed, but it's nice to see a fresh and natural Scarlett Johanson not in nude scenes, and appreciate her as a good convincing actress, Bill Murray delivers a very good and authentic performance. Eventually, a sad movie, but also rich in ironical and funny moments. Really worth seeing.",Lost in Translation
182,Eternality,"The production is excellent, letting us experience modern Japan without actually traveling there. But, the scope of the film is rather narrow.",8,11 January 2011,"Sofia Coppola is trying desperately to emulate her father's (Francis Ford Coppola) success. Her third film is no Godfather, but nonetheless, it's considered the best she has done so far. Lost In Translation is the type of film that can have scores ranging from 1/10 to 9/10, depending on individual taste. For me, it's a solidly-directed film, but it could have been a whole lot better.The emotional range of the film is quite limited. A heartbreaking scene doesn't make you go teary; A funny scene doesn't make you laugh out like a maniac. The construct of the film doesn't allow that to happen, no matter how hard the leading cast tries (Bill Murray, and Scarlett Johansson have wonderful chemistry though). Cinematography of Japan's bustling nightlife is a plus point. The screenplay is not as wonderful as it's claimed to be. I believe it won an Oscar only because the other nominees are weaker.The point I'm trying to make is that this is not a well-defined film. The production is excellent, letting us experience modern Japan without actually traveling there. But, the scope of the film is rather narrow.

183,shanfloyd,A beautiful and subtle film about alienation.,9,22 August 2005,"I, along with those who didn't like the film, found the movie boring. I also found it beautiful. That's because the theme of this movie is boredom. And that's clearly evident within the first fifteen minutes when the camera, the background music and the script depict the two lead characters' boredom with such a detailed illustration, such a deep passion. The beautiful solitary shots (like the one with Bob playing golf in his room) that presents the characters' sense of alienation in a foreign society are the assets of the film. The little things they did together, or the little talks they had are ultimately nothing in the busy everyday life one normally leads; but in their times of loneliness they were like heaven. And if you, the viewer, connect yourself to their boredom, you'll feel that too.This movie is also an example of how an excellent script can take the best out of the actors. See for Bill Murray, he's definitely not one of the best actors in this planet however good he is. But here he delivers a performance that would make any one those best actors quite proud. His subtle withdrawed nature with a sense of fine humor is excellent. Two particular moments: One is when he does the Roger Moore thing and the other is when he speaks to Charlotte about having kids. So contrasting moments, yet so fit together. For Scarlett Johansson, I've seen five of her films and after seeing this one I must admit this performance is of another level. Her character is intelligent and fun-loving, and she discovers something new in this world but she doesn't know how to deal with it. Johansson is flawless in that mood. Their chemistry is the film's another asset. They both come to realize that their relationship has no future, yet they want to utilize their unique bond every minute they stay together. The screenplay gives their deserved treatment (for example, when Bob confesses he doesn't want to go, Charlotte replies, ""So don't. Stay here with me and we'll form a jazz band."").Another interesting aspect of the film is how it describes Japan and the people. The flood of color and sound that represents the technologically advanced city of Tokyo and its fun-loving people are sometimes fruitfully contrasted with the solemn and peaceful atmosphere of the monastery that Charlotte visited. But Bob and Charlotte couldn't blend into any of them and it's nobody's fault. And sometimes their misadventures are quite hilarious, like the scene with Bob, the first ad director and the interpreter Ms. Kawasaki. All the Japanese actors in the film do not have much prior acting experience I believe, but they fit in excellently.Now I must finish my comment mentioning Sofia Coppola's name, because she is the true person behind this movie. As you see all the praises I've done regarding this film, all are her own brilliant work.",Lost in Translation
184,macpherr,That is Cultural Shock!,10,9 February 2004,"Sofia Coppola (`The Virgin Suicide') wrote and directed this movie. I watched and had a few laughs. I fail to see the movie as a comedy per se though.  It is actually sad to be alone abroad with no one to talk to, and to not understanding the language, habits, etc. All those people have cultural shock. I think it should be called `Cultural Shock' instead of `Lost in Translation.' I do not speak nor understand Japanese so I cannot tell if is there were things lost in translation. I know that some languages take at least a full sentences if not more, to translate in one English word.  I know that is the case in the romance languages, like Portuguese, for instance. They are just wordier. That is why multilinguals talking to an English speaking person in a foreign language,  will insert words in English, because there are no equivalent words. I think that she conveyed the idea of a cultural shock really well, and turned such a simple feeling into an Oscar nominated movie. That is what good movies are all about, making the audience re-live their own lives. A brilliant concept and well deserved nomination for Sofia. She is the first woman director to be nominated for an Oscar, and wish she would win, but this year I have the feeling the statuette will go to the hobbits.I don't get it, I am not into that type of movie. Bill Murray ( `Ghostbusters II') `Bob Harris' has a great character and great job. The guy is seriously doing his job and I look at him and laugh. Well deserved Golden Globe, and could have 'thunk' that it was true that he fired his agent and his personal trainer committed suicide. That what I am saying, he is telling us something terrible sad, and we think he is joking. Scarlett Johansson (`Girl with a Pearl Earring') `Griet' is a very good actress with a very promising future before her. My favorite Scene:  Bob Harris getting on the elevator, he looks like King Kong. When he stops the can to say good bye to the only blond in town. My favorite quote: Bob: `What kind of restaurant makes you cook your own food?' I highly recommend this movie. That is exactly how you feel in a different culture.

187,refresh_daemon,"A tale for outsiders, with a couple hiccups",7,22 December 2006,"After all the accolades have been done and gone for a year, I finally got around to watching this film. Suffice to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this mood/character piece by Sofia Coppola First of all, Lost In Translation has a lot more to do with the observational documentary aesthetic and storytelling than the regular fictional narrative that's common to Hollywood film, so if you want it looking for the standard formula for story, that is to say, if you're looking for a typical movie, you're going to be disappointed. This here is less about a traditional story and more about watching two people and developing an understanding of who they are, what they're dealing with and how they make a connection. But we get all this from the watching of them, rather than a clear narrative arc being presented to us (not to say that there isn't a story--but rather, it's a background for the characters).That said, the film does an impressive job exploring how our two characters, lost and self-alienated, cope or fail to cope with their situation. They find each other in a foreign environment and make a connection despite their melancholy and find a means to enjoy their time in Tokyo. I was convinced by the leads' portrayals of their characters and participated in the characters' emotions. I like the floating aspect of the direction and the ease by which the atmosphere is captured is an improvement on Coppola's The Virgin Suicides, and although there are still a couple of less than inspired moments, the capturing of the image coordinated with the acting and setups are still memorable.But, I have to say there were several times that I wanted to throw random objects at the screen because of lack of believability, including some of the ""interacting with silly Japanese"" setups that were fairly hard to believe--the humor is weak because it relies on prejudices that aren't informed. Although I understand the ""looking at it through the eye of someone who doesn't want to, nor cares to understand"" the contrast between very real characters and their empathy and the very unreal, often late-night-weekend-TV sketch comedy pieces leads to disconcerting conflict of tone in the film and has a touch of cultural arrogance.But those moments are not as common as the better moments in the film. Which is good, because I very much liked the rest of the film. Maybe it's because I often feel like an outsider floating around this city of Los Angeles, but I, as the third party, made a connection with these two souls lost in Tokyo. And sometimes finding that connection makes all the difference when you're lost in translation. 8/10.",Lost in Translation

I was lucky enough to see it without ever having heard any of the hype (I don't follow Hollywood anymore, since most of what's released is junk) or even knowing who directed it. I must say it was interesting the first time, but seemed somewhat long and a little bit confusing. The second time I saw the film, I really enjoyed everything about it more... the ambiance, the amazing chemistry between Johansson and Murray, and the basic story. This is both a hyper-modern and meandering tale, and not everyone's going to ""get"" it, or be able to get past the hype. It truly is not for everyone. I believe those who do enjoy it will really like it a lot... in a way, it's a ""love it or hate it"" sort of picture. Put my squarely in the 'love it' camp. This is somewhat to my own surprise, because this is not really ""my type"" of film. Yet I love it anyway. 9/10.",Lost in Translation
193,politic1983,Misguided,5,28 March 2020,"When I first saw Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" I was at university, I was idealistic and everybody saw me next Tuesday. People loved it (the film I mean); but a friend of mine told me he walked out of it. But most importantly, at that stage of my life I was an emerging Japanophile, who had never been to Japan, and in all actuality knew very little about the archipelago beyond a few computer games and having seen an above average number of Japanese films for a British person.But that was approaching two decades ago, and I'm now much more Japan-wise, having been a number of times, eaten ramen and know how to spell ""konnichiwa"" in both romaji and hiragana. It's been a number of years since I last watched Coppola's most regarded film to date - I can't remember when - and now older, the things that I always knew about the film are still present (perhaps now heightened). And while it has a certain charm, there is far more to dislike about this film than like.One thing I'd have probably changed about the film, is that I'd have made far more references to Japanese people being short in the opening ten minutes. The second thing I'd change is that I'd make far more references to Japanese pronunciation of R/L when speaking in English. When you watch an old, beloved TV show, you might find yourself surprised to find out-dated references to race/sex/gender which you'd forgotten and couldn't believe they were part this show you loved so much. But Coppola throws it out there straight away, packing as many casually racist elements into the first half hour as possible. As a film that so many refer to when discussing films set in/about Japan, there is very little of a Japanese perspective on show.All Japanese characters are peripheral, have few lines (beyond cheap gags) and merely serve our western leads. They far from have a voice. While still faltering perhaps, more recent crossover works, such as ""Isle of Dogs"" or ""Giri/Haji"", at least give the impression a Japanese person has been consulted before the script was finalised, and indeed even gave the Japanese cast some Nihon-go to speak. Here, the Japanese simply smile and politely laugh when the Americans speak and tryout a Japanese word (ironically probably pronounced incorrectly). If Scarlett Johansson's Charlotte spending half the film in her underwear is an ironic statement against the portrayal of women in cinema, all that work is undone by its treatment of the locals.Japan itself is also given short shrift in its portrayal. Little is shown of Tokyo beyond the obvious neon lights. At a time when tourism to Japan wasn't quite as high as the booming numbers of recent years, this gave the image of Japan that westerners wanted to have (and indeed Japan promotes): cool Japan, with bright lights and huge cities of skyscrapers; but also where the modern meets the old, with a temple thrown in here or there. This Japan is strange, exciting, crazy, like being on another planet. But what do we really see of it? The majority of the film is set in the hotel where our two leads temporarily reside, before quickly running through some neon-lit streets and pachinko parlours. Though this is perhaps true of much modern day travel.Going outside into the real world is shown as an escape, rather than exploring; and Charlotte's tears that she went to a temple and didn't feel anything state more about her sheltered life than the culture in which she finds herself. Reading Donald Richie's ""The Inland Sea"", he describes how parts of Japan are ""very attractive to a heritage-starved, history parched American,"" and one can see that this search for a meaning beyond is not a new problem.In an interview at the time of release, Coppola comes across in the same way as Johansson's Charlotte: someone seemingly unsure as what they really want to do with their life because those around her have afforded her the freedom to do so. A philosophy graduate with no direction, Charlotte spends the film wandering and wondering, somehow thinking she will find meaning in something. This is a notion Coppola executes well: modern day tourism as a vain attempt at immersing oneself in a culture, while we constantly crave home comforts. Travelling to another country won't give you the answers to finding yourself. Despite its imagery, this is far from a love letter to Tokyo, with the world of Japan largely gazed from the other side of a window, detached.Bill Murray's Bob is a man who has lost control of his own life, taking orders from his distant wife and agent. He, like Charlotte, has become a person with little to do each day and has regressed into the role of a child sneaking out for some fun. The struggles to cope with adapting to life in Japan parallel their struggles to adapt to a new life stage for both: Bob now a washed-up, out-of-work, middle-aged actor; Charlotte a young woman entering the real world without the necessary tools. What place do they have in this new world? Finding each other as kindred spirits in these life crises alleviates this holiday ennui.The supporting roles, namely Charlotte's husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) and Anna Faris as his casual acquaintance Kelly, are airhead products of MTV with little or nothing to really say and are obvious plot pieces to make Charlotte's plight seem all the more deeply rooted in her life. How and why has she found herself here?! While not the most likeable leads, Johansson and Murray do play them well, Murray the stand-out in a role that reinvigorated his career. Everyone else, however, is a little caricature.The film has a certain mood, a well-worked one, which is aided by the soundtrack, which is probably the film's strongest element. ""Girls"" by Death in Vegas plays as Murray enters Japan with a sense of coming up for air, drowned in the city's bright lights. When first arriving, you are entering a world of new sounds, sights and smells. Air's ""Alone in Kyoto"" is another standout, but one feels that perhaps some Japanese artists could have been afforded a place on the soundtrack.This mood also makes the film somewhat re-watchable - even if it took me years to watch it again - and there is a certain charm to it. Perhaps it's the atmosphere of Tokyo which westerners want to hold true, before having actually been there. A bit like a break in a nice hotel, it flatters you and is a nice break from reality, but sooner or later you find yourself wanting to return to the real world.This is a Japan of stylish photography and pretty pictures; of cultural stereotypes and amazement from outsiders. But like many when going on a holiday in a foreign culture, the host culture is heard, but are we really listening?",Lost in Translation
194,tributarystu,It's a matter of people,9,12 January 2004,"So it has been said, that this here production is the best of the year 2003. The only real adversary it had was Finding Nemo, not counting Mystic River and Kill Bill which I haven't seen. The ring guy was as predicted by me, and for me, just another movie in the series, which I consider purely...ok. Many things are at stake, once you dare to say that a movie is brilliant. Like the attitude which you, as an ""all-knowing"" movie goer, will have to it, especially if your preferences and hopes lie on another movie. I loved Finding Nemo, but this is something different. SpoilersIt's a movie about the most strangest of places in the world, which has had a tremendous ascension in nowadays life as we know it: Japan. Never would I have imagined such a vertical place. The verticality is obviously exploited by director Coppola and amazing sights are assured. The story itself might be somewhat disappointing. I totally understand why. If you were to tell someone what happens in this movie, you would say: Well, it's these two people, who spend a while in an astonishing place...and they just talk and talk and then they leave. I think the film lacks an actual story and it is more of a portrayal of characters. As a logic consequence, the actors carry a heavy burden upon their shoulders. And they carry it surprisingly well. Billy Murray has always been a charming actor, ideal for the guy who takes life more as a big game. He's in a ""mid life crisis"" and ""thinking"" of buying a Porsche. The first meeting. Scarlett Johanssen certainly surprised me with her beauty, despite some ""misfeatures"", and her natural talent. Both, Bob and Charlotte, as the characters are named, go through a rather disappointing period of life. They are actually very different people, but a beautiful friendship blossoms between them. You will learn more about them as the ""action"" develops and will learn to love them. Their relationship never seems to go past a certain mark and it all seems so very simple. And simple means pure. Beautiful script and directing.You will be amazed by a certain beauty of life and through wonderful music, the movie will conquer you if you are prepared to let yourself conquered. It's not the average movie you see every day, actually it is a great movie. It has higher aims than just the sentimental bond between Bob and Charlotte, as it asks essential questions about life, marriage and pleasure. Well, life includes all...There are many beautiful things to see and so I recommend you see them. Better sooner than later and better later than never. 9/10",Lost in Translation

I agree with the reviewer that this would have made a parody or comedy along the lines of the Mikado. I think it was meant to be a deep sexy feelgood movie with elements of comedy--it achieves none of this. Ms. Coppola better get of the coke and look at this with sober eyes.This movie drags and is boring. Yes it won an Oscar well surprise surprise Oscar rewards go mostly to PC stuff with some sort of twist that hasn't been done before (dogs in Mumbai etc..) but it is also a old boys town--Coppola's daughter etc...

197,tccandler,Everyone wants to be found.,10,4 February 2004,"""Everyone wants to be found.""I love films about 'old souls'.  Sofia Coppola's sophomore effort is masterful in its depiction of two such people, Bob and Charlotte, who find each other in a foreign land, surrounded by hoards of people who seem oblivious to the complexities and possibilities of human connection.Bill Murray stars as Bob Harris, a reasonably famous actor who is a little past his marketable prime.  He is in Tokyo to do a Santori Whiskey commercial, bored out of his mind and feeling tremendously lonely despite the constant attention from fans and advertising execs.  Scarlett Johansson plays Charlotte, a young woman wise beyond her years, who is in town with her photographer husband while he is on assignment shooting a rock band.Bob is disillusioned and slightly depressed... Charlotte is feeling slightly ignored by her husband.  You can tell that both of them are uncomfortable with other people -- They do not make friends easily.  But somehow, after a few chance encounters, glances across crowded elevators and knowing nods across hotel bars, they find each other.  Their conversations appear to be in slow motion when compared with the hustle and bustle of Tokyo nightlife. Everyone around them seems to be so consumed with business, partying, selling, drinking and blabbing.  Bob and Charlotte have thoughtful, meaningful conversation with a shared wit and sensibility that sets them apart from everyone else.  Together, they find those magical moments in life when they feel like they're the only two people on Earth.  And it is all so sad, because it ultimately feels like a film about what might have been.'Lost in Translation' is a great film because it captures those magical moments -- The sly smiles, the inadvertent touches that linger a shade too long, the truly comfortable silences and the secret conversations.  This film is about the little things that most people fly obliviously by while on their way to another meaningless encounter.This is one of the most memorable couples in film history, which is odd when you consider that they are both married to other people.  But Bob and Charlotte are memorable because they connect in ways that married couples are incapable of.  Sure, marriages can have beautiful moments and profound connections.  But they rarely sustain that initial wave of hope, those nervous butterflies, those breaks from the routine of destiny and day-to-day life.  This relationship comes to Bob and Charlotte when they most need it. There may not be a physical connection here, but there is an emotional one that seems to invigorate them and gives them hope to carry on in this lonely world.Consider the scene in the hotel room, as they are about to drift off into dreams, as their conversation meanders, but never wanes.  It is one of the best scenes I have ever seen, beautifully written, masterfully shot. Charlotte blankly states, ""I'm stuck.  Does it get easier?""  Bob replies, ""No.  Yes.  It gets easier.""  She jokes, ""Oh yeah... look at you.""  He says, ""Thanks.""  The final shot in that scene has Bob gently touching her foot as they fall asleep, and mumbling, ""You're not hopeless"".  There is such tenderness in that moment.I love this film.  It is the kind of film that you will want to watch when you need to be reminded that you are not alone.  However, it does require the viewer to provide something.  It demands patience and it also asks that you have at least a minor familiarity with either Bob's or Charlotte's emotions.  One has to be willing and able to admit that marriage is not always the pinnacle of human connection, that sometimes we need a new soul in our lives to provide a spark that might be lacking or lost.Bob and Charlotte were lost until they found each other, and that final whispered moment will remain theirs, and only theirs, forever.  I think that final scene promises, them and us, hope that they will meet again someday, in this world or the next.'Lost in Translation' is one of the very best films of 2003.  It is easy to understand why it is the most critically acclaimed film of the year, making more major top ten lists than any other film by far (Only 'Mystic River' and 'Lord of the Rings 3' came remotely close).  Both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson deliver powerful performances, worthy of Oscar consideration. Sofia Coppola announces herself as a major player in the directorial ranks with this film... although her writing may be the more laudable of her talents.  I will be first in line to see her next film.  'Lost in Translation' immediately contends for a spot in my 'All Time Greats' list... it is a glorious masterpiece. -- Critical Mass Movie Reviews",Lost in Translation
198,Bob Pr.,A very satisfying slice of life,9,19 October 2003,"This movie appeals on several levels.  It gives a vicarious travelogue of Tokyo, Japan, and Japanese culture.  It captures that sense of careening one can feel in a foreign culture, just barely in touch with a few who barely understand one's language. And the narrative tells the story of a relationship across generations, often with small humorous and poignant touches.Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is a recent Yale graduate who's been married two years to a successful fashion photographer who's involved in his own career and less than appreciative of her erudition and knowledge.  She's still unemployed, tagging along on this trip, having not yet ""found herself,"" and not yet sure of what she can do, or if or how she can validate herself.    Bob (Bill Murray) is an aging movie star cashing in on his celebrity by doing some Japanese whiskey commercials.  Bob faces parallel problems with his own personal life -- his wife of twenty-five years and their children are involved with each other but they have little emotional room for him.So for each, their personal lives -- which one always hopes will be a haven from other stresses -- is the source of major stresses.  And they're in the same Tokyo hotel.  With much spare time on their hands.They accidentally find each other and there's a gradual unfolding, a discovery, so the other becomes a source of emotional comfort, of understanding, and closeness despite their generational age differences. 
How much will their closeness develop?  How far will it go? That's what the movie is about.Murray and Johansson give absolutely charming, superb performances.",Lost in Translation

200,herbqedi,Bored in Japan as under-written and over-directed by Sofia Coppola,3,29 February 2004,"Yes, Bill Murray, in a tailor-made role, is excellent and memorable. Even in a weak movie, he was probably worth of being considered for an Oscar nomination.   However, in my humble opinion, this is a wanna-be art-house film masquerading as a movie that succeeds in neither endeavor.  The Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay nominations are ridiculous.Scarlett Johanssen and Bill Murray are two bored, disaffected, cynical, and self-absorbed Americans who are emotionally distant with their spouses. We spend two hours watching them make fun of a Tokyo they refuse to make the effort to understand or get personally involved with.  He's there, his acting career 20+ years behind him, to film a series of Suntory whiskey commercials.  She's there because of her husband's work as a photographer. They make fun of friends and acquaintances and their own spouses for their superficialities. She quickly diagnoses that he is in typical middle-age male crisis; he quickly admits to it.  They poke fun at the absurdity of life, and basically enjoy a platonic ""affair"" -- a loose and transitory union of two lost souls with little better to do, who recognize that misery loves company.That's it -- that's the entire script of the movie.  Period.  The rest is all ""intriguing"" camera angles revealing the shallowness of Japan, about 36 of Bill Murray's best deadpan facial expressions, all three of Ms. Johanssen's facial expressions, and an uninspired soundtrack.
In short, nothing happens, and unlike better-albeit-flawed art-house films like My Dinner at Andre's, nothing intriguing or remotely philosophical is explored.  This is actually reminiscent of 1973's ""a Touch of Class"" without the sex or the contrived situations.  given a choice of watching relentless ennui or sex and contrived situations, I'll take the latter every time.All of this, and most especially the absence of traditional contrivances such as plot and resolutions, makes it hip and original and a darling of the critics.  For those of us who travel for business, it's a two-hour compilation of the evenings we spent in various cities between appointments hanging out at hotel bars with nothing better to do.  This is boring in your own life and even less interesting watching two people who give you no reasons to care about them -- since they don't care about themselves or anybody else -- being even more bored.This also reminded me quite a bit of 2002's ""About Schmidt"", but not quite as pathetic.  About Schmidt made an additional mistake not made here -- casting Jack Nicholson as a midwestern Mr. Everyman!I think it's ludicrous that no American female has ever been nominated for Best Director before Sofia Coppola.  The only thing more ludicrous would be if she were to win the award for this pretensiously underwritten time-waster.This should have been called Bored in Japan -- just a tad more interesting than watching your Uncle Mike's vacation movies -- and even then, only if your Uncle Mike were not played by the ever-amazing Bill Murray.

The movie doesn't really need one, because the beauty is held within and never needs to be let out. So I'll try my best to translate the feelings the movie provokes from you...The acting was actually some of the best acting I've seen in a film, ever. You actually need to know the voice of subtly and use it, because the film doesn't need a clichéd relationship to carry it onward. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson were wonderful for this role, and something about it just provokes you to feel something you can't exactly put a finger on. I hate seeing bad reviews on here and elsewhere just because people didn't understand the clear message rolling out of it. It almost hurts me to see people finding this a bad movie, but that clearly states they have no heart or soul. The best thing about this film, besides the wonderful use of subtly and the acting, was the ending. The strangest thing is that I didn't want the film to end, kind of like how the characters felt in the movie. It made you CONNECT in a strange way, but you never realize it until the end before they break apart. They executed the ending just how real life would break itself apart, it was actually a perfect ending. I also really loved the setting of Japan. I mean all these movies show relationships in America, while sucking in all these American clichés, but the setting of Japan completes the film. It was such a strange sight to see, but see that was the point. I see Lost in Translation as a character study of two characters that completely randomly set out to find themselves. And it does exactly that. So what else do I say? I really don't know. Wait, isn't that the same feeling the characters in the movie were pressured to?I could go on and on and on about how profound the film really is, but I'm going to make this straight and to the point: see it if you can understand the use of subtly and realize it's not going to be like anything you've seen before.

203,stevenfallonnyc,Overrated but OK,6,29 December 2007,"There's no doubt that ""Lost In Translation"" is a ""good"" film. However, i definitely didn't like up to the amazing word of mouth I have heard about it.Simply put, it's just not directed that well at all. For one, there are many parts of the film in which nothing ""happens"" and many empty stretches where what you see is nothing more than space filler. Some may see this as ""artistic"" but there are ways to do this and keep the viewer interested. Sofia Coppola fails to do that here.She also fails to get the most out of the actors. While Bill Murray pretty much saves the picture, Coppola just doesn't get that much out of him or Scarlett Johansson it seems. Scarlet looks absolutely amazing so that helps, and she does well, but it just seems that a better director could have gotten more out of these two. They do fine, but both would have been better under someone else more capable. Murray, who is absolutely fantastic in ""Groundhog Day,"" just looks way to bored in certain scenes. He does drama very well, but he's not *that* good, leading me to believe he was bored as hell making the movie.The plot moves along very slowly and grudgingly, as if the movie really doesn't want to make the effort but because there are people in the theater (I think?), it has to show some sort of progression. It just seems very forced. This is where Murray and Johansson save the film, despite not being used to their fullest extent. They even save some completely useless and silly scenes, like the one in the stripper bar with that ridiculous song playing.The film tried to be a ""thinking"" person's film and would have succeeded have done properly.

206,HelloTexas11,"offbeat, amusing and melancholy",7,2 July 2008,"'Lost in Translation' would be a good movie to watch at a nearly empty matinée on a rainy weekday afternoon when you're feeling sorry for yourself. The reason being, you'll be able to relate to the two main characters, Bob and Charlotte, as that's what they spend a lot of time doing. The good news is, the movie doesn't wallow in self-pity, but rather uses a measure of it as a jumping off point for a relationship to form between them. This happens against the backdrop of Tokyo... but more on that in a moment. Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a somewhat over-the-hill movie star in Japan to film a whiskey commercial. People instinctively like him, because of his celebrity and the fact that he is charming and funny (when he wants to be). Most of the time, though, he is quiet and keeps to himself outside of public appearances. At first, Bob is anxious to finish the job and return home. Then he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) in the hotel bar and they gradually begin talking. They are both married, neither very happily, and they find in each other a playmate of sorts to pass the time with while stuck in Japan. Charlotte, who is much younger, is there with her husband, a photographer, who seems to find any excuse to go off without her. So she and Bob start finding things to do together, in a casual, unforced way. But they don't have an affair, in the romantic/sexual sense. Though it's never spoken, one can almost hear each of them thinking that they're not going to do something rash or stupid just because they're bored. It's also clear that there's a strong attraction between them, beyond just palling around together; each begins to feel the other is a kindred spirit and there is teasing and flirting, such as when they go to a karaoke party at a Japanese friend's apartment. But there is almost a palpable sense of relief in that neither feels obligated to pressure or be pressured by the other to have sex. All this goes on in the context of two people in Tokyo, strangers in a strange land, you might say. And the residents of that city are portrayed in a way that does indeed make them appear very odd. They seem almost like an alien race who have been brainwashed/corrupted by American and western culture. The Japanese have their own traditions, of course, and those are touched on. The American influence though is everywhere, distorted, as though drawn through a Japanese filter so that what emerges is familiar but warped, like the insane TV show Bob agrees to be interviewed on. I don't suppose any of this is particularly new, yet it makes quite a bizarre impression as presented in 'Lost in Translation,' and even the film's title is perhaps a comment on the dichotomies between Japanese and American society. Towards the end of the film, Bob has a one-night stand with a nightclub singer and Charlotte is angry about it. She isn't even sure why but she is. They go to lunch and there is a funny, snipy exchange-Charlotte- ""Well, she is closer to your age. You could talk about things you have in common, like, um, growing up in the '50's. Maybe she liked the movies you were making in the '70's, when you were still making movies."" Bob- ""Wasn't there anyone else there to lavish you with attention?""The movie's ending drew some criticism but it seemed perfect to me. On his way to the airport, Bob sees Charlotte walking down a crowded sidewalk, and he runs over to her; they embrace and he whispers something to her which we can't hear. Then they separate and he heads on to the airport. His expression makes clear to me that Bob is happier having spoken to her and has resolved to do something. You are left to your own conclusion but my impression is that they have agreed to meet back in the States. It's nice to think so, anyway. Bill Murray is essentially still playing Bill Murray in 'Lost in Translation,' but a muted, melancholy, toned-down version that is right for the film. And Scarlett Johansson is believable and fetching in a role that requires her to react to his long silent stares and she does so in a warm and credible manner. In fact, my main criticism of the movie is that there are TOO many of Murray's 'long silent stares.' You want to reach into the screen, shake him and yell, 'Say something!' But that said, 'Lost in Translation' manages to be sad, funny, and even a little uplifting when it's all said and done... depending on what you make of that ending.",Lost in Translation

How lives of two different people gets mixed up with genuine looking incidents and how they are a support to each other is beautifully demonstrated. The frustration of not understanding the language is very natural and this thing steals the show. The acting was good. Although some of the roles were shown to be inserted unnecessarily. People get bored and get into activities and thus meet some new incidents. From the starting I was waiting that something FAST would happen. But nothing like that happened.

I was mostly impressed with Sofia's directing, camera angles and truly breathtaking and brilliant screenplay. It's not very often you get shots as good as these in movies. This is a story about two people, an old, washed up actor Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and a twenty-five year old woman, Charlotte, (Scarlett Johansson) both in Tokyo in the same luxurious hotel. Bob is being payed 2 million dollars for a commercial and photo shoot to promote his whiskey, when he could be at home with his wife and kids doing a play, while Charlotte has been dragged along by her husband who is mostly away on business doing celebrity photographing. When they both meet, they click immediately. They both explore and try to fit in with the Japanese culture and mingle with friends of Charlotte's.With a huge gap of age difference and both of them married (though Bob is somewhat estranged from his wife and kids) they form a relationship that is much stronger than physical aspects. They share a mutual understanding of the confusion of both their private lives and the difficulty of trying to adapt themselves to a foreign place.A young woman trying to find her place in life and an older man past his prime, looking for something he used to have. Many people can relate to these characters, and that's what I love about movies. You feel the realness of their situations. This film is like American Beauty set in Japan. It lifts you high up from the ground and you'll want to remember the journey, and the message it sends.",Lost in Translation
209,cordenw,I've sorta been through this,7,13 September 2019,"Although not through the romance tension I hasten to add. I have a very happy relationship with my golden treasure of a wife.I've been to China a few times now and they have a social etiquette structure very similar to the Japanese when it comes to dealing with Westerners.Not many of them speak English and those that do always give you a very condensed version of what's been said in the local language. The problem is that they always leave out any social nuances.You never really know what they think of you as a person because they generally see you as a strange other species, or as a novelty. They will talk about you as if you weren't in the same room and have no hesitation in excluding you from conversations with their friends.
Westerners consider that rude but it's been explained to me many times that you don't have to be included if the conversation's not about you... go figure!And so you are... ""lost"".You get no clue from the written language as to where you are, or what kind of establishment you're in, because it's not something you can voice and you have no idea as to how their alphabet works. They carry on talking to you in their own language because they assume that you can understand.It's not all a bad experience, as they are unfailingly polite, generous and hospitable but it can be very frustrating to feel like you're the main act in a circus.In this movie that aspect is displayed very realistically and the karaoke scenes could have been filmed in any of the social gatherings I attended during my visits. If you don't participate they just carry on as if you weren't there and assume that you must be enjoying yourself because everyone else is having a hoot.I really like the way they capture the essence of the style of the American chain hotels in the Orient.
They are chrome, glass and velvet with low light chandeliers. They are executive themed, they always have someone on the piano throwing out muzak and each and every one that I've visited reminded me of Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion.So the director caught every subtle cultural difference and every nexus.If I had any issue with the film at all, it's that it does leave you feeling unresolved, but I think that's Sofia's point.Murray and Johansson put in excellent performances, they are like air bubbles floating in a champagne glass, which is how I felt most of the time I was in that part of the world.

211,lyubitelfilmov,The daughter of a genius reaches for heights or a monstrously long and damn boring reflection,2,27 October 2021,"Melodrama. The picture, the viewing of which I have been putting off for a very long time, and only now I was able to get to it. And I wish I hadn't done that. Disappointment, disappointment and disappointment again. And here's my brief opinion for you - A monstrously long and damn boring reflection. But, in order to be honest with you, I will sort out not only the minuses of this kin, but also the pros that were found, and which slightly smoothed out the storm of indignation that burns in my soul after watching this ""masterpiece"" of the daughter of a really talented director. This concludes the introduction, and I get to the point.So, the pros:
1. Japan - the picture clearly shows modern Japan from the point of view of a Western (and not only) person. Of course, it was impossible to show us everything, but the creators clearly succeeded in giving a general idea of the land of the rising sun. Features of mentality, architecture, way of life, values, manners of behavior. All this will be useful for people who have never been to Japan, or for those who are going to go there. For me personally, this ""masterpiece"" did not reveal anything new, since I already knew a lot, but I thank the creators for the excellent atmosphere and immersion.2. Scarlett Johansson - the young Scarlett is nice and pleasant here, although it was not worth waiting for a great acting game from her. These were her first steps. Cute face, and the figure is nothing like that.So, the cons:
1. Initial shots - Sofia Coppola! Do you want to show the whole essence of your work with these frames? Or are you gently sending all the critics of your ""masterpiece"" to this place? If the first, then I agree, if the second - well, the pharmacy is around the corner.2. Drawn-out scenes - do you like to watch when the hero of the picture gets drunk for a long time? Or does he sit at the window for a long time without doing anything? Or walking down the street? So I don't like that either. And this ""masterpiece"" is filled with such meaningless scenes that if you cut them all out, there will be about half an hour left, during which the director (excuse the word ""director"") perfectly conveys the main idea of his kin - two foreigners in an unfamiliar country are extremely lonely. Really? Who would have thought? You're not lying?3. Scenario holes - even in this simple scenario, Sofia managed to make logical mistakes and this only made her even more in a puddle, as they say in Russian megacities. Sofia? What did you take when you were writing the script? Can you share it?4. Humor - more precisely, it should have been here, but everything stupidly slides into an outright mockery of Japanese culture and they offer to laugh at it. There is no irony, there is no sarcasm (are these words familiar to Sofia at all?), there is no grotesque. They just expose Westerners and Japanese, they stupidly talk each in their own language, and it should be funny? Strange humor, definitely strange.5. Acting - we've already dealt with Scarlett, she shouldn't be scolded too much, but Bill? How did you get into this? Admit it, were you tortured? Have you been starved? Kept only on antidepressants? If so, then I will not scold, and if not, then your acting here is a wild horror and a nightmare, it's not surprising that now you have slipped into insignificant pictures, well, Wes Anderson also shoots you out of friendship.6. Dialogues - Sofia? Did the fifth graders help you with the script? It's just that the dialogues here are so primitive and cloying that there is a strong feeling that it was clearly written by children, but not by an adult woman.7. Terribly boring - I haven't watched such a boring picture for a long time. I remember Doctor Dolittle from 1967 from the last one, but at least you could look at Rex Harrison there. And what's here - yes, May! Studying the ceiling can be quite an exciting activity. Reading the spines of books, looking at posters, and anything can be more interesting than watching this ""masterpiece"". I wanted to turn it off at the fifth minute. Then on the twentieth, then on the fiftieth. But I'm a masochist! I'm looking through everything to the end, hoping to find at least something good, but not this time. The ""masterpiece"" as it was a protracted burden, so it remained until the end.So little of this, the picture was caressed by all international critics and the press, especially praised Sofia. This movie has received several awards. In short, the press and critics are corrupt not only in Russia. It is very sad when an empty and boring movie from relatives of famous directors receives all possible awards and nominations, and really good pictures from talented people go unnoticed only because these creators do not have money or connections to promote their creativity. By the way Sofia! When will you learn how to make a good movie? That this drudgery, that ""Fatal Temptation"" cause exclusively a gag reflex, and deserve the lowest ratings. Yes, nature has clearly rested on you. You'll never be able to compete with your really talented father.As a result, we have a monstrously prolonged and boring routine with vague humor, a good atmosphere of modern Japan, primitive dialogues, boring characters and no less boring music.My rating is 2 out of 10 and I do not recommend this picture for viewing!",Lost in Translation
212,robsta23,"Great Film, Some Argue little Narrative",9,13 February 2016,"After reading several articles/reviews on the film, scholars seem to agree on one key factor of the film: the aesthetics create a feeling of dislocation and anxiety for the viewer. Well, at least at the start of the film. We need to watch Lost in Translation in its entirety to move from this state of anxiety to a sort of peace of mind; this film definitely toys with emotion in a brilliant manner.There are many romance stories that happen in countries outside of the US - there is especially the cliché of setting romantic stories in Paris, France. Setting one in Tokyo, however, puts American audiences in a place that seems a very long way from home since the atmosphere is so different than American culture. It also doesn't help when the only other Americans in the movie hang out at the hotel lounge where Charlotte (Johansson) sees Bob (Murray) for the first time in the film. These characters explore the city which gives them a sense of escape when they feel trapped in this foreign land.It is clear in the first 15 minutes of the film that each of these leads feel imprisoned or disconnected in this strange land - Charlotte makes a phone call in which she tries to reveal this disconnection while in tears, but the woman on the other end doesn't hear this in her voice. Bob is visiting Tokyo to make money for a whiskey commercial while he would rather be doing something with more dignity, like a play back in the states. Both characters are married, but when they begin communicating and spending time with each other, each character seems to be a little more complete than before.If looking at this movie from a narrative perspective, this seems to have a lot of the traditional second act while it rushes through act one and act three feels more ambiguous than complete for some. It still follows the traditional three act structure, but other scholars do not see it that way. There is definitely more exploration with the aesthetics of the film than there is a cohesive story, but the story is still there. To get outside of narrative you have to watch something that is practically ONLY immersed in mood/visuals such as The Tree of Life.The acting is top notch in this film, and the casting of Bill Murray is a great choice. While this may seem more of a melodrama than a romantic comedy, the comedy is still there, and Murray's screen persona fits the character of Bob Harris perfectly. Johansson is also great in one of her early roles, almost hopeless when her character feels she is no longer connecting with her husband.Definitely not your typical rom/com, but it would be a shame to miss.3.5/4.0",Lost in Translation

Writer-director Sofia Coppola may or may not tell her own adolescent, not-so-average upbringing, but this tale is executed with a rare simplicity by Hollywood standards and paradoxically, therein lies both its strength and weakness. Culture clash is just one theme here, providing most of the laughs (I saw this with Swedish subtitles and the Japanese dialog was thankfully NOT translated, enabling character identification even more). However, I lack a certain punch somewhere in the overall emotional content - a need for significant, not necessarily melodramatic, events to avoid that the story is running on empty a bit much, which it does. So I cannot agree to the ubiquitous much-hailed 'granditude' of this picture; it's just too esoteric.But the final scene is overwhelmingly beautiful. We don't NEED to hear what Murray is saying to Johansson, and we're not meant to, either. It doesn't feel like a love story, nor a father & daughter drama, either - the characters are just united in alienation, not only by the setting, but also in their separate private lives. And still, nobody makes a suffering deadpan like Murray - and Johansson is arrestingly gorgeous!So, 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",Lost in Translation

It was good to watch and film that made you feel good while you watched it.  Maybe SPOILERS: Two people meeting and becoming close friends.  Not having sex with each other.

217,ilovedolby,We find a film with such inner meaning and depth that it moves us to understanding the characters through its own filmmaking style.,10,22 December 2003,"`Lost In Translation' is a film that explores loneliness in a rather unconventional way-between a middle-aged man and a girl nearly 25 years younger. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson play the principal characters, respectively. Their performances are outstanding; as is the direction from Sofia Coppola (`The Virgin Suicides'), who also wrote the screenplay. 	`Lost In Translation' tells the story of Bob (Murray) and Charlotte (Johansson). Bob is a struggling actor who ends up in Tokyo, Japan to do a liquor commercial. Charlotte is fresh out of college, following her husband, a photographer, to Tokyo. The two meet in the hotel where they are staying, late at night in a bar. Neither can sleep and both feel a deep sense of abandonment. Bob's marriage is on the rocks and every time he calls his wife for support, she gives him the cold shoulder. Charlotte's problem rests partially with her husband John (Giovanni Ribisi), as well. John is constantly busy with work and does not spend much time with his wife. He urges Charlotte to go out into the city and enjoy herself. But she can barely speak the language and has no one to spend time with. So she stays in her hotel room looking out on a large city, filled with peoplebut with no one for her. 	When Bob and Charlotte start hanging out, they develop a close friendship. They make their greatest connection while watching TV one night. Bob explains the problems with his wife, and brings up the subject about his children. He feels that having children has completely ended his life. However, he cannot deny that they are the most beautiful things that have ever happened to him. Charlotte goes on to explain her disillusionment with life-in particular that she was a philosophy major and has not found her niche in the world yet. Bob goes on to tell her, `You'll figure that out. The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let things upset you.' It is a simple analogy, but ever so accurate.	Is there love between the two? Yes and no. Director Coppola explores their friendship and chooses not to focus on the clichés of a love story. If there is love, it is not based on a simple infatuation from good looks or sexual want. Rather, it would be based on a deep understanding of each other and the respect that accompanies it. In that respect, an emotional love does exist. 	Many of the film's crucial conversations between Bob and Charlotte are kept quiet. We are not sure specifically what the two are telling each other-it could be sexual, or it could be plans the two are making that they want to keep secret. The reason that Coppola chose to write and direct the film in this way is that she does not want the audience to focus on the love aspect of the characters. Rather, the film wants us to focus on the unique friendship between these very different, but very much alike people. 	Also, the film has a great deal of music, but not a score as most films utilize. Without musical score, a film can lack feeling and depth. That is exactly what Coppola wanted here. Without music, the audience feels isolated from emotion as the characters do in the film. Therefore, the audience can relate more to them. 	In the end, we find a film with such inner meaning and depth that it moves us to understanding the characters through its own filmmaking style. ****",Lost in Translation
218,lotus_chief,"A beautiful, heart-warming film",9,28 June 2004,"**POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW**Lost In Translation is one of those films that I appreciated more, the more I watched.  I wasn't liking it much in the beginning; I felt it was slow and just a bit too artsy and weird (by weird I'm referring to the eccentric, 'colorful', disjointed Tokyo setting) to really like it.  I almost felt like Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) felt as I was watching LIT... suffering from major culture shock, not being able to settle into things initially.  But as the film progressed I was drawn more and more into the characters, the story and its settings.  The subtle growth of the connection between Bob and Charlotte was just beautiful to witness, and acted WONDERFULLY by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  Murray's performance has to be the most subtle, quiet Oscar-nominated performance I've ever watched.  The way he was able to express himself, not verbally but visually with his facial expressions and mannerisms, was evidence of the true talent he has as an actor.  I felt Johansson should've been recognized with an Oscar nod for her great work here as well...she was excellent alongside Murray; they made the perfect couple on-screen.  The ending was perfect for the film; I knew they couldn't get together in the end, but for all that they went through during their time in Tokyo I at least wanted Bob and Charlotte to acknowledge what they had.  I wanted them to give themselves closure to the time they spent together, and how much they really meant to one another, and they did that. It was a very romantic and heart-warming ending, and was very fitting for the film; in my opinion, any other ending would've hurt the movie.In regards to LIT winning an Oscar for Best Screenplay, I really can't see why it won.  There was some great dialogue spoken between Bob and Charlotte, particularly when they were on the bed together, but almost half of the film was in Japanese!  The screenplay just didn't jump out at me the way past winners (i.e. Usual Suspects) did.  I won't be suprised if Japanese people were a bit upset at how they were portrayed here; they really came off as warped & spaced-out.  I know better than to let a movie tell me how a culture is, but I couldn't help but ask myself if that's really how things are in Tokyo.  Lost In Translation is a beautiful film, and worth the fame and praise it got.  Kudos to Bill Murray and the beautiful Scarlett Johansson for their EXCELLENT performances.  For me, LIT is a film that will not be forgotten anytime soon.  Truly a heart-warming (can't describe it any other way), memorable experience that will be cherished for a long time.***1/2 out of **** stars.",Lost in Translation
219,Irie212,I think I know why this dreadful movie was acclaimed.,2,15 September 2009,"I'm probably wrong, but honestly I can only think of one reason that critics and the movie industry seemed to love this tediious, contrived, and artlessly racist movie: Bill Murray.Here's the basis of my theory (and please forgive the name-dropping, it's required to make my point): Celebrities are spotted quite often in New York. I've bumped into Harrison Ford on Madison Avenue, dined near Nicole Kidman , seen Uma Thurman browse jazz records and (separately) Ethan Hawke knock back neat whiskeys. Etc., etc. But in thirty years, only once have I ever seen a celebrity actually cause a stir—and not a stir among the general public, but among waiters at a very upscale restaurant, where celebrities are commonplace.It was Bill Murray. I was waiting for a friend, and happened to occupy a barstool that was near both the waiters' station and Murray's booth. The waiters were actually arguing over which of them got to fill his water glass next. They were neglecting other patrons. They were whispering and giggling. They were thrilled.The point is: Everybody loves Bill Murray. I've never seen a bad review of him, and let's face it, he's no Laurence Olivier. He's made some real clinkers (Zissou, Where the Buffalo Roam, Quick Change, Charlie's Angels, Get Smart), but he seems to float above them, a cynical, comical everyman that nobody hates.If his ""Lost in Translation"" character had been played by anyone else—say, Kurt Russell or Michael Keaton or Jeff Bridges (they're all about the same age, and all have comic/dramatic range)-- I suspect critics would have treated ""Lost in T"" the way they treated, say, ""3000 Miles to Graceland"" or ""Jack Frost"" or ""Nadine."" In other words, they would have had the courage to say, This film is atrocious.The moral: If you've got a dull, callow screenplay and a name like Coppola that'll get you funding, hire Bill Murray",Lost in Translation
220,Tiger_Mark,Visually and Spiritually Soothing,10,26 December 2003,"I think Copola finally got the right idea. Simplify your story, get a small cast that is incredibly talented, and let things happen by themselves. I have to admit, I thought that ""The Virgin Suicides"" was horrible! So when I heard that she was loose again, I figured, man, it must be nice being kin to Francis Ford Copola. However, Sofia comes through with the goods on this one. Oh sure, it does bog down a little towards the middle. However, all in all, it is a fine movie. I loved the great shots of Japan and the atmosphere shown through the camera. Scarlett Johansen is a huge star in the making (if not already) and Bill Murray, well, he is Bill Murray (an American ICON!) If you want to know what it is like to be truly isolated, this film shows it. Isolation in one of the most crowded cities in the world. It is this isolation that brings people together, people that would have never ever come together. And this is what happens, people that are alone in a foreign land, away from loved ones, come together. But just how close are they really?

221,ryan_kuhn,"""For relaxing times, make it Suntory time.""",8,13 February 2005,"Watching Lost In Translation reminded me of the first week I was in college. The world was foreign and new, and I knew very few people. That first week was difficult, as the only people I really communicated with were those I saw around my dorm. Now change college to job in Tokyo, and change dorm to hotel, and that is the setup for Lost In Translation, the critical favorite of 2003 that won director Sofia Coppola an Academy Award for best original screen play and nominations for best picture, direction and acting for Bill Murray. Murray plays actor Bob Harris who is in Tokyo to shoot commercials for a whiskey. The actual shooting takes very little time, so Harris has to fill the other hours in a place where he knows no one. The most poignant scene for me was when Harris plays golf all by himself at a beautiful golf course in the shadows of Mount Fuji. Golfing by yourself may be the most boring thing anyone could do. Sure, golf is fun and challenging, but the human interaction that occurs while on the course is what makes it what it is. Coppola couples the scene of loneliness with all out beauty, a brilliant green course, the mountain over the fairway, and just one man hitting his golf ball. Harris does find comfort in another lonely American, Charlotte, played by Scarlett Johansson, who's staying in the same hotel. She's in Japan with her new husband while he works, as a photographer. The two find comfort in each other, not for the cliché sexual reasons most movies these days would go, but rather to stave off boredom and overall loneliness. During the nights they spend together, they run around arcades and various other places in Tokyo that most Americans do not know about, and talk about life. Each is married, each not sure they are happy about it. By the end of the movie, we are expecting for them to fall in love, but they don't, and that's what I like about the movie. The easy way out is never taken, just two souls in a foreign land just trying to fill the hours and trying to figure out what it all means. The vastness of the long shots add a wonderful visual style to the film, adding the feeling small, out of water fish in a huge land that does not take them in.

222,lagriff05,Spellbinding.,10,27 June 2009,"This is a phenomenal movie centered around two lonely, misplaced people played by Bill Murray and Scarlet Johanson as they are both in Japan for career reasons. The drama level is high and the acting is great on all counts, with the atmosphere being mostly quiet and personal - certainly not the slick sheen of some other modern films. What I mainly like about this film is the incredibly realistic nature of it - it's just a movie about people, that's pretty much it. No pretension, no gimmicks, just a touching, funny and sometimes sad story about people and the way their lives interact and the way they think. That takes more talent than you'd think.I especially like how the movie has a little more respect for its audience and doesn't just lapse into a traditional romantic storyline with the typical trappings of that sort of style. Lost in Translation is interesting in that it doesn't do anything you'd expect - the characters never sleep together, there are no gratuitous sex scenes (or sex scenes at all), and when they finally kiss at the end, it's more sad than triumphant or sappy. Sure, these things aren't huge, but it's the little things that really matter in movies, and Lost in Translation emphasizes this more than anything.This movie doesn't sugar coat anything and it doesn't try to be any more cinematic than it has to be, and in that regards, it is worth a hundred miles more than any pre-processed comedy or romance movie you'll find some other big stars starring in.Lost in Translation is a movie that is just extremely pleasant to watch. Not everyone will like it, but a great many people will, and I'd recommend this wholeheartedly to anyone who likes and appreciates the art of film.

223,Ronin47,"Simple, funny and moving (***1/2)",9,19 October 2003,"Isn't it strange how it's often easier to open up and talk about your life, the meaning of everything and your own deepest problems with a complete stranger, as opposed to someone you've known your whole life?
This little irony is at the heart of ""Lost Of Translation"", a strange and funny comedy/drama set in the surreal neon jungle of Tokyo, Japan.
Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, an American movie star who is in Tokyo to earn an easy couple million by doing a commercial, as many American celebrities do. Bored, lonely, and feeling like a sell-out, he meets 19 year-old Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson from ""Ghost World"") who is staying in the same hotel and is also bored and lonely, even though she is there with her husband, a neglectful, high-strung photographer (Giovanni Ribisi).
If this were a Hollywood movie, this would be the set-up for a cheesy May-December romance plot, but ""Lost In Translation"" is much deeper than that. This is a movie about friendship between two people, decades apart in age but both unhappy in the same way, who are able to make the other happy for a brief time. It's about both the nervousness and freedom you feel when you're a long way from home in a strange place, interacting with a completely different culture. It's about looking out your hotel window, down to a city that is busily alive while your own life stands still. And it's funny, too. Bill Murray gives a performance that is funny, touching, and brilliantly deadpan - it's one of his best ever. And Scarlett Johansson does an amazing job forming such a convincing, poignant friendship with a man 34 years her senior. You really feel as if these two understand each other completely.
All vacations must end though, and both Bill and Charlotte have to get back to their regular lives, possibly never seeing each other again, which allows for one of the most realistic, moving final scenes I've seen in a while.
With all that, and a great soundtrack that features Elvis Costello, My Bloody Valentine, and the Jesus & Mary Chain, this is one of the best movies I've seen all year. This is only writer/director Sofia Coppola's second film (after 1999's creepy, enigmatic ""The Virgin Suicides"") and definitely moves her up from ""very promising"" to ""a sure thing"".

225,The_Orenda,Excellent.,8,20 July 2004,"'Lost in Translation' is definitely not for everyone. It is quiet, sombre, reflective, at times a depressing reminder, and a very hard movie to watch for someone accustomed to the multiplexes and expectant of a Hollywood feature with style and attitude. But guess what, this movie is art and is unbelievably beautiful. I have never seen anything this real in a long time.American actor Bob Harris is suffering the results of working in Japan and being married after many years. Charlotte is a student graduate who is suffering the marriage cracks after two years. They find each other lost in Tokyo and a friendship begins.Score one for 'L.I.T' is the absence of unnecessary music. The absence of something melodramatic to fill the mood was the biggest factor to making the film work. You can concentrate on understanding the characters and appreciating the world they are lost in. Score two: the acting. The subtle tones imply of people who are laid low by exactly what they are lost in. Murray and Ms. Johansson are perfect. Score three was seeing this movie never get caught up more than what it actually is, of two people finding and coping through each other from the worlds they are put through. I could go on forever, but to put it simply, if you like the big Hollywood features, do not watch this. People who ponder their existence and wonder what it's like through art, 'Lost in Translation' is your ticket.",Lost in Translation
226,arthera09,I don't like giving tens but this movie deserves it,10,18 March 2007,"This movie is perfect. There is not a moment in the movie that is not perfect. The soundtrack, the lighting, the acting and writing was impeccable. From the opening scene (which is just a shot of Scarlett's butt), to the passing streets as Bill Murray's character leaves. I think the tag lines and the description does not do the movie justice. This movie is not about a friendship, but about love. It gives us a good representation of the type of love out there and that there is love to be had out there between strangers that can be as powerful as any love one can feel in their lives. The moment when the two of them are in bed and Bill places his hand on Scarlett's foot is such an intimate moment and just summarizes the entire movie. This point is emphasized when Bill's character sleeps with the lounge singer and Scarlett's character gets mad. They both know that the act of sex means nothing when it comes to love, but they both cannot help letting it effect them because they care so much about each other. I love the ending and a lot of people want to know what Bill whispers in her ear, but I like that it is a secret that they will share and give a level of intimacy that one rarely sees in any movie. The movie is one of the funniest things and really shows that Bill Murray can act on so many levels. He is funny and tragic and perfect. It was this movie that made me fall in love with Scarlett have not seen her play a better character. I think she did an outstanding job and the scenes when she calls home and starts crying was very well done. The on location shooting really showed and it shows when done well it really improves the movie. I think a movie like this needed to be shot on location for the viewer and the actors to really get caught up in the moment. I could not help laughing for most of the movie and I always hate it when people say it is boring.",Lost in Translation
227,Torgo_Approves,Perfect.,10,23 March 2007,"Death in Vegas' spellbinding song ""Girls"" perfectly sets the tone for Sofia Coppola's second feature film, the bittersweet, intelligent, mature and absolutely wonderful Lost in Translation. Trying to summarize the movie is almost pointless because the emotions the film sparks within you (in my case, at least) can't be described in words. The basic story follows Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a washed-up, depressed actor and an emotionally confused newlywed respectively, as they accidentally meet on Park Hyatt Hotel in Tokyo. The two form an unusual bond, but a bond that is infinitely stronger than that which they share with their respective wife and husband (Charlotte's partner is a jittery photographer who doesn't pay very much attention to her; Bob's better half keeps calling him, pestering him about which colour they should choose for the carpet back home). Bob and Charlotte's relationship is not really a sexual thing so much as a matter of emotional understanding. They're both stuck in life, unsure of what to do with the rest of it and certainly not very satisfied with what they've done with it so far. It's very touching to watch, in a refreshingly non-sappy way.The film isn't all mid-life-crisis slit-your-wrists drama, though - it is also hilarious at many points, mainly thanks to Bill Murray, who turns deadpan exasperation into an artform in a role specifically written for him. The pressure on him is high because he is basically the heart and soul of the film, but he nails the part and he's so great I was really surprised to see that he was nominated for an Oscar (since the Academy rarely hands out awards to performances that are actually *good*). Scarlett Johansson is stunning and convincing in her role and more than holds her own against Murray. Giovanni Ribisi as the aforementioned dorky husband and Anna Faris as a brain dead actress are perfectly cast and it's hard not to hate them.Sofia Coppola's direction is amazing, both stylistically original, passionate and spellbinding. There are many gorgeous images of Tokyo on display here and she finds the right balance between these eye-catching visuals, Murray's comedy and Johansson's angst. Her style is very different from her father's and shouldn't be compared. She clearly shows that she is fully capable of having a career of her own without putting her faith in Hollywood nepotism.Favourite scenes? Bob's ""Santury time"" scene is pure comic gold, and the most emotional part, in my opinion, is the karaoke scene during Bob and Charlotte's night out, when Murray sings his version of Bryan Ferry's ""More than this"". The scene, the way I see it, says so much about the characters and what they're going through. In fact, I'd call it the most important scene in the entire film. Then again, maybe Sofia Coppola just wanted to hear Bill's awesome singing voice (he's actually really good!).Overall the film is just perfect. The acting, the direction, the soundtrack, plot, themes, humour, visuals... what's not to like? I know some were turned off by the supposedly ""slow"" pace, which I just thought helped the movie become more captivating. The central relationship needs to take its time to feel realistic. Honestly, what do you want, car chases? It's an existential drama, not Run Lola Run. Sheesh. For relaxing times... make it Lost in Translation time.",Lost in Translation
228,Ibuk,making great movies is in her genes,9,9 December 2008,"Sofia Coppola,daugther of legendary director Francis Ford Coppola made a very impressive debut with Lost In Translation. Even though this is her first movie you can clearly see he is completely in control. The performances from Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson were brilliant and the storyline was exceptional. Lost In Translation tells the story of an actor(Bill Murray)who goes to Japan to star in a couple of ads. He ends up in the same hotel as Scarlett Johanson who is on holiday with her husband,it is clearly obvious from the first scene that she is neglected by him. They meet in a bar one night and there is instantly a connection. Not a sexual one, more of a father-daugther one. In my opinion Bill Murray is trying to compensate for not being there for his own kids by being like a father to her. In the scene where Murray insists that Scarlett goes to the hospital to get something on her foot checked out is a great example. Then they go to see all the sights around Japan and that forms the rest of the story. To top it up all the movie is laced with funny instances that don't looked forced but is more natural. At the end of the movie there is a famous scene where they are hugging and they are saying something that is rather muffled. I don't know why but the movie struck a chord with me, I can't remember the last time I saw a movie where I got emotionally involved. LIT is a completely fulfilling experience about strangers spending time in a country that is alien to them.",Lost in Translation
229,pontifikator,"Excellent, thoughtful movie",8,6 December 2011,"Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this quietly excellent movie starring Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, and some other people who don't matter. The gist of the movie is that Bob Harris (Murray) and Charlotte (Johannsson) are alone in Tokyo with some time on their hands. They begin a caring, affectionate, sex-free relationship that can't go anywhere, and then it ends.Coppola contrasts the weird, alien world of Japan with relatively ordinary Americans stuck there for various reasons. Charlotte's husband is there on a job; she tagged along because they're recently married but she can't be with him while he works. Bob is a has-been American actor who's still popular in Japan, so he's paying the bills doing commercials for a whisky. Coppola does an entertaining job using Bob to show the discrepancies between the mores and lives of Japanese and those of Americans. Bob meets Charlotte, and each has the opportunity to share their mutual alienation with someone alike. Coppola's script is very good, and Bob and Charlotte's relationship grows naturally, although we know it's doomed because of their age difference. (Actually, it was nice for a change not to have a gorgeous twenty-something falling in love with a fifty-something guy, which seems to be the fantasy of all the men in Hollywood.) Johansson and Murray are wonderful in the film. The characters' relationship becomes relaxed as the two get to know each other and grow more comfortable with their affection, and the two actors wear the roles well. We follow them around as they explore Tokyo, have fun, sing, eat, and such - just a couple of tourists. The scenes of Tokyo, whether on the street or through their hotel windows add meaningfully to their lostness.Nothing much happens during the movie. We see the characters meet, grow together, then part as their worlds take them in other directions. It's a life we've all lived and know. A very good adult film that lets us look in on the lives of other competent adults who handle things appropriately for their ages -- things including loss.",Lost in Translation
230,jmaruyama,Best Appreciated By Those Who Have Traveled To Japan,8,16 February 2004,"I think ""Lost In Translation"" is best appreciated by those who have actually spent some time in Japan, especially Tokyo.  Having lived and studied in Tokyo, I really appreciated Sophia Coppla's movie and empathized with its characters as they tried not only to find themselves but also to adapt to a culture that can be a bit `foreign' at times.  The subtle winks at Japanese Pop Culture were really neat (the Japanese Strip Bars, the pachinko parlors, the odd and wacky TV Programs)  I also liked the references to things that really irk many foreigners (the mixing of `r's and `l's, the small shower stalls, the shabu-shabu eateries).  It sure is refreshing to see the Japanese portrayed normally and not as Samurai Sword wielding maniacs, corrupt businessmen, crazy tattooed Yakuza, overly apologetic buffoons or Sailor Uniformed lolitas.  I found `Lost In Translation' a bit slow at tim es but never overly boring.  It seemed to be reminiscent of Japanese films like those of the `Tora-San' series or `Shall We Dance'.  While at certain points it seemed like a travelogue for the Japan Travel Bureau (JTB), I was pleasantly surprised by how good the picture was and how it did not try to rely on Hollywood `love story' clichés.  Bill Murray was at his subdued best and Scarlett Johansson is extremely likable and appealing in her role. Anna Faris also puts in a terrific performance as Kelly (a not so-subtle parody of Cameron Diaz).",Lost in Translation

232,extravaluejotter,Lost - 1.5 Hours,2,18 August 2006,"I don't know if this is a true statistic but apparently 99% of Japanese people have never left Japan. About 70% of Americans never leave America, so there is a similarity between the two countries - they don't understand foreigners. Allegedly.While Japan keeps itself to itself, America makes a lot of loud pronouncements about freedom, good and evil etc and exports its soldiers to various trouble spots around the world to ""restore order"". Japan keeps the rest of the world at arm's length. America invites it in then wonders why it talks funny or won't eat pork.I imagine that most of the high scores for Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" come from Americans, because the film is not international. Yes it's well-acted and the photography is beautiful but it didn't really make me laugh or feel sad or do anything other than sit there watching, wondering when something interesting would happen.The film is shot from an exclusively American perspective. All Japs are short. All Japs talk funny when they speak English. All Japs are inscrutable. Jap media culture is nothing like good old American media culture. Wow, Sofia, you went all that way and that's all you could come up with? Maybe you should have stuck to acting. On second thoughts, maybe not. Remember Sofia's role as Mary Corleone in ""The Godfather III""? The ""Lip my tights"" sequence is a prime indicator that Sofia Coppola's script isn't half as clever as she thinks it is. Japanese people have difficulty with the ""L"" phone because it doesn't exist in their language. Spelt phonetically using Japanese katakana characters (common in the Japanese transcription of foreign words,) the English word ""Clap"" becomes ""Crap"". ""Rip"" remains as ""Rip"" after transcription. It's an out-dated and somewhat racist misconception that all south-east Asians reverse their L's and R's when they speak ""Engrish"".Apparently you get more out of ""Lost in Translation"" if you watch it again. No thanks. Even taking Bill Murray's perfect comic/dramatic performance into account, this film is too boring and too far up itself to warrant a second viewing.",Lost in Translation
233,Pavel-8,Velly good.,8,9 February 2004,"""Lost in Translation"" tells the story of two demographically different Americans who develop an intimate Platonic relationship while in Japan. Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, an aging movie star who has reluctantly made the trans-Pacific trek to cash in on a lucrative endorsement deal. Scarlett Johansson stars opposite Murray as Charlotte, a recently married young woman who is discovering that her marriage isn't what she thought it might be.
These two are the story of ""Lost in Translation,"" as only a couple other characters have significant parts in this dramedy. Therefore the effectiveness of the entire film relies upon the effectiveness of Murray, Johansson, and the script of writer/director/producer Sofia Coppola. Fortunately their work is absolutely up to the challenge. Coppola wrote an screenplay that could easily have turned into a grand indictment of Hollywood or marriage, but instead opted for the less-traveled, unpretentious road of simplicity, concentrating the entire film on her odd couple. In a deliberately paced film (very similar to Coppola's ""The Virgin Suicides"") such as this one, extraneous parts could have doomed it to mediocrity. But there are no gratuitous scenes that tell unneeded side stories, as each one either directly or indirectly leads back to the core relationship.Coppola and her crew emphasize the simplicity of the relationship by juxtaposing it with the vast size and craziness of bustling Tokyo. Times Square-esque shots of towering buildings with colossal dinosaurs and gaudy neon contrast wonderfully with two people quietly sitting at a sushi restaurant.In those quiet scenes, the onus is on the actors to move the film forward. This is a task much more difficult than most realize. Making true conversation heartfelt and impromptu without sounding fake is a vastly underappreciated art form, yet Johansson and Murray nail these scenes. Johansson in particular deserves credit for being every bit the equal of the veteran Murray, who no doubt improvised good chunks of their scenes. The scene on the bed merits individual praise. As the key point in the relationship, it is the fulcrum on which the entire film teeters. Had it failed, the film would not have garnered such praise. But it succeeds wildly, as the two characters open up to each other in gestures of true friendship rather than revert to one of the typical sexual encounters that plague many films.All of this good and well, but if no one can relate to the characters, then the film still isn't going anywhere. This is where Coppola's writing genius manifests itself. In her two leads, she has created characters that are at two of the most vulnerable times of a human's life. Johansson's just out of college and just-married character is still searching for her place in life, while Murray's fading actor is enduring a mid-life crisis of sorts. Having gone through similar issues, everyone can relate to at least one of their problems. That's the hook, and it works quite effectively.
""Lost in Translation"" has won the Golden Globe for Best Comedy/Musical, which is an interesting categorization considering that the meat of the story is anything but comedic. The humor lies in the little things (pun intended) relating to the differences in cultures, which Coppola and Murray masterfully point out in funny yet not disrespectful ways. Quirks like the low shower head and Murray's height discrepancy are small but very necessary aspects of the film, keeping the mood from becoming overbearingly dreary. Those moments plus the generally upbeat nature of the main characters infuse the film with vitality despite its somber subject matter.
If there's a complaint I have about this film, it's the lack of a compelling force that drives the narrative. The script is not a traditional three-act play with rising and falling action. The plot is extremely linear, moving forward consistently but not dynamically. Because the story was very well told, this didn't bother me much, but it is about the only thing holding the film back from utter greatness.Bottom Line: ""Lost in Translation"" is not a film that will leave you slack-jawed or emotionally drained. Therefore its excellence may not be initially appreciated. But upon mental review, I realized how little was wrong and how much was right with the film. It will stick with anyone who finds themselves in similar life circumstances to either character.  One of the best of 2003. 8/10",Lost in Translation

I could not believe that such a banal, vapid, incomprehensible and utterly dull script won an Oscar, but then Hollywood in general has descended into the lower depths of Hades where apparently it will languish forever. Sofia Coppola, of course, is a Coppola and a female and she can make a film. With credentials like those who cares if the film is a blistering bore with a storyline so whacked that trying to make sense of it is utterly impossible. Ms. Coppola knows nothing about life - like virtually all of the young people in Lotus Land - and because she knows nothing about life she couldn't tell the truth even if she were threatened with decapitation.

This is a trip unlike anything you've rarely taken before. Sofia Coppola actually makes you feel more in awe of the very real city of Tokyo than Peter Jackson does with his imaginative Middle Earth! Maybe because she manages to get under our skins, really conveying the very sad feeling of being... lost. But thankfully she sprinkles it with wonderful elements of comedy. Not surprisingly she wrote the screenplay with Bill Murray in mind, and he truly delivers the part of his life. Scarlett Johansson is devastatingly beautiful and together they make one of the oddest and wonderful screen-couples you will ever see. So all-ready from the get-go this movie has a lot of great things going for it.""Lost in Translation"" would however not be what it is if it had not been for the very keen eye of Sofia Coppala.

Emphasis on BIG SCREEN because this is the only way to experience ""Lost in Translation"". This is one of those movies that could loose much of it's impact on a TV-set.When the movie was over I had bonded with Murray and Johansson's characters so much I felt really sad having to leave their company.

But for the towering presence of Bill Murray, it would be no more memorable a piece of work than any of those high-quality one-off TV dramas the BBC used to churn out.Look up sardonic' in the Illustrated Oxford English Dictionary, and you'll probably find a picture of Murray. With a sidelong glance and the arch of an eyebrow, he raises the slight brief encounter' material to a higher level than any other living actor could hope to achieve.Nobody would contest that the script is wry and observant, but it's also rather smug.

The movie unspooled painlessly for the tiny audience watching it on a Saturday night in a midtown movie theater, but somehow one wanted more.  The big shock for me is that it was so highly rated by IMDB voters--either there is vote-rigging going on, or I'm missing something profound.

The movie painfully reveals its influence. This movie would have seemed profound and groundbreaking in 1963.  But in 2003, it seems trite.  We have a pushing-60 has-been action star  (Bill Murray), who's rueful over a disintegrating marriage and a career that has been reduced to hawking whiskey on Japanese television.  In other words, the Unhappy Middle-Aged Man.  But since he's earning TWO MILLION DOLLARS for appearing in the commercial, it's hard to empathize with this sad-sack clown.  In 2003, we need more than a man who KNOWS he's ridiculous, who KNOWS he has a ridiculous -- and ridiculously lucky -- life.  We're already a step ahead of Murray's character:  i.e., we know he's ridiculous, too.  In 1963 all this might have been a revelation.  Not so today.  And we have the beautiful, talented Scarlet Johansson as Charlotte, the young wife of a photographer who has abandoned her in the hotel while he's off working. Very unfortunately, Coppola makes Charlotte a philosophy graduate from Yale. This goes against the grain of much of what we see:  would a person like this even GET married to a fashion photographer?  would she listen to trashy, pop-culture self-help tapes?  would she -- Little Miss Philosophy-Degree-From-Yale, a presumable bookworm and culture-vulture -- be this morosely bored, anyway?Thus stranded together, Murray's Bob and Charlotte find each other while marooned in their Tokyo hotel.  We're ultimately meant to be touched by their growing friendship, mostly because of each character's sad backstory. But their backstories just aren't sad enough to merit sympathy, let alone all the melancholy that hangs over each of them in their separate hotel rooms.*Lost in Translation*  is not a terrible movie by any definition.  Murray and Johansson are quite fine, and manage some genuine chemistry.  Coppola is also a genial tour guide for Tokyo.  (Comments about this film being stereotyped or racist will surely come from politically correct knuckleheads who don't realize that any critique of Tokyo's modern culture is perforce a critique of American culture.  Downtown Tokyo looks a lot like Times Square on a busy night, after all.  Besides which, Coppola is at pains to show us glimpses of a truer, more traditional Japanese culture throughout the film.) But this movie is very easy to overrate, and the smart critic -- and viewer -- will likely fail to succumb to the impulse.",Lost in Translation
247,timmauk,They'll always have Toyko!,10,23 February 2004,"I hate it when they call a film like this a ""Comedy"" because that's misleading. Not to say there aren't funny moments. Bill Murray is always good at making awkward situations funny, but he is mostly playing it straight here. That's why so many people who are expecting a laugh out loud film will be very disappointed with ""Lost In Translation"".This is a film about two people who are not connecting with their spouses. They may have before but some how they have drifted away from each other. Now away in a foreign country these two meet and feel like they actually ""get each other"". Bill Murray plays a has been film star getting a chance to make a lot of money by making a Japanese whiskey commercial. His humor comes from the way he tries to understand and deal with the Japanese. Scarlett Johansson plays a former ivy league grad who doesn't know what to do with her life, other than being a wife to a entertainment photographer(Giovanni Ribisi). We see her move through Tokyo watching the Japanese live their daily life. She's amused by it all but it's still all alien to her. Bill is alone at his hotel and Scarlett's husband is off shooting pictures so she is alone as well. Both unable to sleep meet at the hotel bar and hit it off.
The thing I love about this film is that it does NOT follow the typical road that most stories like this would. There is no sex, just slight touches and glances. Even though he's old enough to be her father and she his daughter, they don't see each other like that. They connect on a different level, the mind, for which age means nothing. The movie ended not as I thought or hoped, but as it should have. They shared something meaningful and even though it wasn't long lasting, these moments shared will last them a lifetime. I am also VERY glad that the director/writer(Sofia Coppola) chose not to let us hear the final words of the film that were uttered by Murray into Johansson's ear. We just see her nodding, saying okay, and that final sweet kiss. This lets US imagine what he would have said to her before he went back to the states and his wife. I have always loved Bill Murray. Sofia Coppola wrote this film with him in mind and he does a brilliant job. This film made me fall in love with Scarlett Johansson. I liked her in ""Ghost World"" but now I can't wait to see ""The Girl with One Pearl Earring"". I must also mention the cinematography is fantastic. The sites and sounds of Tokyo were both breathtaking and overwelming. I'm sure it was done that way to give you an idea of what the characters were feeling about what was around them. Thank you Sofia for a truly wonderful original film.PS: Anna Faris who plays the dumb blonde ""action"" star is great. If you get the DVD, watch her extended interview session.

248,Camoo,One of the few perfect films,10,14 January 2013,"Lost in Translation either works or it doesn't work for you - and for many people it's a bargain for somewhere in between. It can be seen as a drama, and in many venues it was billed as a comedy - but for a certain segment of the audience it is I believe a profoundly moving and devastating story about an impossible love, told with simplicity and attention to detail; and with such careful modulation that the ground shakes during it's final moments. The criticism I've heard leveled at the film most often is that it dwells on the problems of the 'super rich', when the film isn't about that. The fact that these characters are from this background was the only way Coppola could tell this story in earnest; these characters are extensions of herself, and like it or not she was born into this kind of world. The purpose of the story isn't to evoke sympathy for the problems in these people's lives - rather, there's a universality to this idea that no matter where we are in this world, no matter how well things are going in our lives, we all have the ability to feel stranded. And no matter how stranded we feel in our lives, when the light of a human connection finds us it has the potential to illuminate our entire being.",Lost in Translation

251,DanB-4,"Slow Moving, But Outstanding",9,15 March 2004,"Lost In Translation was easily the most critically acclaimed movie of 2003. moviecitynews.com placed in on more Top 10 lists that any other film, including Return of the King and Mystic River. It is a small budget, low key film, made sparsely, filmed in a casual and meandering style, in which nothing really happens. Bill Murray is Bob Harris, an action movie star on the decline of his career. Unlike many of his colleagues, he has been married to the same woman for many years. He is in Tokyo for a commercial shoot for a Whiskey company. He will be paid very well, but laments that he should be somewhere else doing a play or something worthwhile.Scarlett Johansson is Charlotte, a young, beautiful girl, recently graduated from an Ivy League school and recently married to a workaholic photographer. She is in Japan to accompany her husband on a photo shoot, and possibly to discover herself. She is neglected and hurting and really does not know why.In a lesser film or a less insightful one, Bob and Charlotte would meet, fall in love, sleep together and run off in the end while Celine Dion belts out a ballad over the end credits. But Lost In Translation is not that film. It is an intense, deeply moving, deliberately paced character study that doesn't tell a story as much as it reveals it.Bob and Charlotte have a series of accidental meetings early in the film. This is intertwined with some flat out hilarious scenes of Bill Murray trying to relate to a Japanese commercial director, and Charlotte touring Tokyo. Eventually, the talk, dine, and spend all of their time together. The bulk of the film has the camera follow the two leads through the Tokyo night life while they meet people, go to parties, a hospital emergency room, a strip club and sushi restaurant. Many people I have spoke to about this film found it tedious to the point of being nearly unwatchable. To enjoy Lost In Translation, you have to appreciate not only dialogue but circumstance. This film spends most of its time letting the audience draw their own conclusions about what the leads are thinking and feeling. The ending typifies this technique, and you will either be deeply emotionally moved or completely dissatisfied. I loved this movie. I loved it for the way it slowly reveals the relationship with the two main characters, and allows us to draw our own conclusions. See it and judge for yourself. **** out of ****.",Lost in Translation
252,rcolgan,A Journey I Never Want To End,9,22 June 2015,"Lost in Translation is a very unique film. On the one time it can be incredibly funny, but at the same time is sidelined by a constant feeling of melancholy. We follow these characters throughout, but are constantly held at an arm's length from them. And Sofia Coppola plays with our expectations of what constitutes a typical Hollywood romance, bringing originality to the genre through the way she romanticises the atmosphere in Tokyo and creating a beautifully unusual relationship between two unlikely people. Firstly we have Bill Murray, who takes on his most dramatic and quite possibly his best role yet. His dry wit and subtle nuances are put to best use as he plays Bob Harris, a faded movie star who has taken a job filming a commercial for Suntory whisky. But whilst there he is thrown in a melancholy, dealing with a midlife crisis, questioning why he's doing an advert rather than taking more serious roles and a wife who seems to no longer need him. On top of this whilst working on his commercial he's the only American there, unable to have a conversation with anyone. Those who do speak English seem to say to him the bare minimum giving basic instructions like ""turn and look in camera"". Then there's Scarlett Johansson, in one of her earliest roles as a young bride of a photographer. She's there with her husband, but just like Murray's character she's trapped in the same state of isolation and melancholy. With nothing to do she spends most of the day alone lounging around at home not even needing to put on pants and when she does go out she's lost in an unfamiliar world with nobody to share such unusual sights with. The short time that her husband is there he seems to be more interested in talking to a blonde actress than he does in spending time with her, leaving her feeling even more alone when her husband is there.But after 30 minutes stuck in this melancholy, these two lonely souls finally cross paths and together they spark something of an unusual relationship. We finally begin to see the characters break from their state of melancholy as they (along with us) start to see the beauty of Tokyo along with having fun at last. Whether they bond from a genuine connection or for their need to find someone else in such a lonely place, they finally seems to have found joy with one another. One thing that makes this relationship stick out from the standard Hollywood romance is that Coppola shows much about are characters in unusual ways. Instead of just having a conversation about how alone they feel abroad, we get to see it through having them feel separated from all the people around them in every shot. Then there's their relationship which Coppola leaves deliberately ambiguous most of the time so we feel the same kind of distance that they feel in being in a foreign land.Another thing that really caught my eye in the film is how beautiful Coppola made the city of Tokyo.She does a great job at exploring it with different kinds of shots ranging from packed streets to the quiet surroundings of a monk, with Coppola romanticising the city and showing its true beauty. This beauty can be found in larger parts like the sight of the glowing city at night or through smaller touches like a Japanese couple in Kimono's walking about. Just like Woody Allen with Manhattan, it feels like Coppola has a real love of the feel of the city as she showcases it spectacularly throughout the film. This is a film that really seems to resonate with me the more I watch it. Every time I seem to leave with an even greater appreciation of the complex characters and gorgeous visuals. More than that I think there's still so much about the film I've yet to figure out. There's so much ambiguity between the pair that with each viewing I feel like I walk away learning a little more about this film and it's characters.",Lost in Translation

It wasn't that good.  It had its moments, but it wasn't very memorable.  I'm not sure why critics were falling all over each other to praise it.  Bill Murray is funny in a very subdued way, and Scarlett Johansson is pretty and charming throughout. Nevertheless, ""Groundhog Day"" still remains Murray's best performance, and ""Ghost World"" is still Johansson's.Sofia Coppola directs the film quite skillfully, but the problem is her script.  The relationship between Murray and Johansson just isn't that interesting, and rather contrived.  The ""cultural differences"" they run into don't resonate very much, if anything, Tokyo comes across as much too capitalistic and westernized.

Meandering through the script like a half-baked zombie in a morgue which was probably his intention, Bill Murray does a fine job in underacting and evoking his alienated movie-star tourist persona. Scarlett Johansson also shares Murray's alienation but channels it in a subtler manner. The best aspect of the film is its visual beauty. The lensing is similar to Christopher Doyle's atmospheric work in Chungking Express, but here the austerity and anoynymous spaces that the characters inhabit match the abstract sense of detached reality Coppola evokes so effectively.",Lost in Translation

Exchanging business card, having drinks after office hour... romantic encounters, so to speak.  In actuality, ""Lost in translation"" is ever-playing on this world stage of intensifying human mobility.Linguistic knowledge, nationality and age are determining factors of a viewer's opinions and feeling to this movie.  Catharsis cannot show me its smug smile because personally I know some Japanese and German, besides, both Asian and Western ideas are not unfamiliar to me.  Regretfully, even if I were in Charlotte or Bob's shoes, I would not feel anything too annoying.  I am not lost in translation, anyway.  Perhaps, if the setting is changed to: Asians, Chisinau (Moldova), I may have empathy.What I like the most about the movie is how the characters deal with their growing feeling to each other.  What they do is closer to reality.  I never believe that all frequent business travellers are so lustful that they cannot control their hormonal drive when they are in another country as some movies so ""vividly"" depict.  In a way, it reminds me how people maturely deal with their out-of-wedlock relationship, namely Peter Chan's ""Comrades: Almost a Love Story"", Kar-wai Wong's ""In the Mood for Love"" and Ulu Grosbard's ""Falling in love"".  The ending though carries the air of that of ""Roman Holiday"", yet I do think, despite the age disparity, Charlotte and Bob can be friends when they return home.

259,MrBiddle,For relaxing times. Make it Suntory time.,8,30 June 2005,"At first viewing you'd think the scenes were put together arbitrarily. Lost In Translation demands a second viewing to fully appreciate how Sofia Coppola makes the movie actually live up to it's title. There is indeed cohesion of scenes, if only just merely referencing something earlier as opposed to the standard blatant foreshadowing and payoffs. Such as the smile at the elevator. And Charlotte, when she was all by herself really did bang her toe up hard. All I'm saying is that the cohesion is very subdued, and you don't exactly get the KILLER SHARK feel of the story moving forward. You'll get the impression that the way Sofia tells the story is rather frivolous but it's not. Bob's character arc bends 180 degrees when he DOES want to stay to be with the Johnny Carson of Japan guy. I don't wanna spoil anything but you'll know why this character arc surfaces when you watch the film. And there is still the conflict in each scene - and Bob's relationship with his wife comes to the apex of bitterness in a bathtub scene later in the movie. Speaking of bitterness, Charlotte becomes this way a little later in the film when something unexpected happens. ""I guess you're busy"", Charlotte says that's all I'm gonna give a way as a hint to what I'm talking about. Sofia Coppola does know what she's doing and after what she has put you through with the rest of the film, the ending ultimately becomes a depressing payoff. As Bob regains level headedness and his arc has gone to a complete 360. And despite this praise I am giving Coppola - know that the way she writes narrative on page she was criticized for her work reading like that of a first year film student. But I guess the technicalities of the page in the screen writing craft don't matter, it's ultimately the execution and how you pull off your sleight of hand when you tell the story. I said a depressing payoff - but yes the payoff this similar reaction Coppola has also managed to do in her movie THE VIRGIN SUICIDES where the ending is spilled at the beginning but when you get to it, you feel like you've been riding a vehicle that hit a hard sudden brake. I guess that's skill from the writer-director. And in those moments where Bob and Charlotte are happy-go-lucky, we as the audience would love to unwind as we have been put under pressure earlier exempli gratia Bob having to go through that irritating shoot of the commercial Suntory Time or Charlotte just really lost and bitter as she confides with someone in the telephone with some tears. I reiterate, you must reserve judgment - something I have failed to do until two or three viewings. Ultimately, what you will think of this movie's subdued acting, and storytelling is subjective but as the saying goes you truly haven't seen a film unless you've seen it three times. Is this one of the movie's failures because it didn't manage to hit me hard on first viewing? If it is, then this doesn't deserve the recognition it got in the Oscars. But NO. No, in my opinion Lost in Translation isn't overrated. A-",Lost in Translation

I don't really know how to explain it, there's just something about the way this film moves and flows, and the mood it sets. Something that made me feel extremely content and happy.Since it was the most notable thing about this film to me, I'll start with how it made me feel. Although, it can at times be hectic and fast, at the end of the day, Lost in Translation completely calmed me down. By the time the end credits started rolling, I felt like I had been lost in a whole other world. A world that I would've liked to have stayed in for longer. It's impossible to explain the feeling I had. Some words that might begin to start describing it could be tranquil, content and happy. The mood that this film has is simply magical. It all feels like a dream, and as the final scene comes along, I felt like I, and the characters, woke up to a reality better than the one before.It's hard to describe how I feel about this movie. I think that it's much more an experience than it is just a film. And as with all experiences, they tend to be very personal. I got something out of this film that no else has. And anyone else watching will do the same. The scenes and moments will mean different things to everyone, and we will all find our own meaning in it. I have really learned to love these types of movies lately, and perhaps that's the reason why I liked this one as much as I did. There's something special about a film that is different for everyone. I think it makes the movie stay with you longer, and it ends up being a much more meaningful experience.The only thing that bothered me about this film was the way it significantly slowed down after the first hour or so. Although this film is quite slow at all times, those 20 minutes after the first hour felt a little too slow. However, even though I would've preferred it to be a bit quicker at times, the slowness does allow time for reflection. Something that greatly benefits the film as a whole.I'm sure that many people will find this film to be too slow. It does indeed require a very certain mindset to be enjoyed. But, if you do have that mindset, or if you like slow films that are meant to be experienced, Lost in Translation is wonderful.

264,heyimmyx,Immy's review : Compelling,10,2 August 2020,"I would definitely call this movie a masterpiece. The cinematography, music, acting, the simplistic yet emotional storytelling, all makes this an incredible experience. The film centres on two lost souls in Tokyo, both feeling culturally and personally isolated, and questioning their existence and purposes. Despite being at different stages of their life, they both form a strange but unprecedented connection, deeper and more real than most. I absolutely adored the cinematography and shots of late night Tokyo, producing a dim but dreamy and ethereal vibe, further emphasising the disconnection and isolation that the two protagonists feel. The atmosphere of the movie was heavy and morbid, as we experience the disconnection of the two characters from the world around them. Bill Murray was incredible, portraying a washed out movie star who is fed up of his life and his career. Somehow his expressionless faces conveyed so much emotion and sorrow. He looked worn out and tired throughout the entire movie, as if he didn't want to be here. I find it fantastic when actors can act without having to convey much in their emotions. Scarletts acting was also top notch, portraying a young and newly wed collage graduate already beginning to question her life. Their chemistry was strong and compelling, finding an unlikely solace in each others company, and soon they began to love the place that they had previously loathed. I love how the film shows that it's your connection with others and who you're with that change the way you look at a place. On their own, they struggled with communication and cultural assimilation with the Japanese, however together they were able to look past that and soon found the fun in it. Together, their alienation disappeared. The relationship was atypical and far from mainstream, making this movie much more thought provoking and real than the average Hollywood romance. The music was surreal and atmospheric, exuding the dreamy and hazel like vibe of the movie. I loved their nights out in the city, exploring the nightlife of Tokyo and having fun, thus becoming their true selves and taking on a carefree vibe. The ending was beautiful, adding a mysterious yet bittersweet feel to their last meeting, before finally going back to their old, dull lives. Overall, this movie transports you to a whole new world, something rare in movies. Highly recommend!",Lost in Translation

But if you can find somebody to talk, thing will be different. Bob and Charlotte came to know each other accidentally, though they arrived at Tokyo for different purpose at the same time. They were both boring of present life. The more they knew each other, the closer between them. I was glad that they had no sex relationship. If that happened, the movie would be downgraded to an ordinary movie.It had a positive ending. Although I did not know what Bob said to Charlotte, that was sure to be their new start. If you have a real friend, you will never feel lonely again. In fact it is hard for a man to keep pure friendship with a woman in reality.Sofia Coppola gave us an excellent screenplay.

In Canada it is only PG, while in America it's rated R! And really, the only explanation for this is a brief scene at a strip joint that shows some nudity. I really look down on that R rating because Lost In Translation is a good-hearted film that should be enjoyed by all ages. Notice how during the 2003 Oscar season two films played the ""only one special effect: the effect on the audience"" card; one being this film and the other being Mystic River. Both are great films, both are rated R in the U.S., but only one of them can carry along its story without brutal murders.So what can I say about Lost In Translation that hasn't been said a million times already? It's all true. It's subtle, down-to-earth, and allows the audience to observe and relate to the characters, Bob and Charlotte. Both of them have a life crisis to deal with, and I guess if you're thousands and thousands of miles away from your problems it makes it easier to take an objective look at them, even if they do follow you. Bob and Charlotte confide in each other and develop a relationship. That's what it's all about, and every scene is precious. It's a real and true to life kind of film. We never hear the lines: ""Oh, Charlotte, I'm so glad I went to Japan. You've changed my life in such a profound way and you'll always be in my heart."" That's because that just isn't the way it goes in real life. The feeling is there, the characters know it, the audience knows it, so it has to be left at that.So, yeah, I love this movie. It's clearly the highlight of Bill Murray's career and marks the perfect first real stand-out in Scarlett Johanson's. It's so rare to see a movie that only has an interest in its characters (and only two of them, at that!) and makes them so charming, lovable, and familiar. This is a great example of non-Hollywood Hollywood films: the well-known actors and producers going to the roots of independent film-making.

267,TheSeaLion,A one in a million kind of film,7,2 January 2014,"Who would have thought that Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson would have such great chemistry? Not me until I saw this masterpiece of cinematography a few weeks ago. I did not have much of an interest in watching this movie when I first heard how great it was and decided to watch it. After viewing it, I realized I wished I'd seen it sooner.Bob Harris (Murray) is an actor who has arrived in Tokyo to shoot a commercial. Charlotte (Johansson) is a young woman who married young and is in Tokyo with her husband (Giovanni Ribsi) who is a celebrity photographer on business. Harris is going through a mid-life crisis while Charlotte feels she made a mistake marrying when she was so young. The two will form an unlikely bond with one another and take the audience on an experience through their different worlds and problems. The slow pace of the film helps it feel like the buildup of their relationship is actually taking time instead of happening all at once. The two share a lot of things in common, including having problems with where they are in life right now and a feeling of loneliness which adds depth to both the characters and their relationship. Instead of telling the story about these two very different yet very similar people form an emotional connection with each other, the film takes you on the experience they have and how the connection between them grows.The visuals and setting of the film in Tokyo provides for an interesting location that plays a role in adding depth to the story and characters using its subtle symbolism. Both Bob and Charlotte feel alienated in their lives as if they do not belong there, and Tokyo to them is an unfamiliar and alien place to them with a different culture and language then they're used to. I thought Scarlett Johansson was an okay actress from the performance I witnessed in the 'Marvel' films ""Iron Man 2"" and ""The Avengers"", but her performance in this made me realize how talented she is and has made her one of my favorite actresses. Bill Murray I already liked and knew was good actor from his performance in ""Ghostbusters"", but this shows he can do comedy as well as serious drama. I would actually love to see Murray do some more serious roles because you can tell he is built for both funny and serious with his performance in this. Another good acting job in the film was Anna Faris of the ""Scary Movie"" franchise as an American actress named Kelly. The best part of the whole film is the relationship that Bob and Charlotte share with one another. We get a front row seat as the two take the audience on a journey through the experience they shared together and how it shaped their relationship. The two have great chemistry and have a strong relationship that the audience wants to route for. The best part of the relationship, I think, is that it allows the audience to believe what they want to believe with it. I personally believe that it is just a very strong friendship that they share while others think that they have some romantic chemistry between them. Whatever the case is, I like that it took the chance and the film did not tell us, but instead lets the individual viewer believe what they take from it all.""Lost in Translation"" is a one in a million film that while simple in premise is deep in all other areas. Murray and Johansson have good chemistry, the setting of the film plays an interesting role in symbolizing how the two feel, there are good performances in the movie, and the film allows us to decide what we want about the two, ""Lost in Translation"" is a modern day masterpiece and dives into great detail about a simple bond that two people share.",Lost in Translation
268,ray-280,A defining moment for the leads and their characters,9,25 May 2007,"Most slice-of-life movies draw from lives few of us can really relate to. Sure, the protagonists will appear normal enough, have normal jobs, and live a normal life, but rarely do they behave in a truly ""normal"" way that rises to what could be an actual slice from an actual life. Lost in Translation does this and more, presenting a snapshot of one of those defining moments we all have, an experience that marks our minds forever while simultaneously changing us. Not only does it do this for the lead characters, but also for the actors who play them.Bill Murray (Bob Harris) plays a caricature of himself: a middle-aged movie star well past his prime, but still a big enough draw to command $2 million for a whiskey advertisement in Japan. Many American movie stars accept endorsement deals abroad but not here to protect their reputations; Harris apparently fits into that class. Scarlett Johansson (Charlotte), plays a similar caricature of herself: a slightly snobbier, well-educated newlywed with a clear intellectual bent that is accentuated by her unique physicality, the type that causes men her age to overlook her while driving older men absolutely insane. Though the film appears written primarily for Murray, it turns out to be the vehicle that catapults Johansson from a merely famous dramatic actress into a historically important one. It will be decades before one can fully appreciate her legacy in this film. In this film, Johansson is what her peers like Gnatalie Portman and Emmy Rossum wish they were and will likely never be. To call her another Hepburn would tell only half the story, because Hepburn was untouchable and for the most part unapproachable; Johansson manages to retain a Hepburn-like class without the pretension, uniting both elitist and populist audiences. She IS that young woman every man in mid-life crisis dreams of crossing paths with.Unfortunately, Director Sofia Coppola made one critical mistake with this film, and that is adding an element of indirect golddigging to the plot by making Murray rich and famous. The older men in the audience will forgive this, and still put themselves in Murray's place, but the film would have worked even better if he was down on his luck and already owed the money he was to earn in Tokyo, leaving him to start over, without money or debt, after ""selling out."" The lack of exploration of these dual financial considerations leaves a gaping hole in the film that leaves us wondering, when there is no need, just how much money and fame it takes to connect on a ""spiritual"" level with the ingénue. As enthralling as Charlotte finds Bob, it would have been more convincing if not cushioned by a bed of his money.That said, the plot is stellar, and the casting was perfect. Johansson possesses an intellectual maturity that inevitably leads to boredom with men her own age, including Charlotte's husband (Giovanni Ribsi), who conveniently ducks away for a photo shoot, foolishly leaving his tagalong wife unattended. Charlotte loves her husband because she is supposed to, but wonders what she is missing, a question Murray spends most of the film answering for her. Bob Harris's marriage runs only on inertia and memories now, but both forces are strong and he is not about to abandon such a history. While stuck in Tokyo, sparks erupt between Bob and Charlotte as the two fit together like lost pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Sex could occur at any time, yet does not occur for the very reasons it should occur: the characters, like the director, have far deeper and more fascinating explorations in store than the mere physical release of sexual tension.The most misused actress in the film was Anna Faris (Kelly), the narcissistic, tabloid-hungry movie starlet who serves primarily as Charlotte's antithesis. Coppola could have explored this character and given her depth, yet chose instead to treat her more like a sitcom sidekick. Faris could also have carried the lead role, even if it's obvious why she wasn't chosen. That was no excuse for leaving her out of almost all of the film, however.The subplots, most of which involve Murray playing the good sport in a foreign land, with tourists and TV hosts, provide good background for the more standardized main plot, which moves in a manner which is predictable yet still fascinating. With the extremely talented leads drawing heavily on their own life experience for their roles, it is not surprising that the result of their efforts was one of the all-time cinema classics, and the defining work for an actor in the sunset of his hall-of-fame prime, and an actress about to enter hers. The feeling was a bit similar to what baseball fans must have experienced in 1951 when Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle were in the outfield for the Yankees.Bill Murray should have gotten his Oscar for this film, but he also should have gotten it for Groundhog Day. The Charlotte-like snobs who comprise the academy couldn't seem to see past Murray's everyman persona and his earlier roles to realize he has evolved into a legitimate romantic male lead. Johansson will get her Oscar(s) in due time, but a case could have been made for her here as well. I would call this her best work, except that would insult her ability to eclipse it, which I'm sure she will, but no matter what she does after this film, this role will be what defines her historically.Any aspiring filmmaker should watch this film at least a dozen times.",Lost in Translation
269,pri_e,a good effort though a little lost,6,18 February 2004,"I must say that I hadn't heard of this movie before the golden globe awards so I thought I would go and see it and see what the buzz was all about. Firstly I must say this was a really good effort by Sophia Coppola considering her pitiful performance in the last godfather movie (I'm sorry folks that is still unforgivable). The movie has a good cast with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson giving stellar performances with the city of Tokyo epitomising the crisis that both characters are facing. Though they do touch on a romantic sort of bond but more than romantic its a connection of two souls that know that this one week together can perhaps change the course of their lives forever or they weather out the problems that they have for good. I guess it's the ending that brings the rating to 6/10, I guess because it confused me, hopefully I'll get it one day but I still think its a good movie.",Lost in Translation
270,Travis_Bickle01,"Touching and honest movie, Scarlett Johansson is outstanding!",10,18 March 2005,"One of the greatest romantic movies of all time. Sofia Coppola had already proved with ""The Virgin Suicides"" she's very talented, has an eye for detail and that she's gifted to write heartbreaking and moving screenplays. This movie is not a classical love story about two people who meet, fall in love and have sex. It's the impressive and touching story of a lonely American woman who followed her husband (who has some work to do over there as a photographer) to Japan. In the bar of the hotel she meets the American actor Bob Harris, who is in Japan to do some well-paid commercials.Both characters are in a difficult stage in their life. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is married for a couple of years and the feeling you have when you are completely in love with someone and the other person is also completely in love with you, the feeling that you are very special and unique for that other person; that feeling is completely gone. Charlotte is afraid that her husband doesn't really love her anymore and that she doesn't mean much to him.Bob (Bill Murray) is married for more than 15 years and he has the feeling that the best years of his marriage are over. He wife only thinks about shallow things and they don't have much to say to each other when they talk.Charlotte, as well as Bob, is very lonely. Not the first time, when they meet in the bar, but the second time they meet, they feel there is a connection. It is this connection that brings them together and makes them able to talk about things they couldn't talk about with anyone else because they would not understand it. It is this connection that makes this movie so special.Bill Murray was great but I loved Scarlett Johansson even more. Her acting performance was heartbreaking and I think she really deserved an Oscar-nomination. I've seen this movie twice in 5 days time and I can't get enough of it. The ending is just magnificent and the one kiss makes this movie completely perfect. Coppola is very talented and she capable of saying very much with the amazing stories she writes.Everyone who has enough of all the shallow Hollywood-romantic movies and wants something honest and deep, something touching and sensitive but not melodramatic must definitely see ""Lost In Translation"", it's one of my favourites of all time!",Lost in Translation
271,Michael Kenmore,The cinematic equivalent of The Emperor's New Clothes,1,26 December 2007,"Imagine hearing the major critics on the top of the roof on the skycraper sing boisterous praise for one of the five hundred 'qualified masterpieces', and Lost in Translation somehow received the honor bestowed on Sofia Coppola and company. Big mistake.Lost in Translation is one of these movies that at first you might be seeing a terrific movie, but as it progress it become drab, droll and tedious without justification in substance. There's really no story to speak of -- only paper-thin basic with inanely banterous dialogue.There may be a merit in cinematography that raise the artistic value of this movie, but because the story is non-existent and the characters utterly unsympathetic & boring to watch, cinematography -- stationary in some scenes and moving in others -- somehow negate the enjoyability of the movie by focusing on the ludicrous aspect of tedium as if Sofia could bring back the element of silence inspired by silent films of the early 20th century.Lost in Translation (er, Sofia) abuse the silence element as the expression of meaning when it really add *nothing* of substance to the aesthetics of the movie, artistic or otherwise. It's utterly meaningless if one does not understand the express purpose of silence at the right moment to convey the humanistic value of life in the hectic and modern world. Sofia is being altruistic to the detriment of the audience when it comes to the vanity of the characters as portrayed Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson which generated zero empathy that makes the movie even less interesting to watch in a continuous manner without becoming fidgety or letting out relaxing yawn. There's nothing of interest what happen to the main characters and why should the audience give a care.Sofia made the blunders in filming and keeping the scenes from the fate of being tossed into the cutting room trash bin that are particularly unintentionally humorous in being unabashedly pretentious or idiotically embarrassing. Like the English pronunciation-mangling Japanese hooker in the hotel room and the pointless, unromantic conversations with Bill & Scarlett characters who somehow fall in love while possessing ice-cold personalities that would make Mr. Freeze blush in humbled shame. And the movie moves in the glacial pace that makes it atrocious to watch -- it is the cinematic exercise in tedium for the sake of artistic expression, without tightening up. It drags on and on until the audience feel nothing but contempt for the characters and especially the screenwriter/director responsible for torture by mean of boring the audience to death.Sofia once mentioned her favorite movie director is Terrence Malick. Mr. Malick is a completely different filmmaker who knows how to convey the meaning of silence in the poetic setting because Malick has experience observing nature and human qualities as a former philosophy professor & translator. Sofia did not because she doesn't get the aesthetics combined with silence without the backbone of a rich story and characterization. The Virgin Suicides, Sofia's debut movie, is well-made and competent, but Lost in Translation is such a trainwreck in terms of lackluster substance & poor, drag-on editing that lend to experiencing boredom. This boredom probably reflect the period of boredom at certain points of her life, and she parlay that experience as a form of torture to inflict the mental anguish of tedium on the audience in vengeance. Scarlett Johannson and Bill Murrey, while accomplished movie actors in their right, do the barest minimum except mug to the camera in the aura of exulting ""Sundance Film Festival"" self-importance that elevate this movie to the new level (more like bottom 100) in high art, with moronically sedate monotony & meandering tedium thrown in. Bill's acting is nothing special save comedy and Scarlett is moderately competent but technically bad in dramatic acting (which makes it a safe bet she'll never be nominated for Best Actress Oscar in her lifetime, UK's BAFTA Best Actress award clinch for subpar, vacant, minimalist acting style partially blamed on Sofia's tepid, fumbling directional style & a future hard-*** director demanding spectacular acting notwithstanding).Frankly, I do not know how Lost in Translation screenplay appealed to Scarlett and Bill Murray. It may be a character study, but does it delve into humanities, psychology and philosophy? No. It's more like a staid travelogue populated with non-descript characters that say absolutely nothing but dumb banter then fade to the pretty backdrop with the main characters wandering for a few minutes too long. This script won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for nothing but silence, banter, silence, banter, silence, inaudible whisper, fade to end? When the critics claim the movie have substance that the audience could not spot and decipher and call us stupid for being oblivious, I say the true design of Lost in Translation is that it is an introvertible proof The Emperor's New Clothes carry a valid allegory that apply to Sofia's vapid, utterly worthless filmflam that, next to Corey Haim's 1989 video diary ""Me, Myself & I"", might serve as an ideal audio-visual torture device. Because Sofia wants the audience to experience what she endured, and so we the viewers get the taste of her bitter medicine of a puerile existence, similar to what Vincent Gallo did with the cheerfully self-indulgent ""Buffalo 66"".Zero star out of four",Lost in Translation
272,pinokiyo,The biggest star in the movie: Japan,5,4 September 2005,"This has to be one of the most overrated movies. Yes, it is shot beautifully, but it is because it takes place in none other than - Japan. If they were to take the same story and then film it in America, I guarantee you - it would not be praised this much. Don't get me wrong, I give credit to Bill Murray as well; if it wasn't for him, I'd probably fall asleep during the movie. He added the subtle comedic act - not too forced - which was good for me (I hate forced humor like in movies such as ""Along Came Polly"" or ""Scary Movie 3"") to make me laugh a bit. If this movie didn't have that, then it would've been really dull and boring, since the story wasn't doing it and neither was Scarlett Johansson's character (Charlotte). Even Sofia Coppola (the director) mentioned how she wouldn't have made the movie if Bill Murray were to decline the part - surprise surprise.People who love this movie say there's much more to the story, but there seriously isn't much going on! (Some audiences just like to create their own imagination/story than what the movie is actually showing) The story is just plain and simple. Basically, it's just two lonely Americans connecting together in Japan. Great. Who doesn't get lonely when they're far away from home or a loved one? I could only come up with these reasons why people love this movie:1.) The viewer has never traveled to Japan, so watching this movie was exciting to them. Or the viewer just has a love for Japan. 2.) The viewer has/had their own lonely mid-life crisis and can/could relate to the characters. (Even though the story is just so brief and simple... hmm, they must get easily touched.) 3.) The viewer likes the ""real-life"" style of the movie with slow pacing, unlike the typical Hollywood look movies. Kind of like films such as Magnolia and Punch Drunk Love. (I do like this kind of style... but the story was just not there.)4.) Fan of any Bill Murray movie. (This one is lame--I know, but there are hardcore fans out there)If you have some time to waste, then you'll probably have the patience to watch this entire movie. But if you don't - don't watch it. It will feel like it just drags on and all you could do is sit there and wait for something to happen - nothing mind blowing will ever happen in the movie! (Unless you consider a Japanese strip club with business men as shocking). And as I mentioned before, if you don't have the money to travel to Japan; or have no clue what Japan looks like (and would like a general idea); or just have an interest in Japan; then you might enjoy this movie, since you might feel like you're traveling with the characters. But that's about it.Actually, take a trip to Japan and visit Shibuya, Tokyo (there is a short scene in the movie) and just stand there - you'll see more stuff happening there than in this entire movie.Oh, about the whole hotel shower scene in the beginning where Bill Murray is supposedly too tall for it... he could've just adjusted the thing even higher! He just stopped it half way! And one more thing... please - it's 'Moshi moshi', not 'Mushi mushi' like some idiot in the movie was saying.**** Some minor spoiler: To people who saw the movie *** Seriously, what is so beautiful about the STORY? Charlotte is a snob who attended Yale and thinks low of others. It seems to me that she was only interested in Bob Harris (Bill Murray's character) because he was a star. And yes, she knew fully well he was a star. I really doubt she would've approached him if he was some stranger. And as for Bill Murray's character, he did end up cheating on his wife by sleeping with an old lady! I mean, come on.... what was that all about?!The ending just had no meaning... I doubt their experience together changed them. It was basically a ""one night stand"" kind of thing... yeah, isn't that beautiful? Others can disagree with me, but that is what the movie is SHOWING. So the only beautiful thing about this movie were images of Japan. That's it.",Lost in Translation

274,TheNabOwnzz,A constant stream of awkward moments,4,7 August 2018,"In a motion picture like Lost in Translation, the bonding and relatability of the characters have an even more important emphasis than they usually do. Unfortunately the relatability is something that is completely devoid in Lost in Translation.The acting in the entire picture is mediocre, and this is combined with an average screenplay that consists of mostly 'Hey dude' or 'You know' juvenile kind of dialogue. This is excluding Bill Murray as Bob Harris, who was pretty much the only actor in the film able to perform on a decent level, as he captured the emptiness of his character perfectly due to many of his fantastic cynical takes on his commercial scenes. The cinematography has some great shots, such as the golf course which shows the audience a great level of depth & a couple of outside the car window shots which show our protagonist's face with the mirror image of urban Japan reflected in it. However, there are also multiple weird behind the shoulder low camera angles which make it seem like more of a documentary instead of a motion picture, & Sofia Copolla doesn't seem very fluent in the technicality of the camera movements, as many of the camera movements are jumping all over the place. Copolla also shows us a lot of shots in public occasions while focusing on people nobody knows and nobody cares about while music is playing. While this is presumably done to show us that Murray & Scarlett Johansson's character Charlotte do not belong in this world, the immersion into their characters is severely decreased since because of this since the focus is seldom actually on both of them alone.Lost in Translation's strength is from its silent parts, the slow walks around the city or Charlotte's walk around the temple. As soon as people open their mouths ( Except for Murray ) the quality significantly decreases. Giovanni Ribisi and Anna Faris in particular are extremely cringeworthy in their acting, and their line delivery will embarrass you all the way through. Scarlett Johansson seems to be on the level of Kristen Stewart in showing emotional range because her facial expression never seems to really change during the course of the film. Her weird quirky kind of slightly smiling facial expression is all we see the entire film. She frequently uses 'uuuhmmm' to open a sentence & seems extremely insecure about her qualities on screen. A bond with Johansson's character can therefore never really be formed, since she cannot show any kind of human emotion that will make me really believe that she is in the situation that her character is in. ( There was also an obligatory phone call with her sister in which she starts crying due to her alienation to society & her husband, but Johansson's performance here also lacks any kind of emotional depth ) In the end the relationship between Murray & Johansson seems forced and unreal because of this, and although the scenes before their meeting are a wonderful showing of how distant they seem to be from the world they live in, the mediocrity of its script & Johansson's sub par acting destroy any illusion the audience might have that this relationship could be real. As the title suggests, it is also a neverending stream of cringeworthy scenes. While this is ofcourse partly a deliberate move by Copolla since it wants to show us how alienated its characters are, but the constant stream of cringe this picture has become is overdoing it a bit. Many of Johansson's line deliveries are extremely cringeworthy, Murray's commercials are also extremely cringeworthy and will leave the audience embarrassed. A couple of their scenes together such as the one where he reluctantly kisses her in the elevator are also extreme cringe. Because of the plain absurdity of its awkwardness, Lost in Translation does indeed also become quite ridiculous.Lost in Translation has a great Bill Murray performance, some great shots in its cinematography, but it also has extremely weak supporting performances, many absurdly awkward scenes and a mediocre script with not much important dialogue or the building of a narrative, eventually resulting in a disappointment.",Lost in Translation
275,sngbrd39,A beauteous film,8,5 April 2010,"There is a beauty that is pervasive throughout the film Lost in Translation. I see it in the gorgeous photography that shows us the city of Tokyo in all its glory. I hear it in the expressive soundtrack that enhances the emotions experienced throughout. Most of all, though, I feel it in the connection between Bob and Charlotte, two lonely Americans drifting through a brief stay in Japan's capital.Bob is an actor doing promotional work for Santorey Whiskey. Charlotte is accompanying her photographer husband on a job that brings him across the Pacific Ocean. Both characters are married, but experiencing bumps in their marriages and doubts about their spouses. And both are feeling isolated in a city of millions. A series of chance meetings in their hotel draws them together. They are soon experiencing the city together, enjoying each other's company.One of the concerns I had going into this movie was the potential for, for lack of a better word, ""squick"" between Bill Murray's and Scarlett Johanssen's characters. Murray is old enough to be Johanssen's father, and I was afraid that the movie was going to take us to very uncomfortable places with that age difference. Thankfully, no such ""squick"" occurred. There is certainly an intimacy between them in the way that they share their feelings and concerns, but nothing that feels inappropriate.Overall, Lost in Translation is quite a lovely film. It may take a viewing or two to truly understand or appreciate it; it took me five years before I really got it. But once you get it, it's certainly worth the watch.",Lost in Translation

Murray's performance was so good that I sought out another and I'm so glad that I did. Although 17 years late, I know its probably a good thing because I might not have appreciated exactly how good this movie is if I had watched it back then.This is about a chance encounter resulting in an unexpected and very unlikely connection which leads to a much needed escape for both. In each other's company, the bond between them grows stronger although neither express exactly what it is they actually feel. It's just too soon and there will never be enough time to get there. So once the clock does stop ticking, the irony is that's exactly what they both regret the most. Strange isn't it? To purposely kill time only to wish one had it back? This resonates with those who've had such an experience while simultaneously drawing in those who haven't.

278,GuyCC,A Remarkable Film That Says A Lot.,10,11 March 2007,"I enjoy Bill Murray's acting. Loved him in Ghostbusters, and thought his turn in Groundhog Day was a real growth of his acting skills. I never got around to seeing ""Lost in Translation"" until recently, and after viewing it, I shouldn't have missed it the first time around.Not everyone is going to get this film. Starring Bill Murray, one might expect it to be a comedy or for him to pull some of his wacky, sarcastic hi-jinks. In the film, he's portrayed as bitter, weary and just very alone. It's not that his character (Bob) comes off as a jerk, it's more that his life has become mundane and uninspiring, and he's simply going through a routine with his marriage, his career, his life... knowing exactly what to expect. This is one of the deepest and most low-key performance yet from Murray.The same applies to the younger Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a wife who is also basically alone, even though her husband is more or less around, much like herself and her role in the marriage. Despite the age differences, Bob and Charlotte strike up a friendship, and give each other a chance to sample some living.It's not exactly a romantic film. There's an unspoken feeling of love or attraction, but it focuses more on the friendship aspect. The connection of having someone around who actually ""gets"" the other, or at least makes an attempt to listen past previously deaf words. The film focuses a lot on the isolation and loneliness of the two characters at different stages in their lives, but each character seems to want more out of their daily routines, and can't seem to find it anywhere else than with each other. You feel for the two characters trying to maintain their roles versus trying to make themselves aware of their own lives again.Outside of the story, the movie has great cinematography and dialogue, both realistic and humorous. It's not a depressing twist on the ""mid-life crisis"" fable. It just makes one think, especially for those who have felt like they've been in a rut themselves. It reminds that wanting to change a routine either takes a lot of work, or to simply try something different. And for those who need a tight sense of ""conclusion"" at the end of a film, it's not going to be found here.*SPOILER* There are a lot of things that could be interpreted from the ending, but my own thoughts tell me the end is perhaps the most realistic scenario, albeit each having been changed for the better from the experience. *END SPOILER*I read a few of the negative reviews on here, and I don't understand how this film could be viewed as a waste of time. Maybe the story was too slow paced, or Bill Murray wasn't zany enough for them. Or it's possible that I found this film at a point in my life where I wanted to hear what it had to say, but this film is well worth the attention and awards it received, and in many respects, I can't even properly describe why this film stood out as much as it did.

I guess because I was so young I took everything with a grain of salt.I tried watching it again a few days ago and was so turned off by all the juvenile racist jokes made by Murray's character.

Why then, portray his character like some hillbilly who has never traveled out of his neck of the woods?Johansson's character seemed like a spoiled brat who indulged and encouraged Murray's character when ever he cracked all the tasteless insensitive jokes using a fake Japanese accent.

280,ih007b2077,Slow Boat To Tokyo,10,10 January 2004,"First things first. I expected to like this film, and I did like it. But it was not the event I had hoped for. Normally I take to these sedately-paced stories of human emotion and art-house-type presentation. The whole thing is just so painfully slow, however, and I really can't see how it can have attracted such high praise. The direction, scenery and music are all good. And yet there is nothing strong enough about the central characters to make them dominate a slow movie. I certainly admire Scarlett Johansson, having watched her emerge in both 'The Man Who Wasn't There' and the wonderful 'Ghost World'. Unfortunately, in this role, she doesn't quite have the presence to pull off the impossible - that is, make something of a character who seems to have no real soul. Bill Murray, although I still don't like him, is capable, but I found him miscast. This movie needed a Nicholson or a Hoffman, but I know they're too old now. Where have all the young gifted actors disappeared to? I rate this movie 5 out of 10, and cannot fathom why the critics are foaming at their mouths. It does have great 'bits' but there are far too many meaningless slow periods. My favourite bit was the golf drive, which seemed to be heading for the volcano. Even this shot was out of context and performed for effect. I was half expecting some sub-title to tell me that this was meaningful.

281,ih007b2077,"Boy, was I wrong!",10,27 March 2004,"This is my second review of this movie. After watching it six times, I felt compelled to make amends to my earlier, and thoroughly wrong, review. I really don't know what I was thinking about to suggest that Scarlett Johansson was not up to the part, or that Bill Murray was miscast. I was simply overcome by pre-cinema bias against Mr Murray; and also because I like 'Ghost World' so much. How I was wrong. I am now wondering if 'Lost In Translation' is some kind of modern-day 'Brief Encounter'. The slowness still agitates new audiences, much as it made me fidget, but you have to see through the sedate pace and realism. I, of course, did not do that either initially, and I was only swayed to watch it again after the awards season. But I'm glad I did. All I can say to those people who thought this movie was both too slow and over-rated, is that it's worth giving it another try. Every scene now seems perfect, and I haven't got a single criticism, although I still prefer 'Girl With A Pearl Earring' to see Scarlett Johansson's full acting skills. In all, I have now made 16 trips to the cinema this year involving Ms. Johansson. I still think Naomi Watts is the best actress, but SJ is not far behind her. A truly magnificent actress, and still under 20. Sofia Coppola will find it hard to emulate this masterpiece. I've now taken my bias blindfold off...",Lost in Translation
282,mwendel,People Looking For Direction (Possible Spoilers),8,29 December 2003,"People looking for direction are what I think this movie is about.  Murray and Johansson play two completely different people, both who appear to be insomniacs, who find themselves, lost within themselves and the Japanese culture that surrounds them.  Both on some level, I believe, feel like they have a spouse that may not even need them, or at least only when it's convenient.In the brief encounters with Johansson's character's husband, he behaves with what seems like an utter disregard for her and self-absorption.  At some level he probably is head over heels for her, but isn't very good at showing it, while he is very good at being downright rude at time, in my opinion.Murray's character is one that seems to be something of a washed up, aging movie star, who the Japanese people still love and adore.  His wife based upon the few phone conversations and faxes that we hear and see between the two of them would indicate that their relationship isn't in the best of shape; because so of the things she says depending upon how you interpret them could be almost downright cold and hurtful.  The only thing that they appear to be in agreement on is loving and raising their children, which Murray seems to be missing out on because his agent is sending him all over the place to do commercials and appearances on talk shows.I think through the interactions and discussions that these two characters have they find something in themselves that they like.  What exactly it is doesn't ever seem crystal clear, but its a cross between friendship, sexual attraction, and a kind of mutual nurturing of one by the other as they both appear to be hitting bottom at the same time, but in different ways.I feel that Murray and Johansson portray their characters very well giving them a depth and warmth that people can relate to when viewing this film.  I think one of the reasons there is so much talk about this film is because the acting required wasn't just dialogue delivery - there are a lot of dialogue free scenes, where the actors convey more with their body languages then some actors might do in a 20 minute dialogue sequence.It's not a movie that everyone is going to love.  Some of you will hate this movie and think it's a piece of trash, while others will feel it is a masterpiece to be appreciated.  I personally find myself wondering why a couple of the scenes in the movie were even there and what might have been left out that should have been in the movie instead.  Watch this movie, even if you don't like it, you will walk out of it thinking about life of the movie itself more than most of the movies getting released today.",Lost in Translation
283,TerminalMadness,One of the most pleasing films in years...,8,14 September 2004,"Sofia Coppola has more than proved she's got the chops to be the next great director, and she's also proved that talent didn't skip a generation. First was ""The Virgin Suicides"" which I've yet to see and now ""Lost in Translation"" took critics by storm with this tale of alienation in a foreign country and two people connecting.In this charming entertaining and melancholy gem, we meet Bob Harris, an ex-movie star in the United States who came to Tokyo to promote a new brand of Whiskey to get two million bucks. Bob is a man who is not only alienated in this foreign country with different customs and language barriers but it alienated in his home with a wife he barely knows and kids he hasn't seen in nearly five years.In enters Charlotte, a young woman who's followed her husband (Giovanni Ribisi), a rising young photographer to Tokyo for a week and she's discovered she's feeling alienated by Tokyo and the language barrier, and she and her husband have very little they connect on. The two meet one night at the hotel club, and slowly but surely they connect. There's a sort of special bond the two manage to form right away and amidst their loneliness and isolation within the hotel room, they create a connection amidst the crowded streets and denizens. Receiving rave reviews and Oscar nods, Sofia Coppola not only showed that she was capable of being in the ring with Hollywood heavyweights, but Billy Murray proves once again why he's become such an icon in film.Murray takes everything from himself and puts it all in his performances and here it's clearly evident why he's so appealing. Forget dribble like ""Osmosis Jones"" and ""Charlie's Angels"", the nonchalant, aloof, and often times blunt actor truly makes this film a masterpiece. I was stunned, just stunned at how bittersweet this tale is of two people connect because they're just so alike but paradoxes. Johannsen's character is lost in her new marriage and has no idea what she wants in life while Murray's character is lost in his old marriage and has seen it all, he just doesn't know where to go from there, so the two while aimlessly searching for something in their lives find each other amidst the cluttered, crowded, and sometimes giant city of Tokyo which becomes a character in the film, the source of their isolation.A lot of times the two are looking from the outside in with really nothing to start from, Johannsen looks from her hotel window out onto the large city while Murray is within the population with nothing to start from, and the two are just wandering in their lives. Coppola, a gifted director shows Tokyo in all its depth and dimension: scary, humongous, sterile but comforting in the right tone. There is a beautiful scene in which the character Charlotte goes to the countryside of Tokyo watching a ceremony take place as the foliage falls around her, and it's all she really seems to do, watch everything around her happen with no real purpose. She can't find a purpose in her life and regardless of how hard she tries, she feels like an outsider, evident in scenes where she listens to her husband talking to a shallow actress played by Anna Faris who is funny in the film delivering some truly dumb but hilarious one-liners that increase the lack of depth in her character.The character Charlotte is a bit of a riddle but she's also very likable and serene. Scarlett Johannsen who is not only sexy, plays her with much Zeal and depth; she's such a beautiful but lost person who is in touch with herself but not the world around her, in fact it's pretty much insinuated that her relationship with her husband is failing. Bill Murray is as witty and funny as he's ever been with laugh out loud scenes that flex his ability to deliver one-liners with deadpan reactions, and his knack for comedy in general including his bad tryst with a mistress, his bad luck work out on a treadmill, his hilarious guest stint on a famous Tokyo talk show, and (my favorite) his really hilarious photo shoot for whiskey (to name only a few) that just had me on the floor rolling.Also there is a melancholy mood to the tale as the two experience mundane activities with each other that make many tender moments including karaoke, parties, sitting together, and just lying together in bed talking and bonding. The best scenes are the quietest where they just sit and stare off into space talking, it's truly symbolic of their feelings of loss and isolation they manage to melt away while seeking comfort in one another. They never truly solve anything in each other's lives, but ultimately they gain strength in the friendship they form to move on in their lives and go on to another day.There is a particularly heartbreaking much talked about moment in the climax as Murray's character Bob is about to leave Tokyo in which he grabs Charlotte , hugs her and whispers something in her ear which causes her to cry and laugh. We never hear what he says to her, it's inaudible, and the genius in it is they leave it to the audience to discuss what he may have told her, and they leave it to our imagination because while we may have been with them for the story, the whispers are between the characters and no one else, and in the end we feel so fulfilled for having known these two characters and going on this journey with them.Though a bit slow and lagging at times, this is an excellent top notch gem with beautiful direction courtesy of Sofia Coppola, incredible cinematography, a touching story, and great acting in part of Scarlett Johannsen and Bill Murray.Rating: *** half out of ****",Lost in Translation
284,eamon-hennedy,"Fantastic, I loved it to pieces!",10,19 February 2004,"A wonderful film from beginning to end, this is one of the finest I have seen this year so far. Bill Murray has always been one of my favorite actors and I have been waiting anxiously to see him do a truly great 'serious' role that is worthy of  his talents and this is it. The character of Bob Harris is his signature role as a talented performer and as a result becomes simultaneously his best performance and film since the equally wonderful Groundhog Day in 1993. The jet-lag, isolation and loneliness of Harris is brought wonderfully to life and sees Murray wonderfully convey the poignancy and humor of his character. While there are serious moments to his performance, he still brings that wonderful wry comedic style he is so great at. Just take a look at his encounter with a prostitute (""lip my stocking"") or his bewilderment at how long a translation is to something that he said that was very short.At the heart of Lost in Translation is a love story and Murray would be nothing without a great female actress to play against and we have one here in the shape of the lovely Scarlett Johanssen. As Charlotte she is the female equivalent to Bob. An apparently loveless marriage, although one with enough care to last, and alienated in the culture of Japan, the way she plays of Murray as these two lonely souls find comfort in one another's company is nothing short of superb. She truly deserved that BAFTA and she deserves to win the Oscar too.Writer/director Sofia Coppola masterfully tells her story and avoids sentiment and over reaching emotion instead relying on heartfelt intensity to demonstrate the relationship between these two characters. Her screenplay is one hundred per cent perfect. Her dialog wonderfully sharp and her treatment of the romance at the core of the film touching without the obvious touches. Her direction is also flawless. Her wonderful way of presenting images, such as the sun splitting through the leaves on a tree, or the skyline of Tokyo are joys to behold and shows the world that she is truly her father's daughter. While there has been some finger pointing that she has only gotten where she has today due to her father, with a film like this I would say she deserves her status and a film like this marks her out as one of the finest young directors working today. Just take a look at how she avoids sex throughout the whole movie. Sure there's a trip to a strip club, but Bob and Charlotte never have sex. The closest we get to it is when the two share a bed together, but only to fall asleep for the first time since they arrived. The only moment were sex is presented symbolic is when after a night of karaoke singing, where the two gaze at each other romantically, they meet up, alone to have a cigarette. This is simply wonderful cinema.I understand that there are many out there that did not like this film, and there are reasons for that. The film is more slower paced that you would expect and the film is more underplayed than overplayed, but if you can get past this, you will experience a quite simply life affirming film that I believe is masterpiece.

285,wastebot,Sleepless in Tokyo,3,27 September 2003,"Murray is funny.  Johansson is a fluffy bunny in a new park.  Very nice cinematography.  But it ends up coming off as an advertisement to smoke and drink in Tokyo, which it supposedly was meant to satire.The problem is that all the gloss of the film ends up counter-acting the satire.  The result is a friendship story that glamorizes what the tobacco and alcohol industries want.So, I left the film feeling like I had been subjected to a very long marketing scam.  About the only insight one comes away with from this film is that Sophia has learned the technical aspects of daddy Coppola's trade well, but is harboring some child-like anti-Japan, nearly racist beliefs.With some luck, the average viewer may see it as simply a portrait of the crustiness behind the gloss - a money and fame (or the marriage to them) doesn't buy you happiness story.

But what is this nonsense? The movie wreaks of affected directing. The whole adage of ""show don't tell"" is flipped on its head here, because the writer/director is ""showing"" so much she is in fact telling. It is constructed in a very cynical way that breaks the illusion of the characters and the world that should be created around them. So many moments wreak of the director trying to say something implicitly, thus you are thinking more about the direction than the characters. I can just imagine some of the explanations. ""Look as she sits on the window sill, looking out towards the town all alone... it marks her isolation from those around her."" And in this smug directing, the characters are forgotten. They don't even interact for the first 30 minutes of the film, and it's just clips of anything almost randomly. Ooh look, there's a character receiving mail, there's a character walking through a lobby, oh look there's a character eating. Dull and pretentious.All in all this is a travesty. Pompous directing left the characters way down the list to the point of not even being needed.

Pictures of loneliness and restlessness. Interior pain and loss. Pictures of empty, rumple beds and evacuated rooms where only a distant sound of a buzzing shaver is indicating human presence.Unfortunately those are rare moments, like I said. The film expects more than just the old-fashioned, simple camera work of Lance Acord.

Both are bored silly by being in Japan, they don't understand what is going on half the time, or what people are saying to them and they both feel trapped by their lives.Then they meet each other, and I won't say anything more except go and see this movie, or rent it on DVD, it's well worth it.To be totally honest, the first 15 minutes are a little slow, but persevere, it's brilliant once you get into the story and this is Bill Murray's best work in a long time.There should be Oscar nominations for this movie this week for definite - I would say best screenplay, possibly best director, best actor could be there, and best actress as well. It may well get overshadowed by all those big epic movies out there, but let's keep our fingers crossed!This movie is a must-see for anyone who likes to watch movies that explore character's feelings, but is not for anyone who likes a lot of action - this is a thinkers movie!",Lost in Translation
290,arturmachado-29588,A platonic relationship about nothing,4,28 August 2017,"Drama with a pinch of romance written and directed by Sofia Coppola. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), recently graduated, is in Tokyo with her husband while he does his work as a photographer there; she is unemployed so just wanders around the hotel room doing nothing or goes to the bar and does nothing more days on end, dealing with her existentialist crisis. Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a famous actor who also happens to be in Tokyo staying at the same hotel due to advertisement commitments. Far from his wife and children he goes through a middle-age crisis. Charlotte and Bob know each other and develop a platonic relationship about nothing.The movie, for me, would work better with an older actress and a younger actor so it does not look like the ""wet dream of the pedophile in the closet"" or the ""fetish of a teenage girl with old men"" (given the rating it seems that there are a lot of those around). With a whole city and loads of money available to them, these two do nothing but eat and drink in shabby places or staying in bed talking about their crises. Why not make the least effort of sightseeing? They are in Tokyo, a tourist heaven! What is a romance without it, even if a platonic one? What really baffles me is how could this movie won awards for its argument when it is about NOTHING?!?

291,chrstphrtully,Shining Example of the Beauty of Silence,9,19 September 2003,"How often do you watch a film these days, and truly appreciate the silences? Those moments when you're forced to truly look to the characters' faces, their glances, their quirks, to read the characters' minds.  Even the great American directors of our day -- Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorcese -- tend to focus more on either dialogue or on sound and images separate from the characters to make their point.  Yet how much of our daily interaction with those we know and love (and even those we don't) derives from just those types of silences.That's what makes a picture like ""Lost in Translation"" so special.  Scarlett Johannson and Bill Murray spend a substantial amount of time together, and yet it's remarkable how little dialogue they actually have with one another. Instead, the bulk of their scenes together consist of silences in which the entire span of their relationship -- their semi-awkward meeting, their recognition that they want to spend time together, their growing sense that there is a mutual need that each fills for the other -- is reflected on Murray's and Johansson's faces.The plot of the film is not all that complicated: burned-out popular actor Murray is in Tokyo to do a Japanese whiskey commercial for $2 million; Johansson is in the same hotel staying with her husband (Giovanni Ribisi), a photographer spending so much time on the job that he has no meaningful time to spend with her.  The film is about Murray and Johannson crossing paths, and making each other's lives more enjoyable for the few days they spend together.The importance of their silent relationship is not difficult to see. Compare their scenes together with those between Johansson and Giovanni Ribisi (as her husband) -- these consist mostly of talk (primarily Ribisi) and yet there is no sense of connection between these characters.  There are numerous other examples, although three are particularly worth noting: (1) Anna Faris as a bubbleheaded movie star who talks constantly and says nothing; (2) a hilarious scene in which a Japanese director, who is shooting Murray in a whiskey commercial, apparently needs thirty seconds of dialogue to say ""turn your head to the right""; and (3) Murray's sad telephone conversations with his wife -- words can't bridge the distance when personal contact is absent.   In their scenes together, it's clear that Johansson and Murray are relying exclusively upon what their eyes, their gestures, their smiles, and their expressions can tell each other.And none of this would work without two outstanding lead performances. Johansson is subdued, yet radiant, as a young woman whose mind and spirit are incredibly vibrant, but has been beaten down by the needs of her husband and his friends for idle noise, masquerading as conversation.  Murray is remarkable in a performance that, as in ""Rushmore"", transcends Murray's familiar persona and blossoms into a real performance.  Indeed, if you follow his progression from ""Groundhog Day"" to ""Rushmore"" to this film, the development as an actor is exciting to watch (now, try to imagine if he did ""The Razor's Edge"" today, instead of twenty years ago).These two actors are guided along beautifully by Sofia Coppola's direction, which beautifully transposes the noise and expanse of the outside world -- where neither Murray nor Johansson truly fit -- and their own intimacy.  She avoids the common inclination of many directors to quickly push the relationship in a sexual direction; instead, she chooses to focus more on how these two characters fill the respective voids in each others' lives. 
Nothing about the choices in this film (either from the actors or the director) is ""safe.""  After all, how many directors would make sure that what is ostensibly the most romantic dialogue in the film is inaudible to the audience?  And yet, doing so makes all the sense in the world -- the characters have been so intimate all along, and yet we've been privy to their feelings.  It only seems right that they be allowed to share just one thing between themselves, and themselves alone.",Lost in Translation
292,Blondie_,EXCELLENT!!!!!,10,19 October 2003,"I just saw this movie last night, and all I can do is rave about it!! IMHO the best movie of 2003, hands down. Sofia Coppola is an excellent filmmaker. Where others filmmakers feel the need to use a lot of action and noise to make a point, she somehow manages to brilliantly make the same points, and makes them much better, with her minimalist technique. Despite what others have said on here, this minimalist technique does not come across the least bit boring. I never expected the film to be as funny as it was either-it was non-stop laughs almost until the end with the exploration and comparison/contrast of Japanese vs. American culture. Those of us who have visited Japan will definitely identify with this. Bill Murray and Scarlet Johanson could not of given better performances. Johanson I expected this of as I had seen her impressive turn in 'Ghost World'. Bill Murray-I had never really seen in a dramatic role, with the exception of his dull performance in 'Rushmore'. In 'LIT' he gave an extremely impressive, touching performance in this film and deserves accolades from Oscar. Both of them do!! What a fine dramatic actor he is turning out to be. Johanson and Murray had perfect, beautiful, touching chemistry that had me fighting back tears at the end of the film. The tension they created between these characters was dynamic and intriguing.In a side note-this film is especially interesting being that it is somewhat based on truth from a visit to Japan Coppola took with her husband. Also the character that Anna Faris plays is rumored to be based on Cameron Diaz, and from what I can see, I would believe that to be the truth.I give this film a 10/10!!!",Lost in Translation

Bill Murray has done much better than this in other films like Mad Dog And Glory and Ghostbusters, roles where he had a likable funny charisma.

A very pretty and attractive model who walks around certain places in Tokyo exploring the culture with a big dumb look on her face while her director husband is away filming on location. Why did she win all this praise for this role? Has she been in a box office smash since? The Island anyone?

296,kellyadmirer,Superb Exploration of Being out of your Element,10,28 September 2003,"This movie is set in Japan, but it might as well have been set in Singapore, or Tehran, or Istanbul.  It is not, as some perversely want to believe, a slam against the Japanese.  Instead, it is a look at what it means to be traveling outside one's element and, due to the enforced lack of normal distractions, having the time and opportunity to think about life and develop relationships that are unique to that time and place.If you have traveled alone in countries that have a different language and customs, you can appreciate the utter aloneness you feel despite being surrounded by witty, intelligent people with whom you really cannot communicate in normal (for you) ways (I think the shots of Johansson walking through Tokyo alone and seeing the cultural differences up close and personal establishes this concept nicely).The ""locals"" are just as good and bad and interesting and farcical as people anywhere else, the crucial factor being that they have their ways and they are not your ways.  Whereas at home or traveling within your own country there are countless recognizable reference points that keep you tethered to the mooring at which you anchor your life, when you are completely and utterly on the outside looking in, funny things happen - you start getting introspective, you notice peculiarities about your own home environment (where carpet is the most pressing issue), and you develop relationships based on sheer serendipity.  In other words, you open yourself up to new experiences that you would never permit in your ordered and mannered life at home.This is a movie about that experience.  Two strangers meet, both out of their element, each coming to grips with problems in their lives because they are forced to confront them in the solitude of this alien environment. There are others around to talk to, for example an inane (Britney Spears type) starlet and lounge singers, but for individual reasons they are immune to the influences the main characters feel and thus inappropriate companions for them - the starlet because she is too unclever, the lounge singer because she has become her insipid act.  So the two travelers meet and share a defining experience outside the confines of their ""real"" lives because they are both there and going through the same type of experience.Bill Murray gives an outstanding performance, understated but classic in its very ordinariness.  The shot of his isolation as he hits a golf ball at dawn and then follows it down the fairway alone captures his situation perfectly. Pestered by a wife who patronizes him and agents with no time for him, he seeks out the lovely Scarlett Johansson (or rather, she seeks out him). They have a few laughs, part forever most likely (that is wisely left uncertain) - and, in between, taste a life they might still have if only their pasts did not determine their futures.The film pokes gentle fun at some peculiarities of Japanese culture, but Bill Murray films tend to poke fun at whatever is in his general vicinity - the Army in ""Stripes,"" politicians in ""Ghostbusters,"" psychiatrists in ""What About Bob.""  If you think this is film is some kind of ethnic slam, you are completely missing the point of the proceedings.  The point is that by being in a completely unfamiliar environment, you notice the oddities present in all cultures that surround us and them and everyone that otherwise, being part of our normal background, we just take for granted.  The characters' heightened perceptions is the point, not the fact that some aspects of Asian culture come in for comic observations.If you just have to think the worst about this film as being some kind of ethnocentric xenophobic hit piece, go get your revenge by renting Jim Jarmusch's ""Mystery Train"" which completely reverses the paradigm and has Asians confronting the silliest and strangest aspects of Americana.  If you find that ""Mystery Train"" is not a slam against the US (and it manifestly is not), perhaps you will be able to see that this film similarly is not intended that way against Japan.Please do not bother viewing this film if you want car chases and action sequences and ""10,000 jokes.""  It is a subtle film for those with patience and those looking for a little insight into the human condition.  If you are looking for some intricate plot with clever twists and lots of gadgets, this is not the film for you.  Expect a little, though, and you will get a whole lot.I give this film my highest rating, not because it has an outstanding plot or tremendous action or a high concept, but because it successfully captures a common experience - traveling alone in an alien environment - and treats it honestly with outstanding performance and an intimate gaze.  Bill Murray deserves recognition for this film, and I hope he gets it.",Lost in Translation
297,sc8031,"The Film Equivalent of ""Coldplay""",3,18 June 2008,"Although the pop-group, ""Coldplay"" evokes supposed musical melancholy to a large mass of people, to me it evokes money-making nostalgia for a time when one wasn't such a money-making sellout. I.e. it sounds weak, not weepy; bored, not melancholic.Thus is my argument for this film and most of Sofia Coppola's work. Her movies are kitschy pop film pieces, masquerading behind the imagery of deeper film-makers before her. A la Coldplay versus Radiohead, post-punk or Elliott Smith.I, like every other dopey American, thinks night-time shots of Kyoto are mysterious and alluring and would like to be jaded and melancholy in a crazy Japanese metropolis. However, I don't know if this movie does much for me in painting that cheesy fantasy.I really don't know about the character developments here. Giovanni Ribisi's convenient photographer ""character"", John, is unrealistically aloof from his mopey wife, Charlotte (Scarlett!). He's friends with this girl, Kelly (Anna Farina, famous from Scary Movie) who is freaking annoying on the deep end of the scale. She evokes the lowest-common-denominator of annoying, so that anyone seeing the film can understand how stupid she is in comparison to the lead characters. 'Course, John (Ribisi) doesn't notice this annoying twerp like Charlotte does! Zoinks! Now Charlotte feels soooo socially alienated!!! I mean, geez, could you spell it out any more clearly for us, Mme. Directeuse? With characters like these, this movie borders on social indoctrination! There are a bunch of moments like this. The wisdom Bill Murray's character Bob (What About Bob?) imparts to Charlotte in these situations is basically on the level of an older brother telling his younger sister not to care what stupid frat jocks think about her booty. If there's a reason this movie evokes emotions you can't quite put into words, it's because the movie doesn't know what it's trying to do. This movie is like some meandering indie-rock song that SOUNDS kind of melancholy, but is not concisely written with any theme or message that stands out. Highlights: --Scarlett Johannsen crying at the Buddhist-Shinto shrine --the see-thru underwear on her butt at the opening shot --scientologists in lead roles --Bill Murray crying (he's a tragic character on a level unbeknownst to himself)",Lost in Translation
298,ericjg623,Most boring movie EVER!,1,17 March 2004,"What's there to say? This is a movie in which nothing happens. And it happens to a bunch of utterly uninteresting nobodies. Bill Murray is supposedly engaged in ""understated"" acting. Mostly he looks like a man either bored to death, or in one weeklong Valium trance. His counterpart, Scarlet Johansson, is lost in some sort of existential fog. Maybe these are the kind of people who relate to this movie, and thus find some sort of deep, meaningful message in it. I don't. The whole premise is these two are in Japan for a week, he to shoot ads for a local liquor company, she to basically do nothing while her husband, a famous photographer, also shoots ads. They're both stuck in the same plush hotel, so they hook up. Sort of. Mostly, to the extent they do anything at all, they commiserate. She's unhappy with her marriage. He can't even muster up that much energy. He drinks a lot (making him, at least, a good pitchman for his product). Together they, um, well, do stuff. I guess. About the only thing memorable was where they hung out with some Japanese party animals, one of whom does a (bad) Karaoke rendition of a Sex Pistols song. Oh, the hell with it, merely trying to describe what this movie is about is such a dull process it's putting ME to sleep. Better simply to describe what's wrong with it, which is to say, just about everything.First off, Bill Murray doesn't even remotely resemble what he's supposed to be, a washed up action movie star reduced to doing commercials in Japan. Instead, he comes across as some middle class nobody, a salesman perhaps, forced to spend a week abroad on business. Which brings up another complaint. This film comes off as if these two actually live in Japan, and are finding it difficult to adjust. Which would have made far more sense, but a week? Anyone can put up with being in a foreign country for a week! But most important, there's absolutely no dramatic tension at all. The closest they come to doing anything scandalous is when they share a couple tepid kisses at the very end. And she, wandering around in her philosophical haze, could have come up with something more dramatic than visiting a Buddhist temple a couple times. How about a suicide attempt? A big fight with her husband when he's sucking up to the hot, blonde starlet (who I mistook for Cameron Diaz, turns out she's played by Anna Faris, of ""Scary Movie"" fame)? Something, anything!Oh well. This movie plays like ""American Beauty"", if you took that film and sucked it dry of everything funny, weird or erotic. That film, while somewhat pretentious, was at least interesting. In contrast, one gets the sense that this film wants to be pretentious too, but it simply lacks the energy.1/10",Lost in Translation
299,FilmLabRat,yes it happens but so what?,6,12 December 2003,"I kept waiting for this movie to have substance.  Would the mismatched couple who find each other in a strange land connect on some meaningful level?  Or would they find that the marriages they had were not so bad - that they had been expecting too much?  Something.  Instead, the only thing they really had was loneliness - in marriage and in a foreign country where they didn't know or understand the culture.  So they found someone who feels roughly the same ... 90% of all in their situation, probably do.  Of course two people from the same culture would connect when having a life crisis amidst strangers.  Although I appreciate the subtleties in the acting, the way Murray and Johansson communicate non-verbally, I didn't see many levels of understanding.  What does he know about Ivy League and philosophy?  Nothing. What does she know about being a middle aged, family man or acting?  Do they have anything at all to talk about?  Is life all about such unspoken connections or are those mostly illusions?  I have been in similar situations several times and have come to realize that feelings of connectedness are natural but fade completely from memory and turn out to be silly mirages, later.  The film would have done better to focus on how we imagine we've found someone special under such circumstances, but it's really just common humanity from a familiar country.  Under any other circumstances, the relationship would fall like a house of cards.  This ""story"" is really just a portrait of dissatisfaction, dislocation and drifting among travelers.  So they felt like they found a life raft in a sea of emptiness.  Most of us know better.  The movie made way too much out of nothing, in my opinion.  But the acting was very good, given the lack of script.  How I wish Americans (my people) would learn to study and appreciate other languages and cultures more, so that this mentality of looking for ways to avoid strange foreigners is not so common.",Lost in Translation
300,dutchchocolatecake,meaning of life=marriage is pointless?,1,1 October 2013,"Well that was another hour and a half of my life I'm never getting back. And in the end, there was no grand revelation about anything; not even about the meaning of the character's lives - which I assumed what the movie had to be about. The ending is cryptic and lukewarm. Apparently Bill Murray says something deeply significant to Scarlett Johansson that moved her to tears; it's too bad the audience wasn't privy to it. It might have made sitting through an hour and a half of meaningless contemporary vignettes worthwhile.I have no idea how this movie won any awards or standing ovations from critics; and it seems any pseudo-intellectual can read into the ambiguity of what barely passes as a story line to extract some bizarre philosophical point. Let's not confuse subtlety with vagueness; nor symbolism with obtuse and empty scenes of people staring blankly out a window or riding in a car. I am a significance junkie, and trust me there is none to be found here.Don't get me wrong - the acting is fantastic. It's the writing and pacing that's going to put you to sleep. The irony is not lost to me that this movie features insomnia prominently.None of the main characters were sympathetic or likable to me. They all seemed so stuck on themselves. There's no honesty with themselves or with their spouses. They all at one time, seem to be cheating on each other (even Lydia, whom we never see but only hear on the phone, has zero interest in welcoming her husband back home to the states). If this movie had any message, it seems to be that marriage is completely pointless and only random connections in strange places carry any meaning or significance; especially if we read into it and invest far more into a total stranger than we do the people who are consistent in our lives.And if someone wants to make a movie about how marriage is pointless, that's fine. But don't dress it up as a comedy, don't pretend it is deep and meaningful and communicates anything significant beyond what it is meant to be. No amount of pseudo-philosophical rationalization is going to endow this movie with the depth or significance it desperately wants to be perceived as. What a waste.",Lost in Translation

302,Denver53,"A very good to great film; if you don't like it, you don't get it",9,9 October 2003,"To view Lost in Translation with enough depth to understand it, you have to have some depth yourself. That isn't meant as an insult. In college I took a creative writing class (at the time I wanted to be a writer and I was pretty good, technically) and wrote several short stories as part of the class. After the instructor read three or four of these, he called me aside to talk about my writing and said this: ""You know what you need? You need to fail."" I was shocked and insulted, but for years wondered about what he said and why he said it. Now, 20 years later, I am sure I know what he meant. He meant that my life had been a pretty good one, with few disappointments, and as a result I didn't have the depth to write something truly emotional and meaningful, yet, no matter how good I was technically. I became a journalist.The same is true for Lost in Translation. These user reviews which call the movie boring are missing out, probably through no fault of the reviewer. If you have never been isolated in a truly foreign environment (I have, in China, among others), or have never truly wondered whether the path you are beginning or ending was the right one (including marriage or career choices), and have never met up with a stranger who seemed to ""get"" you even though you both know back home you probably wouldn't even have talked, then this movie will probably seem dull.To me, it was a moving story about two people who connect briefly but not in the lame Hollywood sexual manner. These people talk, and observe and wonder out loud. And when they part, they are sad beyond all normal expectation.
Lost in Translation had one scene -- involving kareoke -- that I thought went on too long. But everything else was almost perfect. To have people speak in Japanese, often with no translation, drives home the isolation one feels in that environment if you are not Japanese. To see Charlotte pace, and sit, and be bored, shows what happens when you are alone in a strange place with no agenda. I've been there. It is EXACTLY like this.
I think I heard the second half of what Bill Murray whispers at the end. If I did, I liked it.

An actor with a two million dollar contract in his pocket and a young girl who could afford to obtain a degree at Yale just don't seem to be the obvious subjects to dabble in superficial philosophical or psychological reflections.

It makes no sense and is thus offensive- not morally- logically.My other criticism is that the night on the town scene was about 10 minutes toooo long. We get the point, already. It's a wild and crazy town and Americans are disharmonious with it. Out of tune, out of sync.Charlotte and Bob are also out of sync within their own lives. The external mis-fit reflects their internal mis-fit. They are both lost in translation within as well as without.All of which has nada to do with the introductory butt. Sorry, I can't get past that one.The Japanese people were not stereotyped or maligned. They were depicted as vibrant, accepting of Americans, welcoming, and simply dancing to the beat of a way different drummer. They were not even offended at being viewed sideways by two jaded foreigners in their midst. I wonder if Americans would have been as polite if the circumstances were reversed.I loved the hilarious touches woven throughout the film, the tuxedo clips and the ""lip my stockings"" will stay with me for a long time.

307,AnnieLola,Woody Should Have Directed This!,4,30 October 2021,"There is certainly plenty of polarity in people's reviews of this opus! It's either ""oh, yes!"" or ""go figure."" I'm afraid that I found it rather tedious myself; it seemed to go on for hours. Here are these well-off people in a swank hotel in this brilliant city, and can't think of anything to do with themselves. Well, of course they're busy taking stock of their lives, but that didn't seem very compellingly conveyed. It's acting; it's illusion; these are actors tasked with making us believe what their characters are supposedly experiencing, creating empathy for what are fictive emotions.Here we have Bill Murray in a non-Bill Murray role, and we keep waiting for him to be Bill Murray --which is generally why we watch him-- but he has little chance to shine. ""Groundhog Day"", for example, was tailored to his strengths and succeeded admirably, while he was all wrong for ""The Razor's Edge"". ""Lost in Translation's"" call girl scene with ""lip my stocking!"" was intended to be funny (I think), and in the right hands could have been hilarious. But it merely seems awkward. Murray is out of his element here, seriously miscast. His character is famous as an action hero, an expert at martial arts who gained a wide Asian following-- a Chuck Norris type. Murray just isn't convincing as this sort of celebrity, but what the heck, we can let him take his best shot.I really couldn't detect any chemistry between him and Scarlett Johansson, who somehow didn't seem to have much presence-- but lips, plenty of lips. This was earlier in her career, when the camera lingered endlessly, almost pornographically, over her darned lips, to the detriment of recording her actual performance.This is exactly the sort of film that Woody Allen can make effective, and Johansson of course later became one of his favored actresses. Think how this premise would have blossomed in his hands! Could he have worked with Bill Murray, though? One tries to imagine his ideal casting choice. All and all, I have to regard this film as a missed opportunity. I'm glad it worked for so many people, but it could have worked far, far better.",Lost in Translation

The film has a simple premise, two people lost in his life meet in Japan and a relationship arises between them.
It is admirable how Sofía Coppola instead of trying to imitate her father does the opposite, trying to differentiate herself from him. And it certainly succeeds, having a much more expressionist staging, with great attention to detail and a really beautiful composition of the shots. All these elements, part of a great direction, she uses to give depth to his protagonists, but always in a very organic and subtle way. Since the film more than represents a romantic relationship, it shows two lost souls who meet or see in the other a way to continue living.

315,clivy,You could learn more about Japan from a Viewmaster film than this movie,6,9 February 2004,"I was greatly disappointed by `Lost in Translation'. I've been in the situation that Bill Murray's character finds himself in: at a loose end in a foreign country. The film captures the sense of alienation and time passing so slowly it seems stuck. It also nicely portrays Murray's character reaching out to Charlotte, the young woman who he meets in his hotel.
However, I was disappointed by the film for two reasons. The first is that it has stunning photography of Tokyo and Kyoto but it views Japan like the two main characters do: through their hotel window. Even when they visit restaurants or night-clubs or in Charlotte's case, temples, the characters do not engage in their surroundings. They treat them as a substandard theme park or theme restaurant, poke fun at them and make fun of the people in them. They even poke fun at the doctors and staff in the hospital. (And what was wrong with Charlotte's foot? We were never told if her toe was broken or bruised although she was seen with a bandage on it.) I can see that Murray's character is there just for the money but Charlotte takes the time to visit temples and Buddhist sites so supposedly she has some interest in Japanese culture. The audience doesn't see much of it. The audience doesn't see much of the friends she has of Japan either.All of the Japanese - even the friends that Charlotte visits - are shown as laughable. Even if they don't speak bad English the audience is still encouraged to chuckle at them.I can see why some people would call the movie racist for this reason. But to be fair, all of the people in this movie are shallow. Especially Charlotte. She says that her husband thinks she is a snob because she sneers at the movie star and the LA scene. Charlotte doesn't show much more depth than the blond vapid film star:  the blond vapid film star actually says more interesting things that Charlotte does. Charlotte doesn't open a book once during the whole movie and doesn't say anything with any insight.
It is because of this emptiness that I found the film so disappointing. The expression that Murray has on his face when Charlotte leaves the lobby at the end is moving, and so is the final scene. But the film didn't make me like either character. I could feel their loneliness and their culture shock but I didn't have much sympathy for either one of them. Stuck in Tokyo in a top class hotel for a whole week with what looks like an endless amount of cash to spend -- poor them! If I were in their shoes I wouldn't spend that much time in the hotel:  I would get out and try to see Tokyo and try to speak openly to the people I met even if they couldn't speak English well. And I would want to see a museum or two. Or a manga store. Murray and Charlotte don't even go shopping.I would love to know what the Japanese think of this movie. The photography is stunning, but many of the Viewmaster slides I had when I was young also had beautiful pictures of Tokyo and Japan. They showed more about the culture and more respect for the culture too.I would have loved it if before the end of the movie Godzilla stormed the Tokyo Hilton and squashed Bill Murray and Charlotte and all other smug characters who made fun of the Japanese to a pulp.I will say one thing in the film's favour: it didn't have any jokes about the food the Japanese eat.

319,dmgrundy,"Little more than a ""mood"" piece",6,16 April 2007,"It's hard, at first, to fathom why this film is so successful - perhaps it's because people think they've seen a 'meaningful' film - it lacks violence, sex (apart from a brief, off-screen reference and another brief scene in a strip club), swearing, and a clearly delineated plot, unfolding in a leisurely, low-key, melancholy, soporific fashion. So sure, it's not M:I3, but that doesn't automatically make it high art, or even a particularly good film, either. Too often Coppola seems content to let the camera sweep smoothly over night-life shots of Tokyo, or linger over Johanssen and Murray's serious faces, with perhaps some music sweeping over to make one think one's watching something 'meaningful.' (In fact, surprisingly for a woman director, Coppola seems to exploit the (admittedly beautiful) Johanssen somewhat - a long amount of time is spent in which the camera gazes on her, often partially clothed (though not nude or bare-breasted), and I was particularly troubled by the opening shot of her behind, which seems to have very little to do with the rest of the film apart from offering titillation for the audience.) The dialogue, which could have saved the movie, often fails to live up to expectations - the central scene, mentioned by another reviewer, where Murray and Johanssen are lying next to each other on the bed, and he gives her his thoughts on life, is quite touching, but he doesn't end up saying anything of much significance, just some bland generalisations about life/experience, and we never really get too many character insights. It's too elusive, too much concerned with surface, despite the fact that so many of its fans praise it for going deeper than most blockbusters. At times I felt I was watching an extended commercial, of the kind that seem prevalent nowadays - seductive visual images with meditative music transposed over the top, calming in a new age meditation kind of a way, but ultimately not saying much.Here's a brief summary of the movie: Johanssen is bored and lonely in Tokyo because her husband (a photographer) is away all the time and thinks she is a snob. She's not sure what to do with her life after completing her philosophy degree at Yale, and wanders around the city, aimlessly searching for meaning. Murray is a washed-up film star doing whiskey commercials in Japan for a week. His phone conversations with his wife reveal a seemingly warm relationship, though as the film continues it becomes clear that he's going through something of a mid-life crisis; she's wrapped up in the kids and the trappings of domesticity (seen in the faxes she sends through about shelves and carpets), he's almost not needed, and life has lost some of its spark. Fairly predictably, he tries to rekindle with Johanssen, though - thank God - platonically. (In fact, this was one of the best aspects of the film - it resisted the temptation to become a romantic drama and instead enabled a slightly more perceptive look at human relationships in general. Probably the falsest part of the film was when Murray slept with another woman - it felt contrived and added little to plot or atmosphere.) In the end, though, he has to return to his family, Johanssen has to continue her search for meaning alone, and Murray's biggest act of rebellion is telling his wife he wants to start eating Japanese food. The problem is, they feel so aimless anyway that it's hard to feel too much sympathy for them - they're rich, with access to facilities which millions across the world could only dream of, and both have loving (if perhaps distanced) spouses - it could be argued that Coppola's analysing the emptiness at the heart of modern society, despite its wealth and power, but because the film is so elusive, it never really manages to summon itself up to SAY something - though it gives the impression that the viewer has been through something meaningful. Another problem is the treatment of the Japanese, which, as several other reviewers have noted, rarely rises beyond fairly cheap comical stereotyping - a far more potent analysis of the lack of understanding between cultures and the barriers constructed by language and custom could have been undertaken which would have added a whole layer of meaning to the film that, as it is, is only hinted at (as much by the title as anything).There were many ideas, themes and threads only hinted at in the film, which, if developed further, could have ensured the experience that so many seem to think this already is. As with much contemporary artistic product, I feel that people are quick to praise LIT as wonderful because it so much as touches on deeper themes, whether or not it fully realises them or develops them in a convincing way. What should really be the benchmark should be art that actually succeeds in not just suggesting ideas beyond the vapidity of the mainstream, but carries them through and causes us, for example, to take a fresh look at the familiar (as opposed to us just leaving the cinema and saying 'how beautiful, how thought-provoking, how ARTISTIC, it must be a masterpiece').",Lost in Translation

Bill Murray plays his most decent role yet although I found him funnier in his Ghostbusters days.Sofia Coppola is ""i want to be like daddy so i want to have a camera"" kind of person. But one way or another, she excels in it. But not that much. I've seen movies with so much more substance than this film. Bravo because it's an independent film and it can stand on its own. Boo because critics praise this little movie too much. It's boring often times, the story is good enough but all these praises? Too bloody much.I hope Return of the King wins. I'm so sick of top award shows giving awards to these kinds of films. Hopefully they'll do something ""dramatic"" like last years winner, Chicago.",Lost in Translation
321,crazyrabbits,How about...no.,5,2 April 2006,"The film ""Lost In Translation"" is a visually beautiful, yet strangely hollow film. How so, you may ask? Allow me to explain.Basically, this film is about a aging film star named Bob Harris (played with excellent comedic timing, as always, by Bill Murray) who has come to Tokyo, Japan to film a commercial for a Japanese alcoholic beverage company. While staying at a ritzy hotel in the city, he meets a young woman named Charlotte (played by Scarlett Johannson) who is staying in the city with her photographer husband. Basically, they both get incredibly bored, and run around the city to engage in a number of hilarious encounters with Japanese people who they can't understand.Is the acting in this film good? Better than that, it's excellent. Is the cinematography good? It's amazing. Is the film any good? Well...My main problem with the film is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. The film claims to be a drama, yet we see many instances throughout the movie of Bob and/or Charlotte failing to understand the Japanese language, and this results in humorous misinterpretations of what the Japanese are trying to say. Lost in translation? More like lost in a pun that's gone on too long.Another problem with this film exists in Bill Murray's character. That's not to say that Murray does a bad job, because he gives a terrific performance. The thing is, Murray is a comedic actor, not a dramatic actor. He has been doing comedy films for years, and scenes that are meant to have a serious quality become funny due to Murray's expressions and movements. This makes scenes become less grave and more light-hearted, which I don't believe was the intent of the director.Does the film portray the Japanese in a racist light? Judging by what I've seen of Japanese culture, absolutely not. I can't speak for everyone, but I have seen Japanese citizens in the media who act like the people in this film to, so I wasn't really surprised at all.Finally, I come to the ending. The plot summary for the film says that the the word ""translation"" means, ""How do you ""translate"" what life is? What is it supposed to be about?"", and that's a pretty good way to summarize how I felt about this film. It doesn't really translate anything. The incidents feel forced, the characters don't see each other that often, and we are supposed to believe that they have found some sort of epiphany in their lives. When the film ends, the characters must realize that they have to go back to reality. Bob still has a failing marriage, Charlotte is still married to her loser husband, and nothing has changed. Did they learn anything. No, nothing I couldn't have learned after watching Japanese television for a few hours.A user on the IMDb named ""M"" said that, and I quote, ""The crucial word in all this is SUBTLETY."" I mean, it wasn't like the incidents were just forced upon us, right? Oh, I forgot. That's the whole crux of the film, to put the main characters into awkward and funny situations. There's nothing subtle about that at all. Do I like sensitive movies? Yes. However, I don't like sensitive movies that have a heavy-handed and utterly inconsequential message.Bottom Line: Did I like this film? More or less. The acting, direction and cinematography are great. The plot is lacking. I give this film a 5 out of 10. If you want to watch, be my guest, but don't expect to get some grand revelation after watching it.",Lost in Translation

323,MooWoolf1,Not good,5,26 August 2018,"Well let's start with that I rate 98% of the movies similarly to what they have.
Like if a movie is an 8.5 here I'll rate it around 8 to 10. The 2% may end up receiving a 7 or worse. I do not give movies lower or higher rate just because I think those are over or underrated here. I'm fair. So far I've seen over 2k movies inclueding more than half of the top250.So this one was a bit boring but kept me interested. From the title I was expecting some kind of trouble made up by the fact they are both in a foreign country. Once it almost happened during a commercial shooting. But no. The terribly weak story just kept going. The only interesting story element was that the guy had a wife and kids. Nothing said that he is not happy with them. He just cheated them without any sing. That part was interesting. The woman's part is like nothing. I didn't feel or think anything about their realtionship. The only common was in between them that they were both in Tokyo and they said they couldn't sleep. No explanation here. I missed that. Then they teamed up got drunk once, were hanging out a little.. The movie ended and for some reason they had to kiss each other at the end. I did understand every minute of the movie.

324,RJBose,The (Japanese) Emperor's New Clothes,5,18 February 2004,"This film falls into the category I call ""Emperor's New Clothes"" (ENC), as it has achieved fame and accolades for ""deep meaning"" and ""sensitivity"" but really is a two hour film about two boring, unhappy people who meet in a foreign county in which they don't speak the language.  That's pretty much it, and there's not much too ""deep"" in flogging the limited cinematic possibilities offered by the premises that some Japanese people don't speak English, that some Japanese people speak English (and sing kareoke) with a heavy accent, and that some parts of Japanese popular culture may be different from what Americans might enjoy. As an American I have often found it amusing that some Europeans who frequent the IMBD boards take great umbrage at perceived slights (real and imagined) inflicted upon their national honor, history and integrity by ostensibly ""American"" film makers and screenwriters.  In some cases it may even be justified.  There is no excuse for this movie's outright mockery of the Japanese, however, and it is astonishing to me that this insulting vapid waste of time- a two hour tribute to nothing but Sofia's attempt to reimagine her marriage to Spike, and the time she wasted hanging around Tokyo hotel suites-  is somehow being hailed as great storytelling, or great anything. The Japanese whiskey company can pay fading action movie star Bill Murray $2 million to endorse its product, but cannot afford to pay for a competent translator for filming the commercial?  A wig magically appears (and just as magically disappears) when young Scarlett is singing kareoke.  Bill Murray plays, well Bill Murray, doing his SNL lounge singer character.  The final climactic moment of the movie is a whisper not shared with the audience.  Is this writing or in fact the absence of writing?

Not much happens. There isn't much dialog and what little dialog there is comes across as bland and uninteresting. Despite all the hype, Bill Murray sleepwalks through his role. As for Johansson, she was much better in Ghost World and Pearl Earring. The May-September relationship between the two does have a kind of poignant bitter-sweetness, but it doesn't go anywhere. They just walk around Tokyo for a few days, not saying much to each other (and that's about all that happens in the movie). The director, Sophia Coppola, manages to make the Tokyo look really unexciting, not a place you would care to visit. The end result is a thoroughly boring movie – you can walk out half way through and not miss much. I give it 4 out of 10.",Lost in Translation
330,mpofarrell,A Dazzling Wisp Of A Film,8,29 September 2003,"David Lean's unforgettable 1946 film ""Brief Encounter"" set the standard for cinematic love stories concerning characters who meet by chance in way stations, be it the dingy train depot in ""Encounter"" or the austere luxuriousness of Tokyo's Hyatt Hotel in Sofia Coppola's new movie, ""Lost in Translation"". Nearly 60 years separate the two films and yet they share a kinship that makes both films unique. Unconsummated love is not a popular subject among today's screenwriters and even a classic on the order of ""Brief Encounter"" was met with some derision by critics and audiences alike. Seen in 2003, ""Brief Encounter "" still has the power to grip audiences with its tale of an unhappy suburban wife and mother who fatefully meets a London physician while waiting to take an afternoon train home and starts a timid affair with the man, himself married. Furtive meetings ensue until the woman , racked by guilt and self doubt, ends the relationship. In 90 minutes of sublime film-making, master director Lean transported his World War 2 audience into a world of newfound love, simultaneously exciting and dangerous and finally heartbreaking in its finality. A deceptively ordinary story of two ""ordinary' people was made riveting through brilliant directing , acting, editing, scoring and sound.Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" does not reach the artistic level of David Lean's masterwork but it is a very good movie. From its ravishing opening shots of nighttime downtown Tokyo as observed by Bill Murray in a cab to the closing shot of another cab speeding away from the city leading Murray to the airport and home, this new film consistently engages the audience's attention, even when the screenplay seems almost non-existent. An American movie star in Japan to film a whiskey commercial, Bob Harris (Murray) arrives in a jet lag stupor from which he never seems to fully recover. Ensconced in Tokyo's spacious but sterile Hyatt Hotel, Harris gets only a fitful night's sleep, then arrives at the studio the next morning to film his whiskey commercial. This sequence, one of several, showcases Murray in spectacular fashion. An increasingly frustrated Japanese director and a genial translator try to convey to the American actor what they want in the scene. Murray's reactions are priceless. His performance in the entire film is a marvel and the best acting he has ever done.Complimenting Murray beautifully is Scarlett Johannson as Charlotte, the young American wife of a roving photographer of a rock band. The couple is also staying at the hotel, with husband John often away on assignment. Lonely Charlotte, feeling neglected by John, meets Harris one night in the hotel bar, and an innocent friendship results. Harris is nearly 30 years older than Charlotte but their May -December romance is wistful and consists mostly of late night talks, spur of the moment adventures in the big city and sharing a bed fully clothed back at The Hyatt. Through all this director Coppola casts an observant but unobtrusive eye on the proceedings. The movie is very strong in capturing the cultural differences between American and Japanese sensibilities, often to hilarious affect. In fact Coppola's penchant for concise observation goes a long way in covering for the unsubstantial screenplay, some of it obviously improvised. However, the acting by the principals is so strong, and Ms. Coppola's direction so self assured that the story effortlessly glides along, despite a few detours along the way that threaten to stop the film in its tracks.The crux of the story centers on the Murray/Johannson romance, and it is truly sweet. When Murray converses on his cell phone to his wife in The States, we are privy to enough information to know that the marriage has soured. Charlotte spends a lot of time at the beginning of the film sitting on her hotel window sill, looking down on the vast Tokyo cityscape, her eyes brimming with tears. This is a movie about two lonely souls looking for fulfillment. Technically superb, with dazzling color cinematography, gorgeously ambient sound and an eclectic music score, this loosely structured film ends on a fairly pedestrian note, but even so it is deeply moving.Bill Murray's great performance has a lot to do with that, and he is ably abetted by the lovely Scarlett Johannson. When these two look in each other's eye's, it is the most sensuous sight imaginable.",Lost in Translation
331,Amadio,One of the worst films ever made,1,21 January 2008,"Having lived in Japan for many years (I'm from Ireland) I was looking forward to a Bill Murray comedy about the extraordinary city that is Tokyo and the incomprehensible (to most Westerners) Japanese. Instead, I was subjected to what I can only call racist abuse. If this film had been made in Africa about Africans' behavior, speech, dress and customs, everyone would have been up in arms. Every cliché about Japan was thrown in. Bill Murray just didn't have to act, and not even Scarlet could redeem the mess. Coppola had to film in the hotel in secret as she wasn't given permission to use the place, and I can see why. It could have been a wonderful film full of insights into the quirky (?) nature of the Japanese as seen by Westerners instead of the hackneyed meaningless dirge. Just because Americans never travel, jet lag becomes a plot piece. Jeez! Jet lag? You have got to be kidding me. For anyone who knows anything about Japan this was an insult.",Lost in Translation
332,johnslegers,Pretentious film for pretentious people,2,5 October 2009,"Why is this film so praised? Our protagonists are a naive stuck-up girl right out of college and an equally stuck-up cynical actor. Neither show any real interest in Japanese culture (he's even quite disrespectful) and neither makes any really attempt to connect with the Japanese (even though they both get the chance to connect). Even though she seems to have a degree in philosophy and he seems to be somewhat of an intellectual type, their interactions remain mostly superficial. And still, their interaction with one another is pretty much everything we get to see for this entire film. I guess this film appeals to people just as pretentious and shallow as the main protagonist (which is the only reason I can think of to explain its popularity), but I personally found it hard to connect with either of them AT ALL.Further, I wonder how much sense it makes for their relationship to have remained purely platonic. Both seem to be estranged from their respective spouses, his wife is on the other side of the ocean, her husband is on a photo shoot for several days, both act like they haven't had sex in a long time, she's a beautiful impressionable young girl, he's a famous actor, they both don't shun alcohol and at one point they become close enough to lie together on a bed while he touches her feet. Maybe it's just me, but I personally find it hard to believe they didn't end up having sex together considering the aforementioned conditions. Anyway, the shame and confusion arising from such a situation (after both realise they made a mistake cheating their respective spouse) would at least have made a far more interesting film to watch Maybe this film appeals to people who never spent more than a few days in a foreign country, but having spent about 3 months in Poland I couldn't see anything I haven't experienced myself AT A FAR GREATER INTENSITY. For me, this makes ""Lost In Translation"" as exciting to watch as two people sitting at a bus stop waiting for the bus to arrive. Actually the latter would probably be more interesting, because the bus doesn't take THAT long to arrive.",Lost in Translation

336,jt1999,"""Lost"" is right",2,4 November 2003,"This is a textbook example of how a film with a good first act can completelycollapse during the critically important second act -- and never recover. Sofia Coppola's minimalist ""romance"" desperately tries to distance itself from its more traditional, romantic forbears (""Brief Encounter,"" ""An Affair to Remember,"" ""Summertime,"" etc.)  In so doing, Coppola effectively torpedoes what might have been a memorable, slice-of-life relationship picture (a little more Woody Allen and a little less Antonioni could have helped), winding up with a sterile, often dull portrait of two lost souls searching for some sort of connection.  Sure, she may have avoided sentimentality -- but she also missed out on emotion, on magic.  On passion.  (See Paul Thomas Anderson's""Punch-Drunk Love"" for a great example of how to incorporate all three.)The trouble begins with the opening shot -- an unflattering angle of our female protagonist, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) that director Coppola evidently hoped would launch her picture in an un-glamorous, European, Godardian way.  But what's the point?  Introducing the female lead by showing her ass?  If a guy had done it, he'd be labeled ""sexist.""  But a woman? No problem.  The more ass shots, the better -- and in this film, there are quite a few.After this artsy-fartsy beginning, we're introduced to Bob Harris (Bill Murray). With scant dialogue and many sad-eyed looks, we get the basic picture: unhappy American actor goes through the motions of promoting Japanese booze to make a buck.  In other words, he's sold out (the premise possibly inspired by Woody Allen's hilarious vodka ad bit from the '60s) -- the artificiality of his assignment echoing the superficial qualities of his life. (Simultaneously we see the shallow relationship between Charlotte and her phony photographer husband, John.)This is where the movie works.  In sparse, documentary style, Coppola gives us a sad portrait of Bob Harris: coping with a loud, Samurai-type director, being asked to impersonate the ""Lat Pack"" for a still photographer.  He is truly in hell, and we feel for him.  Murray has never been more sympathetic.  The lounge lizard from ""Saturday Night Live,"" the wisecracking Ghostbuster or any number of Murray's other wild, free-spirited characters are gone -- replaced now by an overly made-up, sad-eyed clown, a movie star past his prime, a depressed prisoner of fame, making dough instead of art, being coaxed intoridiculous poses while holding a glass of iced tea masquerading as Japanese whiskey.These moments, including one where Harris's wife faxes him a diagram of a shelving unit, are excellent, directed with subtlety and restraint.  The vapid conversations between Harris and his wife recall the ""Happy Birthday"" scene from ""2001: A Space Odyssey;"" Bob is as bored with his wife's remodeling plans as Frank Poole is with his parents' news from Earth.  A quick glimpse of Harris glumly watching one of his old movies on T.V. -- in which the young, handsome Bob, speaking in dubbed Japanese, interacts with a chimp -- is priceless.  At this point, I truly believed I was watching a great film.Half an hour later, the movie -- like Harris's career -- crumbles. After a few chance encounters where Bob and Charlotte flirt tentatively at the hotel where they're evidently both staying (though this concept -- like many others -- is not clear), the realism ends, and -- bang! -- we're aware we're watching a movie.  These two strangers, who have never introduced themselves to each other (never mind exchanging room numbers), suddenly begin behaving like a married couple.  Bob strolls into Charlotte's room, whips off his tee shirt, and chit-chats like he's known her half a lifetime.  Did I miss something?  Suddenly, the hesitant strangers are talkative pals.   And just as suddenly, the movie -- for me, at least -- ends.The downward cinematic spiral continues with a hodgepodge of ""having-fun"" scenes, filmed in sloppy, Dogme 95 style (amateurish handheld shots using existing light).   Many of these make no sense, among them: Murray breaking out of character and singing karioke, and Johansson donning a blonde wig (which disappears several scenes later).The rest of the second act is a complete disaster in which nothing happens. In the third act, we get a half-assed, boy-loses-girl bit: Bob is caught by Charlotte with a woman in his room (completely superfluous, causing no impact to the story whatsoever).  A character revelation where Bob tells his wife he's more interested in healthy eating than picking carpet samples is randomly thrown into the mix, nullifying its impact (see ""American Beauty"" for a great example of how to do this type of thing properly)SPOILER WARNING***
The ending, which could have worked in a funny, bittersweet, ""Annie Hall"" kind of way, falls especially flat.  Bob whispers something into Charlotte's ear -- but Sofia ""Cop-out""ola, in typical young-filmmaker-trying-to-be-profound style-- obscures the dialogue, so we're left to wonder what the hell he said, and what the ultimate point of their relationship was (maybe the line was so bad Coppola eliminated it, maybe she was merely trying to be artsy).
Either way, open endings are one thing, characters' final lines another. The audience is free to use its imagination to speculate on what will happen to Rick at the end of ""Casablanca"" -- but not because ""Here's looking at you, kid"" or ""We'll always have Paris"" are obscured.  On the contrary, these lines are crucial to understanding Bogart's character, his emotional state, and they give the film its resolution.  Well, at least we can be thankful Coppola didn't work at Warner Brothers in the 1940s.""Lost in Translation"" was a good idea for a film, but Sofia Coppola's inexperience as both writer and director shows.   Check out the final shot: after the credit crawl, there's a badly filmed, out-of-focus image of a woman waving to the camera.  It's the final nail in the director's home-movie coffin, once again leaving no doubt she's a novice.  If proving this point was Coppola's intent, she's succeeded.",Lost in Translation

338,EThompsonUMD,Fish Out of Water Romance,8,29 June 2008,"Although clearly not in the same league, Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation (2003) has at least one thing in common with such classics as Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Blue Velvet: its opening sequence contains an extreme anatomical close up. Rather than disembodied lips, eyes, or ears, however, the viewer is treated to a close up of Scarlett Johansson's panty-clad, recumbent rear end. Eye-catching as the shot may be, I'm not sure of its intent - unless it's a sly dig at female body fetishizing in American (and Japanese) cinema. Whatever, Lost in Translation is an arresting and amusing blend of romantic comedy and fish-out-of-water satire.The ""water"" here is contemporary Japan and the out-of-it fish are Bill Murray playing Bob Harris, an over-the-hill, unhappily married actor brought to Japan to do celebrity endorsement ads for Suntory whiskey and Johansson playing Charlotte, a recent Yale philosophy grad who is hanging out in Tokyo listlessly taking in sights and visiting with friends while her photographer husband is busy with various shoots. According to the conventions of romantic comedy, the two eventually meet cute and strike up a friendship that threatens to become a love affair but never quite does. The stars crossing these potential lovers are age difference and complicated lives. Thrust together by boredom, cultural alienation and pure chance, both sense that their relationship is necessarily transient and Platonic.Immediately following the opening butt-shot, Lost in Translation begins its whimsical and mildly satiric view of Japan with an airport hostess in voice-over welcoming visitors to the New Tokyo Airport while Harris taxis through a night scape of great glass department stores and skyscrapers surrealistically saturated in neon ads. He wakes to see a gargantuan Suntory billboard ad of himself promoting the whiskey in Japanese. Doing a double take, he rubs his eyes to clear them of culture shock. Throughout much of Lost in Translation, the viewer must do likewise, metaphorically speaking. The overarching vision of Tokyo is that of a fun house mirror reflection of Western culture, a major Asian city somehow crossbred with Las Vegas and Times Square with beautifully bizarre results.Harris's first 48 hours in Japan humorously establish his strangeness in a strange land. His shower head, for instance, only reaches his nose, and the exercise machine in the hotel's gym barks instructions in Japanese as it races completely out of control like the feeding machine in Chaplin's Modern Times. The scenes shooting new ads for Suntory are filled with language barrier jokes such as receiving the direction to act like Sinatoro, leader of the ""lat pack."" Funniest of all, perhaps, is the late night visit from a Japanese hooker sent as a welcome present from the president of Suntory. ""Lip my stockings,"" she implores. ""Lip them!"" Eventually Harris gets the idea that she means ""rip,"" but the hooker then acts out a dramatic rape fantasy that apparently turns on her rich Japanese clients, but leaves Harris completely baffled and alarmed.The film's two main characters finally meet in the American themed lounge of the hotel they share. From their first casual encounter at the bar, they develop a potent chemistry based on their disconnection from the cultural surroundings, their unhappy marital relationships, and their similarly sardonic senses of humor. Moreover, each is having a difficult time with a key life passage. Harris is deep into a midlife crisis and Charlotte is facing the classic identity crisis of a young adult. Their adventures together begin after Harris charms her with a playful proposition: ""Can you keep a secret? I'm trying to organize a prison break. I'm looking for an accomplice. We'd have to get out of this bar, then the city, then the country. You in or you out?"" Over the next few evenings, Harris and Charlotte trip the light fantastic in a variety of Japlish pop culture venues. Charlotte's Japanese friend ""Charley Brown"" takes them to a strange strip club with sexually explicit hip hop music (""Suckin' on my Titties"") blaring in the background and then to his apartment for dancing, pot, and a few inevitable rounds of karaoke. The adventures reach a soul-searching climax in Harris's room sipping drinks in bed and watching a re-run of La Dolce Vita. Charlotte confesses: ""I''m stuck. Does it get easier?"" And Harris answers: ""No. Yes. It gets easier. . . . The more you know who you are and what you want, the less you let things upset you."" They then fall asleep without the anticipated sexual consummation. Indeed, Harris and Charlotte's ""fine romance"" is much more akin to an old-fashioned Astaire/Rogers tease than to the illicit sexuality of, say, Woody Allen's affair with the teen-aged Mariel Hemingway in Manhattan.On the morning of Harris' departure, he and Charlotte say almost nothing. ""Aren't you going to wish me a good fright or something?"" A look of terrible loss is written on Harris' face as Charlotte retreats to the elevator with a curt ""O.k., bye."" But on the way to the airport Harris glimpses her on the sidewalk and chases after, seemingly setting up a classic clichéd romantic comedy ending, but instead we get a prolonged heartfelt embrace climaxed by Harris's mysterious, unheard whispering into Charlotte's ear. Speculation about what was said, of course, abounds. Romantics might assume that a future assignation is being arranged, but that would negate the entire thrust of the film. Instead, the whispers probably reiterate Harris's assurance that Charlotte will indeed find herself and grow from a gorgeous and intriguing young lady into a beautiful and accomplished woman. The soundtrack's exit music (""Just like honey"" by The Jesus and Mary Chain) connects both to Charlotte (""Listen to the girl as she takes on half the world"") and to Harris as he journeys back to repair his nearly broken marriage and in-the-dumps career (""Walking back to you is the hardest thing that I can do""). Thus this brief encounter ends not in romance but with the mutual-aid opening of blocked passages.",Lost in Translation
339,lethalweapon,"Slow paced, empty script.",5,3 November 2012,"'Brilliant', 'amazing', 'fabulous', and 'breath taking' are just few of the adjectives attached to this Oscar winning masterpiece by leading critics and movie aficionados everywhere, which is why I have to consider the possibility that maybe I just didn't get it.Or maybe slow paced movies with nothing much happening in it are not my cup of tea. Or maybe - ironically enough - the movie maker's intended message and commentary got lost in translation. For whatever reason, I remain underwhelmed. It's the tale of Bob, a veteran, famous Hollywood actor who has is on a business trip to Japan, where he's commissioned to act in an ad for a Japanese whiskey brand. He feels secluded and lost in the city, and welcomes the friendship of Charlotte, a newlywed bride of a celebrity photographer, who is also lonely as her husband stays busy on shoots.The friendship blossoms into a deeper connection that stays unstated, but poignant. I have this feeling that this blossoming process is the central part of the movie that raked in most of the rave reviews, but frankly, I think even this part felt a bit forced. It's not the actors - they all do a fabulous job - but rather, the storyline that felt too thin. The entire movie is way too slow, but the pace at which the central characters get close - that seems too fast. Perhaps they could have put stronger focus on their connection... More time for them, maybe less time making one dimensional caricatures of the Japanese.But of course, that's just my opinion. Maybe it just isn't my kind of movie. Hmm... I never knew I had a 'my kind of movie' thing. :-/",Lost in Translation

341,eragonbookfan,happy 10th anniversary? ......I DON'T THINK SO!,3,4 November 2014,"(NOTE: This review is coming from someone who's actually LIVED in Japan their whole life - and my translating is just okay)Groundhog Day >>>>>>>>>>>>>> Lost In TranslationThat's a MUCH better film you ought to be checking out right now, with meaning and entertainment. This film was WAY over-hyped by the Nostalgia Critic (lulz). I don't care if so many critics liked this film; I don't care if Scarlett Johansen is mostly known for this film! It is surely one of the most boring and undeveloped films I've seen!If you aren't feeling very lonely right now, you very well may by the time you've finished reading this review. For it is the review of a movie that woos, romances and longs after loneliness. A movie that is capable of reaching down inside the most gregarious, convivial person in the world and drawing to the surface a kernel of desperate detachment.Bob is an over-the-hill, middle-aged movie star who relies on his accumulated fame to keep him in the money through retirement. He's in Tokyo to earn $2 million for shooting a whiskey commercial. Charlotte is a young college graduate, recently married and tagging along with her photographer husband on a business trip. Both wind up at the Park Hyatt Tokyo, with lots of time on their hands and no one to share it with. After 25 years, Bob's marriage is shaky, suffering from his frequent absences. After two years, Charlotte's not sure who it is she married, or why. Both are tired. Bored. Lonely. And emotionally fragile. So when they meet, there's an instant connection. Age and social status (or even marital status, for that matter) seem irrelevant as the two cradle drinks at the hotel bar, share lunches, midnight parties and 4 a.m. heart-to-hearts.Director Sophia Coppola (Francis Ford's daughter) draws on her own experiences in Tokyo to bring it to life, but effortlessly. Bob and Charlotte's collective pensiveness and dislocation is backlit by the Japanese capital's freneticism. And the contrast is used to good effect. Racing elevated trains, throngs of pedestrians, flashing neon signs, and the din of bad karaoke don't neutralize the angst, they accentuate, and exacerbate it to the point that its nearly tangible.Bill Murray has always had a melancholy streak. But he typically uses it as a foil for his humor. Here, he wears it on his sleeve, refusing to duck and cover behind mirth and frivolity. And in doing so he delivers the performance of a lifetime. His on-screen companion, Scarlett Johanssen (The Man Who Wasn't There, The Horse Whisperer), easily keeps pace, allowing onlookers a riveting glimpse of the tragedy that occurs when youthful energy and enthusiasm crash into directionlessness and amorality.If one refuses to give in to the movie's moodiness, it becomes merely a dim documentary of two individuals' plodding trips to Tokyo; They eat, they go for walks, they gaze out over the city from their generic hotel rooms, etc. Indeed, eliminate emotion from the equation and ""Lost in Translation"" stops working in ANY language. But it's impossible to separate what's happening on-screen with what happens in your heart. And that is what has made this movie a critic's darling. It's also the pit it falls into while the crowds are obliviously cheering. Because of those strong emotions racing back and forth between projected image and human heart, moviegoers will find themselves relishing the connection and bond they see ""innocently"" forming between Bob and Charlotte. You're compelled to desire their happiness, and the only way they'll ever be happy, you become convinced, is for them to be together. Never mind that that would mean the destruction of two separate families. Sucked in to the moment, it's easy not to care.This film also includes mumbo-jumbo about our souls picking our path through life before we are born. And it's awful that they had to include disgusting & demonic Shintoist and Buddhist references and shrines into the film; that's ultimately when the film jumped the shark for me. The people invented this false cults and religions are FAR beyond superstitious and need to have their heads examined.Hollywood gets a lot of things wrong, and wants to make you believe their films are based on reality; well think again! Hollywood has become more HollyWEIRD these days!And a little bit of useful information of history for you foreigners wishing to visit Japan: People in Osaka are a lot more foregoing, optimistic, extroverted, sociable, kind, lighthearted, & entertaining than people in Tokyo. Because back during the Edo Period, Osaka was mostly filled with merchants, while Tokyo was mostly filled with samurai warriors; so the historical personalities are still somewhat existent in their current state. Just thought I'd throw that out for you people, because I do think Tokyo is one of the most cliché'd cities in the world to visit.3/10PS: Sophia's a hack",Lost in Translation
342,Jules45,Lost in Lost in Translation,10,5 May 2010,"In life there are lots of people who you see in the movies. No I'm not saying Darth Vader gave me a high five this morning or E.T. waved merrily at me on his bicycle. I mean real people. The ones who are lonely, unhappily married, need friendship or else stuck doing a whiskey commercial but would rather do plays.Okay that is a bit too specific. But luckily Bob Harris (Bill Murray) from Lost in Translation fits this description perfectly. He, as you might have guessed, is doing a whiskey commercial in Tokyo for $2 million. And other than giving Mickey Rourke's usual film characters a run for their money for the high amount of alcohol being consumed throughout the film, Bob is a relatively lonely chappy.That is until the lucky devil meets Charlotte (if you know who plays her you'll understand why I called him that). And the two form an unlikely friendship; giving it the adventurous feel of an older aged / modern day version of Hansel & Gretel - only fortunately in this they aren't going to get eaten by a witch. Their search for who they are, what they want in life and vice versa gives them that click so rare in films you wish it could have lasted forever.A wise man once said 'Life is a funny thing' another wise man said 'Films are very popular these days' and it seems Sofia Coppola said 'Lets put both these ideas together and make a masterpiece' and it seems she did so with ease. To the minority the experience will be sorely wasted and it's a real shame they will spend the next 1 hour 40 minutes looking at a pixulated screen with glazed eyes. But hopefully if you appreciate the concept that there are these ordinary, blends-in-with-the-crowd types of people who have something so lovable then you will see how special this relationship actually is.Bill Murray gives in a word a fantasticallyfunnyoscarworthyperformance as Bob while Scarlett Johansson as well as proving she has the best bum in the world by frequently forgetting any clothing below her waist except her semi-transparent Bridget Jones knickers, makes the character Charlotte draw about every ounce of sympathy from you, so that weren't even aware you had that much to start with. But it's Sofia Coppola's screenplay that beautifully puts the cherry on the cake making a film that could have you laughing to the verge of crying to even make you re-evaluate what you want out of your own life.Which is why folks saying this is a must see film would be the biggest understatement ever. So without sounding too desperate make sure you at least give it a rent. Pretty please.",Lost in Translation
343,ddelamaide,"Good, not great",7,9 October 2003,"This is a good film, but the overall rating seems too high. As in Virgin Suicides, Sofia Coppola in Lost in Translation is able to render an atmosphere, a scene, with great mastery. As in the earlier movie, though, the characters here remain distant and their motivation vague. One does not empathize with the two main characters; one simply observes them.I would like for Bill Murray to win an Oscar for a dramatic (or comedy) role, but I don't think this is the one. His comic scenes, particularly the shooting of the whiskey commercial, are classic Bill Murray, drole and very funny. However, his rendition of a burned-out actor in midlife crisis, like Jack Nicholson's performance in About Schmidt, substitutes simple passivity for any sort of deeper emotions.There are also some troubling anomalies in the storyline. Why do Bill Murray and his wife have such young kids after 25 years of marriage? Time zones seem confused when he calls his wife at 4 a.m. Tokyo time and reaches her at breakfast.",Lost in Translation
344,Knuckle,More Dabbling From Sofia Coppola,2,12 August 2005,"First she under-whelmed us with her writer's abilities with ""Life Without Zoe."" Then she added just a right amount of awful to Godfather III with her truly wooden acting. Now, having dabbled in everything else entertainment related, she dons the director's hat in some sort of vain hope that she will have found her calling - or at least something she doesn't completely suck at.Scarlett Johansson, in the ""I'm really not based on not Sofia Coppola, *wink wink*"" role stars as Charlotte, a poor, ignored wife who has been all but kidnapped to Japan by her neglectful husband on his latest business trip to Japan. Surrounded by an island full of those inscrutable, shifty, swapping L's for R's, Japanese, she finds herself alienated in deluxe accommodations that must be costing her husband's employers more than most of us make in a year.Throw into the mix, Bill Murray as Bob Harris, a burned out has-been who sleepwalks through his latest gig - a Japanese whiskey commercial, because he probably thinks he should be doing Shakespeare - and probably for a white audience at that.The two meet and while the sparks obviously don't fly, they take joy in each other's misery, mutual isolation in the world's most populace island, and their asinine observations that the Japanese can't pronounce their R's properly - ignoring the fact of course, that neither one of them can speak a lick of Japanes. Typical dumb ass American tourists.Aside from the generic xenophobic swipes, Sofia Coppola, who also wrote this (if it can be said to have a story at all) sprinkles the story with every cliché possible in an attempt to make her characters seem less like the whiny, bitchy, cry babies they are. At one point Charlotte begs her husband to ""just skip today."" We're supposed to tut-tut with disapproval as he tells her he can't, but given that this photography gig is only a few weeks, it would be the equivalent of one of us skipping out on, oh, a month of work. I think we can forgive him for not acceding to his needy wife's wishes.The story goes nowhere as it chronicles the journeys of Charlotte and Bob. If this movie had been made by someone else, ANYONE else, it would have been completely missed. As is, with the Coppola name, it has garnered accolades from every hipster doofus wishing for another Great Movie Dynasty. Sorry,but Sofia Coppola falls short in her foray as a director, too. I will grant her that the movie is full of some positively beautiful images,but maybe next time she'll cut to the chase and just publish a picture book instead.",Lost in Translation

Bill Murray is excellent and Scarlett Johanson maybe today's best actress. It is a shame that the academy has shunned her performance and nominated Diane Keaton for a role in a movie that was very bad. As for the film itself, when watching you really get emotionally involved with the two characters and you want them to get together. Sofia does a great job at slowing the pace down of the movie so you feel just as tired and bored as the characters themselves.

346,shakawtwf,Utterly boring,2,5 May 2005,"Like a lot of people, I rented this based on all of the hype. I only made it through 45 minutes but based on other people's feedback, another hour wouldn't have made a difference.I started watching and knew very shortly thereafter that this movie was not going well. Bill is bored, Scarlett is bored and so am I. I don't empathize with Bill because, even though he's away from home, he's earning two million dollars in one week making a commercial. I don't empathize with Scarlett because, even though her husband is busy a lot, she seems to have plenty of friends and chooses to spend most of her time alone. If they are bored, why shouldn't I be as well watching them? The humor seems to derive from the basest concepts. ""It's funny hearing Japanese people speak English and it's even funnier to hear Bill Murray not understand Japanese"". A Causcasian person intentionally mocking a Japanese person's speech may not be PC but it can be pretty funny. To show Japanese people speaking English badly and someone misunderstanding isn't. Is that the height of humor in this movie? That some Japanese people have trouble with English? I don't care about these two people; their boredom and loneliness don't mean anything to me because they don't mean anything to me. I don't care when they meet and are bored together.I've read critics and viewers talk about the ""chemistry between the actors"" and how the movie captured the feeling of being alone in a foreign country. For me there was no chemistry and there was really nothing up on the screen to empathize with. I've read comments like ""If you traveled alone in a foreign country, you'd understand."" Well, I have traveled alone in a couple of foreign countries; when I needed to do something, I got up off of my butt and went outside.Movies don't have to be filled with explosions and special effects but I do insist that a movie be about something.",Lost in Translation
347,javi-y-se-acabo,"A Beautiful, Funny and Human Story",10,29 April 2017,"This is a movie for thinking. After you watch it, you keep thinking about it, about it's characters, about Japan... It's truly a funny and beautiful story about a famous actor who is in Japan for the promotion of a whisky and a girl who's married with a job-obsessed person. They cross with each other a few times in the hotel they're living and one day they start talking to each other, creating a very deep bond between them. This is a movie about humans, talking about their feelings, the way it feels to be abroad in a far away country, how they get along with each other and so. Here the main characters are played by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. They're both perfect in their roles. Bill Murray has this feeling of a sad person who wants to make everybody to smile. And Scarlett (in of her younger and better roles I have seen) gives an emotional performance, giving a feeling of innocence but also a person who feels she doesn't fit in the world around her, but when she gets with Bill Murray they both feel like they're in home.One of the best things of the movie is the way it captures the feeling of being in Tokyo, with some moments being filmed almost like a documentary film, taking you to all the different kind of things you can find in this city. And other of the great things is the soundtrack, an awesome collection of music that makes you fly to this Japanese city.Overall, this a movie about human persons, so if you're looking for an action packed film without any substance, you can skip this one, but if you're looking for a movie that talks about humans and tells a beautiful story with some hints of comedy, you'll love this one.

352,HardKnockLife210,Subtle and Beautiful,8,30 August 2004,"What is it to be `lost in translation'?  Maybe it's not just the difficulty in understanding a different language.  Maybe being `lost in translation' is a happening that occurs everyday, when one human being can not understand the speech or actions of another.  Sofia Coppola brilliantly explores topics such as these in the comedy entitled Lost in Translation.This film takes place in the city of Tokyo, Japan, and it explores the friendship between aging actor Bob Harris, played quite well by Bill Murray, and young newlywed Charlotte, wonderfully acted by Scarlett Johansson.  Both characters seem to be struggling with life, going through a stage in which they are tired of going through the motions.  The similarities of these two characters are obvious to the viewer, but the two still make an unlikely match, a match made all the more unlikely by the fact that they meet each other in the large city of Tokyo.The most brilliant aspect of this movie is subtlety.  Although the film is technically a comedy, there's no gag humor or imposing jokes.  Instead there is a quiet that seems to allow the viewer to focus more on the characters and their needs.  The collection of music compiled for this film also fits perfectly with this atmosphere.  Also, the film IS genuinely funny, but this is not to say that there are times when it works as a quiet drama.  This furthermore shows the brilliance of Coppola's story and screenplay.  The one flaw in the film is one short scene, which seems to be completely pointless and raunchy, and it is this flaw that keeps this movie from the perfection that it almost so silently achieves.Finally, the ending of the film alone makes it worth seeing.  Instead of laying things out plainly, it instead leaves the viewer to wonder and hypothesize.  What a beautiful piece of work this is, that focuses on its own characters, but keeps the thoughts of the viewer in mind at all times.Final Grade: A.",Lost in Translation

But no, Sofia Coppola wanted to go for the kind of sappy relationship movie that gets Oscar consideration--she succeeded, of course, but at the cost of shedding a good deal of the movie's comedic potential.  For those of you who see this movie on DVD, not to be missed among the bonus extras is the spectacularly funny, full-length version of ""Bob Harris'"" appearance on ""Matthew's Best Hit TV"" (Matthew is absurdly touted in the movie as the ""Johnny Carson of Japan"",setting up the comedic scene).  This scene had us rolling in the aisles(feigning, as we were, that we were watching it in a theater), and it is illustrative of what the movie could have been: a blast of a screwball comedy.  And the fact that the very funniest scene was cut to the bone only shows how misguided Ms. Coppola was in her conception of this movie--trying to take it in a ""serious"" direction when neither the script nor Bill Murray's acting could possibly sustain that orientation.  Again, well worth the cost of the DVD rental just to catch the full version of the interview on ""Matthew's Best Hit TV.""",Lost in Translation

355,plpregent,Quietly powerful,8,6 May 2019,"I know I'm late (about 16 years!), as it's 2019 and I just watched ""Lost in Translation"", which received plenty of praise and became almost a cult classic in the eyes of many people since its release in 2003.Mainly set in a luxurious hotel in Tokyo, ""Lost in Translation"" is one of those films that slowly cruises its way to its audience's emotions, without ever waving the threat of driving it through agitated dramatic waters en route to a tragic denouement. The somewhat unusual Japanese setting is the perfect landscape for this story of two characters, both of which are quietly going through a life crisis, who each find the other's soul to be of an inexplicably comforting nature. Speaking of unusual, I truly salute the originality in the choices of characters that were made here: Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a jaded Hollywood actor who's on a work trip to Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial, and Scarlett Johansson plays Charlotte, an aspiring writer who is probably barely over half Harris' age, who accompanied her husband, a professional photographer, on a work trip only to spend her days in the hotel room, alone, questioning herself about who she is while her husband is working endless hours.Through their respective struggles, all of which are depicted with the kind of subtlety that never disrupts the tone of the film, both characters are magnetically brought to one another, despite both being married. As Harris says at some point in the film, when speaking about marriage: ""you can drive it but there's still the occasional accident"". ""Lost in Translation"" precisely depicts one of those accidents, but in a very unusual way. Actually, it does so in a very soothing way, where momentarily lost souls find meaningful comfort with one another, instead of two bodies quenching lust. This film is not about infidelity. This film is mostly about these people that life puts in your path and that change it forever, in circumstances that make it impossible for them to remain a part of it. There is a truly bittersweet feeling throughout the film to which anybody who has traveled and made significant although ephemeral encounters will be able to relate. It is hard to explain, but this film shook me more than I suspected it would.Sofia Coppola finished the film with a (quiet) emotional bang, at least in my view, with both characters whispering in each other's ear something inaudible to the audience. It was one of those brilliant cinematic moments that elevates a film to a higher level, and allows it to stay with the viewer for a while.The direction sets the tone perfectly, with the kind of delicacy that brings a great clash between those vibrant and colourful Japanese cities and the characters' state of mind. The film also packs great visuals and cinematography. Seeing the reflection of those endless neon lights and buildings on the window overlay a contemplative and thoughtful Charlotte sitting in the back of a taxi was a pure visual delight. The soundtrack also features a great musical selection.Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson both do an incredible job at giving depth to their characters with even the simplest of actions, and bring life to a quite unique chemistry.This is a comedy in many ways, but it tackles themes that would usually warrant using a dramatic tone, without ever employing it, and without ever dipping even its toes into the realm of clichés.

No such luck though, before I knew it, the credits were rolling, and with that, another hour and a half of my life down the drain.What a complete waste of time. It's a little love story of two people coming together in a foreign country, but since it has nothing interesting to tell, the movie goes nowhere, and there's no payoff. It reminded me of Garden State in the way I felt like I was watching two random people dealing with their little relationship and the movie putting them through their motions. I don't consider it entertainment to sit there and watch two people go on their little dates and smile, flirt, and giggle. Far as I'm concerned, here's the plot summary: two strangers meet, they get to know each other, they do stuff together, then sad, the end.The fact this movie takes place in Tokyo is really of no consequence. Provided that we still have our two main characters in a foreign country, this movie could've easily taken place in any other country and told the exact same story. In other words, the producers didn't bother to use the unique Tokyo environment to their advantage. This movie may be considered slightly above average at best.",Lost in Translation
357,eyal philippsborn,Nothing short of a masterpiece,9,10 January 2004,"Sofia Koppola is one of those directors who had both easy and hard times as an aspiring (and now working and justly respected) director. Easy time because when she decided to adopt burt easton alice's novel `virgin suicides' to a movie, she could have rest assured that she'll have all the guidance, resources and co-operation of all parties involved to turn her script to a movie and the movie- a commercial success. after all, when one's father is the Don Korleone of directors, anyone would be reluctant to rub him the wrong way or anyone might end up sleeping with the fish (no, not murdered just stuck as director for jamboree videos). That's the easy time part. If you haven't figured out the hard time part, read the last paragraph again.In laymen's terms, Sofia Koppola encountered day in and day out with critics such as myself who decided to overlook her talent of which she has in abundance, and anyone who saw Lost in translation, couldn't possibly refute that, Don koppola or not.The film's plot (which might do injustice to the film itself),  revolves around a young woman (the unbelievably gifted Scarlett Johansson) who joins her husband in japan, where he works as a photographer, and spends most of her free time  trying to figure out the peculiar (putting it very mildly) nature of the country she's in. When her husband's leaves for a shooting assignment elsewhere in Japan, she encounters an aging American movie star (Bill Murray)  who's shooting a commercial for a whiskey and gets a hefty sum of money listening to a director with lethal level of Caffeine in his bloodstream . Their common loneliness leads into a mix of deep friendship and semi sugar-daddy infatuation.Japan never received a positive viewpoint in Hollywood cinema (Black Rain and Rising Sun are the first examples that pop in my head),  and in this movie too, Tokyo is a city infested with gigantic commercial electronic billboards, alienated environment and people who all look like their auditioning for an Asian version of the night of the living dead.One of the greatest obstacles in contemporary romantic films in Hollywood dealt masterfully in this film,  is the tacky aftertaste to emotional scenes. making emotional scenes that aren't artificially flavoured in kitch has turned into an art and Sofia Koppola, aided with a well reserved script and excellent acting on both Johansson and Murray's part, turns into the Rembrandt of film making, thus establishes as the new voice of contemporary film and take hold of the helm her father abandoned about two decades ago.This movie has an undefined quality to it, a quality that transcends acting, script or even pacing, it's a quality of mature viewpoint of a young person provided by both director and leading actress, anoutlook that is refreshing on the one hand and wizening on the other.Summing up: this movie is by far the top three movies of 2003 (along with Dirty pretty things plus i'm leaving room for return of the king which i have not seen) and is well worth babysitting arrangements. Furthermore, if you go to japan, take a videocam and a commercial load of prozac.9 out of 10 in my filmOmeter.p.s. a week later a saw a documentary about the suicide phenomena in Japan (over 33,000 took their lives in 2002, mostly because of the recession) so take the prozac advice seriously.",Lost in Translation

Truly awful music....Japanese bar jazz and terrible karaoke. People spending $1000+ a night to stay in a flagship hotel in downtown Tokyo develop creeping angst? Hard to buy into this story line.For me, the most moving parts of the film were a flashing neon sign near the beginning, and a run through a Pachinko parlor somewhere in the middle. The least moving (and a good example of what was to follow for 2 interminable hours) was the lingering opening scene: a fat, stationary American butt. Not my kind of hip. I want my $4 back!",Lost in Translation
360,Lt_Coffey_182,Cinematic Masterpiece,8,21 February 2004,"I saw this at the cinema yesterday and had to review this film. As a fan of Bill Murray, I had to see this and due to the flow of awards, my expectations were high. They were met.A fascinating tale of love and friendship....... in Japan! The acting is so superb that I could have believed I was in the same bar, witnessing their conversations. The plot is natural and real that the two hours flew by, yet the film leaves you with a great sense of fulfillment. Sofia Coppola may not be one of the best actresses but she has definitely proven she has a real flair for directing and writing.Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are perfect for their characters and no one could possibly have given a better performance. Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a washed up movie star who has since been reduced to doing whisky commercials in Japan whilst his family are at home. Scarlett Johansson is Charlotte, a recent college graduate who is having doubts over her marriage. Their experiences are humorous to watch as they struggle to get to grips with Japanese culture and the way their relationship develops is joyous but tinted with sadness. Despite the age gap, the chemistry between Bob and Charlotte is fantastic, seeing them together made me smile so much. The only thing that made me smile more was Bill Murray singing, terrific!The scenery is fantastic. A contrasting view of city life and Bob playing on a golf course which overlooks a mountain give a great impression of how Japan is and the dipiction of the Japanese themselves is hilarious yet so so true.This movie deserves all the Oscars it can get and I can not wait to see it again.",Lost in Translation
361,katydid4819,"Life, Actually",7,23 April 2004,"This is an excellent movie about how real people act everyday. Whether or not this is an actual autobiography of it's writer/director Sophia Coppola, it is something everyone can relate to. Set in Tokyo, it's the story of Charolett, a young woman who is newly married and on her honeymoon. Alone for most of each day in a big hotel, she finds herself constantly running into Bob. He is the other side of her story. He leads a completely different life than her but they bond over the fact that, though they are different, they both feel lonely in the same way.The acting is the spectacular part of this film. Actually, it's Scarlett Johansson who deserves most of the credit. Bill Murray is his same character, and though he plays it very well, he has in truth, a lot longer to work out the kinks. Johansson plays Charolett with a subtle manner that more than holds its own against Murray. The screenplay is good. Not great, but good. In my honest opinion, the Coppola is what won this movie its one and only Academy Award (Original Screenplay). It's neither clever nor is it funny in an outright manner. But this movie is a dipiction of life and life is not usually any of the above. Still, the poetic dialogue only survives because of the skills of those delivering it. This should be seen because it's very real and is easy to relate to. ***/****",Lost in Translation

You get ""Lost in Translation,"" a story of two lonely people lost deep inside themselves.Bill Murray is perfectly cast as Bob Harris, a has-been actor who is in Tokyo to film whiskey ads and do some annoying TV interviews. Rookie actress Scarlett Johansson is also great as Charlotte, a lonely young wife of a photographer. They meet in a hotel bar, and its friendship at first sight. Together they paint the town, learn about each other, and find in each other a reason to live.While the performances are Oscar worthy, Sofia Coppola's direction is not. She could have done much more in developing their friendship, even have the pair have second meaning-of-life talk. (The one they had--simply Murray and Johansson in bed, fully clothed, wondering if life ever gets any easier--was the best scene in the movie.) Other than the karaoke scene, during which Murray does a funny rendition of Elvis Costello's ""Peace, Love, and Understanding,"" the music was just out there. The movie is rated R because of one completely unnecessary scene in a Japanese nudie bar, while a song called (I'm not kidding) ""F--- the Pain Away"" plays. Take out that scene, you have a cleaner and probably better PG13 or even PG film. She'll get better.Overall, a good movie that could have been better. 5/10.",Lost in Translation

For no particular reason recently I decided to take a look and was more than a little surprised, quite pleasantly so.I had been put off by the critics' description (and indictment) of the film's slow pacing. But, as I learned after only a few minutes, it is not slow, only accurate and quite real. Real life can move slowly and still interest us. And in the slow pace there is great energy. Maybe this movie is not so slow after all.Ms. Coppola has assembled acting, cinematography, editing, and sound to create a believably engaging portrait of two people stumbling along through different stages of life. In their disparate situations both middle aged celebrity Bill Murray and recently wed Yale philosophy-degreed Scarlett Johansson are so adrift that even their presence in a foreign country on the other side of the world cannot make them more frustratingly, despairingly lost than they already are. Johansson and Murray deliver the resulting tangential relationship as they form a natural alliance against the souring and confusion of their lives.Cinematographer Lance Acord stars by putting up on the screen images that are both beautiful and true to life, a spotlight that refrains from hogging itself in pursuit of Keats' ideal. It is a measure of how much I enjoyed this movie that I intend to let a little time go by and then see it again. ""Lost in Translation"" should ring a thematic bell or two for anyone who has seen similarly intense tentativeness in ""Brief Encounter"" (1945), ""Chungking Express"" (1994), ""Nelly & Monsieur Arnaud"" (1995) or ""The Lunchbox"" (2013).",Lost in Translation
364,IkuharaKunihiko,Not the best Murray film,6,17 January 2006,"The once famous actor Bob Harris is shooting a TV commercial in Tokyo. Being the only American among Japanese, he feels isolated and out of place. But he soon meets a young American girl, Charlotte, who is also lonely in Tokyo. Being the only English speaking persons around, they become close friends, but avoid a romantic relationship...It's almost incomprehensible what amount of prizes actor Bill Murray won for ""Lost In Translation"" - a BAFTA, Golden Globe, BSFC Award, BFCA Award, CFCA Award, Independent spirit award, LAFCA Award, NSFC Award, NYFCC Award, OFCS Award, SFFCC Awards, Sant Jordi Award, Seattle film critics Award, SEFCA and TFCA Award. Plus he was finally nominated for that damn Oscar. Now, Murray really is a special actor, but ""Lost"" is not one of his best films. It's a good drama, but too simple and silly to be profound or brilliant. It raises an interesting point how two ""outsiders"" can become friends because they have some basic things in common ( like a language or mentality ) and how isolation changes people. Also, it's a very refreshing concept from Sofia Coppola ( who won an Oscar and Golden Globe for this for best screenplay ) to avoid a direct romance between a young woman and older man and just show them in a platonic relationship. But I still have a feeling that ""Lost"" could have been a much better film.-------- I've been to Japan and I can relate to some things in the story, but I can't accept that the only interaction of that culture and the American characters is reduced to Bob not understanding what his Japanese director is saying to him while shooting a TV commercial ( the line ""More or Roger Moore?"" is funny, but feels out of place and somewhat too silly ) or Charlotte just aimlessly wondering around a Buddhist temple and crossing a street while a Dinosaur is shown on a TV screen on a building. In the end the plot seems a little stiff and aimless itself. It is definitely a good, quality film, but in my opinion Coppola missed an opportunity to put some more sharpness into it and create a really magic spark, which manifests itself only in the beautiful sad ending underlined by the song ""Just like honey"".Grade: 6/10",Lost in Translation
365,Sisiutil,Refreshing change from the usual,9,18 April 2004,"Am I the only one getting tired of Hollywood's addiction to special effects, explosions, and huge digitized battle sequences? Given the success of this film, apparently not. In Lost in Translation, there are no action sequences. No one dies while someone else utters a pithy and callous one-liner. The aging male star and the hot young thing do not sleep together--well, actually, they do, but they don't have sex. No one does anything obscene with a pie or any other form of pastry. It doesn't even seem to have a plot in the traditional sense.All of which makes it wonderful. This is a film with very European sensibilities, with its slice-of-life story and seemingly out-of-place set pieces. It could have easily been made by a French director and starred Gerard Depardieu and Julie Delpy. But it was made by an American writer and director with American leads, which makes it very unusual and drew a great deal of attention to it--deservedly so. I don't know if it's a ""masterpiece"", but it's certainly a refreshing change of pace from the usual pap we get from Hollywood these days.
I saw Japan as a metaphor for the world here--we're all strangers in a strange land, lost and desperately trying to make some sort of connection with someone else. Big ideas like that don't get much attention in film these days, but it's good to see that they're not completely gone. 9/10.",Lost in Translation

But great similarities can be drawn to a film that predates it by 10 years, Lost In Translation. Yes both include similar themes of two 'lost souls' finding each other, but ultimately each is inherently, superbly and wonderfully unique. And certainly it's no coincident that both use the same actress in Scarlet Johansson and directors Spike Jones (Her) and Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation) were in fact married at one point, show that each has been heavily influenced by the other. Lost in Translation is set into the neon lit, beautiful land of the rising sun, were two individuals from two completely different sides of the social spectrum converge in the in Japan for dissimilar reasons on the surface but beneath, it's a desperate last ditch attempt at for two lost souls to find something they have been looking for but can't find. For Bill Muarry (Groundhog day) a middle aged actor, well past his prime, Japan provides him with one last chance to make serious money before the uncertain twilight years of his career, as well as his marriage, which you feel he has grown disillusioned to come to an end. Whereas for scarlet Johansson (Avengers), a woman in her mid 20's yet to find her true calling in life, so when her husband is given an opportunity to photograph there, she takes an ideal opportunity to find what she's been looking for, meaning. Both character look for it, but none of it are found in Japan, but might be found in each other. Writer/director Sofia Coppola shows relatively matured assuredness for a director relatively young and inexperienced in her directing career; although to be fare, she was born into a family where film is almost second nature; with her cousin being Nickolas Cage and her father being Francis Ford Coppola. It is plain to see that she inherited the talent for amazing character studying from the later, although unfortunately her carer since with only highlight being the recent Bling Ring, it has showed us that she may never really come out from the long shadow of her father. But let's remain focused on the Positives, Lost In Translation was a phenomenal film and should be no surprise to know it earned Sofia a Oscar for Best screenplay, as well as making her the first ever female American director to earn herself a Best Director node – a fete only outdone by Katherine Bigalow who won the award in 2009 for Hurt Locker. I felt that the film was a finally painted portrait on compelling characters in a place so foreign yet so familiar, which Copploa gently with a brush, was able to add a beautiful tint of honest emotion in both Bill and Scarlet, because just like in Her the relationship is one based completely on emotion, without the need of a physical connection, as in the film they only share on kiss , but because of this and not despite, it allowed me so grow more and more engaged with their thoughts, feelings and action with each passing minute.

The story is uninteresting (why do people go places they won't be able to enjoy? you are in a great huge unknown ancient city and feel unlucky, come on, just go home folks, please).The three points are for the perceivable efforts of the very good cast, especially Bill Murray and Giovanni Ribisi.

373,httpmom,Surreal Story Brilliantly Set In Japan,9,18 February 2004,"This is a  good movie from a new movie maker who is bound to be with us for a while to come. It shows great maturity at a young age on the part of Sofia Coppola. I can understand why many people found it off putting, but I respectfully do not agree. It isn't a comedy...it's a life drama. I love the fact that it's set in Tokyo. From personal experience I can attest to the unnerving loneliness Americans feel when confronted with the foreignness which is Japan. I don't feel this movie is disrespectful of the Japanese mind set, just very surreal...which is key to the story.  Americans in Japan are referred to as Gaijin, a shortened form of ""Gaikokujin"" or foreign-country-person. This is not necessarily negative. It's just a fact. Our cultures are so different that the best we do for each other is `borrow' ideas. We can never become the other and this is a good thing! That aside. The Japan setting was essential for the characters to come to their individual awakenings. Their very `otherness' facilitates their growth toward self knowledge. Most movies would have these two become lovers, but love is not the answer here...self awareness seems to be what is the core of this movie. What better place to ""know thyself"" than in a foreign country.
Curiously enough this movie put me in mind of some early films from Japanese film makers I admire...especially, Ozu, Kurosawa, and Kenji Mizoguchi. It's almost a Japanese story in a way. It doesn't really have a conclusion, nor does it have a formal beginning...it's esoteric and very subtle. The environment is used to tell the story of aloneness...so many scenes of the solitary hotel rooms, the pathetic bar with it's American music, and the back drop of the high rises with mazed cars on twisted streets. I think it was brilliant to place this in Tokyo, the most nondescript city in Japan. For all it's beauty...it's so big and so impersonal, so desolate if you don't belong. Stark really. Such a keen eye for detail here. Perfect setting for two individuals to discover who they might be and what they might want. Yes, it's slow but so is life.

Of course Mr. Murray is there, but only those with a bit of cultural clout in their mix will pay any attention to that fact (more is the pity).Therein lies the problem.  Myself, I was going to watch Tom Cruise (as Tom Cruise) in 'The Last Samurai'; but it wasn't on at the time.  So I went to see 'Lost In..'  I wish I had chosen it from the start.  Apologies to all concerned.On that day I saw a film that perfectly encaptured the very human emotions that we have all felt - loneliness, rejection, friendship, love and even that weird sensation you get when you arrive in a different time zone - you know, when it all has a sort of cold haze and your eyes feel like they've disconected.It was such an effortless journey, speckled with subtle and warm humour, that I hardly noticed that it had ended and that there was a tear in my eye. Anybody who leaves this film untouched has not really 'been alive' (either that or they are a pathological killer).Mr. Murray was his usual amazing 'Ps. Im not really acting' self (which benefitted the film totally) with the rest of the cast as perfect as they could be.Coppola's script is subtle and well observed and the cinematography is soft and comfortable.  It feels as much like the synthetic cosiness of the hotel in the film as it could do.  Watch it and see for yourselves.I would recommend this film in full confidence that if you are 1% human you will enjoy it.

The film is slow-paced with scenes where the characters do and say little, and lots of shots of Tokyo doing the stuff Tokyo does. So the escapism this film provides is only that of being other, normal lives in another, normal place. No surprises, not even at the end. Brave and great.Some people have criticised the film for taking it out on the Japanese, but I don't think there's anything unrealistic about the leading characters' response to their environment.

Lost In Translation is a movie that must have a review written for it.I can't deny that I rented this only because of Scarlett Johansson. I already knew that Sophia Coppola won the Oscar award for writing directly for the screen, already knew this was a good movie, but got it just because of her. And I must say... she's gorgeous in this movie. I disagree 100% with those who say that her rusty voice sucks and that she's a horse faced with big lips. I find nothing wrong with all of that at all. She's the most cute girl I have ever seen! Those Japanese girls next to her for me were the same as men. But I have been very delighted at the end of this movie, because it was great.The story is about a girl named Charlotte, played by Scarlett, who travels to Tokyo, Japan, with her husband John (Giovanni Risbi), because he's a photographer and he's traveling on business and since she doesn't have anything important to do without him, she goes with him. But loneliness announce itself with doubts and sadness as she gazes at the buildings of Tokyo, alone at her room... lost in translation. Scarlett is exactly in this movie as I always imagined her to be. A delicate person, with a rusty, but beautiful voice, simple and beautiful, only wearing her underwear lying on her bed, decorating the room and hurting her foot. Even when Anna Faris (Kelly) introduces herself on a scene where she meets the John and Charlotte couple, there's a huge difference on personality, beauty and presence between herself and Scarlett. By the time Kelly goes away and Charlotte starts talking, rusty voice and all, the boring and stubborn girl has just gone and the angel started speaking.Well, if I'm about to just talk about Scarlett throughout this entire review, I won't get to the movie itself. So, here it is. Charlotte meets a man, an actor, Bob Harris, played by Bill Murray. (I personally prefer much more the dramatic and serious Bill rather than the comedian one of the past). Both of the characters are alone in Tokyo, meet themselves and then begins a relationship between the two like no other you could imagine. The locations of the shootings are beautiful. The soundtrack is perfect! Sophia Coppola in the behind the scenes section of the DVD, Lost On Location, is also gorgeous, beautiful, talented and fun.

I'm sorry, but the crushing majority of humans are *not* faced with this sort of would-be dilemma: being well-provided-for and well-fed in a luxurious hotel, having nothing to do. Most people would jump up and down for joy if *those* were their only worries. Now when you consider that the movie was written and directed by Sofia Coppola, the daughter of the first-rate celebrity director Francis Ford Coppola -- well, it's perfectly possible that *that* was the sheltered, privileged environment in which she was growing up; yes, it must have been excruciatingly boring. Yawn! Unfortunately, that is the *only* thing superbly communicated to the viewers of _Lost in Translation_: excruciating boredom. There is nothing but an endless regurgitation of the same half-motifs, with nothing really happening throughout the course of the movie; there are no developments, and you end the movie exactly where you began watching it: that is, to be precise, nowhere at all. I had to exert all of my will-power to be able to finish watching _Lost in Translation_. In particular, Bill Murray's character and his interactions on the phone with his distant, materialistic wife -- that is just trite, a monumental cliché if there ever was one.",Lost in Translation

And if you've already seen the movie and didn't like it, this isn't going to convince you.But, if you're wondering if you should see this movie at all, then let me help you. If you're not in a hurry, if you like talking to strangers, if you're not afraid of being alone - then yes, see this movie. The movie takes its time to really get into the characters because that's what it's ultimately about. It's about people that enter our lives only for a short time, but change who we are for the rest of our lives.I'm probably never going to see this movie again. And perhaps that's a good thing. The movie left a little mark in me that I'm sure would be ruined by watching it a second time. Maybe some of it is because most of the movie is about getting to know the characters, and I know them already.This is a situation where you just have to decide to jump in, hold your breath until the end, and have confidence that the director knew what she was doing.

385,E-un,Lost in the story...,10,5 October 2003,"The thing that I liked most about Lost In Translation was the complete and utter absence of any formula whatsoever. There was no sex, no guns, no rape, pillaging, murdering or any of the violence that make ""blockbuster"" ""must-see"" movies.This is a whole different outing than Virgin Suicides was. It's a simple story, beautifully told, with great humor and style.Murray, probably improvising as usual, even affected the cast on occasion, with his novel wit. Johansson was utterly believable too, as the slightly homesick, bored young wife.As for the story; it was very simple and almost too easy to identify with the characters in some way.Coppola is fast proving herself to be some kind of genius. She brings together all the elements and it just works. Appropriate soundtrack, not in-yer-face but subtle, amazingly simple yet brilliant direction, an obvious talent for spot-on research (and especially impressive when we consider this is Tokyo-as near another planet as is available), and of course the perfect cast.But the real talent shows through when you realize that we are simply privvy to a few days in the lives of the actors. There are no life-affirming truths, no catharsis, no zenith. And yet the story is so compelling and yet so subtle. The problems that exist for the characters at the beginning remain after the end. Nothing is fixed.All in all, a top movie, possibly the movie of 2003. Now I just have to wait for Coppola's next amazing movie.",Lost in Translation
386,cestmoi,How Perfect Can a Movie Be?,10,21 March 2007,"To answer the question, see Lost In Translation. A first time outing for a director with a good gene pool, Lost... is an astounding film. I have seen films at the cinema and loved them, then rented them to see again at home and realized that love at first sight was as bad in films at is can be in life. This film, however, stands up and more. Seeing it again this week I wondered why I had not been on the street proselytizing for Ms. Coppola's film. The cast is perfect. Nobody can do hangdog like Bill Murray. His benign disapproval is sweet and withering at the same time. His ability to denote sageness with his minimalist mugging is art. When Bill Murray does getting tired, your own bones ache, your head gets heavy, and you yearn for just a little peaceful sleep. While part of the talent may be a happenstance based on physiology, whatever it is I vote yes.Johansson is not a woman of vast range...or perhaps only not a good judge of parts to take...but she is absolutely tuning fork right for this role. A little too ripe of mouth is just right, so again we are talking physiology. And there is a sweetness that she brings to her mid-western desire for this much older man that really does say comme ci, comme ca. Her maturity of character here is very well played. From a male point of view, this fantasy woman would be the perfect tryst, of course. Which bring us to the script that is witty and intelligent, and does not make any major statements on moral subjects. It plays like life. Though that life is certainly special for our whisky advertising man and not so bad for the Johansson figure married to an oaf with some sort of salable talent and the awkwardness of just the man he is. Every shot in the film is so good that you wonder how this came about. Ditto editing. Ditto light and music choices. Ditto the social cultural stuff. Japan is strange to us, though the ""artiste"" nonsense is the same everywhere.Movies don't often get made this well. Let's be quietly grateful.",Lost in Translation

388,ebm123,Ba patient and give it a try,10,29 January 2021,"When I sit to watch it first time, I was pushing myself to watch it to the end: the pace was soooo slow that I thought what a strange and boring movie. The next day I caught myself thinking about it, it just planted in my mind and didn't want to leave. And also it had after-taste: I realized that in fact the movie was inspiring and kind of interesting.
So I immediately watched it again. This time I liked it and noticed and understood moments that did not before. And since then I watched it many times, every year or two.I recommend it if you are true introvert (not because it's a fashion nowadays) , or if you like to be alone, or if you like to think, or if you don't have many friends and actually ok with that, but sometimes you are sad, or if you feel lonely, or if you're trying to find yourself, or is you like to expand your horizons, or if you are looking for your soulmate, or if you don't live by someone's expectations and choose your own way.For me Charlotte is so real girl and so pretty (the looks and inside), and full of harmony. This is the best role of Scarlett. I also liked her in Match point, but this one is better.
Her hobbies in Japan, her tears, her local friends, how she is watching local ceremonies or sits on the windowsill and looks over the city... I would feel the same. I felt so connected to her.
And the music is great.Also, there were some words from Bill's character that shocked me ahead of time: when he said what happens with your life when you've got the first child. This is so true.I don't like to hear that this is ""independent movie not for everybody"". I never liked independent cinematography and never hang out with people who like it, but this one is very good - so I don't care about labels that were put on it.",Lost in Translation

390,aFrenchparadox,Sweet bittersweetness,9,22 September 2010,"Bittersweet. This is the word I would use to summarize ""Lost in translation"". The cultural differences scenes are sometimes funny, sometimes just painful (the TV show scene and, even if it's not really about cultural differences, the shooting scene, highly improbable for me). Otherwise, it's beautiful, melancholic, accompanied by a as much beautiful and melancholic soundtrack. But never really happy, hence the bittersweet qualification. They won't see each other again, I am sure of that. They're way too much locked in their marriage by the guilt. Bill Murray's character particularly, choosing to have a one-night-stand rather than sleeping with a woman he knows he could fall for. Therefore not taking any risk to endanger his marriage. Her, I am sure she would go further if he was not resisting. Somewhat logical: I guess giving up a 2-years-old marriage is easier than giving up a 25-years-old one. Plus because his work takes him away often, he doesn't really have to face his failing marriage. She has, because so far she hasn't a life of her own: no work, no idea of what she could do, she gave up her hometown for her husband. And she's younger, she certainly thinks she can still save her life, while he certainly thinks it's too late anyway. But this chosen impossibility of their story is what makes the film beautiful and melancholic. ""Love"" scenes are platonic and bring you back straight to adolescence. But hey guys, let's face it! We are not teenagers anymore and such a platonic love would be unrealistic at our age and wouldn't fit our needs and desires. Finally one comment on some reviews talking about a beautiful friendship. I truly believe in the possibility of man/woman friendship, but I also believe this can occur only if there is no seduction between the two (either one way or two ways). As long as you don't get over it, this is not friendship, this is still possible love. It's the case here: there's too much seduction going on to talk about friendship. But this possible love will never occur, neither will become a friendship: seeing each other again would be too risky, especially for him. Plus (and this is the real cynical touch here), they would never have been interested in each other if they had met in their usual cultural environment; failing marriage or not, it's the cultural difference which makes their loneliness so obvious. Once back in the USA, I don't think it would stand as intense between them.",Lost in Translation

You have 7 more glorious hours of insomnia, and there's nothing but terrible cable TV to view, just like home, but you're not home. This time you're on a trip, you're going to be so many people you won't know where you stand, until you realize you're an older man and younger woman, in love, but not destructively.If you like films to delicately introduce you to moments that are wonderful, this is the film for you, especially if you enjoy the quiet nature of Japanese culture, even better for you if you've been there. If you've ever been a beautiful young woman married to a careless slob, or an older man who has what he needs, but nothing he wants, you're actually one of the lead characters. Watch closely, and the acting will lead you in like a metronome, pushing you quietly along the storyline. Sometimes film resembles the stage, and scenes are much slower than Indiana Jones, you might like getting used to it.Even if I wasn't in Tokyo, or never had a girlfriend that looked like Scarlett Jojo, I would promise you that Bill Murray would bring me into this film and not let go. This film is a lot like True Romance in its character sketches and its use of location and technology to help tell the story part dialog. A film that shows you a deeper level to yourself from a shotgun blast, or a video game enthusiast sequence can only make you smile, if you get it. If you don't, watch it again in 6 months.I feel that this film allowed the actors to actually perform past the showboat style lip gloss overacting we're so far and piggishly ready to consume. There are elements of Hollywood production in this piece, but it doesn't overturn the hard work to be personal done by the team. That goes for the audio engineering, lighting, and camera shots, everything is delicious, just because it was carefully made.Maybe I'm jaded because I am reminiscing about set, sex, and adventure, but then again, I walked from the center of Detroit to the Detroit International Airport just because I argued in the middle of a new romance. I like loud burst and silent moments. This film curtails to my desire to see my life echoed frame by frame. I'm happy for that, and waiting for another film that so captures this late 90's to new millennium Indie film choice of exploring a person more than exploring a Shakespearian style storyline. Long live the people and the story they were in, not just the architecture and the bodiless morals that haunt our brain washing mainstream work in Hollywood.

And I'm positive it was meant that way. There are no heroes, explosions or dramatic scenes. Only ordinary people set in exotic environment. Main characters are apathetic or sad most of the time. They surely have their reasons for that. But there's a tiny little diversion waiting for them.Simple as that. Strongest aspects of Lost in Translation are images and music anyway, dialogs and/or acting are somewhat pushed aside. Suprisingly enough the movie is still entertaining; one moment you're dull just like the characters are and then you find yourself smiling. It's simply an easy film for an easy evening, if you're in the mood.There's really no point in raging about how it is all stupid and dumb and lame and clueless like some of the reviewers did.

And, WOW, does it NOT WORK.  Unfortunately Ms. Coppola neglected to write a script.  Instead, she fixes her camera on a pensive, depressed Bill Murray and a pensive, depressed Scarlett Johanson, failing to put a single compelling thought in either of their heads.  In a plastic/electric version of Japan these two lock retina, and virtually no one in their orbit seems more real than an animated stereotype  all the Japanese entertainment industry folks yell, whimper, simper or just plain freak out.  But no one talks or says anything meaningful, because there is no plot and no script to indicate a plot.  Same with the Americans, who arbitrarily wander in front of the camera.  Giovanni Ribisi, Scarlett's photographer husband, seems to be in another film, not even aware of his wife's needy, private world of self-indulgence and vague personal crisis.

Sofia Coppola's direction dips its toe in a documentary style that compliments well her script, which never verbalises what doesn't need to be. With this approach, Murray and Scarlett Johansson are left to show us a hesitant relationship whose only foundation is a shared feeling of being lost in life's choices; of having no direction and no one else around to understand them.

406,Vash2001,Second time was charm,10,8 August 2004,"Joey-tribiani was right.  I hated the movie the first time I saw it- in a theater. I actually fell asleep at one point. I decided to watch it on DVD just to find out if I missed something that others noticed and raved about. I was surprised to see that I really enjoyed the movie. Not only that, I could appreciate the subtlety, the way the two main characters behave toward each other- from being total strangers to soul mates.  In a traditional movie they would have fallen in love, but here they just enjoy each other's company, knowing that it is a temporary thing, and yet meaningful in a strange way. Bill Murray should have received the Oscar for this.  Scarlett Johansson is one of my most favorite actresses these days. Her unique beauty and intelligence really set her apart.  She portrays the character Charlotte with such ease, she is not acting at all.  The only criticism I have of the movie is that at times it drags a little.  It is interesting to watch the different places Bob & Charlotte visit, but the story does not move at all. The story itself is very simple and it is not an action packed movie. That's what I appreciated during my second viewing- this time on DVD.  I am going to watch in one more time to appreciate it even more. I really enjoyed the hospital scene and how Bob & Charlotte start caring for each other in subtle ways. It is not romantic but it is touching. SPOILER aheadTheir relationship is mostly platonic. However, after Charlotte discovers that Bob slept with another woman, she is slightly upset.  Bob follows her to the restaurant and she makes reference to his age. She must be feeling hurt and mad.  On their last night in Tokyo they hold hands in the restaurant. The last scene where Bob asks the driver to turn the taxi around, and Bob and Charlotte finally embrace, let their emotions out, and give a goodbye kiss, is very well done. I am not sure the screenplay is Great, but it is very creative and unique and Sophia Coppola deserves credit as screen writer and director for producing this movie.  I am glad that I did not dismiss the movie after seeing it the first time.  So those of you who thought it was an awfully boring film, rent a DVD and you might be surprised.",Lost in Translation

The main characters are both lost in Japan, unmoored and lonely, tired, unable to sleep, jet-lagged and confused. Coppola captures this ethos perfectly. The setting is magnificent- a luxurious but cold hotel in Tokyo and the lights/sounds/swirling/frenetic activity in the streets below. Bill Murray nails the jaded Bob and his midlife crisis perfectly. Scarlett Johansson's Charlotte is just realizing that her marriage is not all she expected it to be and that no marriage can provide her with the life direction she is seeking. Charlotte and Bob are both intelligent and highly attuned to the nonsense (e.g. Charlotte's husband's self-absorption, the inanity spewed by the actress Kelly, the artiness of the crew directing the commercial) that surrounds them. High above the Tokyo streets, both protagonists are trapped in their luxurious but cold setting and the two forge an ambiguous, tender bond. It is to Coppola's credit that the bond remains ambiguous to the end (what did they say to one another in the final scene?) and that the movie avoids the traps that could so easily have ensued had the two had allowed the obvious attraction between them to become explicitly sexual. Coppola allows Bob and Charlotte's story to unfold in its own messy,goofy, unclassifiable way. The scenes involving the filming of the whiskey commercial are hysterical. The scene where Murray sings ""More than this"" at the Karaoke bar perfectly captures the film's spirit: unpolished, ambiguous, heartfelt and ironic.",Lost in Translation

This is a movie that will touch me in new ways as I get more life experiences.Each look of these characters, each gesture and each thought will always get a different meaning from the audience.Plus, it takes place in my favourite city in the world. It's interesting to watch this movie before and after visiting Tokyo. I like how it captures the essence of the city as seen by the tourist. Watching it for the first time at a young age made me fall in love with japanese culture.This is my favourite american movie.

411,MadWatch,Wow. This was one boring movie.,2,12 May 2006,"Wow. This was one boring movie. I'm not sure why, but when this movie first came out it seemed to appeal to me, but I did not get the chance to see it in the theater. Then I forgot about it and did not rent it either. Recently I got the chance to watch it on TV. Boy, am I glad I waited.The movie is about 2 people that are in Tokyo for different reasons. Seemingly because of the culture difference, they are unable to fit in enough to find anything to do and mope about how bored they are and how they want to leave Japan. At least Bill Murrays character was somewhat interesting and he is always fun to watch as an actor.The female lead however, generated absolutely no sympathy from me. She is supposed to be the 'neglected wife'. However, her husband is shown as a loving and devoted husband, who happens to be away on business a lot, which is why they are in Japan to begin with. I kept thinking that she was a whiny spoiled brat that should make the best of the situation (she's in Japan for crying out loud; its like a long vacation!). The whole ""husband works all the time""/neglected wife scenario has been done to absolute DEATH. Bleh.So, as the the story continues, the two of them do normal everyday things, like go to the bar, hang out and talk and go out for supper. As the movie progressed I kept asking ""So, when is something going to happen?"" ""What's the point of this movie?"" And then it ended.After reading some of the discussions it turns out that this is a brilliant, subtle movie which is fantastic for those that ""get it"". Well, the subtleties were too subtle for me and chalk me up as one of those that don't ""get it"".",Lost in Translation

He meets Charlotte, the young wife of a visiting photographer. The two become travel companions, struggling to understand the foreign culture surrounding them and along the way, figuring out what they want in life.This was a serious movie - it showed convincingly how a change in environment, a different way of doing things can lead us to question our lives. It spurred me to think about how exposure to foreign cultures has changed me. Yet there were a lot of humorous moments, from Bob's disbelief that the many syllables in Japanese came out to succinctly in English, to Charlotte's declaration that lunch (sukiyaki) sucked because ""what kind of restaurant makes you cook your own food?"". With travel becoming increasingly common since the turn of the millennium, Lost in Translation is a highly pertinent movie that many of us can identify with.",Lost in Translation

There are many who have commented that they didn't see what the big deal about this picture. Well,everyone is entitled to there opinions,but I do encourage all to see this celluloid classic.This is not your typical hollywood romantic comedy. No,sir!It's deep and speaks in unheard volumes. Sofia Coppola scores a direct hit in capturing the subtle nuances that we all experience in our daily lives. I love how she tells the story through the camera as we follow Scarlett Johansens's recently married character leading a somewhat lost and mundane existance in a far away mystical place called Tokyo! Bill Murray plays with perfection,an actor who has been in the business and married for years and is perhaps facing a mid life crisis of sorts.These two lost souls find each other in a foreign land. They both see a bit of themselves in each other but at different stages of life. They both obviously are outsiders and that just makes them more endearing and empathic to each other.I loved this film. It was real. The ending,which some may not like,is to me,the most impacting to me.

Begins like a light breeze, gets under your skin and ends up sucking the marrow out of your bone & replacing it with oxygen. At last, some oxygen in a movie.The best part is that the whole resolution of the film lies in lines that you cannot hear, for He whispers them in Her ear.I was sceptical, since I thought Virgin Suicides stank big time, because it tried to create a mystery by not telling anything; problem: the message WAS ""this (young girl's thoughts) IS a mystery"". And a mystery only works when people can fill in the mystery. No one's interested in a mystery that cannot be filled. That's not mystery, but a riddle - and riddles get boring without a final solution. (Note that this same issue was addressed superbly by Peter Weir's Picnic At Hanging Rock (1975))BUT people, this time Coppola succeeds in telling the tale, the mystery, by leaving out bits - like telling ""around"" the story, something for which Scarlett Johansson, Bill Murray and Tokyo are greatly to thank. This is chemistry! Not the ""hey you look like a democrat wanna go to bed"" chemistry, but this almost intangible near-to-touch chemistry which always seems to be at the point of falling to pieces, but does not. Not since Gustav Von Ashenbach dreamt of stroking Tadzio's hair (Morte A Venezia) has a light touch (her ankle, please, save our souls!) represented a moment so dense that it instantly evaporates in something bigger. It prepares for the final moment where miraculously that which is not heard is what you seek and, yes, find.Well, this just goes to show what mistery is all about - unable to be caught in words. The uplifting resolution reminded me of a mix between the endings of Fucking Amal and Fallen Angels.A lot of namedropping, but that's just bogus from my ego. What matters?

It stars Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, who are two foreigners staying in Japan for a few weeks. They absolutely hate it there and look bored throughout the whole film. There you have it folks. That is pretty much all that happens.If someone is trying to look deep into this movie and trying to find something deeper, they won't find it.

419,angie_l,There was nothing to translate.,1,23 January 2012,"Again, critics convince people that a bad movie is art. I like slow movies and can handle little to no dialogue but this one has little meaning and I had no emotional connection to the story or the characters. I spent most of the movie thinking, I'm missing something. I was convinced I didn't get it, there's something deeper going on. Then I started reading the reviewers who liked it in hopes to understand what I had missed and realized, I hadn't missed anything at all.The story is about a young recently married Yale graduate, Charlotte(Scarlett Johansson), whose husband is a successful photographer, John (Ribisi). Her husband's job has taken them to Tokyo. She is bored and alienated and spends most her time staring out her expensive hotel window. Charlotte is unsure of her future and life choices. You feel her and her husband have little connection to the point of why did they even get married in the first place? John seems to connect more with an American actress. They connect over superficial conversation but our heroine is quiet and introspective and therefore ""deep."" This makes Charlotte more worthy - can you hear the sarcasm. The petty conversation of her husband and the actress bore her because she was a philosophy major, you know. However, Charlotte, this deep and educated woman, can't seem to find anything interesting to do in a lush and vibrant city.Bob (Bill Murray) is an aging actor(?) in a mid-life crisis and has a stale marriage. He is in Tokyo to make some TV commercials. He feels as alone and alienated as Charlotte. They meet and since Charlotte is not much for talking and neither is Bob, especially not about superficial stuff of course, they have an immediate connection. They spend the next few days hanging out and enjoying the night life. Two bored miserable people of a certain amount of privilege seeking more meaningful lives find each other by going bar-hopping and smoking weed. Not much happens and these deep people who have the power to see the world more truthfully and identify the pointless crap basically mock the Japanese. I won't say it was racist but the feeling like a foreigner in a strange land was only partially realized. All new lands have strange cultures, sure, but combined with all the Japanese people presented as inane, smiling, and eager bordered on offensive.I found the characters evoked little sympathy. They were as bland as the story, or non-story, that was told. The movie is boring and slow to the point of unbearable. I don't know what people liked? I'm guessing Hollywood enjoyed a movie that made a relationship with a 30 year age gap somewhat believable and told us it was not out of shallowness but a ""deep"" connection.

There are a few laughs in the first part and my wife enjoyed the view of Tokyo since she had never been there.  But, there's not much more.

That couldn't be any more evident with it's 500+ ""1/5"" votes, which is certainly ludicrous, inaccurate and unfair. I understand it may not appeal to everyone, but it's flat out ignorant to deem this as a poor effort or production. It's anything but.Is it perfect? Of course not. But it wholly fulfills what it sets out to do and is a fantastic effort from Ms. Coppola.People may complain that the storyline or plot of this film is thin, but its simplicity is part of its charm. The aesthetics of this film alone make it worth seeing. If you never had an inkling to go to Japan, this film may change that. Coppola's vision of Tokyo and in essence, her ""strangers in a strange land"" angle, is strong and prevalent from beginning to end.Bill Murray's performance is outstanding, as well as refreshing. His dry wit and comedy sense permeates throughout much of the film. Scarlett Johansson is also convincing and well portrayed.The cinematography is amazing, and for me, very much part of the film's appeal. I was also thrilled with the ending. Overall, I just enjoyed WATCHING this film. A must see for any fan of Murray or Johansson, as well as those drawn to films centering around human relationship dynamics.I found myself relating to the film's characters on multiple levels and therein lies its strength - capturing the truest thoughts and questions of people as they move through life, but never tries too hard or reaches in order to drive a point home.

Unfortunately, whatever happened in the first hour of the movie was negligible, and hardly set up the ending. I did like the last 10 or 15 minutes, though. 
There was too much ""I'm bored in Japan"" looking out the window, or ""I can't sleep"" (which you do, just at the opposite time as everyone else), or ""look at these pretty buildings"". It was too much filler, and not much substance. And, yes, the language barrier/miscommunication routine was somewhat overblown, and ultimately tiresome.Fool me once (""The Virgin Suicides"") shame on you - fool me twice (""Lost in Translation"") shame on me.  I hope there is not a sequel, which is a definite possibility. I like the vague ending as is.

425,hypersquared,Sofia Coppola's perfectly tuned ode to second thoughts (with minor spoilers),9,25 September 2003,"There is a lot of hype these days for `Lost In Translation,' all of which it more than lives up to, but hype itself is dangerous. I'm hesitant to give any more breath to those flames because this is not the kind of film which will answer heightened expectations well, especially if those expectations have been conditioned by the kind of picture we usually see coming out of Hollywood, even those films that are thought of as prestige pictures or art films. So if you haven't seen the film yet, I recommend you forget anything you might have read or heard already, and skip reading this. Go see it, and expect nothing but a graceful depiction of that least sensational of topics: second thoughts.Contrary to the comedic zeitgeist of our times, `Lost In Translation' is a quiet film. It takes its time about everything. There isn't a damn thing quirky about it; in fact, while it is very funny at times, it's a bit morose overall. And while no movie with Bill Murray will ever be entirely devoid of irony, the kind of winking at the audience that too often now displaces genuine reflections of character is kept to its perfect minimum. Despite the circles director Sofia Coppola runs in, the film is much closer in spirit to Eric Rohmer than to Spike Jonez or Wes Anderson, and as much as I enjoy what Spike and his kind do, I can't imagine a more welcome change in the weather about now.It is also important not to expect too much here in the way of a story, or at least a plot. The set-up in Coppola's script is man-meets-girl, man-and-girl-flirt, man-and-girl-say-goodbye. It really doesn't get any more complicated than that, but as in real life (which `Lost In Translation' does and does not resemble in fine balance), those deceptively simple circumstances are planted with the worst kind of emotional traps, especially when the man and the girl are both married to others, and it's Sofia the Director who details that precarious landscape in uncanny relief.
More than anything else you might have read about what this picture means for its participants, more than a coming-out for Scarlett Johansson, more than the best shot Bill Murray has ever had for an Oscar, it indicates that Coppola has got it as a director. She knows how she wants us to feel at every moment, and uses her particular tools of choice - namely photography, music, and especially performance - to get us there.Mostly what she wants us to feel is the tantalizing presence of `the what-if,' the attraction that an older man and a younger woman can hold for one another when they each find themselves fresh out of compelling interest in their own relationships. It's a theme torn from the pages of the oldest books in the world, so old you might think there'd be no life left in the premise at all, but it is in the subtle ways that Coppola achieves this tension that makes `Lost In Translation' unusual.Holed up in the same Tokyo hotel, Bob (Murray) and Charlotte (Johansson) hover and drift around each other in increasingly tighter orbits, first by chance, and then by design, but until it becomes inevitable, they never make the kind of contact that their heightening attraction would demand. Instead, Coppola tells their story in the negative spaces, playing out their interaction as a finely modulated series of long and awkward silences, like musical pauses in a score where the notes tend to be the kind of banalities that anyone who's ever flirted in real life will recognize as authentic. All the while, Bob and Charlotte barely touch. The one bit of erotic contact that they allow each other at all is all the more remarkable for its minimalism, and while the moment may or may not have been inspired by `Claire's Knee,' it does call to mind Rohmer's masterpiece in its delicacy and the weight of its melancholy.In a pop culture that idolizes excess, Coppola is gifted with restraint. Although she does lace the whole picture with a pleasing kind of levity (the punk-pop karaoke scene especially), there are no bouncy, swirling montages of the two illicit companions having the time of their lives; no near-miss scenarios wherein they almost get caught; no mawkish rows with their significant others to make clear how horrible things are at home, justifying their dalliance. In fact, Coppola is fine with suggesting that an attraction like this might reasonably take place between two people who are in relationships that are not grossly abusive, or just plain wrong from the get-go, but are merely in respective lulls.By the time the end comes, we've come to feel there can't be a satisfying conclusion to this affair. Charlotte, and especially Bob, are simply too pragmatic and won't give in to the whimsy of their attraction. There will be no race to catch her at the airport, no promises to leave anyone's spouse, because they and we know that would be bogus and frankly wrong. Yet, just when we are resigned to leave these two in a state of despondency, Coppola pays off the whole experience with the subtlest of moves: an embrace, and a close exchange of words that we cannot hear and don't need to. By suppressing Bob and Charlotte's intimacy throughout the picture, this brief and elegant moment feels nearly orgasmic on the screen, and it's the kind of gesture a mediocre director could never have conceived, much less made to work.Collaborating with director of photography Lance Acord, and her brother Roman, who directed the second unit, she's given the film a look that directly mimics her own still photography. Soft focus and muted colors dominate, except when she turns the camera on the bright lights of the Rappongi at night. Bright daylight is never allowed to intrude in this melancholic, interior world. Shoegazer extraordinaire Kevin Shields (formerly of My Bloody Valentine) was engaged to bring the equivalent sonic traits to the film's music.Lastly, it is almost impossible to not think of the film as surprisingly candid, given the similarities between Charlotte and Sofia herself. Even physically, the comparison is there: Johansson is a more voluptuous version of the petite Sofia, but they share a wry, pouty face and a soft-spokenness that subtly draws one closer. More tellingly, Charlotte's fascinations are closely aligned to Sofia's. She dabbled in photography, and keeps an elaborate scrap book of drawings and writings much like the girls in Coppola's first film The Virgin Suicides. Charlotte's new husband, a rock photographer played by Giovanni Ribisi, is a dead ringer for Jonze, the real-life Mr. Sofia Coppola.One can't shake the notion that there's a semi- or quasi- autobiographical element to this film, and that Charlotte's disillusionment with her young marriage reflects Coppola's. The recent news that Spike and Sofia are separated doesn't do much to dispel the idea. It doesn't really matter, of course, except to the degree that it would indicate Coppola's willingness to put herself into her art (her immediate self, at that, considering she was only married four years ago and it takes a good two years to get a movie made, and that's on the fast track). That level of honesty is no small thing, especially when the vanguard these days is obsessed with highly formalized cinematic detachment, and it's a huge bonus to the certainty of her talent.",Lost in Translation

Seems the only thing that saved this film was they didn't have sex and Americans can chuckle at Japanese Culture. Which was done very well by the way.  Copland is a great director and the story was pretty good.  Casting was horrible and in my opinion made what could have been a decent movie into this one. I have an idea Sophia.

428,Carrzinho,An effortless movie and an effortless joy to watch.,9,27 August 2019,"Murray and Johansson give two of the most natural performances you will see. Murray who's character could conceivably be autobiographical (and perhaps is why he's so convincing) plays an 80's movie star who's career is on the wane doing some lucrative commercial work. Johansson plays a character who's been married for two years and accompanies her photographer husband on a work trip to Japan.
Both characters are struggling for sleep removed from their time zone. They're struggling with an unfamiliar city and with regret and loneliness. They find solace and kinship and relief in each other.
They are seen sometimes together sometimes apart negotiating life and fun in Tokyo. These moments feel intimate. You as the viewer feel you are there in the moment, just as lost and fascinated as our lead characters.
The pacing is almost soothing, in a bustling environment. The soundtrack is as brilliant and quirky as the city. Tokyo is just as big a star and influence on our enjoyment of this movie.
Though more classically a drama it is at times very funny indeed, albeit with a couple of obvious, if understandable pronunciation gags.
It's warm and layered and mature. It's engaging, it's not forced, it's tonally ""just so"" and I'm struggling to find anything I don't like about it.

Not a lot really happens on the surface.  It's very much to the stars' and Coppola's credit that what's going on inside the characters is very clear, yet never directly stated.  Ms. Coppola has a subtle eye and ear that have allowed her to skewer a lot of contemporary types along the way.  I wouldn't call this a really hilarious comedy, but it is, nonetheless, a sly and amusing almost-love story set against an alien backdrop.  I liked Murray's good-natured performance, but I think it is young Ms. Johanssen who emerges as a genuine star in this film, the first true star to come along since Julia Roberts.

Here, Murray emphasizes restraint in a performance that is definitely the best of his career. His Bob Harris is the embodyment of an actor truly on the downslope of life. After decades of playing lovable clowns in mainstream movies, his has wisely chosen to work on more independant and personal projects. This film, which was written specifically with Murray in mind was tailor made for his cynical type of humor. (Sean Penn was also very good in Mystic River, but I thought his performace was too over the top, and I felt his performance in 21 Grams was a lot more restrained, but, the academy will ultimately have to decide.) Matching him perfectly is the beautiful and talented young actress Scarlett Johansson who does an amazing job of convincing the audience that not only is she a Yale philosophy graduate, but, also a mature young person looking for her direction in life, despite the fact that she was only 18 when playing this part! Both Murray and Johansson were recetnly honored with best actor and actress awards at the British Academy Awards. I hope that the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences can also honor Murray with a Best Actor Oscar this year!This movie is not for everyone in that it is a slow, and meaningful character study of two people drawn to each other in a foreign city. If you are looking for another wild and zany Murray comedy, you might be disappointed in that this movie is more of a quiet character study with some humorous moments spread throughout the film. However, once you relate to these two characters you never want to see it end.This is one of the best films of 2003, and proof that Sofia Coppola, the first American female to be nominated for Best Director has a very promising career ahead of her.This movie proves that you can often find true love where you least expect it!A 10 on a scale of 1-10.",Lost in Translation

I finally had the chance to watch it on cable last night. I fell in love with it. It's not conventional by any stretch of Hollywood standards, but what it does show is that having great actors is important when the script itself doesn't have a whole lot of dialogue.Bill Murray is an actor coming to Tokoyo to make Scotch commercials, after once being a successful actor. Scarlett Johanssen is the wife of a photographer, deciding to come on the trip to Japan with her new husband. One is a middle-aged man with previous success and the other is a early 20s college grad. However both are stuck as to what direction to take next in their lives. They both find each other and explore an exciting country they know nothing about and discuss their lives.The acting is great between Murray and Johanssen because it's the words they say in their facial expressions. Sophia Coppolla often uses long unbroken takes between the two having a conversation. Murray has mastered the speaking without words aspect of acting. Johanssen shows what sets her apart from the new actresses in Hollywood, I give her a pass on The Black Dahlia. She's great at expressing feelings with her eyes. Of course there is the creeping thought in the back of your mind that it's a love story and they will both have an affair. Well this is where Coppola goes against convention. A trap that could easily be fallen into in Hollywood is avoided. Each provides honesty and friendship for the other. They cling to each other because they are alone in a strange land they know very little about.Sofia Coppola shows she has inherited great qualities from her dad in her directorial debut. As mentioned the long takes in the dialogue and great scenery shots of Tokoyo. Also like her father, she isn't afraid to have silence in scenes. A good chunk of the film takes place in the hotel in which the two are staying, including a bar/lounge. From inside the hotel the outside beauty of the city is shown through these great big windows.I loved this film, I'm just sorry I missed it during its run years ago.",Lost in Translation

Actually, I really like one of the comments which says ""a boring movie about two bored people"" :) But, the art of cinema is to tell the most difficult one in a visual way. The story is about feelings that we all sometimes have and even can't express to ourselves...So, the director's done a great work here, and if you watch this in a quiet spare time (especially when you feel a bit blue) and watch for little details and small messages in the movie, I'm sure you gonna like it too..",Lost in Translation
436,bliss66,Subversion in Tokyo,9,30 October 2003,"Charlotte is a 24-year old philosophy graduate from Yale, married for two years to a commercial photographer of film and music personalities currently working Tokyo popular culture as if it were a gold rush.  Charlotte is by his side but in her isolation is losing her own sense of self.  Bob Harris, stuck in a kind of repetitive mid-life crisis, is brought to his knees in Tokyo while he shoots a lucrative ad campaign for a Japanese whiskey.  Bob is an internationally known actor whose career and life has strayed very far from his original intentions.  (Our understanding is that Bob is a `beloved' star of the screen whose cinematic glory days are well behind him.)  For Bob, who feels beyond alien in this foreign land (which presumably he has visited before with better results), the strangeness and impenetrability of Tokyo culture (of which he himself is a part) brings on a crisis of dysfunctional proportions.And so, Bob and Charlotte float about, having lost their moorings amidst a sea of unfamiliar faces in contemporary Tokyo.  Lost in Translation is about how like-minded people find each other in such a sea; how these two people come to each other's rescue and, possibly, change each other forever.That last bit, `the changing forever' bit, is far beyond what director Sofia Coppola would contrive for us to believe here, and though Lost in Translation has its contrivances, they are not of the gratuitous, rom-com variety.  Coppola protects Charlotte and Bob from the mass multiplex audiences who have paid their money and want very much to be jerked off in some consumerist, superficial way with a soundtrack of oldies and endless montages of a glamorous `happy' couple, played by performers who are soulless enough to enact a shorthand, cinematic equivalent of a Hallmark card (Richard Gere and Winona Ryder anyone?)-all of which she could have very easily done.  Instead, Coppola subverts our every expectation of how a relationship should be portrayed on screen, perhaps most strikingly, by giving her characters dignity.  Bob and Charlotte are not show-offs; they don't jump through hoops to convince the audience-to signpost in oh so familiar ways-that their connection, whether it be romantic or a shared sensibility, is genuine.  Instead we see the comfort and ease with which they take each other on, the way they care for each other, in their desperation, more than they do themselves.  We also see it in the decidedly chaste way they pursue their relationship, though they express a lot of affection for one another as they laugh at each other's jokes and take ownership of each other during their stay in Tokyo.  (Charlotte says to Bob, `Let's never come back here because it will never be the same,' in one of Coppola's many gentle ways of suggesting that it's people, not objects, that give us a sense of place.)  In one of the film's loveliest moments, Bob and Charlotte find themselves in a contortionist stripper bar, a place where Charlotte has unknowingly suggested they meet, and though both are bemused by their surroundings, when Bob asks if he should get some drinks-going along with her presumably planned scenario-Charlotte says, `No, let's go.' And both are out the door.  Though the dialogue is sparse throughout, Coppola consistently nails moments like this that speak volumes about how much Bob and Charlotte are in each other's pockets, sharing their existence.What Bob and Charlotte share as well-profoundly, deeply-is a sense that contemporary marriage is dead, an over-rated, useless, almost joyless invention that both feel kind of  hoodwinked into, like the heterosexual rite of passage that it is.  (When Bob says, `life as you know it ends with the birth of your first child,' Charlotte says, `They never tell you that.') Both feel cheated by false expectations and one can't help but feel, given they've been married (to other people) for twenty-five and two years, respectively, that their discontent with modern marriage has something to do with the consumerist age in which we live.  Charlotte's ever-absent husband doesn't even think to include her when meeting a friend in the hotel bar-after he's left her alone and completely isolated for days on end. Bob's wife phones and faxes infrequently and then in a terse and tired way, mostly to inquire about carpet samples, the message being:  `Our lives go on even though yours has come to a dead halt.  Save yourself.'A rather stunning moment in Ms. Coppola's film comes when Bob does lack fidelity and more than a little sense; even though theirs is not a sexual relationship, Charlotte feels a complicated brew of emotions in a scene with just a few bits of short, sharp dialogue where Bob is chastised for behaving in, for him, a very undignified manner while Charlotte gets a jolt from Bob as a reminder of how much he has given himself to her, much more than she would ever know.  Coppola, the screenwriter and director, navigates this relationship with considerable skill, acknowledging these deep pockets of feeling without ever giving in to the romantic convention of cramming in a lifetime's worth of experiences between her leads in a few short days or similar rom-com pornography; Charlotte and Bob never seek to define their relationship for themselves or the audience but we see it in the way they continue to be drawn to each other and eventually seek each other out, we see it in the way Charlotte finds that when seated, Bob is just tall enough for her to rest her weary head comfortably on his soft shoulder.Coppola proves a very light touch with comedy as well and Bill Murray's considerable talents are an obvious inspiration for all of the character-based humour; to her credit, Lost in Translation doesn't feel like a comedy or a drama, it just feels like life.  Scarlett Johannsson is literally 19 years-old going on 24 and the maturity and just plain cinematic nous she displays makes one wonder-probably much as Bob Harris does-what the future holds for this startlingly perceptive and talented actress.  Her lovely bottom opens the film and from the first frame one realises you would have to be mad to leave her alone for too long-those lips, those eyes and lovely thighsbut one of the most ground-breaking elements in Coppola's film is her ability to suggest that Bob Harris-a man of considerable age and experience-sees something far more valuable in Charlotte than just her physical proportions.  These two actually have a spiritual connection. Coppola doesn't put Johannsson through the well-known ingénue paces of funny hats, costume changes and long pop video montages whereby she must dance around and seduce not just Bob but the entire cinema going public-on the contrary, when that moment comes and Johannsson has the opportunity to wow us with a karaoke version of Brass In Pocket, both director and performer pass it by without so much as a backward glance.  Instead, the moment is about her level of comfort with Bob, the way in which they both are at ease with each other.  Both performers are very much on the same page as their director who by presenting an A-list Hollywood talent and personality vacuum in the form of Kelly (a hilarious, brutal impersonation of Cameron Diaz by Anna Faris) reminds us quite easily what Johannsson as Charlotte could've been subjected to by another filmmaker.  This isn't that film and Coppola isn't that filmmaker.  She's the one who knows and demonstrates here that the cinema can be a place where sometimes we retreat because we need to sit in the dark and contemplate our own lives as well as the loves, connections and the places and people in it.

It's easy to see that the camera loves Scarlett Johanssen, and she is lovable, but the plot goes nowhere and the blood of this film is thin and watery, rather than red and robust.

439,monimm18,Worth every minute,10,10 September 2006,"I saw this film in 2004, but after re-watching it the other day, I felt compelled to add my two-cents on IMDb, because it saddened me to see how many people bashed this film for not being what they expected from a Bill Murray performance. I blame the trailer for the misinformation - it makes the film seem like some crowd-pleaser comedy.I say, kudos to Bill Murray for his performance in such a subtle film.A friend asked me what this movie was about and, as I tried to tell her I realized how dull it might appear. This movie is very contemplative, it relies a lot on the spectator bonding with the characters and on creating a specific mood, things that take time to achieve. It was a good thing I saw it for the first time in the theatre, as opposed to DVD/VHS; some parts might tempt one to hit fast-forward. Don't. They are as essential as any other part in this movie; they create the mood and help the viewer relate to the characters on an emotional level; and all that makes the film so incredibly rewarding in the end. I would say that as the two characters develop their bond, so does the viewer's with them and ultimately with the film; in the end you might find yourself completely enamored with it.I think this is a movie about many things: interpersonal communication, the feeling of alienation or the need to belong, the relativity of an individual's perceived value according to the circumstances. Had the characters met in LA, maybe none would have paid attention to the other, but their loneliness in Tokio, a culture so different from their own, brought them closer, made them enjoy each other's company as mere human contact, and value each other as people.In my opinion, ""Lost in Translation"" analyzes the most precious type of relationship: simple human affection based on honest communication, no other instincts, biases or interests attached. The story is told in the most delicate, subtle way, the precious style of true cinema.",Lost in Translation
440,FedRev,A beautiful film about genuine human connection,10,15 February 2015,"There are times when the nature of a film demands that it be deeply analyzed and examined for thematic meaning, and then there are times when a film simply is what it is. Lost in Translation is a beautiful example of the latter. It's about people who are lost, lonely, misunderstood, and isolated in society, longing for a genuine human connection. It's a silent critique of the kind of society we live in, which has a way of crushing people's spirits by emphasizing values that push us away from other people and into ourselves, and Sofia Coppola's film sets about reversing that impulse. Bill Murray plays Bob, a famous actor who's lost touch with his sense of purpose and become aware with how ridiculous a lot of the entertainment industry is, and Charlotte, a young woman who is left alone and made to feel like baggage on her husband's business trip in Tokyo. The two meet, begin a friendship, and ultimately forge a connection.

441,tzer0,Lost On Me,2,24 November 2004,"Everyone seemed to be praising this flick when it came out, though why I'm not sure. I was just watching it again on cable and it just plain lame. The real title should be ""Stuck In Hotel"". It just doesn't go anywhere. The whole film should have been like that scene when they go out on the town, which is the only good part of the movie. But even that seems amateurish, with shots that are focus pulled in the middle (not rack focus either) and shaky shots and wild camera swings. It looks like it's edited together from outtakes only. And the writing . . . ? Was there actually writing involved here? It seems like it was all Bill Murray improvising, though if he actually had it probably would have been better. And the atmosphere scenes and the scenes of Murray working are forced and paced strangely. I know that Sophia Coppola was going for a disjuncted faded photo album feel here, and on that she succeeded. But was she also going for a boring, pretentious, student film feel as well? Because if she was, she succeeded beyond he wildest dreams. This is also a Chick Flick in a HUGE way, because Scarlett Johansson's character is cheating on her husband without actually having sex. Oddly as much as I dislike this movie, I don't hate it nearly as much as I should. Perhaps I just long for it's lost potential. I long for it to achieve something. This film, like many in modern cinema, crys out for some sort of triumph. Most people get enough disillusionment and disappointment in their everyday lives without having to go to the movies for it. Perhaps Coppola leads such a charmed life that 'Real Life' is what she longs for. The only real triumph in this movie is that Murray and Johansson's characters get a little slice of what a different life would be like.",Lost in Translation

Lost in Translation is one of those films.  Being somewhat of a skeptic, I didn't bring alot of expectations  into watching this movie, as it was so well received by the critics that I knew that by it's hype alone, it was probably a good movie.  I spoke to a friend who said that watching the movie, he wanted to dislike it as it was filmed in a documentary style with choppy editing, and left the viewer witnessing third person the story unfolding on the screen.  My friend said that as much as he wanted to hate this movie, he couldn't because it was too good and he ended up loving it.  In some ways I feel the same way.  Experiencing the sensory overload of a visit to Tokyo Japan through the eyes and ears of two extremely lonely American insomniacs, we are left feeling as confused over the surroundings as the characters played by Murray and Johanssen.  Both characters are obviously not very happy with their lives until they meet each other and experience a whirlwind platonic friendship that could have advanced into something of a fling had either character allowed it to happen.  The fact that they both resisted and remained platonic I think is the pinnacle of the achievement of this movie. Both characters realize their feelings for each other but yet act responsibly in honoring their respective marriages.  The relationship that develops between these two is beautiful and enlightening and leaves the viewer with a wish for something good to happen in their own lives.  This movie has several moments of comedy interspersed throughout but it is not in an of itself a funny movie.  It is enjoyable because it is very real and you are left believing that what you see on the screen could have very well taken place, maybe thousands of times throughout the world.

The cinematography is beautiful as said and makes Japan look an amazing place.Firstly i guess if you don't like Bill Murray then you wont like the movie. Scarlet Johanson is stunning, beautiful and lost in Japan with bill Murray. There's nothing more to the film than two people being lost. what can you do when you are lost? you can try and move on or you can stay put. At one point in life we all feel lost and this film is just showing two people lost or trapped in lives they realize they don't want anymore. Scenes of Scarlet Johanson's character looking out into the city OK Tokiyo are amazing and show the loneliness of being away from home in a big city.I must admit i couldn't take my eyes of Scarlet Johanson she really was stunning, captivating.

You have solid direction and cinematography displaying a tapestry of Japan's pop culture.  Maybe it was a poor plot that failed to inspire.  No, couldn't be that, because there was no plot to speak of.Without giving away whatever plot outline there was (because an actual plot was non existent), Bill Murray was the cliched rich guy who long ago settled in to a married life that was depressingly mundane at best. Scarlett Johanssen played the very bored, bright educated young woman who seems early on, to have surrendered any personal direction in life.  Rather she chose treding time as an appendage to her vocationally preoccupied equally young husband.  In short... a future divorce waiting to happen.These two environmentally alienated people meet in an unfamiliar environment and slowly grow on each other.  It seems that neither can sleep, probably because deep down, they realize that life is ticking by like an old regulator clock with a broken chime.

Would it become as funny as Caddyshack or What About Bob? I would have been elated if it had been as enjoyable as Murray's Razor's Edge. On the back of the DVD some critic said it was hilariously funny. He had to be on drugs! Ebert and Roeper gave it two thumbs up. I have a feeling I know where their thumbs were! I've been on business trips where I've felt lonely and in another world and reflected back on my less than satisfactory life at home. I've been in a position where a young woman and I shared a common attraction but I couldn't come up with the courage to overcome an age difference, and I've been in similar positions with women my own age and chosen not to pursue the relationship because either I thought she was ""too"" married or I was ""too"" married or she deserved more than being just the ""other"" woman. And I can understand how someone might ""stray"" for a night with someone who also wants to ""stray"" for a night.I identified with Murray and his various predicaments throughout the movie, but found myself looking at perhaps eight lines of dialog and the scenes in the strip bar as all there was to appreciate. Murray was beautifully deadpan, but perhaps too much so, and Scarlett Johansson and Giovanni Ribisi were just boring, which is rare for Ribisi and typical of Scarlett.

The problem is Johanson has zero ability to do improv. Watch the scene where they are sitting at a bar and Murry notices her black toe. He goes on and on about taking her to a hospital while she just sits there and giggles. It's like watching a kid in an acting class, she is absolutely terrible in this movie.

It is as if the director said ""OK just make up conversation about the pool, ACTION!"" And then both actors just stand there talking about the pool, and once again Johanson just stands there trying to make up dialogue, it's not her fault the scenes are so dull, why should she be able to come up with great things to say, how about A SCRIPT???
This could go down as the single most overrated movie of all time. Copolla won the Academy Award for screenplay??

As with many that have gone before it, this film will benefit mostly from extremely strong word of mouth  and I, for one, will be helping it along in this advertising strategy as this is a deeply interesting and accomplished piece of work.In the unlikely pairing of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, Sofia Coppola brings out some fantastic on-screen chemistry and some truly touching moments.  As Charlotte puts her head on Bob's shoulder outside a truly bizarre karaoke bar, we can feel two people truly connect with one another  even though nothing is said between them.  The same applies to the remarkable scene where Bob puts a over-partied Charlotte to bed, clearly contemplating what would happen if he made his move  again, without saying a word.The touching silences show that this is a film that places the utmost importance not on what is said, but what is not said and what is better left unsaid.  Both protagonists are in clearly complex stages in their lives, yet Coppola leaves the audience to judge for themselves  not to have the characters spell it out for them.  This is just part of the minimalist approach that the film adopts  with long shots and long silences.  The minimalism of the film represents the emptiness that the characters feel in such a foreign city as Tokyo  and the culture shock is shown by the juxtaposition of this minimalism with the busy metropolis that is Japanese culture.This is a fine, fine film and well worth a first, if not a second and a third, viewing.

Edited with a lot of jump cuts and focusing on making the viewing experience seem alienating, Coppola based much of the story on her experiences in Japan.Aesthetically, the film shows many different sides of Japanese culture, showing both the youth filled night streets lit by neon, and the hard working adult environments during the day. The shots are well done, some intentionally done handheld to relate to the characters and some completely still to focus on them or their actions. The film was shot in an improvised, almost documentary style manner and the Director of Photography (Lance Acord) minimised the usage of artificial lights, not using the conventional Hollywood way of shooting, in order to maximise the realistic setting. This way it feels simple and alive, allowing you to see yourself in the characters and feel them.There are no subtitles present, to put the audience in the same conditions as the protagonists of the film, absolutely lost and without an idea of what to do.

This should've been a TV movie...).So, they go out and party, meet a couple of times, but the middle-aged man - who is having a tough time with his wife at home who constantly reminds him how much his children miss him and stuff - knows just how old he is and thus do not attempt to score with the young woman.When they're done partying after a few days, it's just ""good-bye forever"". So to sum it up: There is no POINT in the plot, there is a minimum of (and an embarrasingly bad written) dialogue, and the milleu is not THAT beautiful, although the movie makers seem to want to give the audience that impression, since there are a lot of scenes with people just walking around in Japan.I watched this during the mid-day in my home, without any company and I was quite tired and bored. This movie is already boring, and I was glad I didn't have a hangover, because this movies pace would've made me throw up. So, for what kind of situation was this movie made? My guess is in my one-line summary: It is a movie for times when you want to BECOME bored. And how often do you want that? Exactly. A totally pointless movie, and I wish I hadn't wasted a bit of my precious lifetime by watching it. I can recommend to all you who read this to NOT go see this movie.

To give my rating I have to fill up more lines for the review, so to say it couldn't have been better just doesn't sound right, to say it's perfect is selling it short. Leaving aside the backdrop, performances (I was a fan of Bill Murray before this film, he has since ascended to the top of my list of favourite actors), dialogue, story, all the 'tangible' things you can judge a film on, all of which would receive full marks from me separately... this is a true masterpiece, with a quality as rare as a diamond, that awakens and touches on something inside you can barely touch on yourself.",Lost in Translation
457,dballred,Lost Without Translation,6,19 April 2004,"As an American who travels to Japan frequently, I found this film parochially American. I also found it offensive. The parochial part is the fact that the Japanese dialog is presented without subtitles. It is, of course, intended to convey the notion of a totally bewildering environment for the main characters. Unfortunately for the film, I understood the Japanese dialog almost perfectly--as do millions of Japanese, so I cannot feel that sense of bewilderment.
It's offensive to the Japanese. There is one scene in the film--at a hospital--that would never happen in Japan. No hospital--I don't care how tiny--would persist on speaking pure Japanese if they sensed the patient did not understand. They would do their best to speak understandably or find someone who can, and English speakers abound in hospitals.
Another offensive part is the notion that Hollywood is trying to present its own morality as somehow acceptable and even majestic. The principle character, a washed-up actor older than dirt, finds a normal monogamous marriage somehow draining enough to be attracted to a female child (in her very early twenties) while on a business trip away. Sorry, it may be a normal reaction for an older man to be so attracted--but it hardly qualifies at any sympathetic level. This female child, also in a monogamous married relationship and similarly drained, finds this geezer somehow appealing enough to approach him in a manner that is hard to confuse with anything but a come-on.I'm not going to go into how far the relationship develops, but it can safely be put into the unfaithful category as far as their spouses are concerned. I would recommend viewing it--barely. I gave this film a 6 out of ten.",Lost in Translation
458,suicidalicecreamtruckdriver,"Not as smart, mature, deep or sexy as the director wants us to believe that it is.",1,3 May 2011,"Lost in Translation, by viewing the IMDb comments could just be summed up by this: You either love it or hate it. This film would like to think that it is smart, mature, deep and sexy but it is none of these. It's an immature film that has no substance, but it doesn't even have any style. For a film that nearly clocks in nearly 100 minutes, it feels much longer.You could pinpoint this on the lack of plot and character development and the bland direction. The film is direction less and pointless. There was no point to this film, no moral to be told and the biggest insult this film makes is that it is targeted to a niche audience. But that does not make the film any better or mature in any way. Lost In Translation, if viewed as a comedy, is just laughing at Japanese people. For a film which fan base always says that it is a film for 'mature' and 'developed' people, this is an insult on humanity. If it is not a comedy, then what is it? A drama where nothing happens? A picture of 'real life' that features some ungrateful rich people in one of the greatest cities in the world? I'm not saying that all movies have to be in a genre of film, what I'm saying is that films need a direction or purpose. This film has none. I watch a lot of movies and have been writing reviews on this site for a while. According to a fan of this film, a typical 'hater' is someone who knows nothing in movies. Which sums up Lost In Translation perfectly: snotty and pretentious, a film which has nothing new to say or anything that would be passed off as knowledge. It's boring, dull, uninspired and lacks romance or chemistry. Lost In Translation is about as interesting as looking at a canvas without paint on it, and is as much fun as being tipped into a bucket of nuclear active waste. Don't waste your time searching for depth in this film. You have more luck of finding an alien species of orange owls than discovering depth in this boring film.",Lost in Translation
459,bzb2001,Exquisite,8,29 December 2004,"There are feelings which are universal. Almost all human beings have the need to be loved and the need to love others. Sadly, the reverse is true as well. Loneliness is an aspect to human existence that is hard to live with yet easy to share. It is an irony that each of us have experienced. ""Misery loves company,"" and never has that been more true than with the characters in Sofia Coppola's exquisitely crafted Lost in Translation.Sofia, daughter of auteur Francis, made a minor splash with the surreal The Virgin Suicides in 1999. Here she has evolved into a mature storyteller of two lost souls from America who find each other in Japan. He (Bill Murray) is a falling star in Hollywood who is still worth money in the land of the rising sun. He has agreed to fly there in order to film advertisements for a local liquor company. She (Scarlett Johansson) resides temporarily with her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi).Somewhat by chance, mainly by cultural bonding, the two find they are kindred spirits in a strange land. Murray's character is trapped in a loveless marriage and feels he has sold out to accept money from Japanese businessmen. Johansson wonders about her place in the world, both existentially and professionally. A philosophy graduate, she is confused about the state of her life and is further annoyed by the man she has married; his absences and shallow friends and acquaintances do not make her life any easier.Johansson, still a relative newcomer, continues her string of successful performances but the true revelation here is Bill Murray. From my description it might be hard to understand that Translation is actually a comedy, a dark comedy, but a comedy all the same. Murray breathes a morose lovable quality to his character unlike anything he has ever portrayed before.If there is anything wrong with the film, it is the filler. Coppola's idea is fresh and colorful but is only mostly baked. What she has is tremendous, but there are a series of scenes that involve the two characters wandering around video game parlors and strip clubs and sushi bars. Some of it is interesting: watching lost souls meander a different world from their own. But much of these scenes simply bridge the delicate start with the emotional ending. Though it all works in one sense, it is easy to see through the obvious void.Despite the flaw, Lost in Translation will delight those who are patient and willing to watch films which are sometimes difficult. It is these ambitious films that are the silent backbone for the movie industry's golden paychecks like Mean Girls and Pirates of the Caribbean. ***.5 out of ****",Lost in Translation

461,thepsychocritic,Some people are never meant to be. Or are they?,9,31 August 2011,"Lost in Translation is a film whose meaning varies with perception. It could be like a piece of art for some; beautiful is its every fabric. It might be an ocean for others, deep and thought provoking. And for a few, it can even be a symphony, well-composed, soothing and touching. Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is an actor traversing the descending slope of his career. He looks haggard, past his fifties, is not entirely happy with his married life and is now stuck in Japan, shooting for an advertisement for Suntory whiskey. Charlotte is a newly married girl, just done with her graduation. Her husband is a busy man. She is lonely. Bob and Charlotte meet; an unlikely couple. In an alien land where even the language is unknown to them, they find solace in one another - he a father with half his days gone, she a young woman who doesn't know her purpose in life. But some things are never meant to be. Or are they?The movie doesn't have a plot it has a story in the form of observations made through the eyes of its protagonists. The story evokes the tenderest of your emotions as you see two distraught people trying to come to terms with their lives. The atmosphere is melancholy, but it doesn't permeate into your heart. Instead, you can't help but marvel at the subtle perfection of the build-up. There are times when the camera focuses on things in the foreground, but the blurred, Christmas-like red, blue, yellow and other resplendent lights in the background catch your eye, which when keenly observed, not only help in developing the environment, but are also a visual delight. The movie has been shot in a dim-light which suits its air. It is also symbolic of the desolateness encroaching Bob's and Charlotte's existence. The soundtrack is like drops of rain echoing through still surroundings. It is soft, but it resonates with the situation. Every scene of the film has been adroitly made by the director, Sofia Coppola. The things that have been shown on screen are more meaningful than they appear, and as you contemplate over them, things are revealed, the realization of which is sheer bliss.The film handles emotions like newly born babies. It carries them steadily throughout, before reaching a gradual crescendo. Despite its dismal settings, there isn't a moment that causes ennui. It has been tinged with Bill Murray's sardonic sense of humour and causes an odd sense of joy, one that isn't reflected outside but fills you with fuzzy warmth - like happy memories of antiquity.How does one complain against Bill Murray? With his performance in this movie, he just reasserts what a sublime actor he is. He is witty and cynical, but unhappy and despondent. He works with a nonchalant air. Though he is old enough to be Charlotte's dad, he carries the role with grace. Murray doesn't pretend to be Bob Harris; he is the man.Despite the pressure of having a man like Murray opposite her, Scarlett Johansson does an impressive job as Charlotte. She is sensitive, innocent and unprepared for the hardships of the world; that is why you feel sorry for her. She remains silent through all her ordeals, and that shows her inner strength. The two blend well together, each giving a simple, but unforgettable performance in their own way.A subtle yet distinct feature of the film is that the voice of a person speaks about his/her personality. Both Bob and Charlotte are soft spoken and their character is likewise - soft, brooding and thoughtful. They remain like that through the movie - never loud, never brash - and so does their persona. There are others, some overwrought, some morbid and some that talk really fast, which are all reflections of who the people are - gregarious, depressed and overworked, in that order.Japan has been shown in the best light possible, without there being pretension of any sort. Even the mere sight of the monks and temples makes you feel at peace with yourself. They have shown the sunrise against the skyscrapers - the former a breathtaking beauty, the latter proof of Japan's phenomenal growth. The Japanese are a study in contrast to their American counterparts - they are excited, perpetually joyous and very outspoken. They love their guests and are infatuated with their language, even though they are horrendously lousy at it and never get the 'r' and 'l' correct.Lost in Translation is a very niche film. It isn't for those who try and find a purpose in everything that happens. It can only be appreciated by people who notice its serenity and realize that the journey is often worth more than the goal. As for the end, it is truly spellbinding. It will mean different things to different people, like the movie has been specially designed to suit your imagination.",Lost in Translation
462,hamass-mujadid,Americans or Japanese? Your Call!,7,22 March 2015,"First of all, and I mean no offense here, I am always ambivalent (and mostly negative) about Asian resorts. There's something artistically plain about it. It's very hard to absorb. This Asian factor gave me a hard time, and I agreed with the lead cast on many judgments. I hold nothing against Asians in particular, it's just that the atmosphere depicted in the movie is truly frustrating sometime. You don't get used to Asian regions in a glimpse, and sometimes even after long periods of time. So while I somewhat loathed the whole Asian part in the movie, I concurrently loved it too, for it exacted my opinions with such clarity and conformity. Call me racist, I won't mind.Lost in Translation mounts the romantic reformations of two affected individuals. Both Charlotte and Bob have been emotionally unstable and their banal stay in Japan makes their lives even more unbearable. With the whole Asian life going on adjacently, they find their only source of entertainment, or rather peace of mind with each other. They don't mind each other's age, or looks, although Charlotte does complain about Bob's height on one occasion. With simple conversations, they build an extraordinary relationship, which none disclose with words. I reckon Sophia Coppola found it unreasonable to vocally express the bond as it would simplify the whole concept, and I'm one-hundred percent with her on this. The moments I spent with Charlotte and Bob were one of the most memorable moments for me. Their chemistry was beyond excellent. They infused every emotion, every tension, and every reservation with such delicacy and perfection, like when Bob's shooting for the commercial—the face he makes on director's ever-going dialogs, and the face he makes while he actually shoots is both intricate and funny.The writer obviously implies much against Asians, or is just critical of their routine. It's a rather delinquent subject for most of Asian natives, but a visionary look tells us that Lost in Translation backs opinions and views of a very wide population; people actually feel this way, and it's not a criticism, it's a suggestion to be more cosmopolitan. Sophia undertook this controversial responsibility and improvised it with immeasurable degree of acuteness and neutrality. More than anything else, she exquisitely highlight the various harsh cross-overs of lifestyles, norms, and routines of inhabitants of different regions. Scarlett Johansson has never seduced me more. I literally despise the present-her for the amount of unspeakable she's doing to herself, her fans, and general audiences. I loved Scarlett for what she did in Vicky Christina Barcelona, Match Point and this one. Her smile was tormenting; she was an aphrodisiac (I'm getting goose-bumps.) Now, she just looks ugly. Lost in Translation is perhaps Scarlett as her best. I fell in love with her from the first scene—her rear peeking through the underwear, and her legs (get me some cold water, somebody!)Bill Murray—I've never really liked him. The guy picks dumb roles in somewhat dumb movies. I mean he's stuck to Anderson like I'm to media. Anderson makes richly imaginative, yet dumb movies. This becomes even more frustrating when Murray gets all the mortifying characters to play. I saw his true potential for the first and only time in Lost in Translation, and although I still am not a fan of him, I've to appreciate what he's done in the movie. With everything complementary about the movie, I still have some reservations. Will Sophia Coppola, unlike Lisa Cholodenko, come up with ideas like this? Will she ever come to the level of Woody Allen, Richard Linklater, or Alexander Payne for that matter? I guess not, and that disappoints me. This makes me think that movies like Lost in Translation might just be good-luck for Coppola, Cholodenko, and others like them, and that such movies are therefore, not works of rigorous imagination and aesthetic ability. I hope I'm wrong. But I can't be; it's 2015 and Coppola hasn't done anything else that extraordinary so far. I'm worried.",Lost in Translation

The film is filled with long, lingering shots of Bob Harris (Bill Murray) looking bored and bewildered and Charlotte (Scartlett Johansson) looking wistful and winsome (Johansson is easier to look at for extended periods of time). There are several scenes in which Japanese people speak to Murray's character in Japanese, which he doesn't understand, and scenes in which he speaks to non-English speaking Japanese in English. In these scenes, there was no translation for anything to be lost in. Bob Harris' inability to care about the new carpet that his wife is fixated on is a heavy handed metaphor demonstrating that you don't have to be separated by the lack of a common language to lose things in translation. The movie also seems to want to convey the message that anyone who is happy and upbeat about life (the cabaret singer, John and Kelly for example) is a moron, and that truly sensitive people have to be miserable and bored, whether they understand the language or not.

466,gigadragon12,Word of Mouth Review: Lost in Translation,9,4 July 2011,"Review Score: 9/10 – Beautiful Cinematics and an alien culture create some of the best atmospheres for a uniquer love story than most movies.Lost In Translation is the story about aging actor Bob Harris (Bill Murray) as he goes to Japan to film some whiskey commercials. Along the way he meets and shares a deep relationship with Charlotte (Scarlet Johansen) in a down to earth and adult relationship.Where Translation manages to wow and impress is largely in its visuals. There are several expanses of the movie that simply observe the city of Tokyo and other areas of Japan. It examines its plant life, parks, industry, religions, cultures, all without a single word of explanation. This works as it allows the viewer to take it in and form their own opinions about these things. They aren't just placed out of context however, they are always following a character or both the main characters and have reasons for being there.This also plays largely into the comedy of Translation, as Bill Murray winds his way through various media sets from photography to film to TV and even his encounters with a Japanese prostitute and hotel staff are rife with cultural humorous and add to the entire shroud of being misplaced.Being misplaced is a huge central theme of the movie. It accomplishes this by having its American characters in a Japanese setting and going through the most zany and out of whack parts of that culture. The characters both feel misplaced in their relationships and their futures (Bob Harris' failures as an actor and Charlotte's useless seeming position in her marriage and job (she has a degree in Philosophy)). But I do wonder if this effect can truly be felt by everyone especially a person from Japan perhaps, might understand the physical comedy of things like a shower that's too short for Bill Murray, but what about the cultural displacement? So as such, this is the films only true downfall is that it does rely on cultures to shift the difference and apply the alienation to its characters. While this could probably be easily observed by anyone, I do wonder if it can be felt by audiences that aren't innately so Americanized. Of course, that being said, its like having a Japanese person watch an episode of Jersey Shore, and even most Americans know whats wrong with that public face, right? A bit off track there, oh well.Anyways, Lost in Translation is heavy with cinematic sections, a good unique love story, and a very rich and powerful setting that impresses even as it enchants. It is a great movie, and no one should miss it.",Lost in Translation

I've heard plenty of people call it ""Genius"" and ""The Best film of all time"". WHY??

As Patrick Stewart says on a TNT commercial, ""Drama is life heightened."" I found no such drama in this film.Focus Features claims to make original pictures, in opposition to the endless cliche movies of Hollywood; however, the three I've seen so far have had unoriginal plots, bland stories, and sparsely challenging roles. Before viewing ""Lost in Translation,"" I had seen ""Gosford Park"" and ""Swimming Pool."" Ludivine Sagnier was the only worthwhile aspect of the latter, and the plot of the former was not ""original,"" as the Academy had awarded it - ""Memento"" was far more ""original"" a screenplay.

You're at the point where you either say goodbye, and wander off in search of more forgettable pleasantry, or you take the chance to say what's really on your mind and to give another person a chance to know who you really are. ""Lost in Translation"" is a movie about two people who reach that place in their ongoing conversation, and decide to take the chance. It isn't a romance, at least not in the traditional sense-- these two people don't simply need someone to love, they need someone to remind them why they get up every morning. It's one of the most humane, genuinely good-hearted films I can recall watching, and at the risk of imitating earlier comments and reviews of this movie, I think it's one of the best films in recent years.It doesn't have ""that scene""-- it's never flashy or obvious. Its single best moment comes when we don't know exactly what its lead characters are saying to each other. Its visual style is a sort of oddly placid bewilderment-- the movie does an excellent job of making you feel as if you're lost in a city where you don't understand anything. If you were there, maybe you'd be looking for someone who doesn't understand it either, but might understand you. I loved this movie, because I believed every second of it. Bill Murray has never been better in his life than he is in this film, playing an American movie star who's just a little too smart and a little too wise to be impressed with himself anymore, and he's matched note for note by Scarlett Johansson, as a young woman who hasn't found her place in the world yet but is pretty sure she's made a wrong turn somewhere. This is a movie about finding someone who'll listen to you, someone who doesn't know you well enough to know what it is you want to hear,  but might tell you what you need to hear.

Lost In Translation is not a movie for everyone, especially those with a decent knowledge of modern Japan. Nor is it a subtle masterpiece that only emotionless brutes are unable to enjoy. Western cinema must be in a sorry state indeed if an average film like LiT is lit up as the movie of a year because it dares take two steps away from standard formulas like the age-old love story or a clearly defined main character. Those two steps are not enough, they won't take a movie anywhere.Coppola should be given some credit on creating a solid movie and directing an actor like Murray, but the film itself is too void of meaning and message to leave an impression. The main characters are not probed more than shallowly, which is a lost opportunity with an actor such as Bill Murray, and expected with a choice such as Scarlett Johansson, whose young age is so obvious as to harm the credibility of the film. Even with a setting like the futuristic Japan, the movie is not able portray anything which is not already old and rugged from repetition.

The more serious tones of the movie and the beautiful cinematography are gorgeous and really leave a mark after the movie is over. It is ranked up there as my favorite movie next to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind! The acting is truly amazing. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are perfect for their roles and could not have done a better job! Bill plays the depressed actor pitch perfect with his usual quirky humor along the way. Scarlett is incredible as the young woman questioning her marriage and trying to find herself along the way. She really brings a sophisticated kind of sexiness to the role. The music is probably one of my favorites. It conveys the movie's themes beautifully. If you ever get a chance, go out and see this movie.

Although I wouldn't call ""Breaking the Waves"" banal, I mention it because that was the last movie I remember being so widely praised both by critics and public and totally leaving me cold. Well, if you liked ""Breaking the Waves"" -- another miserable study in desolation -- you'll probably like this one. Why anyone would find this movie interesting is beyond me. I found it completely bogus. Bill Murray's character was fascinating and I wanted to know more about him, but the young woman was a complete and utter empty bore. So a couple of lonely, depressed people in disappointing marriages find someone acceptable to spend a week with. Big whoop!! She didn't have anywhere near enough substance to make this real or interesting to me. And another thing: A big deal was made of Bob being married 25 years -- how many people have you heard of that are married 25 years and have two young kids? I could definitely have seen him married about 10 years to a much younger woman who was getting fed up with him and his lack of attention to his needy family, but after 25 years it's not about the kids anymore. But I guess it had to be ""25 years"" to be a HUGE contrast with Charlotte's measly two, as if that puts him in a position to pontificate. Hey, news flash kiddies: Marriage is HARD and often depressing. DUH. And a guy of 50 isn't having a midlife crisis, by the way; he's way past that particular milestone. Calling it that just puts the cherry on this huge, pretentious piece of McBanality. Oh, and what did he whisper to her in the last scene? Who cares already?! It seems the relationship between the two was the main event for admirers of this film, but for me that was what destroyed it.

Bob is a lost soul, trying to figure out his marriage, career and life. He meets Charlotte, a young woman trying to figure out the same things. They have a romantic relationship and spend time wobbling around in Tokyo. Time runs out and Bob leaves for home, leaving Charlotte crying.Bob and Charlotte are one the most relatable characters in cinema. Bob feels so much like the one older friend who servers as your personal psychiatrist and who gives great life advice. Charlotte is the one girl who everyone thinks is kinda slow and senseless, but is actually just very young and naive. She's the one girl who goes to law-school and just aces everything, while remaining humble and nice.And finally, the soundtrack.

489,stedrazed,A quietly beautiful film.,10,18 November 2003,"What would you do if you met your soulmate after 25 years of marriage to someone else? What could you do? After a quarter of a century of commitment, including children, to one person, how do you even admit to yourself that you've just found your ideal companion, especially when that person is married as well? This is the dilemma with which Bob Harris (Bill Murray) finds himself faced in Sofia Coppola's LOST IN TRANSLATION. Oh, did I also mention he's stuck in a country whose language and culture he doesn't begin to understand? Murray's performance is excellent, his best work in years. The lines of age in his face and his subtle, toned-down gestures and expressions erase the Bill Murray we all thought we knew, leaving only Bob Harris. This is not to say that the role is humorless ---- far from it. But it is a deadpan, morose kind of humor, the humor of a man who makes another person smile to keep from crying himself. When Bob and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansen) meet and begin getting to know each other, they speak often of Bob's ""mid-life crisis"", but this is in no way the story of a middle-aged man's desperate, self-destructive infatuation with a much younger woman. This is the tender, unspoken romance of two beautiful misfits kept apart by self-defeating fidelities and the prejudices of time. What would have happened had Bob and Charlotte been the same age and unmarried when they met? Certainly something wonderful to experience but, in terms of the film, much less poignant and interesting to watch. It is the looks of longing between Bob and Charlotte, the aforementioned subtle gestures of Bob, that make this film such a sad and beautiful experience. It is the performances that immediately capture the viewer of this film, but never doubt that Sofia Coppola is a fine and wonderful filmmaker. She doesn't rely on any flashy camerawork or clever plot devices to tell her story, but don't be fooled by the film's minimalism; Coppola has written a profoundly beautiful script. The dialogue is sparse at times, but this only lends greater power to the words that are spoken. Murray has a line in this film that I may never forget: ""The more you know who you are and what you want, the less you let things upset you."" Simply put, but just ringing with universal truth and importance. LOST IN TRANSLATION is funny, sad, warm, irritating, fulfilling, thought-provoking, simple, tedious, surprising and beautiful, just like real life.

490,cs100,Lost: the moral of the story,3,20 October 2003,"My rating: 3/10Lost in Translation suffers from having no central theme, moral, or fundamental message to communicate.  If it were a mindless screwball comedy it could be forgiven this flaw; however, the movie does appear to have the pretensions of communicating some sort of deeper meaning.  But the best moral of the story that I can come up with is:  people in strange foreign cultures, cut off from family, will bond together and make some bad choices until their return flights depart.  Hardly an earth shattering revelation.Bill Murray does give a fine performance, and has several opportunities to showcase his ironic wit, especially when filming a whiskey commercial. The film also functions as an interesting Tokyo travelogue and an introduction to various aspects of Japanese popular culture, including the pachinko parlors, arcades, street youths, strip clubs, and Japanese television. Bill Murray's visit to an over-the-top gaudy Japanese talk show is another one of the highlights.Unfortunately, the film's flaws outweigh the positives.  Besides lacking meaning, the plot takes several illogical turns.  Just when Bill Murray's character and the young married woman he meets appear on the verge of deepening their relationship, a much older floozy steals his affections for the night, which he instantly regrets.  This prevents the film from developing into a love story - it's a friend story, and one in which the friends aren't acting terribly rationally.  The young woman whom Bill Murray's character pursues is remarkably directionless; it's hard to believe that someone who graduated from Yale with a philosophy degree would be following her husband on a photo shoot assignment, listening to pop psychology motivational speakers, and crying over her experiences in a Japanese temple.  Some of the humor is more clichéd than funny, especially the ditzy blonde American actress.By contrast, Groundhog Day, which is a more mainstream film, was not only much funnier, but also had a message to communicate, about how one should conduct one's life.",Lost in Translation

The clever cinematography delivers the foreign dynamic, the wonder and bemusement of an entire wold lost in translation, yet being in the middle of it. This immersion is on a level that only few films ever could achieve.This films beauty stretches to its heartfelt screenplay, which characterises its figures so successfully, so clearly and delivers upon their lives complexities and worries so masterfully. A wonderful story, though some may say it meanders, I truly understand and grow to care for the characters more deeply, and thus in my opinion it strengthens the feature. The screenplay also delivers upon the initial awkwardness, when shot in tandem with the cinematography, the tone for each scene is display and inferred enough for the audience to immerse in the emotions more deeply than in other films.The acting is truly of the highest league. Bill Murray has even said this was his favourite performance. Together, coupled with the beautiful screenplay, Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray have such a sweet, colourful and loving chemistry that clearly shines through into the final product. Theres so many scenes to display this combination, what comes to my mind most is the scene following the party where Charlotte leans her head on Bob, and the final scene between the two. In addition to this, Giovanni Ribisi is fantastic as always, and the rest of the supporting cast deliver upon their characteristic functions to the plot, in the upmost quality.Unlike many post 2000 films, the music in this film is truly of remembrance, the slow guitar and quiet melodies and motifs that repeat and develop throughout the scenes truly compliment the feature. The music does not dictate the emotion, this is up to the audience, it acts as a vehicle to stratify whatever emotion the viewer feels in the scene. This is a highly uncommon achievement, which is worthy of great praise.This film evokes different thoughts and responses from all people, as it has a mature subject, children would not enjoy it. But I feel very personally about this film and truly it holds a special place in my heart as one of my favourite films. Due to its beauty, decorum and truly pure craft.Despite this, no film is without flaw. On the subject of meandering, some scenes were executed to near perfection, however on some but not all repeat viewings certain scenes lack the same impact, particularly in the first half of the film, though the later scenes grow in their meaning and emotion upon repeat viewings.Overall, I truly love this film and give it a very high 9/10.",Lost in Translation

It's also Bill Murray's best performance.  He is nothing short of amazing playing a has-been actor with whom the Japanese are still infatuated.The story takes place over a week period in Tokyo as we are introduced to Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte, played with much maturity by Scarlet Johannson. They are both stuck in a culture they don't understand and marriages they aren't sure are working anymore.  Charlotte's husband (Giovanni Ribisi) is a photographer who is always on a shot and leaves her in the hotel to fend for herself.She wanders around Tokyo and Bob keeps himself in the hotel bar where Charlotte finally bumps into him and a friendship is slowly developed.  This friendship saves them from the aching loneliness visually displayed by Sofia in long, beautiful shots of Johannson sitting in the hotel window looking out over the sprawling metropolis of Tokyo and Murray trying to find anything on Japanese television he can connect with.Don't get me wrong.  This is not a downer movie.  It is one of such various and vast emotions that I'm surprised Sofia fits them in to one little movie.  There are moments of great laughter and joviality such as the ""gift"" that is sent to Bob's room. But even when when Charlotte and Bob's adventure begins it is quite apparent they are still not truly happy especially when they end up at a Karaoke bar and you get to see Murray's character singing Roxy Music's heart-breaking ""More Than This"".Some people may find the slight fun poking at the Japanese a little too much, but it's meant to show just how different their culture and ours are so different.  A few scene are down right gut-busting and others just drive the character's actions as they try to something to hold on to they can identify with.  It's an amazing cornucopia of events and emotions.I found out, too, that Sofia went to Tokyo many times with her father, Francis Ford Coppola (you may have heard of him), and I wonder if they story is somewhatautobiographical.

500,jasonsurety,do it!,7,27 April 2004,"Lost in Translation has elements of a great film.  The feeling of alienation is presented well.  There is chemistry between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  The subtly in the relationship between the leads surpasses most films.  Where in most films, the characters would fall into a passionate kiss early in the picture, these two fall into an intelligent and touching conversation.Spoilers: Translation is not a great film, though.  It is a good film, but it lacks some key elements that would take it to the next level.  That a young, intelligent, beautiful woman(Johansson) would waste her time in Tokyo isn't unbelievable, but it is unlikely.  Before her and Murray begin their consanguinity, she seems quite slumberous.  It is revealed that she is dissatisfied with her marriage to the photographer she has accompanied. Then why did she come along?  Did she want to reconcile?  She makes no attempt.  It is only the Murray character who enlivens her. 
I found it realistic that they didn't have sex, but a little less believable that neither made more of an attempt at this.  Each actor rendered feelings of desire well, but characters become less appealing when they let opportunities slide through their fingertips.  Did they not give in to temptation because they were married?  This seems like the wrong explanation.  Otherwise, they should have avoided one another because their attraction could have yielded sex,  not to mention that Murray sleeps with a lounge singer.  Their relationship goes deeper than sex?  Yeah, I'll buy that, but why not consummate such a bond?  That these two truly love one another would hurt their spouses more than a physical act.These are only slight problems.

501,shinymc_shine,Fear and Loathing in Japan,8,20 January 2004,"Sofia Coppola's ""Lost In Translation"" is a gentle dramedy about a friendship formed due to isolation and loneliness.Bill Murray plays a once hot actor, recently fallen on hard times, who accepts work doing a whiskey commercial in Japan. Scarlett Johansen is a newly wed married to a hard working photographer who spends the majority of her time keeping to herself in her hotel room. They both share a bond based on isolation by their foreign surroundings, suffering from insomnia and separation from their loved ones. In a short period of time they become the best of friends, able to discuss subjects that they couldn't bring up with their spouses. This is a character piece, deliberately slowly paced that at all times feels real even though the events take place in one week.Murray is flawless in a seriocomic role. His face expresses perfectly his bewilderment with his new environment, the people and their customs. There are brilliantly comic scenes throughout with Murray in top form. I haven't seen him as good as this since Wes Anderson's ""Rushmore"". Like every heavy metal rock band can produce a romantic ballad so to does every comedian have a serious performance in them. Robin Williams, Jim Carrey and even Steve Martin have shown their serious side in films but Murray is able to blend the painfully real with laugh out loud hilarity.Johansen is also strong in the less flashy but by no means lesser role. Her performance is the more emotional of the two and there are small hints in her portrayal that their relationship could lead to more than friendship.Some people have critized the film about the depiction of the Japanese. I personally feel that the accusations of stereotyping are false and believe that Coppola and her cast were playfully mocking Japanese culture rather than the people themselves.It's good to see a funny comedy of late that didn't have to rely on crude or violent humour. There are moments of great beauty mostly due to the locations chosen by Coppola and her team. The one problem is length or the slow pace of the film. As an audience we understand that both characters are suffering from insomnia but it's a fine line between establishing their affliction and boring the viewers.Coppola has suffered the wrath of critics due to her writing ability (Francis Ford Coppola's ""Life Without Zoe"" segment of the anthology film ""New York Stories"") and her acting (Francis Coppola's ""The Godfather Part III""). But with this release, her sophomore effort as director, she has shown her true talent as a filmmaker and is certainly not riding the coat tales of her famous writer/producer/director father Francis nor her husband director Spike Jonze. (There are rumors that the photographer character portrayed by Giovanni Ribisi is loosely based on Jonze.)Over all this is a quiet, gentle film that successfully mixes realistic comedy with heartwarming drama and for an independent art house film has definite cross over appeal.",Lost in Translation

A modern day Brief Encounter of sorts. It has its touching moments and it leaves a sense of sadness at the end.It is the kind of film I would like, but I don't. Perhaps it lost me at the beginning, when the main character Bob Harris, as played by Bill Murray, displayed a ""can't be bothered"" attitude towards the people who pay him a fortune to do a job (he should realised that if he can't be bothered to be nice then don't take the money!). There is also something vaguely racist and offensive about the portrayal of Japanese in the film as some weird alien creatures to whom you don't owe some sincere display of courtesy or civility. And so for me there is little sense of empathy towards him or his feeling of loneliness and boredom, and the story falls a bit flat from then on.Charlotte is played with great sensitivity by Scarlett Johansson who is a revelation in this film. As for Bill Murray, despite the praises he has garnered in this film, I'm not really sure he can really display anything deeper apart than making a few faces or just looking bored.

Well, that's not entirely true: every once in a while, a Japanese person does something so unbelievably wacky and nonsensical that it strikes you as cheap if not outright racist.  As a storyteller Coppola has nothing interesting to say and takes two hours to say it.  I'm a huge Bill Murray fan and I thought it was mostly a waste of his talents, and a waste of time.L.I.T. is a good example of a film that is praised as an insightful ""character study"" yet it told me very little about the characters.  There's a lot of meaningful stares and longing looks, but we don't really get to know who these people are, because the movie is so light on details that actually matter, so light on action, and so preoccupied with its mood.  Of course ""action"" can manifest itself in many ways, and the importance of an action may seem small but may be set up to have dire consequences.  In this movie, for example, the act of simply knocking on a hotel door, or of sending your husband carpet swatches, are filled with more meaning than they would be in any other movie.  Those moments were good.  But it also had so much filler, including many meaningless, wordless minutes of sightseeing and lying around, and the aforementioned ""aren't those Japanese wacky"" moments, and a long, long scene where they sing Karaoke.  For me it wasn't nearly enough. I don't need (or even want) a formulaic Hollywood story, but a good movie goes somewhere, and build in some way to something.

514,RolltheClip,A heartwarming journey through Tokyo,9,19 April 2014,"After a recent stint of horror films, 'Lost In Translation' was a delightful retreat from the bleakness of the dark recesses of the human mind as it explored the budding relationship between two strangers in Tokyo. With both of our main characters being at a standstill within their respective careers, it seems as though they are also in limbo between their past lifestyle and the ones that they would ideally like to lead.With the large age gap between Bob (Bill Murray) and the beautiful Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), poor acting could have easily been the downfall of the film. Regardless, Murray exudes his trademark charm flawlessly as you witness the budding relationship between the drifters. Without, the movie could have had an entirely different feeling as the wrong male lead could have come across as creepy or inappropriate.As you study how these characters are, you notice how bewildered they both seem by the overwhelming diversity of Japanese culture. The neglect they experience in various forms is perhaps enhanced by their isolation because of their lack of knowledge on the culture that they were immersed in. However, they find solace in each others company and this is when they dive in to the Japanese lifestyle and just embrace it.Life is fleeting; Sofia Coppola captures this message perfectly. It may seem clichéd but Bob and Charlotte spend all the of their time together just simply living. Their flair for life is infectious. It gives this wonderful sense of adventure and wanderlust, to explore everything the world has to offer with the most wonderful company. A truly beautiful, heartfelt film that is exceptional due to the strong performances of the leads.",Lost in Translation
515,world2you,The Most Overrated Film of 2003,1,21 June 2004,"First of all, unlike many viewers who disliked ""Lost in Translation"", I did not disliked it because it ""lacks plot"" or because ""nothing happens"". Cinema has proved, over 40 years ago, that Cinema is not Literature, and therefore plots can be subdued.However, unlike Films such as ""Before Sunrise"", Lost in Translation doesn't work. You never seem to believe that Bob and Charlotte are having actual fun, instead it seems like they are PRETENDING to have fun. The main problem is that unlike ""Sunrise"", their relationship never feels natural, and you can always tell that there's a script behind their dialogue.
This is, obviously, non-intentional, which harms the film to a great extent, specially since it is not as clever or as atmospheric as it think its. Indeed, all the little atmosphere the film has is due to the excellent soundtrack and to the inherent charm Tokyo has, NOT because of Coppola's skills or the extremely dark and plain Cinematography. (the average film goer seems to love it for some reason. Anyone can shoot buildings from inside a car, and the interiors are poorly lit, at all times)While Murray and Johansson are solid in their own respective parts, they lack any chemistry, and the same goes for Ribisi and Faris. In fact, Faris should not be in this picture, but apparently Sofia Coppola felt we needed a little bit of her personal problems (shown in an extremely literal manner) on the screen.To sum it up, this one could've been a Cult Classic, one of the great off-beat Romance Films in Cinema History. Unfortunately, due to Coppola's spoiled-girl Direction and amateuristic skills and editing, it's simply ""cute"".6/10",Lost in Translation

You can almost see what they are thinking, and read the confusion and turmoil that they are experiencing, at the same time as the pure pleasure and enjoyment of each other's company."" Yeah, I didn't understand what they were talking about either. To me, it sounded a little like ""The emperor's bright clothes are juxtaposed perfectly with his dark boots""...If you like plot-driven movies, don't waste your time. It's just introspective images again and again and again. You may accuse me of being dull and having a short attention span, but it's quite the other way around: I quickly understood that the two characters feel alienated and disenchanted. I didn't need repetitive shots of Scarlett in the tub or looking out the window to get the point.And after I got the point, I was looking forward to something actually happening with it. Surprise, nothing does. Instead, I get beaten over the head with the ""We're so lonely, no one here understands us, but we understand each other"" shtick. Not only is that horribly cliché, but it's nothing that I want to spend another 2 hours of my life watching.And I willingly rented this thing... that's right, I didn't expect any car chases or explosions. I was hoping to get the story of two strangers connecting and at least attempting to solve their problems together to teach some kind of new lesson to me.

At first glance, it appears that our two characters have a comfortable, rich life; but as the story progresses, we see that they lack the spark in their life.Scarlet Johansson puts up the performance of her life. Never before have I seen her act in such a delicate and touching way. Her emotions and her expressions are spot on during the whole film and she portrays a likable, smart, sexy character.Bill Murray is Bill Murray. He brings a fantastic comical side the story; one that's funny and sad at the same time. His performance is fantastic as always and draws the viewer into the character. The film begins with a really odd shot: Scarlet Johansson's ass. I personally thought it was delightful and its quite a nice surprises for the beginning of the film. All throughout the film, we see really nice shots of Tokyo and its landscape and the people. The language barrier that the characters of the story feel can be felt and seen by the viewers as well, so it gives that since of reality that we're really submerged in Tokyo's environment with the other characters. SJ's character is newly married and has moved to Tokyo with her husband who is a photographer. The issue here is that her husband is a work- orientated person. Therefore SJ is feeling lonely in a city where she does not know anybody and has trouble communicating because of the language barrier. BM's character is a famous Hollywood actor who is in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey Ad and get paid 2 Million dollars. But with all his fame and money, he still seems stuck and bored. It's an enjoyment to watch these two people find each other and start to connect and build a relationship. You better agree that it's an enjoyment, because that is pretty much all that happens in the film. The movie has a slow pace and all we get to see is this two people building a relationship. You might think to yourself: ""that's the most boring plot ever created"" and you could be right, but I personally found a delight to watch and I can honestly say this is the one and only romantic movie that I truly enjoyed.

What is more, I am interested in the description of Japan and Japanese. I feel that the descriptions of Japanese are excessive from the viewpoint of Japanese, such as an interpreter and a director.

There is no way this film could have been written without first hand living experience in Japan and it does a nice job of condensing some of the unique twists a visitor might find on arrival.  The use of the alien background sets the stage for the inner alienation each person experiences.Bill Murray's character is effective as a tutor to Scarlett Johansson's; his character has become adapted to living a life in isolation in a crowd, while she is confronting the reality that the realtionship she has with her husband is not going to be the ideal that she envisioned.  Bill Murray's off-camera wife distills their relationship into control issues of guilt and minutia, to which he is all but numb.  This is perhaps the best character for Murray since his overlooked role in ""The Razor's Edge.""  It's about time for his characters to mature and I hope his next venture is another drama.",Lost in Translation
532,stephanmj,Probably the worst movie I have ever seen,1,22 February 2004,"Never before have I had such high expectations for a movie but been let down so much. I should have known when I saw that Sofia Coppola directed it that it was going to be dire. But it had got rave reviews as being ""hilarious"" and with SNL's Bill Murray how could you go wrong. The grim truth of the matter is that the film has a weak unoriginal plot, the premise of the story happens 40 minutes into the movie, there are many many long shots of Bill wondering around the city like its a show on the discovery channel.
But what I found most disgusting about this movie was the way that the American characters are basically mocking the Japanese culture and the way they talk throughout the whole movie. I am not oriental, in fact I am a white male, but when I try to put myself in the shoes of a Japanese person watching this film, the film comes across with the typical American arrogance and self-centeredness that Americans are used to. I am really annoyed I wasted my time on this film, Sofia Coppola should be ashamed of herself, as should the academy for nominating this trash. In the end I can only pity people who find this film ""beautiful"" and ""poetic"". It is devoid of intelligence and originality.",Lost in Translation

This time around, most of the critics around the country praised the film and the acting. My best friend loved it while I wanted to walk out, but then I often dance to a different drummer. I have never been a fan of Bill Murray as a comic and this film did not make me a fan of his dramatic talent. I assume there must be some there.  It was boring, slow-moving and whoever told Bill he could sing has an enormous tin ear. Yes, I understand the loneliness of two people in a strange place, but for two hours, it gets to be a bit much!  The romance has left me in my old age, I guess.",Lost in Translation
534,TanjBennett,like the picture inside a locket,9,28 February 2004,"It is interesting to see the dichotomy in how people view this film.  Some people focus on Japan and see it as a film about Japan.  Me, well I've been there many times and since the background is everyday events I was watching the actors, who are center frame in pretty much every frame.  And it is about their characters.  They're in an environment which is alien to them but not alienating, and it is the perfect setting for them to become introspective.And some see nothing happening.  Whereas I see a relationship bloom and flow to its conclusion in a way that both will probably remember and keep thinking about for the rest of their lives.  Maybe that perspective also depends on whether it has ever happened to you.Very nice.",Lost in Translation
535,joonaslaine,Wonderful story of a weird relationship,10,10 March 2019,"An interesting story of being in the right place in the wrong time and creating an odd but yet so normal relationship. Perfect example of opposites attracting and friendships forming in a most peculiar way. Movie also shows how friendships/relationships don't form by force. Murray and Johansson play their roles well and are perfect suit of an imperfect couple. The tension between the two and Murray's character's imperfection brings more to the movie. This sort of story feel very lifelike and a one (without other person being a movie star) that could happen and in some sort of way has happened to many. And that makes the movie touching. Leaving the end open was in my opinion better than the two embracing each other and living happily ever after. Now the ending doesn't ruin the movie to half the audience, which either want the two to end up together or to stay as strange encounter in a foreign place. Maybe not a perfect movie because it kinda lack's content, but close enough for me. Also a good thing in the movie is that there isn't any forced plot twists and unnecessary sub-plots. A must see.",Lost in Translation
536,Mr Blue-4,This Movie Is Lost Alright,4,30 October 2003,"Full disclosure:I thought both ""The Virgin Suicides"" and Sophia Coppola's short film ""Lick the Star"" were a whole lot of nothing.  I'm a fan of narrative filmmaking, something that Sophia herself has fessed up to not being terribly interested in.  On the other hand, I had higher hopes for this film, mostly because I had just gone to Japan (and Tokyo) for the first time this year, and I really like both Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson.Alas, Sophia failed to deliver, yet again.  ""Lost in Translation"" is a mostly dreary exercise.  I would say it's just a bunch of scenes, one following the other to no discernable point, except even the ""scenes"" themselves are mostly empty.Please spare the prose defining how Bill and Scarlett are each ""lost"" while fiddling around in one very swanky hotel.  I would rather say that both are, unfortunately, playing shallow characters from which we never gleam any inner life over the film's running time.  They're bored because they're boring.Not only do Murray and Johansson play fairly drab characters, they manage to spend their time with possibly the least interesting people in Tokyo, with Coppola pal ""Charlie Brown"" leading the way.  Unless you're taken in by that nexus of downtown bohemia and jet set glam slumming through the night as only people without day jobs can, they might as well as been in a foreign-language Omaha for all they get out of Japan.And the shame of it is Bill Murray deserves a vehicle like this, one for him to reveal his improv talents and that deep streak of melancholy he has that has only grown with age.  His maturity is reflected in that he relies less and less on shtick now:he knows how to hold an audience with the smallest behaviors and reactions.  We get a demonstration of this here, but to no end.Which leads me to ask those here singing ""Lost""'s praises:what's the matter with you people? Am I one of the few to see and admit that the emperor has no clothes?There seems to be this sense of satisfaction here, that a) if you ""get"" this film it is because you are operating on a higher plane and b) if you don't, why, you're just too conditioned to ""commercial"" moviemaking and your senses too dulled by American bombast to ""appreciate"" the quiet and sensitivity that Coppola has instilled her film with.As a card-carrying fan of Taratino/Oliver Stone school of filmmaking, let me say ""baloney.""  Let me only point to Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" which manages to provides strong characters, a definitive sense of place, and plenty of quiet time with its actors all the while servicing a compelling narrative.However, I do also enjoy the small character studies that ""Lost in Translation"" aspires to be.  However, in this case, we never learn anything more about Murray's movie star or Johansson's young wife from about 10 minutes into the movie up until the end.  All we do is observe them in the strictest sense, but we never really ""see"" anything.None of the dialouge provides any further insight into these people.  In the films that I like, the people in them express themselves in such a way that we learn more about them as we go.  In one scene Bill tells his wife on the phone he wants to get healthier.  The next scene he orders beer with his lunch.  There's an illusion of an connection between the two:you'd get a hernia trying to make a real one.My advice is to see the works of Eric Rohmer, who knows how to do this stuff right.",Lost in Translation
537,mailbob,Beautifully understated,10,14 March 2013,"""Lost in Translation"" begins by focusing separately on two characters, Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), Americans arriving at a Tokyo hotel, each in a private lost world. They don't meet until fairly far into the film Before they speak to one another 32 minutes into the film, they brush at opposite ends of a crowded elevator. There is just a glance and the barest hint of a connection via Charlotte's self-conscious smile. They depart from the elevator and go their own way. That's it. This brilliant piece of editing and acting sets the tone for the entire film. Their next meetings are equally understated, and so it continues.As the plot develops, there are moments of silence, when nothing seems to be ""happening"". There are moments when Bob and Charlotte are each alone in their rooms and we feel the emptiness of their lives. There are moments when they are together but silent with one another. But even as we feel their growing connection, we feel their emptiness. While the pace may lag for some viewers, the film moved along very well for me and kept me fully engaged.The characters are in two opposite but similar worlds: In Charlotte's own words, she is ""stuck"". In Bob's words, he is ""lost"". Bob is an actor, 50-ish, who realizes that most of his life is behind him. He has fallen into a cycle of meaningless work, and while he loves his family, the tedious details of his life, whether it be posing for whiskey ads or choosing rug samples, no longer bring him joy. Charlotte, in her 20's, is barely out of college and in a marriage that clearly isn't working. She doesn't know who she is or what if anything her future holds. While he is lost in the past, she is unable to imagine her future. For both, the present lacks meaning. All this is set in a country where the incomprehensible language, along with curious customs and attitudes, reinforces their alienation and loneliness.The characters ultimately find meaning, at least temporarily, in their connection, but perhaps not in the way they expect. The film doesn't descend into cliché and the tidy ending anticipated in most Hollywood films. This has disturbed some reviewers, but for me, the climax of the film on the crowded streets of Tokyo is all that much more powerful.I can't finish without mentioning the cinematography. If there is any beauty to be seen in an overly large and obscenely commercialized city, it is wonderfully captured here. Yet, in keeping with the mood, the beauty as the characters view it while riding through daytime streets or gazing at the 4AM lights from their hotel windows, has a rough edge: there is emptiness as well as beauty that comes through the crowds, traffic, noise, and garish lights.One might categorize this as a romantic comedy. While it is certainly romantic, almost painfully so, and while there are some hilarious comic moments, that particular classification doesn't fit. Most romantic comedies are made for light escapes. The fundamental mood here is serious, almost depressingly existential. Yet, unlike my feeling after viewing Coppola's subsequent film ""Somewhere"", I was uplifted. This film aims for and hits on an emotional level that stays with you for days.Kudos to all involved, beginning especially Coppola (director, writer, and producer) but also the actors, cinematographers, everyone. Even after a second viewing, this film delivers.Added 4 years later: Even after a 3rd viewing, the film delivers a punch. I'd still rate it a perfect 10.",Lost in Translation

540,bkimbrell0,Lost in Translation (2003),10,15 November 2008,"Hands down the best film of 2003. Subtle, quiet, witty, intelligent, beautiful, and sophisticated.Bob (Bill Murray) is a middle-aged actor in Tokyo, Japan to shoot a whiskey commercial. He's lonely, depressed, and unhappy in his marriage with a wife who is constantly making subtle jabs at him about not being there for his children. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is a recent college graduate and newlywed in Tokyo, Japan because her photographer husband dragged her there. She's unsure if she made the right decision regarding her marriage, and doesn't feel comfortable with her new life. Bob and Charlotte meet up one night at the hotel they're both staying at, and have a heart-to-heart conversation about life in general. Neither one of them can stand Tokyo, and the culture is difficult for either of them to adapt to. They both enjoy each other's company so much and have so much in common that they form an unlikely friendship in a city in which they individually feel so cut off and helpless. It is through friendship that they both realize what they've been missing in their lives.Sofia Coppola made incredible decision after incredible decision in the making of this film. The setting of Tokyo is so beautiful and yet so cold at the same time. The dialogue between Bob and Charlotte is ingenious. You really appreciate that there are still films out there that can depict a relationship between a male and female that is based on friendship and intellectual stimulation, without relying on sexual tension. It's such a wonderful film that anyone can enjoy, because it's so relate-able to your everyday life. If you've ever had a friend who pulled you out of a hard time when you felt so lost, regardless of their age or background, this is the film for you.10/10, a masterpiece.",Lost in Translation
541,ethanj-41027,The Universal Language of Lost in Translation (2003),10,30 March 2020,"Lost in Translation (2003) - [10/10]I really don't know what to say. It's incredibly hard to put into words the experience I just went through and witnessed. I guess I'll start with where it all began: the Coppola family. Jeez Louise what on Earth are the Coppola's eating for breakfast? Francis Ford Coppola and wife Eleanor Coppola must be feeding their children some sort of filmmaking breakfast, because all three of their children (themselves included) are spectacular filmmakers. Roman Coppola, Sofia Coppola, and Gian-Carlo Coppola all have done something remarkable in film; particularly Sofia. Whatever it is they're eating, I want some. Sofia Coppola crafted an exquisite piece of cinema in the form of Lost in Translation (2003). This film is so remarkably written, I am not at all surprised she won Best Writing, Original Screenplay at the 76th Academy Awards. In my opinion I would have loved to see her win more, such as Best Director (she was actually the third female director to ever be nominated for that category) but Peter Jackson definitely deserved it. I don't think I would have been able to decide between Coppola and Jackson. Everything feels so natural in Lost in Translation (2003). It doesn't feel scripted, and that's how amazing it is. The events that unfold are unpredictable, simply because life is unpredictable. It is so subtle, everything she sets up I mean, yet at the same time it isn't. It takes multiple viewings to pick up on some of the subtleties because there are so many. Things that are mentioned, seen, or even thought from our leads come back in new ways. It's really the subtleness of the film that impacts the audience the most. These subtle things suddenly reappear right before the audience's eyes and it's beautiful to see. The direction is masterful. Clearly she's picked up some things from her father, and improved upon those things. She's able to conjure emotions in her characters and in the audience, emotions that have never crossed the cinema screen. It's spectacular in that way. I felt things I have never felt before. This film is real. It is incredibly real, to the point where it's almost as if you're watching a documentary and a small portion of two people's lives. We're able to really empathize with these characters as a result. These characters are real people that could exist, and probably do. For a large portion of the film, I forgot I was watching Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson acting. Masterful direction and writing makes you feel lost in this film. Lost in the beauty. This film completely changed the dramatic romance genre. It wasn't focused on a man or a woman. It was focused on both at the same time. It doesn't feel like a romance, yet at the same time it does. It's really interesting. The characters in this film aren't necessarily in love with each other, but they need each other. They need each other for that portion of their lives and it changes them. Just as it can change the audience that views this film. We get the sense that this is not your typical romance film from the very first, opening shot. It isn't about physical love, but emotional love for each other's well-being. The impact this film had can be seen in many other films such as Her (2013). Spike Jonze actually wrote and directed it, Sofia Coppola's ex-husband. A lot of Lost in Translation (2003) is actually based off of her experiences in Tokyo with Spike Jonze which is quite interesting. I actually prefer this film over Her (2013), but both are really similar. I think it can be said that without Lost in Translation (2003), pieces like Her (2013) would not have been made. The casting in this film is perfect. No one else could have pulled this off if Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson weren't cast. The age gap was not a problem. It wasn't weird or disgusting, but oddly beautiful. We smiled with their characters. We laughed with their characters. We cried with their characters. If someone else played Bob Harris (Murray's character) it would have been creepy. He was perfect in this film. He truly became his character (partly because Coppola wrote his role with him in mind). His mannerism, eyes, facial expressions, how he sits, stands - everything is purposeful and believable. I was able to tell what his character was thinking just from his eyes, and I knew exactly what he was going to do next before it even happened. There's a reason he was nominated for Best Actor. He should have won. This is probably my favorite performance by him and is actually his favorite film he's made. He's hilarious, serious, but at the same time you can tell he's pained and that something is terribly wrong. Masterful acting on his part. Scarlett Johansson is really good in this film as well. She utilized the same techniques that Murray did, as she also became her character. She was only 17 when this was being filmed, so to be able to pull off the things she did is quite incredible. Her skill as an actress can be seen in this performance at a very young age. A lot of this film is just that - incredible. A lot of people become upset with this film's depiction of Tokyo. It relies on a lot of Japanese stereotypes in the form of animated caricatures of people. I didn't find it disrespectful at all. As a tourist in a foreign country I know that that's how I've felt towards the different peoples and cultures. You really only see the stereotypes because you don't quite understand their people. It is no different in this film. We center on two Americans in the foreign world of Japan, so it only makes sense that we only see the stereotypes of Japan because that is what out characters see. It isn't meant to be insensitive, it is meant to be true. (I know the length of this review is long, so I'll try and simplify other parts if the film.) The cinematography is really beautiful and meaningful. The soundtrack is perfect to place us in the shoes of our characters. The editing is perfect. Everything about this film is perfect. I truly enjoy and love this film. It's probably my favorite romance film ever. It's a masterpiece. It is the small moments that hit hard. Such as the moments where, typically, the love interests in a romantic film would get intimate, but in this film they don't. Instead, our two characters simply talk. They talk about their problems, and solve them for each other without directly knowing they did so. These are the types of moments that come together to form Lost in Translation (2003). Some phrases aren't always the same when translated into different languages. Films aren't always the same when translated into different languages. People aren't always the same in different, new locations. A lot is lost in the act of this translation (or relocation in terms of people traveling). But what is never lost and what is the universal language, is emotion. Emotion is never lost in Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation (2003). Sometimes it will hit you like a brick. Other times it will softly tap on your shoulder - or whisper in your ear. But emotion, emotion is constant throughout this film. This universal language whispers into your ear as you watch this masterpiece, it whispers and whispers until the words are incomprehensible. And at that point, the film resolves. (This film features one of my favorite endings in film history). These final words stay with you as the credits roll, and as the experience that is (and was) Lost in Translation (2003) ends - it only just begins. Coppola plants a seed in your soul that begins to sprout as the credits roll. It begins to sprout seconds after the film is over. Minute after minute. Hour after hour. Day after day. Week after week. Month after month. And in some cases, year after year. This seed is the universal language - emotion. That is what a film should do. The best films begin when you walk out of the theater. This film has the power to change you through that seed, if you let it. It will open your eyes to new ideas, feelings, peoples - and emotions. Lost in Translation (2003) is a film that will become a part of you after viewing it (you'll be bilingual in a new universal language as well). It is incredibly hard to translate how I felt to words, because it is such an experience. So I highly encourage each of you to watch this film for yourself. To feel what I felt. To experience what I experienced. (This film is very much not rated R. There is only one sequence in this film that makes it R and it is completely useless. It lasts for 1 minute and 3 seconds, but it is pointless. If that is the main reason why you haven't seen this film, I can send you the timestamp and explain what happens so you can skip over it. You need to see this film). Even as I finish this review, a lot of how I felt is indescribable. I fear that what I have translated from this universal language will be lost.

I enjoyed it completely and she didn't.The reason I liked it and she didn't are the same - it really is an arts movie, driven by visual direction, character development and unspoken dialog.  Lost in Translation offers a too real form of escapism that forces the viewer to re-evaluate their own lives.  It is almost a 'heart of darkness' type self discovery - Bill Murray as Bob Harris and Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte each go on a journey of self discovery, they face their primal fears and needs and overcome them.  (or maybe I am trying yo read too much into it?)This is a complex film, much more than a simple forbidden love story. The plot is driven by character development, although there is an underlying 'Casablanca'-esque forbidden love component.Bill Murray is superb, as is the beautiful Scarlett Johansson.All in all this is a very laid back, subtle movie with near perfect acting and direction.

547,azjimnson,Most Overrated Film of the Last 20 Years,3,15 April 2010,"I'm only giving this movie 3 stars for the pretty good night photography, but I've seen better night photography in TV movies made for Lifetime. If the director's last name had been Smith or Jones--and she was no relation to a famous director--who himself rides on his past reputation now, and hasn't made a good movie in years--we would have been spared this piece of self-indulgent, self-satisfied, and smug tripe. Mr Murray's character is supposed to be a former action movie star, the sort of actor who would have played sophisticated action heroes, such as James Bond. If you can buy that premise, your suspension of disbelief is strong enough to support the Golden Gate Bridge. And Scarlett's character is sooooo lonely, as her hot shot photographer boyfriend doesn't appreciate how good she looks in her underwear. Well, he's been there, seen that, right? Perhaps he has come to realize she's a brainless cipher who has nothing beneath her pretty surface but terminal self-pity, and an odd, brooding desire to sit semi-nude in hotel windows. So here comes the pitiful, sad sack, so-called action hero actor, equally depressed by his own self-awareness. And of course they bond in that Hollywood old guy young babe way, which makes me wonder if every Hollywood movie is now required to be partially a biography of Jack Nicholson. This film reminds me of a cartoon in the current issue of the New Yorker. In this cartoon three robots are shown sitting in front of typewriters, typing furiously. Two lab coat wearing researchers are standing behind the robots. One tells the other, ""The robots all developed self-awareness, and then self-loathing. Now all they want to do is write novels."" I suspect these robots are actual authors of this film's script.In a tremendous insult to many actually talented filmmakers, Paste Magazine, in their March, 2010 issue, just listed Ms. Coppola as one of the ""Top Fifty Living Directors,"" strictly on the basis of this one, pretentious film. They don't mention her even worse subsequent efforts, all of which are unwatchable unless one is sedated. Meanwhile, they left great directors like Nicholas Roeg and Monte Hellman, neither of whom has died, as far as I know, off the list entirely. No one will remember this fraud of a movie in another ten years, but the works of Roeg and Hellman will be preserved as classics of the cinema, and discussed by future film scholars the way the works of great directors of the past are discussed in film schools today. Ms Coppola has no more talent as a director than she demonstrated as an actor in that awful performance in her father's weakest ""Godfather"" sequel.How so many otherwise astute critics were fooled by this piece of self-indulgent navel gazing, I can't understand. But nepotism runs deep in Hollywood, and perhaps there was some degree not wanting to disrespect Francis which colored their judgment.",Lost in Translation
548,halopes,"So, so beautiful...",10,25 January 2004,"Sofia Coppola's latest movie, LOST IN TRANSLATION, is an astonishing piece of sublime film-making. There is not one thing that is left behind in detriment of something else. Everything works in perfection, from the cast to the editing. Ultimately, this movie is a great lesson of film-making. It magnifies the importance of such things as musical score, songs and chosen locations. Not everything is storytelling in cinema; visual composition and music are also utterly important. LOST IN TRANSLATION is the most remarkable example of that. The city of Tokyo, colorful and technologically advanced, is as important as the characters themselves, or the story, and grants supremacy to this wonderful film. The same is valid for the superb score and carefully picked up songs. I could go on talking about cinematography, costume design, etc.I found the chemistry between the dry, ironic Bill Murray and the sweet, innocent Scarlett Johansson just fabulous. Murray couldn't be a better choice to play the man lost in his life, alienated from the mundane realities of modern times; a man who eventually have learned to accept life's small frustrations and a loveless long-time marriage without carrying a burden. Johansson, on the other hand, has to be the sexiest actress of her generation. Her eyes can have the deepest, touching look. She glows sweetness and innocence from her entire body and she couldn't also be a better choice to play the young, married girl already `lost' in life but who still has some hope.Sofia's approach to the main characters' relationship is extremely subtle. This is not a movie about a one-night-stand between two people who meet in a foreign country hotel. It is a movie about two people who meet and the things that are left unsaid. Eventually, it's also a movie about the clash of different cultures but ultimately, this is a movie about a relationship between two lost and lonely people. The city of Tokyo becomes the personification of alienation, thus allowing both characters to be themselves; they don't try to impress each other. The consequence is a natural, honest, deprived of second intentions relationship; a relationship where both people try to find comfort, being surrounded by a strange environment.LOST IN TRANSLATION has beauty written all over the place. The movie becomes magical and the bitter sweetness of its tone is what makes it so powerful. Unlike the dozens of Hollywood films we watch during the year, here not everything needs to be explained, not everything needs to be verbalized. The chemistry, the looks, the touches, the expressions speak for themselves and what is not said is agonizingly powerful. After THE VIRGIN SUICIDES, with this movie Sofia Coppola defines herself without a shadow of doubt as a sensitive filmmaker who, in a subtle yet very efficient way, cares about the complexity of human relationships and understands the potential of cinema as a way to evoke deep emotions.",Lost in Translation

If it is a good movie, I can stay awake, enough to watch the DVD special features.This was not one of those movies.I fell asleep twice, for 10 minute intervals. I did make the effort and rewind those minutes, worried I'd missed something important. Not to worry, apparently I didn't.I'm not sure if I bailed at the halfway or 2/3 point, but I really couldn't wait to see if the paint finished drying in this borefest.My only regret is wondering whether or not I missed what appeared to be an upcoming payoff scene with a nude Scarlett Johansson.

It wasn't funny, the plot was dumb, and the acting was nothing special.  Bill Murray was being himself, which is annoying enough, so why was he nominated for Best Actor?  Why was this movie nominated for anything?  Why did so many people like this movie?  I chuckled a little bit during the exercise bike part.  I don't recommend this movie to anyone.  It reaffirmed my dark hatred for Bill Murray.  If you liked this movie, see a doctor because I think you need help right away.  I give this bad excuse for a movie 0 stars.

553,lduperval,Sleepless in Tokyo,9,21 May 2004,"By definition, any movie that begins with the shot of a woman's behind is a great movie. Unless it stars a Ron J. and a J. Rage and is directed by a Seymour B... Instead, put Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansonn on screen and Sofia Coppola at the helm and you've got a movie that shines.Sofia Coppola is neither a prolific film writer nor a very active film director. This is her first film since 1999's The Virgin Suicides. Once again, she makes you stand up and take notice. She must not feel pressured to produce anything on a regular basis. This allows her to polish and work her ideas to perfection, before she unleashes them on an unsuspecting world.Bob Harris (Murray) is a movie actor who finds himself in Tokyo to work on a publicity campaign for a brand of whisky. Two million dollars' worth of whisky publicity, to be exact. Back home, he's got a wife of 25 years and two children waiting for him. He's jetlagged, he has insomnia and he isn't all happy with his life.Charlotte (Johansonn) is a semi-abandoned newlywed, stuck in Tokyo while her photographer husband runs around the country, working his craft. She's homesick, she's got insomnia and she doesn't know what to do with her life.Bob and Charlotte meet. Bob and Charlotte fall in love. Bob and Charlotte live happily ever after. If this was a typical Hollywood movie, that would just about sum up the movie. Fortunately, Coppola's writing is much more intelligent than that.There is no question that there is tremendous tension between Bob and Charlotte. It is this movie's lifeline. When will something happen between them? How will it happen? Will they regret it afterwards? The slow and intense building of their relationship is fascinating to watch.I've never been a big fan of Bill Murray, I don't know why exactly. I have seen a few of his movies and they've left a bland taste in my mouth. In this movie, he gives the best performance of his career. He is touching, he is believable and he is funny, without stooping to the level of a Caddyshack or a Meatballs.Scarlett Johansonn is a gifted actress. At such a young age, she's got an excellent track record, and promises to be one of the best actresses of her generation. And she's cute to boot!The actors' play is enhanced by the exquisite dialogue. Sample this:""I'm payed two million dollars to hawk whisky when I could be home doing a play instead. The good news is that the whisky works.""Or:Lydia (Bob's wife): Bob, should I be worried about you?Bob: Only if you want to.Movies such as Lost In Translation are the only indication that there still is some form of intelligence and originality in Tinseltown. I just wish directors and writers would take a cue from Sofia Coppola and make less movies, of better quality.",Lost in Translation

The movie is about homesickness and not much more. It is a bit predictable and nothing much happens, but maybe that was the directors intention: to present just a bit of the characters' lives, without a very deep analysis.The best of all were the actors. More than half of the merit is theirs, especially if they, as I've read, improvised some of the dialogues. I also liked some scenes very much, but a sum of beautiful scenes is not necessarily a beautiful movie.""Lost in translation"" reminded me a lot of Doris Dörrie's ""Erleuchtung garantiert"" (Enlightenment Guaranteed) in many aspects (first of all, the setting, and the general feeling, too). The problem is that Dörrie's film was made in 2000, and the story is so much better than ""Lost in translation"". At least for me, this movie arrived too late. If you enjoyed Coppola's one, try the other one, even if you find it too similar, and you'll see it's far more complex and fresh.My impression, with all due respect, is that Sofia Coppola can afford to make movies because of her last name. I'm not sure that people would be thrilled about her movies if she weren't Francis Ford Coppola's relative. In my opinion, if I think of ""Virgin suicides"" (movie that, BTW, I hate, it bored me to death; I didn't get it at all), she is making progress: this is a richer movie, with more flavored dialogues and more round characters. But I don't know if that is enough to win awards. But she is young. Maybe, with time, she'll come to make the sort of movies at least I love.",Lost in Translation

The basis of the movie is a friendship between two mismatched people stuck in a city which they find confusing and a little scary. if you have ever been to Tokyo (or Japan for that matter), it is surprising how anyone can be bored, but it does happen. This is an emotional and funny story about two people becoming friends and discovering more about themselves and life from each other, whilst trying to comprehend a city which to them makes no sense. it might not be very actioney and some people will probably find this boring but it's a nice look into the minds of people forced to look at themselves in a different light, and i'm sure we've all felt like we don't belong at least once.",Lost in Translation

559,eminkarakus,*****watchable*****,8,23 February 2005,":Bob Harris (played by Bill Murray) is an American film actor, far past his prime. He visits Tokyo to appear in commercials, and he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johannson), the young wife of a visiting photographer. Bored and weary, Bob and Charlotte make ideal if improbable traveling companions. Scarlet is looking for ""her place in life,"" and Bob is tolerating a mediocre stateside marriage. Both separately and together, they live the experience of the American in Tokyo. Bob and Charlotte suffer both confusion and hilarity due to the cultural and language differences between themselves and the Japanese. As the relationship between Bob and Charlotte deepens, they come to the realization that their visits to Japan, and one another, must soon end. Or must they?Americans abroad, almost innocents. Charlotte, fresh out of Yale with a degree in philosophy, is in Tokyo with her husband, a photographer whose work takes him away that week. Shes adrift, her soul on ice. Bob, mid-50s, a semi-retired movie star, is there to make $2 million doing a whiskey ad. At home are a wife and young children, but hes jaded and melancholy. Both are jet-lagged, and Tokyos culture and language push them further off kilter. When they meet in the hotel bar and spend their free time together for a few days, possibilities arise amidst the losses. Their friendship becomes an experience: does he have something to teach; can she reconnect him to life?Hes doing a commercial, parlaying his fifteen minutes of movie stardom. Shes just graduated from college, recently married, and tagged along with her husband, a photographer on assignment. Hes married with children, but hes never home. Shes supporting her husband, but has not idea what she wants to do with her own life. Both are searching for the meaning of their lives, looking at the situation from different points of view. A persons lifetime is filled with self examination. Why am I here? What am I doing? Is this as good as it gets? The plot of this movie is the plot of life. You have a beginning. You're in the middle, and your story hasn't ended yet (in some cases, it wont end even after your death.) Bob and Charlotte find each other fulfilling certain needs. Charlotte needs Bobs attention and humor, and Bob needs someone he can talk to (Bob ""talks"" with his wife, but they are not really talking.) Bob helps Charlotte by answering her questions regarding life and direction, while Charlotte helps Bob by reminding him how much he loves his children and his wife. The love between the two characters is not one of lust but rather one of emotional and psychological need. Plot less, pointless, and boring? Only if you want all your stories packaged nicely with pretty paper and pretty ribbons. To me, the movie is like the shabu shabu sushi restaurant. What you get out of it depends on how much you put into it. The meaning of our lives, the purpose, the dreams (both dashed and realized), and the expectations forced upon us by others.

560,jlwalker19-1,sad but oh so true,8,19 April 2005,"I was up late but could not stop watching this movie. The acting was very good. Scarlett Johannson as Charlotte in this movie is the girl I would want to spend time with. I truly hated Charlotte's husband.In regards to the time Charlotte and Bob spend together, I was reminded of the Art Garfunkel song, ""A Perfect Moment"". ""For a moment you were mine."" Charlotte and Bob share such special moments together, often times without saying a word. When they do talk they connect with each other on a very deep level. Other than ""What About Bob"" this is in my opinion Bill Murray's best movie. He is such a real character that the viewer can relate to.If you want fast moving violent action, this is not the movie for you. But for true feelings and the universal search for meaning and happiness in our lives, and how we need to be able to connect with someone on a deep and loving level, and just have fun with them without any expectations, it really tugs at the heart.I had to wonder when watching this movie if it really portrays what it is like for an American visiting in Japan. I would hope it would not be so disconcerting.I could watch this movie over and over just to watch Scarlett Johannson. She doesn't wear much makeup and certainly doesn't need it. And silly me, I'm a guy but I just love her hair. Aside from my typical guy response, honestly it is a very touching movie.

Not the movie, me loving it, because I am a manly man (I think I am at least) I like movies with violence and nudity. What people don't know is that movies with a great story and characters are my favorites. So let me tell you why I love this one. First of all I hate the same exact love story over and over again. Which is why I like this one, it focuses more on Bob and Charlotte's relationships instead of when will they kiss, when will they do it, when will they have the liar revealed story. The two characters are the most important part. Most people who don't like this movie complain about the beginning where they just walk around lonely. I feel it helps the viewer feel like the characters, lost and out of place. The cinematography is some of the best, Sofia Coppola really took advantage of Japan's beautiful scenery. The thing that surprises me the most is Sofia Coppola 's directing ability, she is the woman people were mad at in the Godfather part three. She surprised me, I can't wait to see what she'll do next.

562,mike-wright-1,Perfection,10,7 January 2013,"Lost in Translation's real power comes in its ability to elicit such a range of emotions from its audience whilst remaining so subtle in everything it does. At once beautiful, tragic, heart warming and funny, it is underscored by a wonderful soundtrack, spectacular cinematography and magnetic performances from its two leads.Bob and Charlotte are two people lost in the maze of their own lives. The feeling of isolation from their true selves is perfectly reflected in Tokyo's alien culture, people and surroundings. The film is set at a perfect pace, which allows you to consider what may have come before. You are able to mull over how their lives have panned out up to their chance encounter in Tokyo and therefore untangle their respective emotional messes. There is no judgement present in Copolla's script or direction, and none is expected of the audience.LiT is in the same class as Before Sunrise in its achievement of developing an intense relationship between two strangers over a very short space of time – Copolla replaces Vienna with Tokyo as the postcard backdrop. Comparing the two films is made all the more interesting by the vastly different styles. Where Linklater used almost all dialogue in developing the relationship, Copolla is sparse with hers – relying more on shared experiences and on two characters being in exactly the same place in their lives, despite the generational divide.It's difficult to see any other actors pulling off the roles of Bob and Charlotte. By many accounts, Murray is effectively playing himself, despite being somewhat against type. Johannson was just 18 at the time of filming – making the emotional depth she conveys quite extraordinary. Lost in Translation really is flawless.",Lost in Translation

566,Mighty_sheman,"Not a Movie, not really anything!",6,14 May 2005,"Let me start by reassuring you I am a very open minded guy, I guess when it comes to films I am becoming increasingly more cautious in my choices and perhaps a little cynical in my reactions with time, but remain open minded and prepared to let a film take me where it wants to go. When I think of where Lost in Translation took me I feel it was close to nowhere, but unlike a lot of the films that have this effect I feel the journey was somewhat worth while and I can extract some meaning and enjoyment from it all. Let me explain, this film to me was not what I would describe as a 'movie'. It was more like an attractive painting, more a common case of a movie becoming art instead of art within a movie. It was not even a particularly interesting painting. I will also point out at this point that I generally enjoy films that are subtle and I'm sensitive too so don't think the meaning of this film was lost on me. I also believe a film does not need action scenes or CGI violence to be great, however I prefer films when something happens in them. You see I feel if possible this was TOO subtle, it's deeper meaning became lost in the translation.The film looks attractive if never spectacular, the story beneath it reaches a certain hight and it never really gets beyond it. I think it's mainly because the two protagonists are hardly the most engaging pair of characters your ever likely to come across. Murray as the washed up (as he's used to playing now) actor Bob Harris is likable at times though Murray's now tiresome deadpan wise ass act can become off-putting, you feel the character is somewhat shallow and lacking the required human traits to be anything other than just a cardboard cut out constantly upstaged and out performed by the backdrops and locals who give this film some much needed humour and something else, oh yeah, LIFE. Then Johansson's character is so utterly unlikeable you will probably, like she does, want to constantly roll your eyes too, she does improve but not nearly enough. What makes the film and it's two leads redeemable is the situation - 2 confused, withdrawn, somewhat hopeless strangers with more in common than you might expect finding each other amongst all the commotion and noise of Tokyo and the unique friendship that develops between them. Also this film is about finding solace and beauty amongst the mundane and inane, both of which are in plentiful supply here. Also the emotive and profound (but under developed)idea of a relationship that seems so right yet is unable to blossom because of situation and because the 2 characters are both at different stages in their lives. Murray tired and worn out, slipping (somewhat willingly) into a life of monotony and routine while Johonsson has her whole life ahead of her and is trying to work her way out of a mundane existence. This is the main driving force of the film.The thing that made this film fall flat was the lack of real elements of interest, it had it's moments but they were few and far between. Bob's phone conversations with his wife were vaguely amusing, you had that and the karaoke scenes and the famous tights bit and that was about your lot really. While the relationship between Bob and Charolotte is sweet and innocent (almost childlike) there is a lack of impact and connection from this viewers POV, I didn't really feel for them. The film was a tad too drawn out and felt at times more depressing than engaging, I felt a burning desire for Coffee and Prozac at times. In fact I feel you can go out and about your nearest town and observe and meet REAL people and you will find a lot more interesting characters and relationships than the ones here. At times it was touching at others I couldn't help but think to myself ""my god, what a boring pair of morons."" The final scenes are what make the whole thing worth while, when Murray get's in the taxi, THAT is when the emotion finally shines through and I felt a genuine admiration for Murray there because he made that scene and thus the movie. You could see the emotion trying to burst out of the character, but he resisted because he had already long become desensitized by life and the world around him. That scene encompasses all that the film was about, a relationship, and the loss of it, and having to return to what's familiar and safe - like returning home from a great holiday, you feel glad for the experience but you accept life has to go on, as it was. That was a fantastic scene and Murray's rather patchy performance before hand was forgiven.however after the film I felt, like I have with many a film recently, that I could see what the director was saying but they could have said it quite adequately in 20 minutes never mind 2 hours. In fact if you took out all the painful, overly long awkward silences and walking/eating/sitting you would probably only have about 10 minutes of film left! Another case of a director not having all that much to say but taking a whole lot of time to say it, at least other films that don't have many themes to explore throw in some events to put their characters through. This film was notable because of it's lack of any.If you want a heavily overrated film that is just 2 hours of nothing happening (there are loads I assure you) you could do A LOT worse than this, at least this will engage the emotional part of your brain (if only slightly) even if it means putting the rest of your brain into auto pilot.",Lost in Translation
567,drjlo,Bill and Scarlett's Gift,8,23 February 2015,"The first and last time I watched this movie was 10+ years ago, a very long time, and remember a lingering feeling of quiet exasperation somehow mixed with an odd sense of elation, in a background of fog and disorientation reminiscent of jet lag. Well, on one foggy late night around 3 or 4 AM, I happened to come across ""Lost In Translation"" on cable for the second time. There has been more than ten years of ""life"" that has happened since the first viewing, including things that have gleaned me new appreciation for this film's themes like sleeplessness, soul-searching, loneliness, relationships, and that all-elusive ""happiness."" This movie is a gift from Bill, Scarlett, and Sofia Coppola to those who have walked the elevations of life, still feeling somewhat dizzy and lost, yet have not lost the courage for what's in store. When Murray says ""I am completely lost"" during his phone conversation with his wife, or when Scarlett says ""I'm stuck"" to Murray, the effect is greater the more one has traveled the path. Some may remember this movie as an extremely sad movie, but the reason this movie can be a gift is due to the fact it is a non-judgmental witness to our lives that silently cheers us on. ""Go on. Keep going,"" it says. The ambiguous ending may seem like a cop-out to some, but that's exactly how our lives swim in the sea of space and time (Sorry, I just watched ""Interstellar""). Scarlett may be ""stuck"" in her marriage to someone she does not know, but perhaps she will leave him, write a best-seller, meet the man of her dreams. Or not. Maybe her next husband will turn out to be even worse. Maybe she will get together with Bill again, only to find out Magic can't last. People are people, and same or different issues will pop up. Maybe Bill will find renewed energy, leave his wife, buy that Porsche, and shack up with another, inevitably younger, woman who appreciates him more, to live happily ever. Or not. Maybe that woman will grow lose appreciation for him just as much over time. Maybe it will be even Scarlett.

568,Siradakis,the Bitter sweet taste of encountering..,9,18 December 2004,"Such a great film.. ""just like honey"" - like the song from Jesus & Mary Chain of the soundtrack.. What is beautiful is that Coppola surpasses the obstacle: usually it is very hard to depict the connection that can occur when you meet certain people - the interaction between people is something vague and fragile but very substantial at the same time. Sofia Coppola manages to show the bitter sweet taste of sharing things that need not be told in words between two total strangers. I loved it. And the reason is that it combined the pulse of American filmaking with the aura and beauty of European cinema. Tokyo is the best background, Both Bill Murrey and Scarlet Johansson are great, and DO NOT forget to buy the soundtrack.",Lost in Translation

The Coppela clan must be very influential indeed for this flat as a pancake film to get nominated and awarded anything other that worst movie of the decade.Curiously, the only character with any dimension was the wife - and we only know her through her phone conversations with her husband.  Isn't that strange?

570,rimnod,Much better the second time........................................................,8,25 January 2005,"I would have to agree with others on this site that ""Lost In Translation"" is often better appreciated on a second viewing. I wasn't much impressed with the movie the first time I saw it. Initially, the""Charlotte"" character seemed to be much too self-interested. She came across (as acted by Scarlett Johansson) as nothing much more than an awkward if precocious child. I also thought that the relationship between Charlotte and the Bill Murray character (Bob Harris) was a little too cute and contrived. The Tokyo presented in the movie seemed a weary and confusing way-station on a journey to nowhere. My attention continually flagged on the first viewing.When I viewed L.I.T.again (six months later) I came away with a much better opinion. The movie is very effective- after all -in telling the story of an unlikely friendship between two people drawn together completely by chance but both engaged in a common struggle to come to terms with their lives. Coppola has to be given credit for the clarity and thoroughness of how the story is told. There are few if any purely incidental scenes that I can find--every step is set out with a purpose (often with a dual purpose). As an example -the scene with Bob Harris and the Japanese ""premium fantasy girl"" is,at first glance, done just for laughs --and it is funny. However, coming as early in the movie as it does, it was designed to show that the Bill Murray character is not a pig (not all of the time at least). When offered a prostitute --he sends her back. This idea is reinforced later as Bob and Charlotte form a bond which doesn't quite reach the level of sex. The movie does have a clear ""women's sensibility"" in that respect.The idea of intimacy without sex intruding is not something that many male directors have explored. It isn't till late in the film that we see that Murray's character is indeed interested in sex.... He does sleep with the hotel lounge singer for the express purpose of showing the audience that he does have the impulse.The relationship between Bob and Charlotte is cloudy in some respects. It remains platonic however there are hints of the ""sex thing"" lurking out there. Curiously enough Coppola goes to the trouble of offering some ""cover"" for Bob and Charlotte to have sex by letting us glimpse their marital frustrations. This is especially true in the case of Charlotte as we are shown her husband's mild infatuation with a Hollywood bimbo. In the case of Bob we are allowed to glimpse the cold nature of his marriage by comments his wife makes (or doesn't make) as they talk over the phone. But --in the end--this ""cover"" is only used to justify the intimacy of Bob and Charlotte's friendship.The Tokyo of the movie, for me anyway, comes to represent life. Life is sometimes like being a foreigner in Tokyo --with all its excitement(and dreary boredom), confusion--the feeling of being lost and adrift - and the seeking.One aspect of the movie that I have not seen discussed in the IMDb reviews is the effect of Bob's celebrity on Charlotte. He is described as being ""washed up"" -however everything is relative. He is still making $2 million dollars for a couple of Tokyo photo shoots --he is still an easily recognizable celebrity. One wonders if Charlotte would have approached and sought a relationship with Bob if he was just a 53 year old businessman visiting Tokyo. In ""real life"" Bob's celebrity would have been the crux of the relationship--but In the movie it seems almost incidental to the story. It is interesting to speculate as to what the movie would have been like if they had chosen to dispense with Bob's celebrity status.I usually don't like ""women's movies""--romances etc.......I think everyone can agree that the saving grace of the film is that the two main characters don't sleep together---It gives the movie a sweet tilt....... O.K.-I must be getting soft or having a mid-life crisis. It does however give me a warm and fuzzy feeling to think that there must be some girl out there--fresh out of college -who might adore me for all of my sensitivity and vulnerability--..well...I hope my wife doesn't read this review.",Lost in Translation
571,wainot,Bathed In Hype -- I wanted to like this movie more than I did!,7,4 June 2004,"Don't get me wrong -- this is not a bad movie; it deserves a thumbs-up.  I really wanted to fully embrace this movie.  To me. it's a drama - not a comedy - with some humorous, whimsical moments.  That's fine.  My favorite movies are human drama ( I just wrote an evaluation of Secrets and Lies - which I loved - that epitomized human drama.)  Now, I didn't expect LIT to stack up against Secrets, but it fell way short.The good news:  very good performances by Bill Murray (one of, if not his best, role) and Scarlett Johanssen (sp?) -- (this actress has an old soul, wise way beyond her years -- the sky appears to be her limit).  I admire the relationship/friendship between the characters; there is humor (well, a little), good-nature and warmth between them, and I admire the restraint shown in how their relationship played out, or didn't.  I also like how the world-weary actor (Murray) kind of discovers that he actually has some wisdom and perspective to impart to the newly married, disillusioned Johanssen.The bad news:  The back stories seemed to be all cliche, not very compelling stuff w/ no great insights or even great humor.  Admittedly, his wife and her husband are minor characters, but there is just no depth to their stories, conflicts, conversations, decisions -- nothing new or even irreverently different.  And then, the on-the-surface 'Lost In Translation' stuff - showing cultural, language differences between US and Japan -- was just a run over weak, hackneyed turf.  Now, I did not want to watch this w/ a jaded perspective, but how often can you trot out the ""l/r"" thing?  The humor and cultural insight just never ran much deeper than that.So, while I cared somewhat about the two leads, there was just no great compelling story line other than what I felt was Bob Harris (Murray) discovering some goodness and self-respect within his own jaded soul.Re:  Murray's Oscar nomination:  from what I saw it was deserved  (in fact, the part seemed to be perfect for him, a la Groundhog Day.  I thought Groundhog Day, although maybe more 'Hollywood', was more compelling, more humorous and at least as profound as this!).  Yet, I shed no tears for his losing out to Sean Penn, who gave a more rangy, more interesting performance in a much better film, Mystic River.  I do also think that Johanssen's acting (more support than lead, I thought) was nomination caliber, and I hope she will continue to command some great roles moving forward.I rated it 7/10 on this site; it's probably a 7.5, but no more.",Lost in Translation

He sets a example we should follow, because we probably think he is happy and successful.However Bob is unhappy, bored, confused, mixed up, lost, dazed, seeking escapism and wanting to be understood, not really a great candidate too copy, probably he is just like the majority of Joe Bloggs in the film in his heart.Do the advertisers falsely believe his endorsement holds this power, or are they correct and everyones so lost that what brand of Whisky Bob drinks does hold some significants.It's just one issue amongst a multitude of issues that this abstract film will raise for you, if you put in the work, and watch it thoughtfully.",Lost in Translation

And at the same time, it's not one of those art-movies which you don't understand unless you have studied Literary Sciences or Arts for at least four years. It's a simple movie about attraction, love (I guess), and life. Bill Murray proves how great he is as an actor. It's odd to see him make fun of himself in a way by playing an actor in his mid-life crisis. Scarlett Johansson is wonderful. Her voice, her smile, and her very special beauty give this film yet another aspect to make it one of the very best (if not the best) movies that I have ever seen.

576,dkennedy3,Respectability is alive and well ...,7,30 December 2003,"Set largely in the Park Hyatt Hotel in Tokyo, with some interesting panoramas of that great city, Lost In Translation presents as a very real life-like set of circumstances a lot of us could easily find ourselves encountering.  The film follows a week in the lives of two quite different people - Bob Harris, a middle-aged actor, in town on business, having left his wife and family at home, and Charlotte, an attractive girl young enough to be his daughter.  She is visiting Tokyo with her husband, but he is totally preoccupied with his work as a photographer, and we see as little of him in this film as she does. Bob and Charlotte are drawn together, as they both feel marooned and very alone in the big foreign city, and simply find solace in each other's company.  Despite the obvious generation gap, they become more attracted to each other.  But he is not about to throw away his 25 years of marriage, nor she her much shorter but equally devoted commitment to her young partner. The temptations are there, make no mistake, and on occasions their silent thoughts appear almost as clear to us as if they were subtitled on the screen. I found it uncannily easy to identify with the older of the lead players, as the situation, dialogues and behaviours were so believable - not exaggerated or over-the-top, as in so many similar films.  Part of that identifying was a hope that, if in his position, I would have the strength to react the same as Bob did, right up to the very satisfactory ending which we were all quietly wishing for.",Lost in Translation

The acting, the script, the camera-work is all spot-on.Unfortunately, its deft touch left me feeling deeply depressed. This film's manifesto seems to be that none of us can ever truly connect to anybody else. No attempt at love (friendship, devotion, or romance) can ever successfully overcome the barriers between people because of our different lives and circumstances, regardless of whether we share the same culture or not.It's like an entire film of watching people cling to a life raft, only to discover that no rescue is possible regardless of what they do, or where they go.How completely depressing a lesson.",Lost in Translation

It taught me a lot, honestly. Here are some things I picked up while watching this great film:1. Japan has a culture that is considered to be strange, awkward and plain dumb. There are hardly any exceptions.2. It's completely normal to cheat in a relationship, as long as the other party doesn't appear to be extremely appealing at that moment. Oh, and there are no moral dilemma's attached whatsoever, so by all means, go for it.3. If you've got money and fame, you are considered above the rest and you can treat everyone as such. Especially the Japanese, since their culture is already considered to be inferior.4. Even if you do not try to fit into a different culture and its people, just nod politely and next thing you know it, you get what you deserve. After all, you are the guest, so they should obey you, not the other way around.5.  It's a movie and surely its message doesn't have any moral obligations. Movies are like zoos or entertainment parks. They have nothing else to show us than pretty imagery and clever quotes.-

Its a amazing way the shooting is made, great scenes that just show HOW different Japan really is. the Acting is also great, they just play realistic, and you really can see, and believe, that they just want to go home. I was amazed when i saw it, because some of the scenes are great.I just love this movie because it show to everyone that it isn't easy to travel all the way to Japan to live there, its so different, and maybe too different for you.

Audience reactions seem to be polarised between those who love it and those that found it boring. I have neither of those reactions.On the whole I enjoyed watching it. I have no problem with movies which take their time and each scene had something to like; whether it was cinematography, acting or situation.But I did not love it. I was not left with a feeling of satisfaction at the end because the characters did not go on a journey which I could appreciate. I suppose the question is: do we want movies to reflect life or to tell a story. Most of the time when I am in the cinema, I want to be told a story even if the plot or resolution are somewhat unrealistic. There is enough real life out there for us all to experience. I am not asking for a conventional romantic drama but as least some conflict or temptation.I would contrast this with another Scarlett Johanssen film, Girl with a Pearl Earring, which I enjoyed much more. This also was a slow burn of a film, but there was an outcome of sorts (the picture) and there was more love shown for the setting.

585,steve-599,A fresh new look at boredom...maybe,6,4 October 2003,"Spoiler Warning (if that is possible for a movie without a plot)In the world of art films, novelty is everything.  So what's fresh and new? How about boredom?  Lost in Translation explores the world of exquisite boredom with an ironic twist -- Tokyo is superficially exciting -- bright lights, animated people -- but to our out of place American visitors Bob and Charlotte, it is just so ho-hum.  Unfortunately, Coppola's treatment  of the subject is too effective -- by the time the movie hits its stride when Bob and Charlotte go out for karaoke, you just want to scream to break the boredom yourself.  It languishes in meaningless scenes that drag on forever. It revels in the complete absence of a plot.  The second half is sheer agony, engaging only in getting you to hope something will happen, while reassuring you that it would not betray you that way.  Still, in two scenes toward the end I was disappointed.  Bob had meaningless sex, perhaps just to emphasize his boredom and the pointlessness of everything, and Charlotte suavely glosses over it as if it couldn't make any difference.  But instead of ampifying the boredom, I found it to be achingly trite.  Finally, in an absurd ending that I hope was just the Hollywood ending and not the director's intent, Bob finds Charlotte in a crowded Tokyo street moments after abandoning her at the hotel (which incidentally breaks the laws of physics), and ends their relationship with a heartfelt hug.  That scene really let the wind out of the sails for this movie, giving it the happy ending that just kills the energy of inertia it strove so hard to create.
My rating -- 3 points for creative and even inspired photography and directing, 1 star for Johansson (Charlotte), and 2 stars for Murray -- 6 out of 10 in all -- and I'm giving it every possible break.  Murray is definitely the film's greatest asset, a brilliant performance -- without him we would never have been able to withstand the boredom at all.  How could they have gotten the other 4 out of 10 -- well, maybe people unfamiliar with borerom and meaningless will find it refreshing, but to me a slice-of-life show is exactly what it's cracked up to be -- boring.  I'd recommend getting a plot next time, and working on dialog.  Yes, Coppola is a very promising director, but that alone does not make this a great film.

This film is about 20% comedy, 80% drama, but all of it masterfully done.Somehow the Director, Sofia Coppola conveys a deep and interesting story with very little dialogue (I had no idea it was her until the ending credits... was I surprised). The dialogue is humorous, well written and honest, but it is rare.

And I understand this is an obscure idea in most Hollywood movies. But it isn't an obscure idea to me (as I am capable of enjoying the company of a female without sex being involved) so I guess that's why the film didn't seem as interesting to me. There was a lot of hype for this picture, and I don't think it is worth it. This could have worked a lot better if it were more upbeat.

Their portrayal gets shallower rather than deeper as the movie goes on. The dialog isn't wooden so much as just shallow and trite. The peripheral characters are all handled in hackneyed ways -- like Murray's wife caring only about redecorating the house, Johansson's husband in too-cool on-the-make mode.Tokyo was fun to look at, but you see it only through tourist's eyes.

Johansson looks nice with her big, strange puffy lips, but also extremely uninteresting. None of them have any meaningful lines, their characters are only sketched slightly and don't develop.The minimalist approach might be considered cool and very 2003, but it really translates into a couple of characters that just don't touch the spectator.Only redeeming feature: the superficial view into Japanese culture and a city we hardly ever see portrayed in the West.(Japan and Japanese culture by the way only serves as a backdrop which the protagonists can be amused by.

They are neither good nor bad, they are just two people who are going through a difficult situation. Is a plot tender and sad while linearly develops. All that shows is credible: the characters and everything they do. We see them share their sadness and loneliness, struggle to feel better but not solve their problems.It is a film that offers an experience through empathy: both the characters with the audience, like the characters between them.Both performances are excellent, they make great film, as the director dreamed it to be and help that everything is flowing quite naturally, so that the two characters feel real enough. Bill Murray plays a movie star, and despite that, he is not acting like himself, he created the character as such, who is simultaneously happy and sad with his life.It is a simple story that surprises us because it does not fall into the ""clichés"" that anyone would imagine, goes its own way (very realistic) and has an ending that the viewer is less expected.These are two characters who are lost and alone, but when we see them together that's all that matters, regardless of where they are or what they do, because what is striking is the fact that they are happy to see because they are accompanied and because they know that someone cares about them, someone found them.",Lost in Translation

Sofia Coppola has to be complimented with her outstanding cinematography, enabling these characters to stand out among the haze of busy Tokyo. Two people on a lonely raft on a busy and alien river, the eye of the storm, alone and almost condemned to find each other in a strange culture. And it works so well. They are comfortable in their silence, their goofyness and their silly wisecracks. The only other foreigners in the movie are either Germans or Americans playing awful muzak, not worthy of any attention (well, a little bit of physical attention for the 'singer', but regrettably so ..). The fact that they did not get involved (or managed not to get involved), apart from a farewell kiss and a gentle touch, works very well, and is the main driving force and creates the overriding atmosphere in the movie.

598,ian_ison,The Last Remake of 'Brief Encounter',5,30 March 2007,"This film was, as many people before me have written, dead boring. It was deliberately about self-important, dead boring Westerners visiting what had once been a vibrant and fascinating country but which increasingly since the Meiji Restoration has become a pale clone of Western modernist society - and thus both as boring as the original and a parody mirror held up to any inquisitive Westerner.The base plot line is a pinch from the slightly more charming 'Brief Encounter' which challenged the traditions of fidelity after the passion has departed. In this film, Murray's character seems to be inwardly devoted to his wife and family, remote in the US, but outwardly unafraid of a little dalliance with a not-quite-single white female. She is just bored and bored some more - and then deserves to be bored. The Japanese modernists whom they meet up with seem way too modern and the couple drift back into their comfortable, if dull, lives.I have to confess that the person I took to the cinema to see this film dozed off and snored half way through the film. Nobody in the audience complained - perhaps in sympathy - perhaps out of amusement at a little diversion. I'm afraid it was that kind of film. If you wanted action and dialogue they just weren't there in abundance. If you find watching autumn leaves slowly wend their way across the lawn, into the street and then into the opposite gutter, this is your kind of film.Ava Gardner famously once said of 'On the Beach', shot in Melbourne, 'what better place to choose for a film about the end of the world?'.

Lost in Translation is yet another movie victim to deceptive trailers. The trailers for this movie made it look like a comedy with a plot, whereas the real movie is a sloooooooooooooow-paced drama with a very loose plot. Two mopey-faced Americans bored with their lives wander around Tokyo together and do random things, at the end of the movie, rather than getting involved romantically, the two characters simply part ways and go back to their boring lives. (I did like the fact that they remained loyal to their spouses and did not have an affair). My problem with this movie is that it was all style and no substance. Maybe if this movie had a stronger and more intricate plot, and the actors would occasionally smile once in a while, or just show some emotion, maybe, I actually would have enjoyed watching Lost in Translation.

Even making fun of the Japanese language (ohmygad, they can't say ""r"", that's, like, so, hilarious!) didn't get me aroused enough to stay awake. Okay, so Tokyo is a really lousy place to stay, even if you have a ton of money, because if you are a famous actor and/or philosophy graduate turned dumb-blonde, you just can't find ANYTHING interesting to do there. Except maybe to go to a party where you get shot at with laser guns. At which point, I tuned out and started to snore.

Spent the next 10 minutes pondering why the scene was shot then gave up.One problem with movies that portray 'true life' is that those lives are often uninteresting. Perhaps I should give myself an Oscar for the humdrum three of four weeks I've just lived - or - maybe the point of a boring film is to self reflect to makes one's own life less boring.

However the general view I have about the movie is not so different from similar ones.The acting is good while I feel uneasy with some characters. Charlotte was one of them. She had problems of neglect with her husband and she had her chances to return back to home. Why bothering asking Bill Murray to stay there? Go back with him. It seems as she needs a good, caring friend, but she also wants to be where her husband is. Thats not so logical to me.The lifestyle of Tokyo has been quite sharply pictured in the movie. That is good, but not the real thing I was looking around in this movie.The reason why I really didn't get all along with the movie is I am an easy adapting person.

616,twilightseer,I really wanted to like it...,3,15 March 2005,"but I didn't. I rented this on DVD because I had really liked ""Virgin Suicides"", Sofia Coppola's first film, which was intense and eerie. Also, the pitch of Lost In Translation (LIT) seemed interesting and I thought that Coppola could make a great film out of it provided she showed the same talent as in her first film. Sadly, this is not the case.It's easy to see what Coppola tried to achieve with LIT: a tale about loneliness, incomprehension and impossible love, devoid of any real plot or action but instead, relying solely on the personalities of the two main characters and the feelings arising between them. This is an incredibly ambitious project, the problem is: if you want to make a movie that is so character-driven, you have to create characters that viewers can identify with and feel empathy for. This is the biggest failure in LIT: the lack of such characters.Let's look at the protagonists. Bob Harris, the actor played by Bill Murray, is totally jaded and apathetic. Why? Simply because he's been married for 25 years and is in Japan for a few days to shoot a commercial that still earns him 2 million dollars. Really tough indeed. As to Charlotte, she feels blue because her husband works hard to get his 15 minutes of fame and doesn't have much time to devote to her. Big deal. However talented Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are, they can't convince me that these people really have serious reasons to complain and that they're really the loneliest people in the world.So from then on, I waited and waited again, convinced that something remotely interesting or moving would eventually happen between them. And the wait was very boring since, as I wrote before, there is no real plot. The film is a dilated succession of empty moments, conversations and encounters that seem to have no end. Sometimes, inexplicably, Sofia Coppola throws in totally random things that seem totally out of place, such as the (mildly funny) visual gags with Murray, the karaoke/strip joint/TV show scenes (which are, in addition, unpleasant examples of stereotyping of Japanese people, a constant that sure doesn't help the film) or additional characters like the dizzy action movie star played by Anna Faris (if this is supposed to be a snide attack on the industry of blockbusters, it fails miserably because Faris's character is at least alive and proves much more memorable than any other in the film).In the end, after what seems to be an eternity (and a boring one at that), Bob and Charlotte say goodbye to each other. This was the only time where I felt a little emotion, maybe because the idea of a heart-wrenching separation is universal. But even this nice moment is marred by a now well-known dramatic trick (SPOILER: before leaving for good, Bob whispers something in Charlotte's ear and the viewer will never know what that was). If they had just kissed, looked a moment at each other, smiled and then separated, then the ending would have been good. As it is, it's just artificial and shrug-inducing.Overall, Lost In Translation was a massive, cruel letdown. It was all the more disappointing since a lot of time and talent were wasted into it. In order to not be entirely negative, I'll still mention that the cinematography is beautiful (so is Tokyo, apparently) and that the music is good at times. It's still not enough for me to make for a good movie. To conclude, I really hope that ""Virgin Suicides"" was not just a fluke and that Sofia Coppola's next film will be much better than this one.",Lost in Translation
617,IslandMyst,Perfect film for this genre,10,26 July 2019,"I think that many people don't understand that this is a ""slice of life"" type film. You're like a fly on the wall watching how people interact with each other and how they deal with various situations. There isn't supposed to be a cohesive plot any more that someone's actual life has a plot. The characters don't have goals which are blocked by an antagonist who they have to overcome by the end of the film. These are the kind of films you can play in the background and slowly get into. Gotta just take the genre for what it is.Murray's character is an actor who has become jaded with the extras that come along with being famous. He seems to have done the whole product promotion thing a thousand times before and has become a victim of his own success. Scarlett's character is an intelligent young woman who recently graduated ivy league and got married before even knowing what she wants to do in life. Instead she follows her husband around on his ventures.They're both trapped in the minutiae of their lives...While Murray's character is big, he finds it difficult to relate to anybody. Everybody he meets immediately just starts talking about his movies and he takes it as part of the territory but is visibly sick of it, as if he never signed up for this. Scarlett, on the other hand, is small. It's her husband who is big and well known to the point where he's good friends with celebrities. She feels like an accessory to someone else's life rather than the primary focus of her own.They meet by chance while staying at the same hotel in Tokyo. The film goes to great lengths to show just how different the Japanese culture from their perspective. How they don't understand what's going on half the time because of the language barrier and customs.They end up being the perfect piece to the other one's puzzle. Due to her lifestyle, she's the only person there who isn't impressed by his celebrity. He's the only one there who she can have a deep, intellectual conversation with. This is highlighted by Scarlett's character being forced to listen to one of her husband's celebrity friend's played perfectly by Anna Farris, who is always bringing up asinine conversation topics in which she constantly gets facts wrong or just makes things up.Murray and Scarlett start spending time together and you can tell that these are two people who would probably never find their way to interact with each other but for being in Japan. It shows that some connections are like this. They work in one context but not others. If they were back in the US their lives would be too different. However in this context, two strangers can find it easier to understand each other than even their spouses, with an even more powerful connection. There are implications to why people grow weary of their marriages. The context of a relationship may change over time especially after a couple has children.A lot of the film is subtextual. There's one scene where they're in a restaurant and they're both in a bad mood. It doesn't make sense at first glance since they've been having such a great time together, but it can be deduced that they're upset at the fact that they've each met someone who gets them so well but they could never actually be together. There's a generational gap between them plus all the other barriers makes it unfeasible, and it's just not fair. They'll soon just have to return to their lives.These real life type of themes are brought up but not overanalyzed. The audience has plenty of leeway come up with their own thoughts and interpretations of the themes. There are many funny moments and some stereotyping of Japan, but not to the point of being offensive. All the characters feel real and are intriguing to watch. It feels like the movie could start following the lives of any other characters and still be interesting. There's rapper that had like five lines and it even had me pondering what he was doing in Japan.The film is fantastic in my opinion and near perfect for the genre. It's even better that it was filmed in the pre smart phone era Tokyo. An era where if you were by yourself, you were alone even if you had a mobile phone. Today, you're never alone as long as you have access to you messaging apps. Today, you can't really get lost with Google maps. Today, you can translate anything you need to communicate with someone else.

621,cindy-346,Very Original!,9,4 March 2008,"I woke this morning with the thought of Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation at the forefront of my mind. Having watched the film last night, I was buzzing to watch it again and determined to discover what her next project would be; so as I always do when in need of movie-related information, I visited the IMDb (Internet Movie Database) homepage. The site was adorned with news of the previous night's Oscars awards ceremony but as I scanning the list briefly I received two surprises - one was of course counting Return of the King's 11 awards, but my happiest surprise was to see that Sofia had won an Oscar for the film that I had fallen in love with just 12 hours ago. The talented Sofia Coppola received four nominations this year, winning the much-deserved award for ""Writing (Original Screenplay)."" I find this ironic as the film's experimental style involves what seems like at least 100 'inserts' and very few scenes with dialogue. But then that is the film's beauty - that Murray and Johansson's chemistry (excuse the cliché) radiates through their acting and the well-directed timing of their few deliveries, leaving viewers on an emotional high throughout the movie.The film's hundred or so inserts consist primarily of shots of Tokyo which Sofia's crew translated (under her unique direction) from still shots she took whilst touring the city. The inserts can only be described as a 'scented pot pourri' with their rich variety of camera techniques and colourful (sometimes unusual) subject matter. I began watching the film in a confused awe until I felt I could understand the style of the movie. Experiencing this visual-stimulation tornado in the mind alone is worth watching the film for in my opinion. As well as the treat to the eyes and heart, the film's medley from around the world was a treat for the ears, begging to be played at sky-scraping volumes.If Sofia's entry into film industry was purely nepotism, it is clear from her work that she herself has the talent as both a writer and a director to become successful in it. All that remains is the torturous wait until Sofia finds or creates another work of visual poetry.",Lost in Translation

There are a few funny moments (Bill Murray mugging for the ad cameras, the carpet-square scene), but not enough for a successful comedy. But not enough really happens with the characters or story to qualify as a successful drama either, so it's stuck awkwardly between genres. I don't have a problem with movies that are both, but a movie shouldn't be neither.

Plodding, tiring, waste of top comedic talent...this is a chick flick for a lower intelligence, average, shallow woman to waste an afternoon with.As to anyone else's bad comments on this piece of dreck...I heartily agree. Bad career move for Bill. He may have felt pressure to interconnect and make ""nice"" with the Coppolas... they are pretty powerful Hollywood stuff. What with Sophia's daddy doing the Godfather and Apocalypse Now and other drama action pieces. At least the Godfather had something to say...and did it with power...about a serious subject.This movie, Lost in Translation, has NOTHING to say, and does it with wimpy suggestiveness; long moments of no speech or action, nice photography with bad writing. Kind of like your brother's videos of his trip to Tokyo, only without any useful information, or your brother's pizza and beer.The characters are undeveloped. The king has no clothes. This thing is a stinker, and in my opinion nails shut the awful record of Ebert and Roeper who actually gave this not just Two Thumbs Up, but... are you ready for this?... Two BIG Thumbs Up. Never again! My best thoughts on the analysis of how a train wreck like this is conceived in the mind of the Writer / Director, Sophia Coppola, is she is a fan of Woody Allen, a genius without saying it, a true innovator of style, comedy, and philosophic insight set to comedy. However, whereas Woody Allen has talent, and a funny observational humor, Sophia has apparently the ability to hold a camera and watch a man on a business working trip to Tokyo, doing nothing spectacular.The Woody Allenish aspects of this movie are the commentary, and the relational aspects of male and females in marriage and dating... only this movie makes no witty commentary. Just pictures of two boring people. Sorry Bill. I really am a huge fan of his work, including Groundhog Day, Stripes, SNL, etc. But, this movie was beneath him for whatever reasons he did it.If I were Nicolas Cage, I would disavow any relationship to Sophia Coppola.No plot. No direction. Nothing to say. No arc. Attempted humor lands on its face much like your stilted Aunt attempting to quote Jerry Seinfeld. Even the mispronunciation in the speech of the native Japanese unable to say their ""L's"" falls flat on its face. The Japanese hooker yells at Bill to ""Lip her stockings"" meaning ""rip her stockings."" Phhtt. Listen to the echoing silence.Any hack writer in Hollywood could have punched this thing up. Should have considered hiring a comedy screenwriter... or perhaps taking direction from Bill Murray and listening to his creative instincts. Obviously, he had little input into this smoldering pile.I wonder how long Sophia had to pound daddy's desk in order to get him to put out the money to fund this film.",Lost in Translation

Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson hold your attention as two disparate, lonely strangers in a foreign land (Tokyo itself is effectively a central character) who seek solace in each other's company to escape their self-imposed exiles at the Park Hyatt hotel. Murray, an international movie star, is on location filming a whisky commercial whilst Johansson is accompanying her photographer husband (a quirky Giovanni Ribisi) on a business trip. The film charts their burgeoning friendship forged through a mutual apathy borne out of loneliness and frustration. They talk, drink, sing karaoke and hang out in the hotel bar. 'Lost In Translation' is a film about finding both friendship and inspiration in the most unlikely of places. The fact that the central characters find understanding in such a foreign place demonstrates this to perfection with Tokyo proving an inspired location for a movie about finding meaning. In fact you could say it's wholly ironic. A clever and subtle film which rails refreshingly against convention, making Sofia Coppola clearly one to watch as a director.",Lost in Translation
629,RBNY,"Acting is great, but the story is lacking",6,13 October 2003,I thought the two leads were incredible.  Bill Murray deserves the accolades and I hope he starts getting more work again.  Scarlett plays the ingenue to perfection.  She is definitely on the rise; the camera loves her and she has the acting chops to continue. The story to me was lacking.  I liked what Coppola was trying to accomplish but I felt substance missing two thirds through.  It seemed she did not know what decision to make with the characters. I will say the photography was outstanding as well. I just don't think the movie is a great as some are praising it to be.,Lost in Translation
630,BobRed,Well.. something was lost,4,28 January 2004,"Lost in Translation - The name of this movie is certainly appropriate.Most of the film was dedicated to showing how out of place the two main characters felt in Japan.  The result was that I felt out of place sitting in the theater.The breakdown of the film is probably as follows...40% - I don't speak Japaneese, 28% - I don't understand the Japaneese people, 10% - I don't understand myself, 20% - We have fun together, 01% - Classic Bill Murray humor, 01% - We have something special together.I'm sure Sophia Coppola will get an Oscar for her direction, but in my humble opinion, direction was where the film really failed.  Many scenes were cut in such a way that I was continually trying to figure out what I was looking at.  There was also a continual darkness to the film, which may have been intentional, but I personally cannot handle being depressed for 2 straight hours.If you really want my recommendation, skip this movie until you find yourself in a good mood that you want to dismiss.",Lost in Translation
631,asu,Superbly constructed (and you can see the seams),7,4 October 2003,"I came in with misgivings, having admired the craft but not enjoyed the Virgin Suicides. Quite and silence are used in film to add gravity to scenes (we're so used to constant soundtracks in American films), and I thought there was a lot of ill earned gravity to that movie. and honestly accounting for that, I still dislike Lost in Translation ... the entire first half consisted of one cheap shot after another to build up two characters who in the end I tolerate but generally think of arrogant tourists. Actually, I actively dislike the girl at the end. I understand that it was meant to show culture clash, the we're so lost and how do you reach out ... but with such a mean spirit that I couldn't help but think that of the shallow, low side of the characters. Nor did was it an elevation of what is basically a normal, common feeling for many of us. The culture clashes were so constructed as primarily sight gags, or reaction shots, or god forbid the japanese mispronouncing english...in Japan? It was a spirit that permeated the film, especially including the poor little rich girl actress. Sure its funny, the Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson (who did fine) are our surrogates, and they built entirely at the expense of the ill-conceived characters, who are merely more ""the world is crazy and crude and we're lost"" props for the leads.The second half was better, more even, even if the good things about Japan that they like are a very hip, elitist selection anyway. Had the first half been more tonally even, I think I would have enjoyed it much more. But by then I wanted the well made, well acted, pretty movie to end. Everyone was very good. The script was very constructed, every other character astonishingly poor. Like Storytelling, well sure I don't like those people. You wrote them that way.Happy Together reminds me of a lost in foreign country movie that wasn't so mean. Being lost shouldn't be a feeling that requires insults, like Coppola's shots w/o people. Simlarily, there are quiet banal moments we're just supposed to gauzily watch. I say we're suppose to feel a bit of their existential ennui. And I don't. Its the same thing as <SPOILER>

Sofia delivers best when she can create her own landscape, as in LIT. Knowing that Sofia and Spike Jonz split up, and seeing LIT, we know that Charlotte's character embodies both a confused Sofia and her crush on Bill Murray. There is an entire generation of women that look to Bill Murray's movie caricatures as the bomb. This is evident watching and listening to Sofia anytime Bill comes up in some of the behind the scenes reels on the DVD. This is not a bad thing. It creates the heart wrenching humane embellishments conveyed by LIT.To say Sofia is a visual storyteller is an understatement. Growing up in a movie family may have created this trait and skill.

The movie had no climax, no real breakthrough, no resolution. But... as I realized, sometimes neither does life. What this movie does spectacularly is make you feel in a way you've never felt before, the bitter melancholy of life, the knowledge that things could have been and perhaps never will be. The setting in Japan makes the two protagonists feel even more isolated, and perhaps drawn to each other, two lost souls in an unfamiliar place. In consistency with the theme of the movie, I offer a word to describe the emotion which movie makes you feel - Saudade, the feeling of distance and loss suffered by the families of men off at sea during the age of Portuguese discoveries.Also, if you like this film I recommend listening to the song EDEN - rock + roll.

635,ImOkayLarry,Magical,10,28 June 2008,"As of last night i have seen this film 3 times, and each time i have loved it more and more. To but it simply, i now consider this to be quite possibly one of the best films i have ever seen. It's hard to justify this opinion with words, its just something that i feel when watching it. It's magical yet real, intimate yet distant, soul-warming and heart-breaking. It's a huge mix of contrasting feelings, all contradicting one and another, and this couldn't be more fitting. It's like love, gentle but engrossing.. but perhaps that's enough about 'feelings'. More technically, the cinematography is fantastically suiting to the story, with shallow focuses creating a delicate world around the lonely protagonists who are so out of place with it. The acting is superb, Bill Murray is the best he has ever been (evoking a whole spectrum of emotion, but also making us laugh)and Scarlett Johansson.. well, she may well be the most beautiful creature ever to be put on film. Lost in Translation feels like a very personal film, as if Coppola is putting herself into these characters. One specific moment brings this to mind, when Charlotte muses about being lost in life, to paraphrase; 'I tried writing but i hate what i write, I tried photography but my pictures are so..mediocre'. This feels like a reflection of the film-maker's own frustrations (for example, being shunned out of the acting world by the harsh criticisms to The Godfather Part3), But i am very happy to say that this films is every bit as good as anything her father has made, and whats more, i even prefer it. With Lost in Translation, Coppola has truly proved that she has found her vocation. It's fresh, different and excellently made. But more importantly it's magical.",Lost in Translation
636,kevinmanf,A masterpiece about the mood and states of the characters,10,5 March 2006,"It is not easy to talk about ""Lost in Translation"". Sofia Coppola's second film as a director is in part about things we never talk about. While its two protagonists try to find mutual solace in each other, their silence is as expressive as their words. This is a film that believes that an individual can have a valuable relationship with someone else without becoming part of that person's life. At 19 years of age, I am not married but I can understand pretty well that it is easier for a stranger with whom you share a moment in the bar or corridor to understand your problems better than your husband or wife. Here is an extract from Roger Ebert's great review of the film: ""We all need to talk about metaphysics, but those who know us well want details and specifics; strangers allow us to operate more vaguely on a cosmic scale. When the talk occurs between two people who could plausibly have sex together, it gathers a special charge: you can only say ""I feel like I've known you for years"" to someone you have not known for years."" In this marvellous story, the two lonely individuals that merge the illusions of what they have and what they could have are two Americans. The emotional refuge, Tokyo. We have Bob Harris (Bill Murray), and actor in his fifties who was once a star, and is now supplementing his incomes with the recording of a whisky commercial. On the other side of the telephone, a frightening reality: his wife, his sons, and the mission of choosing the right material for heaven knows what part of the house. When we consider Bob's situation, we realise that Lost in Translation is also a meditation on the misery of fame. Certainly fame has great (perhaps greater than disadvantages) advantages but then there are the obligations, the expectations...We also have Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a woman in her twenties who is accompanying her husband, a photographer addicted to work, on a business trip. But it could said it is as if she is alone anyway. Her world, just like Bob's, is reduced to strange days in the bedroom, the corridors, the hotel's swimming pool, and the bar, the perfect destination for victims of sleeplessness and wounded soul. The bar is the place Bob and Charlotte meet for the first time. They talk, little, but just enough. Once their dislike for parts of their lives are established, they begin sharing times that feel dead to be able to feel alive.Bob and Charlotte are souls in transition for whom, surrounded and confused by exotic rituals, and a different language, allows them a moment to lose their identities. Both characters provoke similar feelings form different experiences. There are no kisses or crazy nights between them, but only a shared intimacy in which a night out, a walk in the streets, a session of karaoke becomes a powerful expression of their affection an complicity. The relationship we all await only happens in our minds and the protagonists, whom we are not allowed to know everything they say and desire. Tokyo metaphorically speaking is the third character in the film. The bright colours, the noise of the city...just everything evokes the various spiritual awakenings of the characters. It ends on a perfect note leaving the relationship of the characters undecided. A rare gem in modern day cinema.",Lost in Translation

Sofia Coppola has definitely become a director that will channel real emotions through scenery and performance.  Bill Murray deserves an Oscar for his performance in career-defining role as Bob Harris.  He not only was funny but dramatic at the same time, especially the way he sang Roxy Music's ""More Than This"" that was so heartbreaking.  Scarlett Johansson truly deserved the Upstream Best Actress Prize from the Venice Film Festival for her portrayal as the lost, neglected Charlotte that is performed with beauty and maturity that makes her outshine all her peers.

The story is simple, characters are used more than once before, but it still has much more to say about life, marriage and human beings.Before I saw it, I wondered why the name is LOST IN TRANSLATION, but after, everything cleared out. The long and complex Japanese language, loses its meaning and becomes dull when translated into English. Just like, human emotions loses their importance, and real necessity when tried to be translated by using so much unnecessary words.After only 2 years of marriage, there's little concern for the other, but the glance of two strangers are far more meaningful than all the other words..Finally, this is not just a drama, for those who hasn't seen it.

The story is about two people who are in tokyo for business, not as tourists, and they both are bored and wish they weren't there. They come together and try to have some fun. OK, good story, but Sofia has concentrated so much on showing how bored and sad these two are that makes you bored too. As I said, it starts very good and goes good for some time but then you get tired of seeing Bill Murray's so bored face (his face doesn't change at all!) or Scarlett Johansson's sad face and you start to feel like them.

640,erialc,"Good, but slightly disappointing",8,12 April 2004,"It was hyped up to be the critic-favorite of the year, the little film that went on to capture the elusive taste of the Academy. The rave reviews and the prestigious honors piqued my anticipation, but at the end it all resulted in a slightly disappointing viewing experience. I still enjoyed the film, but it just failed to impress.After a few initial jokes, the movie, having worn the façade of a romantic comedy, turned itself into a serious drama that ponders on much bigger issues in life. The pace of this film was extremely slow, but purposely so with the intention of conducting a character study of two strangers who befriend one another in Tokyo. Thus, the story only turns more interesting when the two main characters, who are almost devoured by their own boredom, finally come into interaction. Stuck in respective plateaus in their lives, Bob and Charlotte long for a counterpart that understands their feelings.
While immersed in a world with completely different cultures and language, they look onto the other for a trace of solace and most importantly understanding to their miseries, their isolation, loneliness and dissatisfaction in life. In this aspect, the film delivers, but to a much more successful extent through Murray and Johansson's facial expressions and subtle gestures than Sophia's much extolled writing (dialogue), presenting us with a poignant and realistic relationship of two people, lost in life yet not completely hopeless.",Lost in Translation

He captures the role with such precision that you don't realise this is the same guy who, dare I even mention it in the same breath, provided the voice of Garfield last year. You see a few traces of his characteristic smugness every once in a while, but by and large the Bill Murray you see is a lot more serious... and seriously damned good.It's such a simple story... unhappy married man meets unhappy married woman in a place neither of them are familiar with, and suddenly realise that they're all the other has got at least for the time being. In an age where Hollywood is trying (mostly unsuccessfully) to scare and shock us with something new at every turn, Sofia Coppola takes what should be the premise for a typical chick flick and turns it into something that anyone who has ever experienced an emotion of any description can watch and appreciate.A brilliant film in any language.",Lost in Translation

The guy was just born to make you laugh. He can make you laugh in the most subtle ways. His best characters are usually judgmental and cynical who slyly poke fun at others and use very sly wit (see Groundhog Day and Ghostbusters). His character here is again this way (as he mocks the how annoying his hosts are) but unlike his other films 'Lost in Translation' is not mostly devoted to his humour and this time he is playing alongside a young actress who is every bit as eye-catching. Whereas previously Murray has stolen scenes and is clearly the class act, here Scarlet Johansson puts in a performance that demands just as much attention.There are still many occasions where you will find yourself grinning at Murray but this film is not a simple comedy. Far from it. This is more a character examination than a film. Here we have two characters, at different stages in their lives and yet with identical personal issues. Both are in marriages that aren't working for them, both suffer from insomnia at night and of course both are a little lost in the foreign culture they find themselves in.Filmed with extreme deliberation by Coppolla, sometimes too much so, we get a real insight into human relationships and communication. The setting of Tokyo provides the film with jaw-dropping visuals and makes for easy viewing when this portrait of two complicated characters lives might veer towards depressing. But Coppolla does not allow that to happen because with the right injection of humour and wondrous cinematography you remain light-hearted about the whole thing.Some may find the negative representation of the Japanese offensive but it serves up some humorous moments and the film would not have worked without it. And thank you Coppolla for not making the ending overly sentimental, as at one point I feared it would. Because lets face it a romantic relationship would never have worked out between them.

I have seen this movie twice, and the second watching didn't change my initial take on it.If the point was for these two characters to have a chance encounter in a foreign land and alleviate each others creeping malaise, it works, up to a point. But the sparks never flew, and the fact that they never had sex and only exchanged a few awkward hugs and a couple of clumsy kisses leaves me scratching my head in dismay. The story didn't even have them going at it hot and heavy and on the verge of sex only to have them draw back at the last second, thus titillating the viewer without consummating, but we didn't even get that far. This situation had so much potential, but so little exploration of that potential.On the plus side, again, the cinematography was superb, and we did get a look at Japanese culture in the post modernist age that is relatively accurate, which does redeem the director to some extent.

Scarlett should have been listening to a tape on Japanese instead of whatever self-help crap she had playing. But these people don't do anything to better their situation.

And why was so much time spent capturing the night life in the bars - where almost nothing happens - time that could have been used to fill out the story about the two main characters? Lost in Translation proves a theory I've long had about film-making in general: it's extremely difficult, if not impossible, to depict boredom on the screen without boring the audience.The Emperor has no clothes, and this film has no substance.

660,undertakercowboyatyahoodotcom,A Positive Review.,10,14 January 2004,"In reading other comments for the film, it seems apparent to me that many people have missed the point. Why are there people complaining about the lack of a plot? Why are there people who think that Bob and Charlotte's relationship is based on un-requited love? *Slight SpoilersFirstly, this is a bold, under-dramatic film that dares to be real. It's character driven so the plot, as it were, is one that proceeds from moment to moment, a series of portraits that brilliantly shows how life can be. Personally, I appreciate a film that doesn't try to exist within the framework of what you would expect. I like it that it didn't feel the need to create tension or conflict, or whatever else a film is supposed to have to be interesting. Can't a film just be about how things sometimes are, in a witty and well-portrayed way? As for the two main characters' relationship; it is not one of falling in love, as shown by the fact that there were no advances made by either of them (which some people seemed disappointed by.) Instead they had a mutual connection and a 'real' feeling of being comfortable with each other which can be hard to find. Essentially, the film is set at a time in both their lives when they needed a friend, and the beauty of this is brilliantly stated, and fluently, by Sofia Coppola, who has had the audacity to make a film that does not feel conventional, and because of that can have a greater emotional impact. The film is a snapshot. Do photographs have a plot? I applaud Coppola for not feeling like she had to make Bob and Charlotte have a sexual relationship, with Charlotte's husband finding out, perhaps Bob's wife, creating all kinds of conflict-ridden scenes that have been done a hundred times in other films. My point is; this is not that type of relationship, or film. A viewer has to realise this. It's about how people, in a very ordinary sense, can subtly effect your life. Or not so subtly. Or maybe just a celebration of the possibility of human friendship and its lingering effects on others, since Bob and Charlotte will no doubt never forget each other.As for the technical points of the film, there is no need to comment on them, since how brilliant the acting and direction is has been commented on many times, even by those who were disappointed by the story. (Someone mentioned something negative about the mundanity of the conversations. But extraordinary, non-real conversation would have seemed out-of-place here. And anyway, besides the introductions [which incidentally also introduced us to the characters in a way], I thought the dialogue was excellent and witty.) Other comments made have concerned the Japanese culture. It is certainly the cause of many a smile, and for this I wonder what the Japanese reaction is. My reaction was one that thought it wasn't overdone, although it could have been, and if you have any kind of common sense the viewer should be able to realise that this is in every way a caricature of Japan and its people. (Since when have films not been allowed to make light fun of certain cultures. It happens all the time.) And as for the many shots of the city itself, I thought, within their documentary-esque style, they were revealing and eye-opening. It's the city as it is, and some of the high shots were stunning. There's a quick glimpse of outside the city, but it is the city (which comes alive as another character), which is the important set-piece. Whereby I see how some of the areas portrayed about Japan, Tokyo and its people could be grating or offensive, it is important to realise that this is the view of the city and its people that Bob and Charlotte are subjected to. On Charlotte's one excursion out of the city, we are able to appreciate some of the finer aspects of the culture, though Coppolla couldn't indulge in this further because the character didn't. And the character didn't (as some commenters would have liked) because it wasn't in her character to do so. In a way, Charlotte was in emotional limbo, and instead of going out in search of the Japanese culture, she connected with someone who felt closer to home: American Bob. And likewise for Bob.
Anyway, I kinda lost my way after not discussing the technical prowess, so I'll keep it short and sweet now. Bill: excellent. Scarlett: excellent. Verdict; excellent, deep film. I just wanted another positive comment posted among the negatives.",Lost in Translation
661,ichapman,Japan and the Japanese,4,13 January 2004,"Perhaps the most objectionable feature of this overrated film is its sneering, superficial view of Japan and the Japanese.  Coppola's take on this appears straightaway in Bob's journey from the airport through the garishly-lit high-rise desert which is all we are shown of Tokyo to the ingratiating group of welcomers awaiting him at the hotel.  But the point is hammered home in scene after tedious scene of Japanese speaking incomprehensible English (and even - good grief! - no English at all), Japanese behaving like idiots, Japanese in endless karaoke sessions, and shot after shot after shot of all those soulless big buildings!  An alternative to this view of Japan is restricted to Charlotte's visit to Kyoto, a sequence so brief that if you'd blinked you'd have missed it.What a dreary contrast all this is to Edward Zwick's 'The Last Samurai', which, despite its share of Hollywoodisms, shows a genuine interest in and respect for the country in which it is set.",Lost in Translation

Surely to god the director could have generated something resembling energy for these poor people. Every cliché I have seen in movies filmed in Japan. The Pachinko parlor, the Karaoke bar. Sushi and shinto shrines. Was this the best Sofia Coppola could do? In the first twenty minutes we understand the dilemma of the Bill Murray character. He is lost in translation. Hearing fifty words spoken for a three word request and wondering what all the other words mean. This is the theme of the film. Okay. Great. So this review has to carry on for more lines in order to become acceptable. Hey wait a minute! I'm padding out this review in much the same way the writer-director padded out her film. Drink Sartori! It's a wonderful whiskey. Go into the same bar and sit at the same table. Commiserate with a total stranger. There was little or no substance to this.

This movie was more then deserved to be seen when was released in theaters and now when it's released on DVD. Oh, well.Tokyo looks amazing in this movie, as a comperission I can say that it looked sort of like LA looked in Colleteral. Amazing! And the movie starts with the best thing in it, you can feel how lost the two main characters or at least Sharlote are in this huge insane city.The directing is superb, everything feels right, but the script that gave Coppola her Oscar (probebly not her last one) is not what I expected it to be. Tlost characters meet each other and get lost together in that crazy city and in the end they must break up. Not the most original or brilliant of scripts but works well. Unfortunately, for me at least, the movie is way too short. I didn't feel the sorrow of ""leaving"" Tokyo which I should have if the movie was long enough for me to start loving or hating that city. For me it was not long enough so I felt nothing and that makes the movie feel a little empty to me.The acting was of course superb, Murrey is a well known actor but Scarlett is a fresh face (and I must say beautiful in a most refreshing way) and she will become a great actress in the future.So all in all it's a worth watching movie but there is a great chance that in the end you would ask yourself ""what the hell that was all about?!"".",Lost in Translation
664,nintendovi,An Artistic Depiction of being 'lost'.,7,27 March 2008,"At best the movie is a story about feeling out-of-place - in relationships, in life and in surroundings. The visuals are nice and the movie is powerful, and while the acting is good the story could have used more work.Bill Murray plays a middle-aged married man who does alcohol advertisements and travels to Japan for a photo-shoot, all the while promoting the product he's trying to sell. Scarlett Johansson plays a young woman whose husband cares more about his work than his relationship, and would much rather go back to America than stay in Japan and feel lost. Both of the characters feel out-of-place in Japan, which is totally different from America, and find kindred spirits in each other. Murray gets drunk and sleeps with an atrocious lady while he's there, which he will now have to go back home and explain to his wife and children, and Johansson stays in Japan with her husband but it's implied that she may now have the courage to talk to him and tell him things aren't working. The two find unlikely friendship in each other, and possibly learn more about themselves and what they want to do with their lives.And that's pretty much the whole movie. But, it's still worth watching from an artistic perspective. I should also mention that this movie portrays two peoples' experiences in Japan negatively, and this may not be the case for every American that goes to Japan. Both of the main characters didn't really have much interest in being in Japan either, they were there because of work and spouses.After watching the movie I did think a lot, about the main characters and what life would be like in Japan, so it does evoke some feelings. Also, the documentary on the DVD that shows everything Sofia Coppola went through as she made the film was pretty interesting, as was the music video, so the extras on the disc are worth a watch.",Lost in Translation

In fact, this movie transcends all the usual criteria, (plot, script, acting, cinematography etc.)Although those aspects are actually stunning, there is something else, which goes beyond those things that completely nails it for me personally. Some people say they just don't get it or that it's boring because nothing happens, but maybe it's just that they just don't relate to the mood of the film, which is cool. Everybody is different after all. Personally, I'm a sucker for melancholy, self-indulgent slush that lets me wallow in self-pity. I seek it out and gorge myself upon it ;P , But seriously, I yearn to get far away from all the bullshit and find some space where I can really get in touch with my real thoughts and feelings, and totally find myself.

Bill Murray and Scarlett JoHansson are made for each other, and Bill Murray is still funny as hell.  The Japanese setting only added to the majesty of the film.  Best part: Bob and Charolette's night on the town with Charlie Brown and crew.  Doesn't this film make you want to visit Japan for yourself.  This flick is hands down one of the best films of 2003.

Each is finding life meaningless and confusing which is compounded by their Japanese setting. (It IS a hard language to master, it is a difficult cultue to relate to, and all of those little gifts the Japanese keep pressing on us -- just about bore us to death.) The pace of their developing friendship and the use of music lyrics to portray what they are feeling is masterful. The first image we see is the behind of a woman with her ""groove thing"" showing though a pair of gauzy pink panties. This movie will have sex (and sex sells). Yes, there is a little sex, but not what you think, and that was a nice surprise. It was a great look at Tokyo (esp. Ginza district) and Kyoto, with vignettes of Japanese night life and pop culture (such as pachinko, arcade games, karaoke and an inane talk show).

668,CareySandwich,Brilliant,10,13 October 2003,"Lost in Translation is a tale about two different people coming together and finding each other while on a search to find themselves. Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a has-been actor who is in Japan to film a whiskey endorsement. He is going through the standard midlife crises and his being plopped into such a strange and foreign culture only magnifies his feelings of isolation. Scarlet Johansen plays Charlotte, a young girl who has been married for 2 years to John, played by a hilarious Giovanni Ribisi. John plays the stereotypical work-centered yuppie who doesn't give his wife the attention she needs and leaves her to sit and ponder her existence for days on end while he is out at photo shoots.This is definitely the breakthrough role for Scarlet Johansen, who you may have seen supporting Thora Birch and Steve Buschemi in 2000's Ghost World. She delivers her role as a lonely Yale philosophy degree holder with an almost eerie grace. Bill Murray also gives what I would call the defining performance of his career in Lost In Translation.  He delivers in classic form on the comedy element of this performance, but also manages to handle the dramatic elements of his character with surprising sensitivity and depth.They meet in a bar and initially are attracted simply to the familiarity of someone from the States whom each can understand. But as they continue to run into each other, and eventually decide to hang out while they're stuck in a Japanese hotel, they begin to find that it is on a much more profound level that they understand each other. They relate to each other in ways that are therapeutic for both of them.As Murray and Johansen weave this intriguing relationship into a perfect tapestry before our eyes, we begin to wonder exactly what makes a relationship work between two people. We are forced to wonder why some relationships only work on paper (don't forget, both our characters are married, however unhappily) but fall short in real life, while others are virtually impossible on paper, yet come to life in the field, if only for a short time.  The script, which was brilliantly crafted by Sofia Coppola (daughter of Francis Ford), makes suggestions about the philosophical nature of relationships, and how they contribute to the makeup of who we are. She also directed this film, with all the precision and care of an auteur who is looking to establish herself stylistically in the industry.
Lost in Translation is a great film, the best I've seen yet this year. It's humorous throughout, even though the laughs never really rise above a chuckle. The humor, while it is cliché-ish and standard for a culture-clash film, always comes smoothly and naturally, and is never forced. Tanslation plays to the immense acting talent of both leads and has a sense of ambient symbolism which lets its motifs flow naturally without drawing attention to themselves. Try to see this film if you are at all interested in other human beings or the dynamics between two people.",Lost in Translation

Speaking of, Murray's rise to latter-day sainthood vis a vis Rushmore and Royal Tennenbaums is incredible to me. Especially here, the man simply looks and acts pathetic at all times. There is no depth to pathos or boredom in film; it exists at face value on the screen. Same goes for Scarlett Johanssen. She gives a performance that makes her worthy of the lead in ""The Andie MacDowell Story"". She, along with the story, is vapid and without any emotional depth. Maybe that is what being rich expatriates means to the heinously fake Sophia Coppola. Whatever the case LIT is as pretentious and shallow as ""The Virgin Suicides"".

670,KvMauB,Translated Well,9,13 December 2004,"Lost in Translation is another favorite film of mine, which appealed to me and entertained me on many levels. First the film is an astute exposition on Japanese culture and how westerners might perceive or misunderstand it. Though much of the humor originated from this, Lost in Translation could almost be a documentary on modern Japanese city culture, I think. Also the film mirrored a very similar experience I had when I lived in Japan for a short time. I can totally identify with Scarlett Johanson's character, as I too wandered around in a jet lagged daze, marveling at the sometimes strange, sometimes more efficient, sometimes incomprehensible differences in the Japanese solutions, customs, and tastes. But my main reason for liking this film is that I think it truly showed an uncommonly realistic love story. It was a love story of a different sort with two married people that meet and connect intimately (seemingly more intimately than their respective spouses) without overt sexuality, despite a gulf of age, and, I think, maturely and honorably.

671,ryan-bfd,Sophia Cappola's Masterpiece,9,24 December 2015,"This film is one of my favorites. Lost in Translation is a gorgeously produced movie. Everything from the writing to the directing to the acting flows together so beautifully. Especially the movie score, cinematography and editing. There are some quick and harsh cuts that you see a lot of young directors utilize, but in this movie it is done so well. It just works in this movie. I don't know if it's the way the end of each shot lingers a bit or what it is but the movie is so well put together. A young Scarlett Johansson puts together such a captivating performance. It's so natural and unforced. So is Bill Murray's. There performances just pull at your heart strings from there very first scenes to their very memorable and iconic last. This movie is so good that, at certain points, I can't believe that I'm watching a Sophia Cappola film. The score and soundtracks compliment the visuals so well. It's highly stylized with captivating colors in each scene that flow together perfectly. The art direction is just phenomenal. Some shots make me feel like I'm watching an urban Ingmar Bergman film. The film succeeds to maintain this romantic vibe that is rarely seen by lot of films. It seems to derive influences from movies like 'In the Mood for Love' and 'Chunking Express'. Maybe its just because this is a Tokyo love story so the ""Asian romance"" influence is kind of prevalent throughout the film. However, it also has a theme of loneliness and despair. It is sprinkled though out the dialog but it also shows its self in the way certain shots are set up. Such as the ones where Bill Murray is sitting alone in his hotel room and where Scarlett is sitting next to the hotel window, staring out into the vast city landscape. This just makes every interaction between these two all the more satisfying, (SPOILER: Which makes the end all the more heartbreaking). Sophie put this film together very beautifully. It baffles me to think that she just made this masterpiece then never made anything like it ever again. She really is Francis's daughter. And 'Lost in Translation' could be her 'Godfather'. The truth is only time will tell, but if this is true, I'm anticipating seeing her 'Apocalypse Now'.",Lost in Translation

The film perfectly forced you to feel the lead actors confusion and left you to marvel at the beautiful shots of the city. Johansson seems to dull down her over glamorous image that she is known for and seems to blend into the background and lets the city take centre stage. Murray plays the 'tired' character he plays best and always seems isolated until Johansson appears.Giovanni Ribisis' leaves it to the audience to decide whether or not he is sleeping with Anna Faris' character Kelly. Faris plays an airhead role (again), which people may not think about mentioning but in my opinion I felt like she is there to be symbolical, as the lead actors seem to be intelligent but they are having trouble with their lives at this point and Faris is living in the moment and letting the cards fall as they may and Johansson wishes she could live like that. This is especially brought out in the scene where Johansson is jealous of Faris because of her friendship with her husband. The scenes when they are partying in the city give a sense of paranoia as everyone else around them are laughing and joking. The whisper and kiss where supposedly ad-libbed and completely in audible.

677,WWFStern,"""For me, I sympathized with the characters more than I empathized with them""",9,24 January 2004,"WARNING:  Newspaper-style movie review, including plot discussion.Lost in Translation has been praised by countless critics as the singular indie gem of 2003. Personally, I found House of Sand and Fog and Monster to be far more compelling viewing, yet I cannot criticize reviewers who lavished this film with four-star reviews and glowing rhetoric. This is an original piece of work, with a decided air of wisdom, that simply didn't connect with me deeply at any point. Director Sofia Coppola provides several long silences for what one can only assume is viewer introspection. Judging from the film's enthusiastic following, Lost translated art into life quite well.For me, I sympathized with the characters more than I empathized with them. I was unable to find an ""in"" to become emotionally engaged in the plot. The characters were recognizable, but difficult for me to identify with. For that reason, I felt detached--like a viewer of rather than party to the experience--for the length of the film. Instead of wise, the film felt wispy. It was entertaining while it ran, but once the credits rolled, it immediately began its rapid fade into the nether-regions of my memory.But, despite these screenplay issues, the acting and direction absolutely stand out as among the best work in recent memory. If the material had been stronger, this potent combination probably would have churned out a film truly deserving of Best Picture consideration. Bill Murray gives his best screen performance ever as Bob Harris, a B-list American movie star who is shipped off to Japan for a big money liquor endorsement. Away from his family and home country, Harris feels the pangs of isolation and depression. The sporadic calls to his wife reveal a woman who is distant, and a relationship that has long since fizzled.Harris can't sleep a wink, and spends a great deal of time in the hotel bar, where he meets young newlywed Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). Charlotte, a recent college graduate with a degree in philosophy, is married to a photographer with seemingly no interest in her; he prefers to hang out with the ditzy airheads he shoots. Both with equal desperation to escape their surroundings, Bob and Charlotte strike an unexpected and deep friendship. We believe they are soul mates, yet the circumstances are damning. Can they drop everything that's become so achingly familiar and try to start their lives over again, perhaps more along the lines of what they had hoped they'd always be?As good as Murray is, and he is absolutely terrific, Johansson taps into a wonderful intangible that makes her presence on the screen absolutely intoxicating. She shares palpable chemistry with the much-older Murray, making the bond between them feel all the more genuine. Director Coppola takes full advantage of this, with inventive visuals and direction that is so sure-handed it comes as a shock Lost is her sophomore feature effort. There are literally a dozen different lingering shots that could easily work as effective poster images.For all those reasons, it is frustrating the film itself isn't stronger as an end product. Even the beginning, with several big laughs, just leads to a bit of a letdown when comedic momentum runs out in the third act. But, despite numerous imperfections, any Oscar buzz on the film is much appreciated. Nothing would please me more than to see Lost in Translation's ""David"" vanquish the Lord of the Rings ""Goliath"" that has turned cinema toward epic moviemaking and away from the intimate human stories that move mountains so much more effectively than an army of the dead.Final Grade:  B+",Lost in Translation

682,swisswuff,Cultural bias is the essence of the movie.,4,30 May 2005,"People debate whether the possibly ""deep"" portrayal of both main characters and the contrasting ""superficial"" and distorted view Japanese culture constitutes some type of cultural bias or even racism. I can not see why this is a question, as this film is heavily culturally biased. In essence, that is how this film works, but cultural bias is not the focus of this movie. To blame this movie of it's most important tool would be missing the point.We are presented this movie through the eyes of the main characters Bob and Charlotte. Both are white American citizens who seem to share views on what one would like to achieve in life.Their real problem is their inability to connect to other people on a larger scale. Their marriages suffer from their inability to connect to their spouses. Their own soul suffers from their inability to even connect to themselves. They lack interest in current affairs of other people who are different - and at present, Japanese people, which they perceive exactly as they are portrayed in this movie: loud and unsophisticated. So, Bob and Charlotte regard Japanese people in a loud and unsophisticated way, which is why they are portrayed that way. All of these clues show that Bob and Charlotte suffer from some human and cultural inability that spells out as ""un-able"".The movie does not say that all Japanese people behave superficial, loud and grotesque, and the movie does not say that all Americans are culturally unable - all the movie says is that Bob and Charlotte are two Americans in Tokyo, and they have a lot of problems.Yet, these two un-able people connect through being as unevolved as they are, because through their clumsiness, similar problems occur to them, similar life experiences form, and that is how they find out that they ""share"" things. They don't set out to learn Japanese. They don't attempt to meet Japanese people who are normal (instead of being superficially loud and grotesque). They don't do anything to leave the beaten path of their white American average culture. And see what missing out on all this does to them! One can not describe their personal situation as 'suffering', as they are not truly 'suffering'. They live in a 'self-made hell', or rather, a hell that comes about by not doing anything oneself. Both Bob and Charlotte suffer from a high degree of lethargy; no wonder, cynicism and an enhanced longing for passive understanding are consequences. They find that in sharing all of this, they ""belong"" together and since they lack any positive common definition of fun, they go through ""deep"" moments.Both Bob and Charlotte would lose their common ground if they went ahead to be more active. Charlotte could start playing a more active role in her husband's life. Bob could hang out with some Japanese friends on the weekend, maybe invite them to the USA for a hiking trip later. Both could start trying out whatever there is in Tokyo to do - and it is hard to imagine that such could not fill at least two movies. But by doing that, they would find out differences between each other, and they would have to bridge interpersonal gaps they already had problems to bridge with other people beforehand.It does not surprise that legions of people that share such difficulties think that this is a great, and ""deep"" movie. Many Americans and Europeans define themselves as ""not this"" and ""not that"", but negative cultural definitions never bring about much common ground, and that can truly be felt.Now, this is 2005, and life should have much more to offer than sharing cultural inabilities. Bob and Charlotte should be investigating museums, shows, food, culture, people, language, scenery, agriculture - whatever. Yet they don't do that.Indirectly - without direct translation, if you remember the title - we perceive in this movie that ultimately, the beauty of this piece lies in the weight that this ""belonging together"" ends up being attributed: it is only a weak tie that forms between the two protagonists. They obviously define themselves - and each other - over what they can not do, and that does not suffice to make them, or for that part anyone else, a couple that can face challenges and venture out into the unknown of different cultures. Too weak to handle life, too weak to go together, drowning in passivism, unable for anything else but distorted cartoonish views on other cultures. Any other director would have had Bob and Charlotte have a most dirty affair with each other - but not so Ms. Coppola. And that is the true beauty of this movie.",Lost in Translation
683,Fatboydim,Lost The Plot,1,18 February 2004,"This film reminds me of the rubbish I used to write as a teenager. Interesting to nobody but myself. The fact that millions of dollars have been lavished on it simply gives it credibility it does not have. I like the central premise of a one off meeting between two people that stays with them for the rest of their lives. But when that happens in life it's usually down to a spark... something happening. Here nothing happens and Sofia Coppola isn't brave enough to contain the film to the time frame of one night. I even suspect this was a play that Sofia turned into a film.The poignant moments aren't very poignant. The comedy isn't very funny. To spend time with either of the two lead characters would bore us into submission. And this despite the fact that it has Bill Murray. And you get the feeling that a much funnier, or more poignant film is happening elsewhere between the photographer, Starlet and lounge singer.
Go watch Rushmore ... for Bill Murray's best performance. Go watch Lawn Dogs for an Indie film that knows how to strut it's stuff when it comes to odd couples. Or indeed Ghost World that also shows the relationship between an older man and younger woman. [And also has Scarlet Johansson, pouting in a very similar way.] And go watch Virgin Suicides for a better example of film making by Sofia.It would be wrong to say that this movie is awful, but it comes pretty close.",Lost in Translation

There's nothing wrong with the cast, but the dialog is what drags them down to decidedly ordinary personalities.The best explanation I can give for the Oscar is that it's written to trigger memories of exploits touring foreign countries in male movie stars, i.e. written for Hollywood. The rest of us don't get much out of it.When I saw the movie I read Bob's character as that they wanted Sean Connery, but he declined. It would be interesting if this was in fact the case! With Murray in his place, there were possibilities for making the could-be romantic a comedy, but the dialog and Murray's utterly inexpressive face puts a stop to that.

No.. there you aren't going to hear ""I love you"" or ""I couldn't live without you"" and so on... No!

The non-verbal communication where Scarlett Johanson was just looking at Bill Murry spoke volumes on how intimacy can be built by two people put into awkward situations together.  And it was cool that Bill didn't seduce her, so that makes him super nice and sympathetic.

687,Darth_Yannis,"A truly fascinating ""platonic' Love...",8,28 April 2004,"*note:I would like you to forgive me for my rather bag English but being a Greek guy my English is not my mother language.Murray gets to do what he does best in Sofia Coppola's 'Lost in Translation', where he plays Bob Harris, a washed-up Hollywood actor who is in Japan filming a celebrity endorsement for a brand of whisky, in part because he needs the work, in part to escape the suffocating humdrum of his 25-year marriage to Lydia. Bob is staying in the same Tokyo hotel as Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a young ex-student of philosophy who is unsure what to do with her life or whether she has done the right thing in marrying photographer John (Giovanni Ribisi). Unable to sleep in the wee hours of the morning, Charlotte meets Bob in the hotel bar, and their shared dissatisfaction and anxiety quickly becomes the basis of an intense friendship. Charlotte makes Bob feel younger, Bob makes Charlotte feel appreciated, and in an alien environment, at a time of personal crisis, the pair discovers mutual understanding and comfort - until the week is over and it is time to resume their everyday lives.'Lost in Translation' is about two people who have lost their way, and a brief encounter in the unlikeliest of places which helps them both find their bearings and get back on track. Governed by minute observations of character rather than sweeping events, the film first offers a wry series of parallel vignettes which show Bob and Charlotte in situations where communications have broken down - Bob struggling to comprehend his Japanese handlers and director, Charlotte failing to connect with her husband. It is a good half an hour before a single word is exchanged between Bob and Charlotte, but that moment marks the first meaningful communication that either has had in Japan. From then on they become constant companions, like a couple of intimate lovers, overcoming their alienation and incomprehension precisely by sharing their experience of them.Bob and Charlotte's slow-burning relationship is evoked with humour and tenderness by Murray and Johansson, whose on-screen rapport, despite the difference in their age, is tangible. Lance Acord's cinematography transforms Tokyo into a strange wonderland, as far from Hollywood as Coppola's contemplative, uncluttered script, which allows its two central characters to develop at a leisurely pace, and ends not with a bang, but a whisper. Coppola's contempt for Hollywood sensibilities is reflected in her satirical treatment of Kelly (Anna Faris), a loud, vapid starlet visiting Japan to promote her latest blockbuster, 'Midnight Velocity' (starring Keanu, naturally).Seeing Bob and Charlotte's lives changed in 'Lost in Translation' may not exactly change yours too, but it is a smart, stylish portrait of a romance that never quite happens.",Lost in Translation
688,M_INC_KW,Lost on me,5,13 March 2004,"I just rented ""Lost in Translation"" last evening and watched it with my other half, who promptly fell asleep less than 30 minutes into it.  Ok, this shouldn't be insulting--it's a normal occurance when we rent movies after cooking at home and staying in for the evening--but, since I saw the entire thing, it was an omen in retrospect.I have to agree with some of the user comments I've read thus far--this is the type of film you almost feel obligated to ""get"" lest you sacrifice your intellect in mixed company.  But, if I have to work that hard to get something, I have to wonder if it was worth getting to begin with. 
I'm also troubled by the fact that I don't want to reveal any spoilers, yet don't know what would classify as one given there isn't much to report.  I get the fact that they're bored.  I get the fact that they can't sleep.  I get the fact that they find one another in a hotel that they are staying in, that (given that they're in a foreign country like Japan) they should have tons to say to one another because they share a common language, but, they chose instead to say very little to one another--communicating in this ""higher way"" of comfortable silence and understated bonding.  Is that what I'm supposed to get?  Yeah...I think that's about it really.  People have been calling this a ""love story,"" but, I didn't get that.  I know I've been in a foreign country, met fellow Americans or English speaking travellers, bonded with them, hung out with them, promised to keep in touch when leaving, and have never heard from them since--with equal non-effort on my part.  That's kind of what I thought it was.I guess I wouldn't worry too much if you're one of those viewers who feels stupid for not walking away from this film changed or emotionally enlightened.  Those who go into this film with that in mind surely will, or will watch it a thousand times until they do.  Those, like me, who just wanted to see Bill Murray--who I love--in a role that was nominated for an Oscar after years of good work got what they were after, too.

Its beautiful is in its simplicity, in the little details and the silent scenes that show the loneliness of the main characters.Bill Murray and Scarlet Johanssen are perfect, solo or together.

Sofia Coppola shows that she learned very well with her ""daddy"", directing with kindness and sweetness, and writing to touch everybody's hearts.It's not a comic movie.

You also need to identify with either Bill Murrays mid life crisis or Scarlett Johansson 'just out of college' lack of direction.

A desire 'to be found' is also essential!If the above is a good description of you then you will probably find this a very intelligent, subtle and enjoyable movie. If on the other hand you are lucky enough to be completly happy with yourself, your marriage, your work, your future and your life in general, then you will probably find this to be rather slow at best and boring at worst.I was somewhere in middle (found it a bit slow, but very subtle) and will probably watch LIT again in 20 years to see how I react to it then.The movie certainly accomplished what it tried to accomplish but is certainly not for everyone but at some point in everyones life it will probably be for them!",Lost in Translation

It is the most beautiful piece of art I have ever seen.The story is that two Americans, one a fading actor from the 70's and the other a newlywed Yale philosophy student meet in Tokyo and become friends. But before that happens they feel either lonely, isolated and probably a little confused. When they realize what a friendship it is, they do more and more together, but their time is running out. It all builds up to the movies extremely satisfying conclusion.The best scenes are kind of like a series of beautiful character studies to themselves. They are; The beginning where Bob wakes up in the car, Charlotte walking through Shibuya, Charlotte gazing out the window, Charlotte on the subway,The night club scene, Charlottes trip to Kyoto, Charlies house, and the amazing ending.First of all, the acting is fantastic. Murray and Johanssen perfectly portray Bob and Charlotte, both performances ringing Oscar. Bob is a funny and heartfelt character, Charlotte is a captivating emotional and beautiful gem of a character. A++ for acting.Another aspect of the movie, in which it would be nothing without is the music. The music stands out here and basically plays a part in the film. The opening music, the subway music, the Shibuya music, the nightclub music, the strip club music, the Kyoto music. Many of it is done wonderfully by Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine, and the ending music beautifully chosen, The Jesus and Mary Chain.The amazing, breathtaking scenery out of windows, on trains and in the city plays a crucial part as well.

They inadvertently find each other in a hotel bar in Tokyo, as Charlotte is left alone by her jet-setting photographer husband, and Bob struggles to get through his $2m dollar contract to promote various products with a sense of humour. Although attracted to each other, their growing feelings are not based on lust, rather on mutual respect and understanding. Key scenes in the film display this brilliantly - from Charlotte smiling innocently at Bob in the hotel lift, to Bob tenderly caressing Charlotte's foot in one of the most character-revealing moments in the film.Bill Murray well deserved his Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a fading film star - a part extremely close to home, perhaps, given his somewhat fading status himself before this film. Johansson gives a sophisticated, heart-breaking performance of 25-year old Charlotte, with a maturity far beyond her real-life 18 years at the time of filming. Her face is one, for some reason or another, you simply have to watch.Murray and Johansson have amazing chemistry. At times, they only need to look at each other to communicate how they're feeling - in fact, they don't converse that much at all. This is refreshing in a day and age when communication is so impersonal - we rush off a quick phone call, we punch in a text, we fire off an e-mail; when do we just stop, and look into someone's eyes? This theme is made all the more poignant by the surroundings of Tokyo: in a land of technology and new inventions, Bob and Charlotte's quiet inter-play is played out against a background of innovative architecture, flashing lights, and natives enthusiastically absorbed in the latest noisy gadgets.Some critics and viewers have claimed there is no definitive plot to Lost in Translation. This is perhaps true, but what can be more real, or more plot-inspiring, than human nature? Bob and Charlotte's subtle exchanges are worth ten explosions in some of the more mindless action films. However nor is this a typical will they/won't they rom-com fare - although there are some comedic moments interspersed with serious concepts, LIT doesn't fit neatly into any genre.Writer and Director Sofia Coppola has created something very special here, and something as close to perfection as a film can be. The imagery is breath-taking and the score perfectly apt. The unpredictable ending will break your heart, and you'll want to watch this film again and again - though you may not quite be able to put your finger on why.

Lost in Translation (2003) is a progressive example of a ""Stealth Chick Movie"", a term on Internet postings for a film that a guy would enjoy seeing on his own, but takes his girlfriend or wife because it'll make him look sensitive.  The oldest use I found for this term was for Muriel's Wedding (1994).There is a similar theme that seems to have a lot to do with the remarkable guy-friendliness of these two films: these aren't the typical romantic stories that provide an example of love and relationships.  Instead, both explore love and relationships as concepts, asking thought-provoking questions about what love is and is not, what does and doesn't qualify as a relationship. Lost in Translation (2003) depicts a contemporary, not-quite-improper relationship among two people for whom such a psuedorelationship seems to be what they need and want.  I won't be more specific for fear of spoiling the film.

The completely unbelievable premise of a sad-sack, whiskey-soaked Murray and his troubled 18-year old co-star forging a bond that ultimately comes close (but doesn't get there, thankfully) to sexual is made worse by obviously inexperienced direction, a cliche-riddled script and slower-than-molasses pacing.

708,w00die,Surprising Favorite,10,4 February 2010,I don't generally buy DVD's but I bought this one. I've watched it a number of times now. I can't really put my finger on it but the movie seems to stir some kind of feeling inside me. I'm middle aged similar to the protagonist in this movie. I think it's the ideas that excite me. Being famous. Being paid lots of money. Dealing with mundane issues in life. Dealing with romance. Dealing with boredom. Dealing with middle age. Dealing with middle age sex. Dealing with a wife. Dealing with a mid-life crisis. How to have fun over 45. The comedy of life. The tragedy of life. The excitement of youth. The unbearableness of youth. This movie hits on everything I experience in a poignant way. I don't really know if the people that made the movie thought about all that or not. I doubt they did. But they got out of the way of life and let it spill out onto the film. And I connected with it at all levels. I am very much like Bill Murray and I really think Scarlett Johansson is a fantastic actress. It ranks in my top 10 ever.,Lost in Translation
709,rajin22,Spot on,9,3 March 2004,"People who think Lost in Translation lacks beginning and ending have not understood what Sofia Coppola tried (and in my opinion she succeeded in an excellent way) to do. We are allowed to see a short timeframe of these two persons lifes, and how their lifes have been or what they might evolve in is left to our imagination although we get enough clues. We see only what we have to see. That's the strength of this movie.Beautiful, romantic, funny and realistic without getting cynical, this film is an exceptional character study which steers with ease between comedy and drama. Murray is excellent. Nothing is overdone. Good dialogues. Great last scene in which we don't hear what Bill Murray whispers in her ear. Well timed kiss. Most of the things people who didn't like Lost in Translation write I disagree with. Maybe you need some sort of a recognition with events out of your own life. I think people who traveled a lot might relate to certain situations better or at least understand what the director tried to say. Japan in this respect is 'the world -or life- itself'.

And there's a natural beauty and delivery in her performance that makes Scarlett Johansson one of the brightest up-and-comers!

But, so was my trip to the grocery store, but I didn't chose to make a movie out of that. Actually, maybe there's an Oscar in it if I do.The main problem I had with it was, it's just not entertaining.  Not particularly funny, not deep in terms of character or plot, and just not engaging.  A fish out of water movie star from America crosses paths with another fish out water American.  They check out Japanese night life, talk about the ups and downs of being married, and check out some more bars.  And there's some marginal comic hijinx along the way.  It's a romance where the lead characters don't sleep together, and for that it should be applauded. It's an original approach, but the problem is, it's still a dreary, uninspired meandering character piece, WHICH IRONICALLY, only has superficial characterizations.  Hell, even some Hollywood action movies layer their characters more deeply.  I'm left with a kind of vacuous feeling.  So much of the writing felt like filler.

Having lived in Japan, half of the people who learn about my travels ask me if I've seen this film. It is a popular film to like among philosophers and travelers alike, going against the mainstream Hollywood bang.

716,cobrasixtysix,"This is ""Real Cinema""....you need to see this!",10,16 December 2011,"The movie starts out framed in the bustling backdrop of Tokyo where Bob (Murray) a famous but disenchanted actor is contracted to do a whiskey commercial. It seems Bob doesn't know any of the local language, so any social interaction without an interpreter is impossible. Charlotte(Scarlett Johansson) a neglected wife of two years and recent graduate of philosophy is staying in the same hotel as Bob, with her photographer husband John (Giovanni Ribisi). Bob and Charlotte first meet in the hotel lift with just a glance and a smile and although they soon went their respective ways, this is the pivotal moment where their souls would be bound forever. For their own reasons Bob and Charlotte have difficulty sleeping, so they restlessly start moving about the Hotel at night. Soon they start bumping into each other in the Hotel's corridors and bars in their quest to still their minds, seemingly in an attempt to break away from some hidden shackles of their lives. It's during these encounters that Bob and Charlotte begin to share their life's stories and become friends. They begin arranged nightly excursions together around the social districts of Tokyo, roaming the streets, going to clubs and parties and even a strip joint. The pair shares many endearing moments of tenderness, awkwardness, confusion and fear as they try to come to terms with their mutual attraction despite the age difference. In time, it becomes evident that they had stirred each other's long denied desires, for purpose, to be wanted, heard and appreciated. Each time they meet, the tension is so powerful, unbearable even, like their gulping for air and you will be to. All they really wanted to do was embrace each other and never let go, but they resist. Eventually as they are lying in bed together (talking) after a night out, she curls up next to bob and starts to go to sleep; her foot just barely touching his hip. After a time, Bob (although in fear of overstepping)tentatively allows his hand to rest on it and is relieved that the gesture is accepted. This film is absolutely loaded with subtle yet powerful human emotion that really ""gets in"". Coppola truly displays her cinematic mastery as she captivates the audience with her unmatched story telling skills. The acting isn't credible, it's ""incredible"" and so deeply immersive; to the point you feel it's not acting at all, that it's ""really"" real. I found myself wracked with emotion at their dilemma and how it would ultimately unfold. This is a very poignant and emotionally stirring film something akin to the calibre of ""The Notebook"" I will not soon (if ever) forget.You definitely need to see this film, Amazing!Special thanks to my friend ""Classylady_73"" for recommending I watch this",Lost in Translation

Before I go on let me just say that I actually didn't give the Acting and Visuals an F, but rather a D. What kept the Acting at a D was Bill Murray, cute Scarlet Johansson, and not enough screening time-Giovanni Ribisi. The fact the movie was filmed with a regular camera and not a cam-corder kept it at a D for visuals. As far as the Story and Direction, this movie felt like it didn't really have too much which didn't give the actors much to work with and denoted the Acting to a D. Now what angers me is that almost every critics Ive read from loved this movie and I mean loved it, 4 stars etc. I am disgusted with how critics love movies that bore the hell out of me and when it comes to movies that keep my interest they try and find whatever flaw they can but yet can't with a movie like this, such as boring as hell!!!!

I simply thought this movie tried to be too artsy and self-important for it's own good.  It's not a thought that struck me at first as everything about this film is done so subtley. Bill Murray himself doesn't disppoint, he did a great job in this film.  A picture says a thousand words and so many of his expressions were just priceless.  However the chemistry between his character and Charlotte was simply non-existant in my opinion.  They had no interaction, they had no life altering discussions, their relationship amounted to the same value of two people staying up late getting drunk and discussing the world.

720,superferb,An in-your-face subtle movie...,3,16 August 2013,"What happens in this movie? A guy from the US stays in a Tokyo Hotel. He's alone. A much younger girl, also from the US, stays their too. She's alone too. They meet. They become friends. They fall in love. Eventually they part. Now what's the subtext of all this? Two people, alienated from their lovers and the meaning of their lives, meet and find a soul-mate in each other. Convention and duty keep them from becoming lovers, and they part.Compare both statements... abracadabra: They are the same. It's purest on-the-nose writing, mistaken for *subtlety*. Not only by large parts of the audience, obviously, but by the director herself, too, i'm afraid. But in fact, it's the direct opposite of subtlety. Subtlety is when themes of maturity and sexual obsession lurk underneath a fast-paced action plot (just a random example, that comes to mind...). Here, everything the camera shows us is exactly what it's all about. So no, sorry, no *subtlety* here.Yes, the cinematography is nice here, but without a story to support it, any aesthetic quality will wear off, quickly. Every time. This is a constant in cinema, no, an axiom. Aesthetics are good to transport meaning, to enrichen it, resonate it, or contradict it. But in cinema, they can never *make* a movie, and any attempt to do so will lead to a movie that is disenchanted by multiple viewings. Or by years passing by, changing taste and deadening the audience against exhausted aesthetic stimuli.So, even though with about 108 minutes, Lost In Translation isn't a long film by today's standards, it gets boring. You're desperately starving for something to happen. Turns. Sparks. Meaningful dialogue. Anything. You know, i get it. It is about that nothing really has meaning. That you can't make a connection. But again, that is trivial. There's nothing underneath, especially nothing that would be cinematic in nature. For the cinema, the natural narrating mode is ACTION. And you know so well that i don't mean explosions... just simple action like how Bob is slipping onto that bed, close to Charlotte, where they watch TV. The way he does it. How he moves. How does she react to that? How does she move? Coppola denies as any bit of real dramatic action that could very well be in this movie. Going against the grain because she wants to, and because she can.Many say it makes them think, but i disagree. Rather, the whole movie feels like getting breastfed with a certain, rather limited spectrum of emotions. It tries very hard to hammer this one point home, and this makes it upsetting. ""I do get it! On with the story, please!"" you wanna shout at the screen. For example, all the background music playing in bars and karaoke boxes ALWAYS shouts the subtext of that respective scene right in your face. Very poor, and grossly underestimating the intellectual capacities of us viewers.I think Bill Murray is one of the great actors of our time, and the scenes of Bob's shootings clearly showcase his craft. In fact, i'm absolutely convinced that in many scenes, Murray actually felt just as flabbergasted by Coppola as Bob does so in the movie by that Japanese director character. He clearly needs more SUBTEXT, but there just is none... so naturally, he somehow has to act out these stiff scenes, somehow make the presumably right facial expression to non-existent content. If he's not up to his usual heights, it's obviously not his fault but due to a weak, shallow, and mostly pointless script.Same goes for Scarlett Johannson. Her character doesn't make a lot of sense, and is a mostly soulless composite of superficial characterization and some backstory (college degree...). I urge anyone who complains about her performance to act a person that ""just doesn't know. anything"" within a plot that doesn't move. Anywhere. It is impossible, and almost an insult to the actor. Also, i don't know what all the running around in underwear was supposed to accomplish. I mean yes, i got a hunch, but i'm actually too scared to write it down. A danggit here it is: ""Ah, ain't i a gorgeous little chick don't you think.. But so lost.. i'm really lost.. Shouldn't you love me for that shouldn't you?.. But hey don't get gross here please, i mean it's about u know i'm cute u know.. Not that sex thing you jerk.. Or maybe a little?.. Aaarghhh, i don't know myself.. i really don't..""After all, i did somehow enjoy watching this movie and seeing Bill Murray in a different kind of role. Also, i do think it is always a good idea to put Johannson on film in her youth. She is one of the most beautiful woman on this planet. Some scenes are interesting, even worth remembering. But overall, the story is lacking so hard that i can't imagine re-watching this except for educational reasons (e.g. how to NOT write a screenplay). Five stars minus one for the nepotism you're smelling a mile away, minus another one for not getting that one ""pre- climactic"" close-up of Johannson in focus = 3 stars.",Lost in Translation

Then again, this film is the work of a wealthy, very very lucky woman who only had a chance in the film industry through blatant nepotism. The ending product is exactly what people must expect from someone like her.Tokyo Japan is an illustrious, breathtaking world class city with its very own character. Anyone in this would want to try out different cultures can enjoy the city without having to team up with someone of their kind. Only completely miserable bigots that need therapy will not enjoy the city as tourists. It is more than an aesthetically pleasing tourist trap, as the film implies. If Bob and Charlotte were believable, enlightened creatures, they wouldn't need each other to appreciate the city and life itself. In the ending it absolutely astounds me as to why a Yale grad with a philosophy degree can't even figure out what to do with her life (law school?), and why the old timer couldn't just retire if what he did made him miserable. I only pitied Charlotte's husband, who actually had a direction in life and true passion, yet got married too soon; and Japanese people from around the world for being mocked in a film that gained subsequent accolades.The movie's concept is a great idea, but when you stick the main characters in a real city and treat it like Alientown, it doesn't work, and even seems borderline racist.

725,andiam123,A minority opinion,3,20 November 2003,"I'm sorry, but I can't join the groundswell of praise for this film. I couldn't wait for it to be over. It was supposed to be a tender love story, but I never saw any real chemistry between the two lead characters. What this pretty young woman sees in this washed-up actor is beyond me. The dialogue never really establishes any chemistry between the two lead characters. As for the actors, I give it a split decision. Bill Murray gives a one-note performance as a bored middle-aged man. He reminds me of his character in the first half of ""Groundhog Day,"" without the growth we see later in the film. I had the feeling he was as bored as the character he portrays. Scarlet Johanssen, on the other hand, rises above her mediocre material. She gets visibly more attractive as the film progresses. I wonder why the director--a woman--seemed so obsessed with Charlotte's body. She spends a lot of time in her underwear. The opening scene--a prolonged view of her backside covered by nearly transparent panties--seems there for titillation only. (For that matter, why do the two of them meet in a strip joint? Just to show off some Japanese woman's physique?) Also, the film is condescending toward the Japanese. Do we want to tell the Japanese that this is how we view them? Granted, some of the satire is directed at the Americans. When the hospital clerk assumes that they speak Japanese, this seems to be a satiric comment on the way Americans assume that everyone speaks English if we speak slowly and loudly enough. But it seems we are intended to sympathize with the ""poor"" Americans instead of laughing at their ineptness at confronting a foreign culture.",Lost in Translation

727,BertMacklin_9,once in a lifetime...,10,2 May 2011,"Sofia Coppola's ""lost in translation"" is a beautiful film. Everything about it is just so great. Its about an againg actor Bob Harris (Bill Murray), an actor out of his prime, not sure about life, about to shoot a commercial in Tokyo for whiskey. Bill Murray amazed me when I saw this film. I really didn't know that he could have this type of emotional range. Bob Harris is a character similar to Bill Murray, but Bill Murray makes his character so original, funny, and likable. Bob eventually meets a young woman named Charlotte (played by Scarlett Johanson). Like Bob, Charlotte is a person not sure of their life, and what they want to be. Charlotte tags along with her husband, who she jumped into a marriage with, while he shoots a music video in Tokyo. Scarlett Johanson really defined herself as an actress here. She got snubbed for Best Actress at the Oscars (she wasn't even nominated). She is a very curious woman stuck in a glass cage, wanting to discover life, then she eventually does when she meeets Bob.The story is very simplistic, but the dialog is so masterful that its entertaining at all times. Sofia Coppola is a great artist. Her screenpplay earned her an Oscar, which was very much deserved. Its full of realistic and thought-provoking dialog, and funny written parts, and its just a great screenplay. Sofia Coppola is an equally great director as a writer. She is a much more art house, independent director. She has an always moving camera, steadily moving though, and uses beautiful placement in her scenes. I love the part where Charlotte is looking out the window. The camera starts on her, then moves to the window, looking out onto the massive metropolis of Tokyo, and you really feel what she is feeling. The part where Bob is in the hot tub talking to his wife on the phone is another part where it just ties you in so much. And I don't know, the whole film is a poetic and beautiful work of art. And lastly the ending. For sure one of the best endings ever. (SPOILER!) Bob goes to say goodbye to Charlotte while she is walking around, then Bob whispers something to her, and you can't exactly hear it. It was such an impressive technique there. It really made you see how close they were, and whatever they said, its between them. And then right after, the two hug and kiss, and you see tons of people walking around them, but you're focusing directly on Bob and Charlotte, because there, is where so much heart and emotion is. Either way, great film.",Lost in Translation
728,Cryogenic,Absorbing,10,27 April 2006,"Sofia Coppola chooses to open her second picture with the unexpected appearance of Scarlett Johansson's semi-naked buttocks. On the big screen, it's impressive, and on any other screen, it manages to entice. But this is just the beginning. In many ways, it doesn't even seem that. The image is seductive but dislocated -- it's just there. Then the title credit appears: ""Lost In Translation"". It's like Coppola is having some massive joke at our expense. What's there to translate about such a sight -- much less to lose in translation? We're immediately intrigued by the voyeuristic nonchalance of it. It is this same casualness, hiding real intent, that shapes and sustains the picture. For at its heart, ""Lost In Translation"" is a hypnotic tone poem for desire and the need to reach out and find meaning. The butt-image functions as a motif: in the bold sensuousness, yet comic randomness of it, we are being made to lust for something -- but we are at a loss to make sense of it, just as the film's characters find themselves lusting for things they can't readily define.So begins our journey. ""Lost In Translation"" unfolds with a jazzy rhythm and soft-spoken sultriness beyond the capacity of words. This is cinema as water, as smoke and as ether. Coppola positions her camera as if capturing real events for the first time. You rarely, if ever, get the sense that anything has been staged. So skilled is Coppola at doing so that it becomes easy to take it for granted. But this dreamy documentary style has also alienated some. While there is a plot at work, the film makes no concessions to big dramatic flourishes or rousing set pieces (or even memorable dialogue). Fortunately, for those that understand and appreciate Coppola's schemata, this is all to her and her film's credit. Lance Acord's photography, in being nothing short of stunning, ably assists her. Light and colour are mixed like a soothing beverage in every scene. ""For happy times, make it Suntory times"", Murray smoothly intones, and the photography never fails to provide a visual equivalent. The sound design is also exceptional. When Murray's character receives a fax, you can hear every click and whir; when he shuts off a TV, that familiar yet subtle dimming of the phosphor can be made out; when Murray enters a lift, we can hear every mechanism and every rush of air as it transports him from one four-walled maze to another.But, if that's all the film had to offer, it would generate no meaning, no heart, no soul. It is the brilliant performances of Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray that carry the film through. Scarlett Johansson plays your ""average"" girl with classical movie star looks. Bill Murray literally is a movie star, comically trapped in an extended jetlag; a sleepy haze; a passive-aggressive nightmare he can't snap out of. He's never been funnier. Even his character's commonplace names, ""Bob"" and ""Harris"", suggest a man cruelly fated to reach this misanthropic point in life. But both characters, despite their rich backgrounds and self-absorbed natures, are also achingly human: their quiet dilemma, a primal scream from their insides that's already reduced to silence by the time it reaches their outsides, gives the film texture and intrigue. We're involved with them. We care about them. We connect to them. There are moments of incredible honesty from both. We can see that when Charlotte tells her husband that she loves him, she really does mean it. But Bob's allegiances are initially harder to suss. Watch after he carries Charlotte back to her room. He hesitates at the door for a moment -- should he stay? Later on, when the two are sat alone in a strange inner-city apartment, Bob sheepishly looks to his side, as if contemplating whether to initiate something with Charlotte or not. Yet in Bob's subsequent conversation with Charlotte on the bed, in spite of his later sexual liaison, we can tell that he, like Charlotte, truly loves his significant other.One interesting thing in all of this: obnoxious charges of racism have been levelled. But such charges are crude slurs against the film's beautiful tapestry. Its concerns are profoundly human ones, and in every such case, the sharp square peg of racism cannot fit into the circular hole of reality. ""Lost In Translation"" laments the fact that these characters are lost amidst such a dazzling culture, just as it laments and pokes fun at the culture that's at least partially responsible for causing their alienation. Thus, we have one of several meanings for the title. Another might be that being lost is a scary thing: the film tenderly juxtaposes the uniqueness of individuals against a sea of noise (as in the magnificent shot of Charlotte looking out of her window onto the city). We're all unique -- but how easy it is to forget that or lose touch of the ones we love in such a vast and impersonal world? On a broader level, of course, ""Lost In Translation"" also refers to the notion of needing a true simpatico for communication. This is not a single-layered or one-sided motion picture by any stretch of the imagination.A review of this film wouldn't be complete without a few remarks on the soundtrack. None of the songs, save the literal karaoke renditions, are particularly striking or conventional -- but they achieve something greater by seeming to glide across the screen, momentarily giving us a lift, and then disappearing again, like Charlotte and Bob first spotting each other and raising smiles, before walking off, in that crowded elevator. This is cinema that doesn't need nor want to shout -- it glances and whispers. Even the simple white credits have a serenity and fade on and off like the flickering lights of Tokyo or the moods of the people we're being shown. Nothing jars. Everything meshes. This is a quiet masterpiece.",Lost in Translation

Instead, thinks to an inside track and a star with a name, this movie created more buzz and acclaim than was due anyone who worked on it.There was little to no dialogue, and most of the best lines appear to be spur of moment quips from Bill Murray and nothing more. The movie was unsatisfactory in every area imaginable, from dialogue and story line to cinematography and directing. I was left pondering why this movie got any recognition whatsoever.Before I actually saw the movie was I cheering for Sophia as the only female director getting any recognition, which was unusual especially for her age. I ended up wishing that this was not the movie and she was not the director who was getting this recognition, since it was so undeserved.Having said that, this was not a complete waste of film, it was good for what it was, a first film. It wasn't genius, in fact I have yet to meet anyone who actually liked it or found it interesting. And based on the commentary it has received, the only people who liked it and found it interesting were those who had been to Japan and really enjoyed the culture there.To conclude, we should give this film the credit it deserves and nothing more. As someone who has seen several first films done by college filmography majors, that's where this film belongs. The only thing that differentiates this film is a slightly larger budget and better access to equipment and stars. The only credit it deserves is as a nice first film done at a freshman level, with a note by the teacher saying there are some promising things in this movie to work with, but it has a long way to go before it should ever be nominated for any award much less an Oscar.",Lost in Translation
730,fpbaggia,The art of conversation,9,5 February 2004,"Here is a a film where characters actually talk and listen like actual human beings, and is worthy of all the accolades it has received. The chemistry and connection that the two leads have is completely unforced.Bill Murray, and the (oscar shunned!!!) Scarlett Johannson forge an affection that stems from their total disconnect from their current culture. The only time the movie meanders is during the middle sections when the Murray and Johannson characters are out on the town with her friends. Who are they? None of them are developed, but this is a minor quibble in an otherwise superb look at a budding friendship and possibly more. There is an open ended finale that will leave viewers with a couple of possible outcomes. The virgin suicides and now this, Sofia Coppola is a new voice in the women's arena,certainly one to keep an eye on.",Lost in Translation
731,madpenguin41,"Sweet, sad, gorgeous",10,24 August 2004,"In a word, stunning. Bob and Charlotte are Americans in Tokyo. Much of the movie is atmospheric and devoted to giving the viewer the feeling of being lost and horribly out of place. Indeed, that's certainly the way Bob and Charlotte seem to feel. However, that out-of-place feeling runs much deeper for them than simply being strangers in a strange land, unable to communicate with virtually everyone around. The setting serves as both the wake-up call and the parallel to the deeper lost feeling which plagues them, that of being lost within their own lives. In a person's familiar homeland, it is so easy to draw superficial parallels between oneself and observed strangers, perhaps ignoring a glaring difference. However, in a strange land where the person is completely unfamiliar with the culture and the lifestyle, it is hard to attempt to make any connection whatsoever to people observed. Those people seem to be comfortable, if not happy. They're fairly content, situated in their lives. Some even seem to have a spiritual balance. Yet, both Bob and Charlotte don't feel they have any of this. They don't know what they want out of life, but they know they don't have it. Their lives are empty, and the drastic change in their surroundings makes them realize, probably for the first time, how terribly lonely it feels to live in a world where every other person seems to be able to make sense of life, while they can't. As I said, many of the scenes in the film are simply atmospheric. Others serve to reveal great depths about the characters. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are stunning in such scenes. Without speaking, both manage to allow the audience a peak inside these characters by simply reacting to what they observe. The best example is when Charlotte watches a wedding from afar. Her gaze betrays so much her idealized perception of how beautiful marriage can be, but mostly her mournfulness that her own marriage is so distant from that. Other short scenes are comedic. Sure, some of them don't really serve to move the story forward, but Ms. Coppola is smart enough to know that tender laughter goes down so smooth with such a large dose of melancholia. Murray provides most of the laughs here, particularly in the scenes where he shoots his whiskey ads. A night out on the town with resident friends of Charlotte also provides some lighter moments, including a toy-laser gun chase out of a club and down the streets. This takes us into a karaoke scene, in which countless things happen. The overall partying and drunken renditions of songs is fun and hilarious. However, it's also here that the bond between Bob and Charlotte really begins to grow. The musical selections also are interesting in terms of what's going on between the two characters. From an audience standpoint, the scene is particularly noteworthy for Johansson's rendition of the Pretender's classic 'Brass in Pocket'. She is a goddess and here she creates what may be the sexiest sixty seconds in film ever.Speaking of music, it plays a crucial role in this movie. The song choices throughout, underscore both the melancholy and the ethereal elements of the film. The strongest selection, though, has to be MBV's 'Sometimes' which plays as the cab takes the very drunken Bob and Charlotte through the city and back to their hotel on their night out. The visuals of the bright city lights passing by through the car window are an amazing visual for the song, just as the song perfectly captures the feel of the entire film.Of course, the relationship between Bob and Charlotte gradually grows, resulting in the film's very few multi-minute scenes. These scenes stand out boldly from the very short snippets that make up more than half the film, and for good reason. The night-out segment is lengthy, and very important. It builds the foundation for the couple's relationship. The centerpiece of the film, then, has to be the conversation the two have on Bob's bed late one night. Here the theme of loneliness and discontent is laid out plainly. 'Does it ever get any easier?' asks Charlotte, without assigning any specific subject to her 'it'. 'No. (pause) Yes,' replies Bob. Perfect.Within several days these two make each other feel things they never knew they could feel and have things they never even knew they wanted. Certainly, both are unhappy with their marriages, yet one of the great accomplishments of the film is making the audience sympathetic to that unhappiness without condescending to either of the spouses. Of course, such good things must end eventually. The goodbye is gut-wrenching. Never before has the closing of an elevator door wreaked such havoc on my psyche. Of course, that isn't the finale. Bob finds Charlotte again, but the way that scene is handled is just too perfect to spoil here. Suffice it to say it stays very true to the spirit of the film: sad, yet hopeful against all odds.I love 'Lost in Translation'. However, I can't really recommend this movie to everyone. For those who need hugely dramatic moments in their movies and themes that are explicitly stated, this is the wrong choice. This film is for the open-minded, for those who appreciate subtlety, for those who obsess over how the small details in life affect everything. It isn't hard to admire the craft and beauty of this film and to be generally entertained by it. However, the emotions portrayed in it feel so personal that it's probably hard to LOVE this movie without really relating to it. Don't worry. NOT relating to it can't be a bad thing. It probably means you're well-adjusted, somewhat content, and at least have some clue what it is you want out of life. For the rest of us though, this film absolutely means everything. Score: 10/10",Lost in Translation
732,Sarie26,"Not bad for Sofia, not the best of the year",9,31 March 2004,"Lost in Translation was hailed by many critics as the best film of the year, and Sofia Coppola's direction as the biggest cinematic achievement of 2003. I do not agree with those claims. However, I did find Lost in Translation a beautiful, touching, sad film that quietly exposed us to the struggle within all people to find happiness, plain and simple.We spend our hour and forty-five minutes (which do sometimes feel a bit longer than that) with Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and pretty much no one else. Bob is a has-been sort of movie star, filming some ads for liquor in Japan, and Charlotte is visiting the country with her husband John(Giovanni Ribisi), an up-and-coming photographer. Both of them are unhappy. And for the first part of the film, Coppola pretty much bombards us with images of their unhappiness. Bob sits around in a daze watching Japanese tv or drinking in the hotel bar. Charlotte sits around in a daze in her hotel room window or drinking with her husband and Kelly (Anna Farris), the very annoying young starlet who's also staying in the hotel. Life sucks. Sigh.This would all be really bad if it weren't for Sofia's wonderful knack for catching emotion through cinematography, music, and facial expressions. She saves it - but barely. It's almost too much. A great set of scenes featuring Bill Murray at photo and commercial shoots helps ease the boredom.Once the two meet, the movie becomes interesting, if fairly predictable. The two have a unique chemistry that is beautiful, not creepy (thank God, because I honestly was worried that it would be). They develop a fast friendship and the movie takes a turn for the more interesting. The good things? Bill and Scarlett are both great actors. The bad things? Not much happens. This movie has no plot. So don't look for one, it's not there. It is simply a character study - and they don't change much. They mostly just talk about how they feel and how unhappy they are - but that doesn't really change throughout the film.I'm probably making it sound like a bad movie. It's not. It's pretty interesting. But a few things are clear. 1) Sofia is not a dialogue goddess. Part of the reason her first film, The Virgin Suicides, is better is because Sofia wrote a narration that carries the film so the dialogue (which, again, there is not much of) does not have to. There is no narration in this film (nor could there be) so we're stuck with Sofia and her mediocre and very thin dialogue. 2) This movie was written for Bill Murray. And he's great in it. But is he the best actor of the year, you ask? No way. Because at the end of the day, he's just a more sad and emotional facet of the same old Bill we know (and love, yes, we do love him) - but he's no Sean Penn. Not now, not ever. Scarlett is the one with the real talent, and though it's there in this movie, she was not slighted for not being nominated for awards for this film - she's better in Girl With A Pearl Earring anyway.3) The critics of the world always want a small indie film to praise and exalt each year. This year, rather than In America or Whale Rider (both infinitely better films) they chose Lost in Translation - and I'll tell you why. Because it's directed by up-and-coming and certainly talented FEMALE director Sofia. Yes, Whale Rider was also directed by a woman - but her last name is Caro, not Coppola. And if the Academy's gonna notice a woman's film, you can bet your ass they're gonna go for a name like Coppola...it somehow makes the act of exalting a woman's film a little easier to swallow.So my take? Lost in Translation is lovely, but sort of pointless. Go rent The Virgin Suicides to see Sofia at her best.8/10",Lost in Translation
733,arigel,"Some good, some bad, all-in-all not the movie of the year",6,19 February 2004,"After watching this movie, I had a feeling of confusion.  I thought to myself, ""is this really the great piece of American film work that everyone is talking about?""  Personally, I do not think that this is one of those top 10 movies.  The movie had a very low-key tone that, at times, felt long and boring.  I was a little befuddled about Charlotte and Bob's relationship as by the end as throughout the movie it seems to waver. But its a unique relationship and its a little refreshing to see something a little different, one based on shared boredom and loneliness.  However, its frustrating at the same time because you cannot figure out what direction they are taking next.Besides from that, you can really relate to their loneliness throughout the entire movie.  I had a little added enjoyment because of my experiences in Japanese class where I had to listen to my teacher babble in Japanese and every once in a while speak in broken English.  In this respect I can REALLY relate to the characters.  The background shots of Tokyo are well done and add to the tone of being lost in a crowd and alone.  Also, Bill Murray fits the part of Bob like a glove and was enjoyable to watch.
Although this movie was beautifully made, its not particularly exciting and is in need of some direction as it just feels flat throughout.  I give it 6.5/10 since it was professionally made, but really falls short in terms of a great/interesting story.  Maybe on a second run-through, I might appreciate more things.",Lost in Translation

You never once feel that their relationship is false; all the stiltedness and unease you may remember from liking someone when you first meet them is there. And as they get to know each other the film follows them along at an easy pace.I can understand that some people might be disappointed upon seeing this film, it reveals very little and really goes nowhere.

736,shabulia,Brilliant!,10,14 May 2005,"I usually hate it when I see someone give something a perfect review. Let's face it, most people who do so are what videogamers call ""fanboys"". Maybe I am guilty of this in regards to this movie, but I simply can't help it. This movie is absolutely brilliant. I have never seen a better portrayal of a ""slice of life."" But this movie is so much more. The fact that Bill Murray was beaten at the Oscars is mere politics. He was clearly the better actor. While this is only Ms. Coppola's second venture into directing, it is nothing short of amazing and visionary.What first struck me about the film was the amazing cinematography. The visuals of Tokyo in the second scene are breathtaking. And they don't stop there. The visual flair of this film does such a wonderful job of making you feel right at home in this almost alien existence. Japan is vastly different from the United States and as told in the story, so is it told in the imagery.As for the story, again brilliant. This story is solely told in the characters. These are real people and not cookie cutter performances. You believe their portrayals and find some kind of understanding with them. You can empathize with both Bob Harris (Bill Murrary) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansen) in many ways. If nothing else, you at least get a sense of what it must feel like to be foreigners in such a different world. Beyond that, these are real people who have real problems. And with that, we feel close to them and feel their anxieties. Don't expect to get some kind of closure or big happy ending. This movie ends things like they end in real life. It isn't a tragedy, it isn't cathartic. It just ends.I only wish this film would have come out in a different year. For it to be up against such fierce competition for 2003 was totally unfair. This movie was a sleeper hit and with the build up of the ""Lord of the Rings"" over three years, it was almost unfair to pit it up against such a mammoth undertaking. Regaurdless, as a film, this is the better of the two (or all of the Oscar picks for that matter). I cannot recommend this movie enough.

An adventure film in the city, ""Lost in Translation"" was the contemporary start to the revolution of modern humanistic film-making in 2004, which resembled films like ""Sidways"" and ""The Door in the Floor."" More relative to ""Sidways"" this movie is also good because of the exploration of Japan, exploration of Bill Murray's confusion, and de-sensitized involvement in the characters of Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson.The things that are evolving more so in acting quality and human screenplay in these recent years is the realism of acting, and subtle feelings delivered to viewers.These recent years have shown us that special effects and virtually new films aren't required for cinematic artistry.",Lost in Translation
738,iain_connell,"Not a masterpiece, but very good nevertheless",8,16 February 2005,"Good to see that so many people rate this film highly, in spite of the depressingly familiar reaction from others to what is a deliberately slowly paced study of displacement in an alien environment. Are those who found it boring really so used to fast editing and special effects that they cannot just sit still for ninety minutes ? The irony is that the two central characters find themselves at sea in a culture - modern Japan and Tokyo - which epitomises the very empty garishness that is typical of so much modern film.My problem with Sofia Coppola's film is not that it is boring, or racist (though those with a social-political axe to grind may find it so). It is that the nature of the relationship between Charlotte and Bob is formed mainly out of shared awkwardness and alienation rather than affection, and that Bob's character intimates sexual desire rather than emotional affinity. Apart from in the final sequence, which, tellingly, was improvised rather than scripted, the characters are not allowed to just be with each other; rather, we see them dance around each other's need for connection, without actually connecting. For example, when Bob carries Charlotte to her hotel room, he does not need to look disappointed when she goes to sleep, simply accepting of their age difference. It's not that a physical relationship between them would be offensive, it's just not necessary. (In the strip bar scene they leave after only a few minutes.)The contrast between Charlotte and the blonde movie star, and between Bob's one nighter with the hotel singer and the Bob-Charlotte relationship, is well made and sufficient to tell this tale. Sure, Bob's family and domestic trivia await his return, and Charlotte has been left to her own devices; but that's no reason for a full-blown affair, and the understated - until the last scene - affection between them is what carries the film.My other problem with the film is Bill Murray himself. Perhaps it's that I never have liked him much, but I think it's more that he is, simply, being himself - or, rather, Bill Murray playing Bill Murray. So we get his typical facial grimaces and expressions, put to good use in the ironical and comic whisky commercial sequence. We see only the Bill Murray that we know, rather than a Bob that the actor might have been allowed to create.So, a sensitively and beautifully shot portrayal of a putative relationship in a foreign culture. Scarlett Johansson is clearly destined for very great things, still and self-aware beyond her years, and Bill Murray will have done himself no harm by this self-portrayal. Ms Coppola has created a controlled and individual work with talent compounded of experience (instigated by her father ?) and observational skill. A pity that the surface of the film, typified in the title shot of Ms Johansson's prone behind, is at variance with its centre.",Lost in Translation
739,reece-beale,Brilliant acting and screen writing coming together as one.,8,23 January 2015,"The underlying theme of this film is loneliness. Charlotte (played by Johansson) can be seen in the foreground of shots that put her against the background of the city, showing just how small and on her own she really is. Bob (played by Murray) can be seen walking around with a look that can be only described as emptiness on his face, even as a movie star, you never see anyone really care about him before Charlotte enters the picture. Coppola does a good job of hitting this theme and setting up these characters, while both actors give performances that compliment the story.The story was excellently written and showed the compelling relationship between the two characters in Japan. The progression of the relationship from simple to complicated (as Bob foreshadows when he talks about marriage becoming more complicated earlier in the film) is emotionally effective as you know it's going to have to reach it's inevitable end and the ambiguous nature of the whisper leaves the audience questioning whether Bob will stay or leave Japan.I didn't give the movie a higher rating because it started off very slowly and there was no real character or story development for the first half an hour. After about fifteen minutes you get the point and you understood that their both feeling lonely, however you continue to get hit with the point for more time than you need to be. Anna Faris was also badly cast and too over the top to be believable.Overall though, I thought the acting was brilliant, and once the story got going, you really started to care for the characters which is all down to the stellar writing of Coppola.

740,roses_are_red14,Overall: dull,4,23 December 2008,"I had high hopes of this movie, but unfortunately my final impression is that it was dull.The ending had a kind of strange magnificence to it. We've all seen the last minute expression of sentimentality on the way to the airport before, but it was the only moment that really hooked me into the film. Everything in those moments seemed perfect to me, but where was that same level of energy in the rest of the film? In the beginning it seems Coppola is excellent at creating a sense of the deep boredom of her characters, but as the minutes stretch out it becomes apparent to me that she has gone a step too far and bored her audience as well. While the photography in this film is beautiful and the sound design is a wonderful immersion tool, I think the film never quite comes back from one key scene that just doesn't quite hit the spot. Charlotte and Bob's boredom is supposedly broken by a night of great fun, but the fun never reaches as far as the viewer. It was all very well to take us into their boredom, but at this point the feelings of character and audience part ways, only to be reconnected 60 seconds before the cut to black.Perhaps, to be fair, I should say that this is well-made and promising. I just think that a few bad choices at the wrong moments pulled down what could have been a lovely piece of work.",Lost in Translation
741,BeMi21,Soulmates,9,9 June 2014,"When I first watched the film, I was quite disappointed. I expected a complete different and much funnier movie. Some days ago I gave the film a second chance. This time I knew what expected me and what was the movie about, so I watched it with different eyes. And I liked it. The first 30 minutes contain a lot of subtle humor thanks to a great performance by Bill Murray who plays the aging actor Bob Harris and would have deserved an Oscar for it. His facial expressions are absolutely fabulous and made me both laugh and also pity him. His marriage doesn't mean to him what it may have meant 25 years ago: His wife worries about meaningless things like the color of a carpet, the marriage lacks of romantic, words like ""I love you"" aren't spoken or they are spoken without much emotion. In a Japanese hotel Bob meets Charlotte, a young and beautiful woman, who doesn't really know where her life's heading to. She's a graduated philosophy student without a job and is married to a photographer who works during the day and leaves Charlotte alone in her hotel suite. Scarlett Johansson, who is a bit underrated in my opinion, gives a wonderful performance and shows us Charlotte's sadness and feelings of being a bit lost in Japan in a great way. It's almost unbelievable that Johansson wasn't even 18 (but playing a mid-20s) during production. Bob knows how Charlotte feels and he can identify himself with her. The two spend the next days together and Bob seems to feel important for another person the first time in a while and Charlotte meets the first person she can talk to seriously in Japan and who understands her and her fears. The most wonderful thing about the movie is in my opinion, that I'm not really sure if the protagonists were in love or rather something like soulmates who gave security to each other and filled each other's life with emotions like importance, joy and happiness which they haven't felt in a very long time.",Lost in Translation

I'm, not that this matters, but to avert the caustic barbs of those who feel it matters, a certified, genuine, card-carrying genius.I didn't like this movie. At all. In any way, shape, or form. It is not because I am stupid, nor because I don't appreciate the genre. It is because this film is horrible. It features only one redeeming quality, and that is the cinematography of Mr. Acord. The only reason it seems that any critic liked this film is because of a bizarre form of nepotism (a rarity for Hollywood, despite all its other failings) and the fact that it has a certain underbelly pop-girl indie-director vibe to it that makes it the trendy, beret-wearing thing du jour.That said, the writing is boring, dry, and pointless. The direction is rigid, the acting more so. Only Murray has a fine performance, and that is more to years of expertise than to a good script. Young Scarlet is drab and morose, as are all the other characters. The soundtrack is unmemorable. And if you've spent about five minutes on the internet, you know that the supposed culture differences of Japan as portrayed on the screen are far, far deeper than shown. What little humour their is seems to be derived from the hateful bitterness of the characters and borderline racism, or at the least spiteful Amerocentric jingoism that seems to infect every fish-out-of-water film made in the past 20 years.I suspect that once more people view this on VHS or DVD, it's score will drop dramatically as the stunning cinematography is lost on the small screen.

Me however I left those sorts of things behind in the 70's.This is the dullest film I have seen in a long long time.
Nothing happens. There is a story there about how a bored wife who has graduated recently is stuck in Tokyo and meets up with a Actor who i couldn't decide wether he wanted an affair or not but was driven to it by the boredom around him. And thats it.As an insight into Japanese life it falls well short of the mark to as I thought that most Japanese people would probably be insulted by the insinuation that they are all business men, game heads or prostitutes who pronounce rip 'lip' (If i said it in the street it would be racist).It took me two attempts to finally watch it all the way through and expecting a big finale I was terribly dissapointed. I got the impression that Sophia Coppola got to make an art house movie on a big budget.

754,smclean,A well-crafted Gem.,9,3 October 2003,"Like with all good films, ""Lost in Translation"" takes some time to find its footing and build an identity. Although that takes approximately an hour (you'll know exactly which scene if you've seen the movie), I found this to be a thoughtful and witty performance. Sofia Coppola avoids the more ridiculous scenarios that tend to unfold in hollywood movies and sticks instead to a story that seems abundantly realistic. I've always felt that a film's true value lies in whether or not it makes you curious when it's over. Some classics for me in this regard are ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Basic instinct"", and most recently ""Signs"". Now I add ""Lost in Translation"" to this exclusive group. Why does Charlotte feel the way she does in the latter third of the movie? her ambiguousness typifies the symbolic contrasts inherent in the story, young and old, man and woman, husband and wife and most broadly America and Japan.        There are so many barriers to happiness in life, so many obstacles that appear incorporeal at times and at others as apparent as brick walls. To me, the heart and soul of this film lies in how it confronts   how lost some of us are in a world dominated by commercialism that seems  both ruthless and overwhelming. This is to take nothing away from Murray  and Johansson who both turn in excellent performances, eccentric and funny  in the former, lonely and yearning in the latter. The cameo award here is  a tie between Yutaka Tadokoro and Giovanni Ribisi. Mr. Tadokoro was hilariously funny as the director going 320 miles per hour and Mr   Ribisi managed, in his limited appearances, to show us just why Charlotte  wasn't Mrs. Happy. Still, throughout the film, I felt myself caring not so much about Charlotte and Bob as individuals caught up in the complicated tangle of relationship purgatory. As well as they were played by the two leading actors, this was almost a movie that could have survived on its own merits, without central characters, like a baffling snapshot taken of cultural migration gone bad meeting early, and mid, life crisis.        Last but not least, was there ever any more of an amusing portrayal of a starlet than Anna Faris? Kelly about killed me. No wonder people in Hollywood have drug problems. I felt myself reaching for my white powder baggy every time she oozed into a scene. Have...to...make...life...mean...something...        Seriously, go see this film, it's amazing. 9/10.

755,lisaoklahoma,Let's see how many analogies I can put in this review,10,9 May 2009,"In ""Lost in Translation,"" Sophia Coppola proves that less really is more. The movie is sparse in every way--sparse in dialogue, sparse in environment, sparse in agenda. Set in Japan, it has the feel of a neatly-trimmed bonsai. Watching ""Lost in Translation"" for the first time, you may get the feeling that nothing is really happening. But that is only because you have been accustomed to movies of a different kind. Most movies are like temperamental little children. They stamp their feet and beg you to love them.""Lost in Translation"" is not like these movies. It is mature, quiet in tone. It never screams but instead flows like a gentle river. And as the undercurrents lap at your feet, you suddenly feel something you have never felt before and know you are in the presence of something indescribably powerful.You might watch ""Lost in Translation"" for the first time with certain assumptions. Forget these assumptions. You'll want to place this movie into some type of category, for the sake of convenience. Don't try. ""Lost in Translation"" resists categorization. It doesn't quite know where to put itself. Put it under ""L,"" for ""Life."" Life doesn't fit into one category either.There is Laughter in this movie. There is also Love. But it isn't the type of Love that runs to you and gives you a long, passionate kiss. This Love stands in the corner shyly, unsure of itself. It is no flamboyant seductress but a young schoolgirl. It is delicate, innocent. It is curiously remarkable.This movie is about unexpectedly being rescued, but not in the conventional way. No evil madmen or deadly situations hold the main characters captive. The enemies here are the enemies each of us face every day--alienation and melancholy. The atmosphere of the film, foreign and cold, exudes these feelings. Only in such an atmosphere could something truly magical occur. And something truly magical does, but only if you have the eyes to see it. If you don't the first time, give it another chance. You owe it to yourself. Because ""Lost in Translation"" is absolutely perfect. And perfection is not something that happens very often.",Lost in Translation

But why did it get all the 4 star ratings from the critics, you may ask. There is a tale, The Emperors New Clothes, in which in exchange for pile gold, two weavers promise an Emperor a new suit of clothes that is invisible to those unfit for their positions, stupid, or incompetent. They only PRETEND to give him new clothes, and since he can't see any thing he does not want to let them know he is stupid, so he just pretends that the clothes are there and beautiful. Then all of the court councilmen feel that they also must pretend that his clothes are wonderful, and it keeps going. Finally when he is on parade through the town a child cries out in truth, ""The emperor has no clothes!""Because this film was directed by the daughter of a very famous director, all the critics felt it must be wonderful and gave it 4 star ratings, but the truth is, this film has no clothes. It was boring and stupid. It wandered aimlessly and when it got really slow the director tossed in a nude scene to liven it up. The characters were unconvincing and uninteresting, the story weak, the acting terrible, and the overall result a total waste of time. it did not connect at all.

759,Nuada7,Marvelous,9,29 September 2003,"""Lost in Translation"" is the first movie I've seen in a long time for which I didn't regret paying full price at the theater, especially after the brain-blistering acid trip of ""The Hulk"".  Note that this movie is not fast-paced; it's more the pace of ""Cast Away"" than ""The Fast and the Furious"".  It's also not Bill Murray as the total goofball we all know and love; this is a serious dramatic role for him, with just a lick of humour in the right places, careful not to overdo it.Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a past-his-prime American movie star who is in Japan making some commercials for a whiskey.  Though translators help him well enough to get by with conversation, he is lost in a search to reclaim his identity amidst the flashy technology and neon lights of modern Tokyo pop culture.  His wife and children back home miss him, but they've grown used to their father's absence.Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is two-years wed to John, a photographer on the job in Tokyo who is often away from the hotel room where he and his wife stay.  Charlotte has a degree in psychology but is also searching for who she really is (or at least who she's supposed to be) in Tokyo's wealth of karaoke bars and arcades.Their paths cross from repeated sightings of each other in the bar at all hours of the day and night, since neither is having much luck getting any sleep.  They develop a warm friendship quickly, but each fights internally with sexual frustrations, loyalties, and choices that will shape their lives.Bill Murray proves himself as a dramatic actor in this film, and the makeup artists do a wonderful job helping him along with how aged and tired he looks through most of the film contrasted against how youthful and bright he appears at certain points.  Scarlett Johansson steps up as a precocious actress and tackles what had to be a difficult role for a 16-17ish year old (during filming) to play; it may not be hard to pull off 60 when you're 50, but it's really something when an actress can seem to be in her mid-20's with college and marriage behind her when in reality she's still of high school age.Many bizarre parts of Japanese popular and underground culture are showcased in this movie.  Perhaps some were played up a bit much, but that's part of the movie's charm as it sends protagonists and audience alike careening into a new culture.I won't spoil the ending for you, but--personally speaking--this movie was a full 180 degrees from ""The Life of David Gale"", as the more I thought about that one the more I wanted to flip the switch myself.  ""Lost in Translation"" left me wanting something else at first, but the more I thought about it the more I felt it couldn't really have ended better.  As a final thought, I think the idea was not to be able to understand all of the last lines, and just to take it as was shown.9/10, and it would be higher if it could appeal to a larger audience. This isn't a movie for everybody; it's a love it or hate it thing.",Lost in Translation

The scene with the shooting of the whisky commercial is memorable. At the same time, I was really caught by the growing romance between those two drifting souls. There is a strong feeling of freedom coming out of their story as they get carried away by the moment. In addition, and that is more personal, this movie plays a special role for me as I have lived a similar experience. Bill Murray has never been so touching and for example the karaoke scene is one of those amazing cinematic moment.

The small story, such as it is, is more symbolic/metaphoric than concrete, and hammers over and over again at the difficulty we have as individuals trying to connect with one another, or even in finding any meaning in our miserable lives. All visuals serve to increase the feeling of isolation and disconnectedness.We get the message, but we just don't believe the author's or director's viewpoint is very much on target, so we're not particularly sympathetic. If you're looking for either a good time or a thought-provoking experience you would do better to look elsewhere. 5/10 is being generous, and we continue to be disappointed with Bill Murray's recent work and anything Sofia Coppola directs.

That is how it feels when you do go to a new place where you know nothing or understand nothing. The world is happening around you but you do not know or understand what to make of it. At that moment you do want to just find one person - even if it is by a long shot - who understands what or who you are and where you're from. The line ""Everyone wants to be found"" sums up the whole movie for me. Everybody always needs somebody to love.Bill Murray finally gets an Oscar nod with a gem of a performance. A man in a mid life crisis is not new to any Hollywood fan. We have indeed seen it time and again, but there is something different and new about this man or is it the fact that he takes us into the real deeper realm of what a lonely man feels like which makes us relate to him better. Be it anything, this character is one I will never forget. The subtly hidden pain or the tall man in between all those average sized Asian people or just watching his own movies dubbed in Japanese, all of these little things go a long way in showing the plight of this man.Scarlett Johansson being the age at which she was when she did this movie has never looked more beautiful than when she walks in the monastery looking at the newly wed couple. Her face is not beaming radiance or she is not the sunshine, it is just the in-explainable look on her face and the gaze in her eyes which just caught me off guard. It is only a great movie when the actors compliment each other with their performances and Boy do they do it here. She holds her own in such a brilliant way and with such a captivating aura around her.Sofia Coppola deserves the most special mention of all. Her screenplay is not about two people meeting in a strange land but it is about everyone's life. Everybody, be it a baby or a grand dad, wants to be loved and be in love. Everyone wants to feel a connection and find a reason to be happy. The feeling of every man is an island is wonderfully portrayed here. But the final moments where you see how frustrated people are by being islands and how much a connection of any sort or any time period mean to a person is really heart warming. It is perfect that we never hear the final conversation. It is for the viewer to think about and fill it by our-self. Think about what is the perfect thing to say at that moment is what i ask the people who watch this movie. The direction is absolutely stunning as she shows us what exactly she wants us to see and what she has seen through her eyes and vision.Magnificentperformances, Scarlett Johansson at her most beautiful, Beautiful locations, Sofia Coppola, the score, Bill Murray and especially for the way it made me feel at the end it is and forever going to be a 10/10.",Lost in Translation
763,theachilles,The Coppolas still delivering the goods?,6,12 June 2004,"A middle-aged actor, with his career in its downs, finds himself in Tokyo for the shootings of an advertisement. There, he'll meet a just-married girl, who left everything back in the States in order to support her photographer husband.It seems as Sofia Coppola is trying to prove from the very beginning of her career that she has far more talents than her famous last name. After the almost autobiographical Suicide Virgins, she comes up with a story that is a model for our era. And this is the era of easy solutions, of emphasizing on body pleasures and on the unconditional expression of feelings. She is dealing with a love story that many people would think that has never existed, just because there weren't any physical proves. But if there's a reason that makes this movie so special, is exactly because it portrays all these things that would never happen in front of our eyes, the things that no one would say, but all of us feel in the inner part of ourselves. Inside one of the most crowded cities of the world, our heroes feel more lonely than ever before. They find on each other the compassion they seek, not just because of the same language, but because they share something deeper. They both are face to face with life's choices. It doesn't matter that she's in the beginning and he's in the middle of the course. The circumstances are the same.Although Coppola is touching perfection as far as the script is concerned, from a directorial point of view she's unable to cover certain weaknesses. In its biggest part, the film is nerveless and the few emotional breakouts of the plot aren't followed with intense scenes. However, these weaknesses are well-hidden thanks to an astonishing Bill Murray. The way he combines a psychotic comic personality and a gloomy tragic character in the same role is admirable. Johansson also shows that she has a lot to give in acting, as long as she continues with the series of great choices that has so far made.Lost In Translation, without coming up to the unprecedented reaction that the movie spawned to critics all over the world as it ain't The motion picture event, it can easily excite the viewers with its melancholy, humour and lyricism.",Lost in Translation

I can't say I remember very many specific 'parts' or particularly memorable pieces of dialogue, despite having seen it on a number of occasions. I am, however, almost endlessly drawn to the near-enigmatic nature of what does happen, perhaps because it is so easy to relate to. Of course I'm not implying that I empathize with Bob's actual character, but rather, I feel connected to his plight (or lack thereof).If you've ever wandered your neighborhood alone in the early morning hours and felt somewhat indifferent to the world, there may be a small part of either of these characters locked inside of you somewhere, longing to find someone that shares your own troubling sense of apathy - someone that may also lend you a whisper, a bittersweet sense of hope, and a truly private moment that would have the potential to make everything a little more bearable.",Lost in Translation

He gives probably the most convincing portrayal of jet lag I've seen.Scarlett Johansson is so good at portraying characters who are 'outsiders' in some way, and here she is excellent as the bemused, curious and disoriented Charlotte, newly-married to a young photographer and accompanying him on a shoot. Her character especially benefits from Sofia Coppola's proved skill in portraying young women on screen, while her character and Bill Murray's are equally well-observed and well-acted.The film has some nicely-observed comic moments while convincingly conveying the sense of being 'lost' in a foreign culture and trying to find one's bearings there and in the wider world, and even in life itself.

771,jiz-6,Well... Bill Murray was good...,6,11 February 2004,"Lost in Translation is a film about a relationship between a faded Hollywood star and a bored wife, set against the background of Tokyo.I'm unsure how to view this movie, if it were a book I think I would characterise it as interesting but poorly written.  The film is very much about a message rather than pure entertainment, and that message is put across as much visually as it is verbally.  The basic message seems to be about the problems with communication that exist at all levels of society, with the difficulties that the main American characters have interacting with Japanese society mirroring their own problems with their own private relationships.  The film manages to get this message across, however I found much of the film dull.  Why all the staring out of windows over Tokyo, staring out of car windows, and wandering around Pachinko parlours.  It gets the message across that people are bored/jet lagged, in a foreign culture, and allows for some nice street scenes of Japan, but all this could have been foregone with a bit more dialogue and acting.  Just because the character is meant to be bored does not mean that the audience has to be bored with them.  Therefore I think several minutes could be cut from the film without damaging the message.  Additionally, the relationship between Murray and Johansson didn't make me feel for either of the characters.  The way I saw it they were both quite selfish, well certainly as selfish as their respective spouses.  And I think this is where the film failed.  You were left asking: A couple of people you don't really feel for are having a boring time on a business trip in Tokyo.  So what?'   
As for the acting: Bill Murray was excellent (and certainly rescued this film), Johansson was nice to look at, but didn't really say anything of meaning - she seemed characterless,  the assorted Japanese characters were all excellent, Ribisi wasn't really in the movie, and  Faris did a nice cameo as the airhead actress.However, overall I felt although I understood the movie, it was too intellectualtoo cleverbasically required too much work analysing what everything meant rather than generating feelings or enjoying the film.

From there, once a film acquires a reputation as undeserved as this, it is almost compulsory to love it- the middle classes sit around their dinner tables, and all smugly agree how good it is, no matter what they actually think of it.I am angry that I have seen this film, and I am angry that it is so popular; it simply reflects how low our society has sunk, and how little we expect from popular entertainment.

Scarlett Johanssen is reason enough to see this film - she will be the next Cate Blanchett in my mind. She's versatile, strong and extremely polished in her acting style - she just blew my mind in this role.

It's too bad that we live in a time when subtlety is sometimes mistaken for boredom, but this film is anything but. It's exquisitely rendered with a knowing eye by the gifted daughter of a gifted man, who knows how to paint with quiet, hushed emotional colors. It's a bittersweet examination of two lives going in opposite directions: Bill Murray is a once popular, now fading movie star whose life, both professionally and maritally, is in stasis, while Scarlett Johannson is trying to figure out what it's all about. These two people cross paths and give each other hope and love in a crazily foreign land, and in unpredictable ways that are by turns witty, ironic, tender, and finally heartrending. Never has Bill Murray's gift for finding the pathos underlying his brilliantly hip comic sheen been so generously and perceptively uncovered. Bob Harris is a guy I can fully understand and relate to, leading his life of quiet desperation and weary resignation. The luminous Scarlett Johannson is an old soul in the body of a rapturous 19 year old who perhaps reminds Bob of what he once thought he was or could be. Charlotte brings back Bob to life for the brief time they are together in Tokyo and it's one of the sweetest, smartest, and wisest screen pairings the movies have given us in ages.

The Bob Harris character is played pretty deadpan, for instance.  Pardon . . . SPOILERS COMING!  The romance is not likely to develop, and we are glad that it does not.  These elements, together with the long shots of still faces, still scenery, make for an innovative and artistic film.Why was it made?  People who either have traveled to Japan or who are into the electronics devices and media made possible by Japan will like its scenes.  Things in downtown Tokyo are compacted, for instance, a party in a tiny cubicle of a high rise apartment building, seen clearly from outside the window.  Thus, it is a travelogue for Japan, no doubt in part funded by the Tourism Bureau of Japan.  Well, what if you are not into electronics and mass media?Why else was it made?  To show that an older man and a young, zestful woman can have a sort-of relationship without sex.  If so, it failed a bit.  They are acquainted but they do not grow by the end.  For the Charlotte character to grow, her earlier stated inner conflicts must be resolved.  Yet she remains unenlightened as to her vocation.  She remains a philosophy major attracted to Buddhist priests and complaining that she is involved in promoting hair products.  She remains romantically uninvolved.  The final sequence much-touted here is like the return of a ""Don't want"" product to the store:  they don't even take phone numbers or anything.Isn't the title decentralized?  The two involved in this central relationship are not the ones translating; they both speak the same language.  The title alludes to a joke you saw coming.  It alludes to the trouble Bob Harris is having following a Japanese director whose interpreter is reluctant to thoroughly quote him.  It isn't funny the first time, because it's based on the old impression that someone talking in a foreign language seems to be using a lot of words.  It is repeated so many times that you want to turn the page.  Now, every time this movie is mentioned, you think of the tired joke that the script kept repeating and which is away from the main thrust of the film.",Lost in Translation

As a travel program on Japan it works well,  fair enough.  It makes you feel that you've really been there,  very well photographed. But...

780,solar_son,A Very Laid Back and Well Done Film.,8,15 October 2003,"Being a big fan of Bill Murray, going into this movie I expected him to stand out the most as an ever constant center of comedic attention.  I was suprised (pleasantly) to find that the main characters of this film took a back seat the real show stealer - the city and people of Tokyo, Japan.  The characters and story of ""Lost In Translation"" work well, but the scenery and camera work around Japan - and the Japanese people - make it up in case the premise doesn't hold your interest.  Sofia Coppola does a fantastic job presenting Tokyo and really works well with the local color.  In fact, I would go out on a limb and say her work in ""Translation"" in on par with that of Michael Mann (whom I consider the front-runner of technical direction and cinematography).  Everything incorporates really well in this film and throughout you really can get the feeling that you are right there (please excuse the old catch phrase).  But be warned, a film with such a low-key demeanor can confuse or bore some viewers who expect loud crashes and bangs every five minutes in order to let them know when to start paying attention again.  I also think the story line is very original and interesting.  The on-going theme in ""Lost in Translation"" may seem kind of familiar to those of us who have been a foreigner alone in different city on a business trip.  I'm pretty sure this movie gives several opportunities for the viewer to relate to the circumstances or characters at one time or another - that's why I think it works so well.  Also, I have to admit I've become a fan of Scarlett Johansson.  Her girl next-door looks and sweet demeanor really grow on you after a while - you fellas will know what I mean (plus it didn't hurt that she was lounging about in her underwear half the time)!

It is so beautiful, so wonderful, so touching and moving that I nearly wept several times.I'll skip the formalities.  If you haven't seen the film but plan to you already know the plot (or can read about it from almost any other comment posted above or below me).  Allow me to instead list the most heart-rending moments:*Bob on the phone with his wife and her quick-click before he can even say what was clearly a cursory ""I love you""*Charlotte speaking with her ""best friend"" back in the US who is too busy to hear the breaking of a heart*Charlotte's look of betrayal the next morning*The shared moments during karaoke*Bob's daughter's response when he tries to speak with her*Charlotte boarding the elevator with hardly a word as Bob heads for his limo*The conclusionI hurt every time I saw these characters hurt; perhaps my judgment was impaired by Johannson's beauty.  I mean, I heard once that among the saddest sights in the world was a lonely, beautiful girl.  The beauty of course transcends simple skin-depth (although Johannson has that in spades), but still, I hated seeing her cry.  Of course, the pain I saw in Bob was something I had witnessed firsthand several years ago, and this clearly reached me as well.  So I doubt that it had only to do with the loveliness of an actress.Let it remain at this.  The film was visually beautiful, well-written, realistic and had a deep impact on me in spite of the largely alien subject-matter.  For this I gave it a perfect '10.'",Lost in Translation
782,mike_76,Hate it or love it. I love it.,10,28 October 2006,"Good for you Sophia, for every person who doesn't appreciate this film I hope there are at least five other people who do. In fact I just went back to read comments and it does seem 5:1. I hope so. Every person expressing disappointment with this film say the same things, ""the storyline is pointless"" or ""the actors are boring snobs"". Get over your preconceived notions of what a movie should be and if you don't like it then so be it. So what if there is no point obvious explicit point to the storyline. Boring? That's too bad you find it boring.What I love about the film is how beautiful it is. Not just the shots (which are just incredibly gorgeous) and not just the music (which is simply perfect). More than that, it shows the beauty of a city and of a simple relationship between a man and a girl becoming a woman. The story is simple, not many words are spoken but those that are spoken are sincere. The movie, to me, is about how the beauty of life sneaks up on you when your not looking. It is about sincerity, true moments where people are just looking for something special like friendship. In this case, it's an unlikely friendship in an unlikely place.There is not much happening and not terribly much being said, but really this film speaks incredibly loudly to me. I love it.",Lost in Translation
783,huggebear,a film that rests on its characters,8,11 October 2003,"I've been reading through some of the comments, and it seems as if everyone either loved this movie or absolutely hated it.  I liked it a lot.  I will make one concession to the film's naysayers: there really isn't much of a plot, at least in a conventional sense.  Both Bob and Charlotte are dissatisfied with their lives and respective relationships, but the film isn't about finding solutions to those problems.  The dissatisfaction and alienation are what enable Bob and Charlotte to bond so quickly.  The film follows their relationship through several sleepless nights in Japan.Truth is, I can't entirely disagree with the negative comments many reviewers have made about the film.  It's not as funny as it could be, nor does anything particularly noteworthy happen in the film.  I liked the film because I could relate to it.  The karaoke scene brought back memories of nights I have spent hanging out with people I had just met and would probably never see again.  In addition, as a junior in college, I could identify with Charlotte's feeling of having absolutely no idea what to do with her life.The performances are great...Bill Murray is excellent as usual and Scarlett Johansson has seamlessly transitioned into adult roles.  Granted, there isn't much of a plot, but to me it doesn't seem to be necessary.  ""Lost in Translation"" is almost like a short story: two lonely people meet in Japan and form a friendship, knowing that they will ultimately have to return to their regular lives, but for a few crazy, alcohol-filled nights, they will enjoy each other's company and contemplate things that could be.",Lost in Translation
784,raphal,Sterile and pretentious,1,15 September 2004,"Are you familiar with the agony of having to confront most of your friends with your (very) negative assessment of a movie everyone loves? It never hit me so hard as with Lost in Translation, a sad monument to vanity and contempt. Two aspects of that film made it particularly unpleasant: the use of clichés, and the very poor tailoring of scenes.I suppose the foggy poetry of the title explains the distance with which everything is filmed, and the particularly painful impression that everything taking place on the screen is in fact happening behind a bullet-proof window. Every time something a little significant threatens to occur (physical or verbal contact between the two main characters, a twist in the plot...), the scene is cut short. Now I very well understand that this may be considered a rather clever technique, and I can appreciate the understated aesthetics of it all, but this is going too far, and turns into a farce: we're asked to PRETEND that something meaningful is taking place between the scenes, or inside the character's heads. What a fraud.Now back to the multitude of clichés that are used throughout the movie, particularly to depict the Japanese, cultural and everyday Japan, but also show-business relationships, what happens after 20 years of marriage, expatriates, the shallow side of young and successful Americans, etc. This is a feature that many people commended, arguing that it was a rather subtle, elegant and ironic treatment of the issue of cultural shock in particular and inter-cultural contact in general. I only see contempt for the world at large, a very crude perception and rendering of other human beings, and a terribly self-indulgent narration technique. No effort of understanding each snapshot, nor any attempt to brush an overall picture: what was the point?!All in all, I did not enjoy this movie. Except during the very rare moments of humor (""for relaxing time, make it Suntory time""), it was not pleasant at all to watch. 1/10",Lost in Translation

But that is all I got out of this movie, and that's a little less than what I was hoping for. Granted, it also makes for a great Tokyo travel guide with an attitude.As with many movies, I sense two distinct camps here among the IMDb commenters. I'm gonna side with the dislikers on this one, though I would abhor to be considered as the kind of brute that just likes movies with big explosions or a lot of focus below the belt. I can dig ""deep"" movies as much as the next guy, but this one just doesn't have what it takes.Maybe even the LIT fans can admit that it doesn't exactly have ""Casablanca"" quality.

789,sslatten3,Still great,9,23 February 2006,"With Lost in Translation, Sofia Coppola has deftly combined two themes in one film. The first and most obvious is that of two people who share an isolated romance in other another country. When Bob and Charlotte meet, they are both submerged in a place that is, culturally, totally foreign to each. The awkwardness of being a fish out of water becomes evident when they first see each other on the elevator. Their oddness stands out and enables them to recognize each other as kindred spirits for the moment. It is this sense of isolation that allows them to meet up and become friends. It is highly unlikely that they would have befriended each other in downtown Manhattan.The next theme Coppola uses is that of the May/December romance. Romance between a young woman and a much older man has been explored in various ways over the years, but this is the most effective example I have seen. Since both characters are married, each is constrained from consummating the relationship. With the extreme difference in their ages, Bob and Charlotte are approaching marriage from opposite sides of the time line. When Bob does cheat on his wife, it is with some lounge singer who is considerably closer to his age. The viewer gets the impression that he knows the singer can ""handle it"" much more than Charlotte would be able to. He seems to want to preserve Charlotte's innocence here, rather than shatter her youth by seducing her and forcing her to see all the baggage he carries with him.Coppola is unusually clever at weaving these two themes together and showing that two people who are out of their usual circumstances can find each other and learn from one another, without having to fully enter each other's world. It is to the director's credit that Bob and Charlotte do not kiss until the end of the film. When it finally happens, Bob whispers something into Charlotte's ear and she begins to cry. I interpret this to be some variation of, ""Stay married, but when things get rough, remember our time together."" This was a very powerful scene and is what elevates the film above merely being entertaining into the category of excellence.",Lost in Translation
790,rage_k,Watching this film made me feel jet-lagged.,9,1 September 2008,"Lost in Translation is perhaps one of the most emotionally stunting movies I've ever had the pleasure of watching. It leaves you feeling strange. Not happy, not sad, nor ambivalent. Sofia Coppola somehow manages to take the viewer on a journey through the lives of two very different people who meet in a Tokyo hotel, and turn into a beautiful, disjointed urban fairytale; she leaves it to the viewer to fill in the gaps. Both Bill Murray and Scarlet Johannson play their roles flawlessly. You could almost believe you were watching someone else's memories or dream, as the characters are interesting, believable and nigh-on tangible, but very little is ever divulged about either character. There are many aspects of this movie that are very well accomplished. The cinematography is at times breathtaking, showing you the Tokyo skyline at night and the busy, ebbing tide of people on the Shibuya streets. It almost seems like Sofia Coppola at times, took a few clues from Japanese director Takeshi Kitano with regards to her emphasis on extended landscape shots. There are long, focused scenes portraying various aspects of Japanese landscape and culture; a Shinto wedding, a Buddhist temple and a rush-hour train ride are but some examples. Though none of these scenes have any real significance in the movie, they do resonate and help consolidate the mood of the film. The music plays its part very well in contributing to this almost indiscernible mood. There are moments in the film where the music adds an almost haunting ambiance and mood to a scene, and there are other moments where you almost begin to feel as disjointed and culture-shocked as the two protagonists when certain compositions make you feel like you're spending a sleepless night with music pouring in, subdued, from the room next door while you're recovering from jet lag. The movie does a good job in portraying Americans and Japanese people as being hopelessly juxtaposed on a cultural and on occasion, linguistic level, often to comic effect. It's interesting to watch a film which doesn't so much judge as it does observe the cultural and linguistic differences between America and Japan. The most interesting parts of the film are where you see the protagonists attempt to overcome their initial culture-shock and jet-lag, and try to interact with various aspects of urban Japanese society..Lost in Translation is quite simply, a beautiful movie.",Lost in Translation

While at the hotel, he meets and eventually befriends a young woman (Johansson) accompanying her husband, a photographer who seems to have time for everyone except her. Two people, at two different stages in life, form a powerful bond of friendship, restricted from becoming love by the commitments each have to other people. The film does a great job alternating sequences of pure hilarity with thoughtful drama, all interspersed with glimpses of a world and culture foreign to Westerners, yet possessing a distorted familiarity which makes it fascinating - almost making you wish you were there, on the busy neon-lit streets of Tokyo.

First, Bill Murray was at his finest confirming my belief that it is impossible for him to give a bad performance. Second, it had the entrancing Scarlet Johanssen for whom my hopes were so high after seeing her great performance in Ghost World. She is only eighteen years old, but exudes this great mature and sexy aura that makes us believe she is much older. Third, the masterful direction of Sofia Coppola, in only her sophomore effort, helps guide the movie along beautifully.

A story of two disillusioned lives who meet in Tokyo.  Surrounded by a new culture their alienation is a means to connect and allows them to make sense of themselves.  Shot in a cinema verite, on the fly, documentary-esque style Sofia Coppola and her colleagues shoot Tokyo with eyes of admirers.  And the soundtrack composed by My Bloody Valentine's Kevin Shields is distinctly fresh and poignant.  The performances are all amazing in their own subtle way.  Bill Murray is the obvious stand out walking the line between humor and melancholy with sympathetic grace.  Scarlett Johannsen matches him stroke for stroke with her wistfulness.  The other characters Giovanni Ribisi and Anna Faris add depth to their characters as a photographer and young starlet, respectively, despite limited screen time.There are no resolutions in here just hopes, wants, desires.  A decision between what is right and what is meaningful.  As the film builds itself into a corner.  It resonates even more, because it shows fleeting encounters rarely eclipse ephemeral durations.  When Bill Murray whispers his last words to Scarlet Johannsen's ears.  We as watchers are not allowed to hear.

But that night, I thought of how much of an experience this movie is. The emotions captured and the world it brings you to is phenomenal. The acting is amazing. The relationship that Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray have feels very real. The feelings I get from the movie are quite mixed. The main characters are almost never upset with each other, but before they met each other they were miserable. Now, the world this movie is in feels so distant, and yet so close. I guess we can all relate to the story, if we stripped it down and examined its basic premise, but the place the movie is set in is what strikes the audience as unfamiliar. Well, the main characters are unfamiliar with the place they're in. They're two lost souls, in an unknown land. I think that's what makes the movie work. The environment and the story seem to differ so much that they compliment each other. If this wasn't set in Japan, it would seem like an average romance flick. But it's a lot more. It's a bitter-sweet film that can show what the real world is like, which is quite refreshing, compared to all the happy endings nowadays. To be honest, there aren't really any parts that stick, no high points. However, this means that there isn't really any low points either. The ending is also bitter-sweet, I love it. I won't spoil it for you, It's just, realistic, i guess is the best word to describe it. This film deviates every norm of a movie of today. It's one of a kind. It's a different kind of love story. Except it's more of a friendship story. How two stranded people find each other and begin to care for each other more and more as their own lives seem to become less and less of a reality.

These common-bonds result in the two of them forming an unlikely, but electric, connection in the hotel bar. The pair then take in Tokyo together, their friendship developing brilliantly but they are never being able to take it one step further.This is perhaps the best 'indie' film of the 21st century so far. The acting is superb and Coppolla's smart script and even smarter direction put the characters across brilliantly. Ultimately the film's biggest asset is the subtlety of its stars' performances and the subtlety of its direction. This subtlety made it a let down for many people. The film was marketed as a kind of slapstick, lighthearted rom-com and admittedly the moments with the Japanese ad-men are utterly hilarious but the film is a character study. I remember expecting the former but being surprised, and delighted, when I found it to be the latter.Its a triumph for all involved. Anyone who doesn't feel moved by the 'goodbye' scene clearly has no heart, the acting is outstanding. Coppola's tight direction, and good use of music, ensures that the film never drifts into schmaltz and that real emotion is what carries us through the film.I feel sorry for all involved that Return of the King came out in the same year.

They should - there hasn't been a film as beautiful crafted as this for a long time.",Lost in Translation

It was a big disappointment! It did not have any plot. Even the director admitted that in an interview. The characters were bored and they effectively got me very bored also. I kept waiting for it to turn around and show something interesting but that never happened. I think people who liked it were brainwashed into thinking that there is something deep and intellectual about this movie and admitting you don't like it may make you sound dumb. Hey, you can call me stupid but this is really a bad movie.It reminded me so much about ""My Dinner With Andre"" which was in every critics top 10 list the year it was released. I saw it and could not believe they even made this movie about 2 very uninteresting middle aged guys talking over dinner throughout the movie.

There were a few high points, though: Govanni Ribisi, a usually rough and tuff guy cleaned up to play Scarlett Johansson's hubby, the culture clash- USA vs. Japan made for some situational comedy played up by funny-man Bill Murray. And Scarlett Johansson's performance is very impressive for anyone less than 20 and in that role, making her rise to extreme stardom a sure bet. Just read a list of her movies and the people she has worked withfrom Rob Reford to Thora Birchher star friends alone are enough to give her major props. So definitely check out her other films, which will surprise many with the range of acting. Some people have just ""discovered"" her but she's been on my list of ""make-it""s for a while.

This anyhow is my feelings towards the film, which I'm shocked in this case to find that not everyone agrees with. My taste in movies is quite diverse and I will sometimes adore movies when i haven't read a single good review, or absolutely detest films which have been consistently praised! In the case of Lost in Translation, quite a few of my friends have classed it as 'boring', or 'too simple'. Usually I'll take this criticism in my stride, accepting that everyone has their different opinions but in this particular film I couldn't help but argue against what my friends were saying - After all how could they call such a beautifully made film as this, boring? How can such a comment possibly be justified?...Naturally I asked them to explain.'Yes...Yes Johnny the film does boast some great acting, I'll agree with you there and yes certainly Coppola has shown plenty of skill both behind the camera and in her writing of the script - I found the truthfulness of the language spoken between the two key characters to be wonderfully startling.' This is a relatively vague remembrance of what one of my good friends said to me upon their viewing of the film. Naturally I asked why, when they had nothing but compliments to add, did they not like it and this was the response I got, 'It's just not for me Johnny - It moves along at too slow a pace and I just wasn't satisfied enough by the premise to be willing enough to be taken along for the ride.' My friend spoke this in such an articulate manner that I was left to marvel at his clarity - he understood perfectly why he didn't like the film and it was at this moment when I realized that I just couldn't argue anymore - I had nothing more to say.I understand that readers may by now be getting frustrated at why I'm not really 'reviewing' this film. Personally I believe Lost In Translation is a near masterpiece -It boasts strong performances, great dialogue, a touching yet realistic story and excellent direction. Despite my recommendation though to go and see the film, I should very much like to emphasize that it's not for everyone - there will be some people who will be bored out of their minds and while I certainly didn't feel that way in watching it, I understand perfectly well how there will be those who will be frustrated at its simplicity.",Lost in Translation

The story actually told us, that how we feel, when we are outside our comfort zone. We will start to lost ourselves, confused and everything seems so wrong.

This movie is so accurate to the lonely travel experience it's miraculous. I don't see this as anything like a ""romance"", there is something higher going on here--a story about love for another human, an almost stranger... the relationship is so complicated yet very simple--it is the same love that lovers have, that is between friends, that a parent would have for a child. It lets us know that we're all in this together.There is a scene where Bob is singing karaoke and Charlotte is simply looking at him. It is an unbelievable look of love.

The movie  is just a shade over 90 minutes long, making it quite short in comparison to typical movies of today.  But in that short span of time, you experience extreme culture shock, a dampening feeling of entrapment, a sense of longing, and you are privy to the story of two people who are lost spiritually, emotionally, and physically.You can see the honesty behind every facet of the production...as the movie is semi-autobiographical for the writer/director Sophia Coppola.  Each shot evokes some kind of emotion, without forcing emotion into the mind of the viewer.  For instance, you will feel restless as you watch the characters flip through late-night, obnoxious Japanese television in their pajamas. You feel utter frustration as Bob Harris (Murray) tries to make sense of a photographer giving directions with pidgin English.  The film is masterfully directed with a perfect, subtle simplicity.This is, far and away, Bill Murray's finest performance, and also an amazing feature of Scarlett Johansson.

822,neil_ward,Ace,9,12 April 2005,"Bob Harris is a middle-aged actor as ugly as a monk with a grudge, stranded in Tokyo while he films a whisky commercial. Alone and bored, he discovers a kindred spirit in Charlotte, a twenty-something newlywed with an increasingly irksome and absent husband. The pair find solace from the city's disorientating strangeness in an uncategorisable relationship which drifts between father-and-daughter-like bonding and romantic tension.Director Sofia Coppola displays faith in the audience's perceptiveness to understand characters and situations without excessive narration; romance radiates from the natural sense of warmth and sensitivity not as the result of explicit, manipulative scripting. Her mostly subtle approach is validated by the brief, ill-advised scenes of broad humour which rely on the apparent intrinsic hilarity of small people.Bill Murray's droll, dark eyes plead to be sparked with life. His apathetic body-language displays a bemused resignation to fate, crucial to the sad but inevitable conclusion. Scarlet Johansson is a luminous presence, beautiful and graceful. However, both of their characters would have benefited from more empathetic situations; Bob is annoyingly dismissive of his work despite his excessive earnings and luxurious treatment while Charlotte's 'alienation' can frequently be inter operated as mere petty sulkiness.The cinematography masterfully captures the seductive but hollow neon-landscape of Tokyo and thankfully doesn't presume the viewer will jerk-with-astonishment at the mere sight of symmetry as in The Virgin Suicides, and is sublimely complimented by the ambient, melancholic music of My Bloody Valentine and The Jesus And Mary Chain.

828,tolbs1010,the most overrated film of 2003,4,18 October 2003,"How people can call Lost In Translation a great movie is beyond me. Sofia Coppola proves once again that she doesn't know how to shape a scene let alone an entire film. The premise isn't bad, but all of the ideas float by latently on the screen. Cinematographer Lance Acord helps make up for Coppola's lack of an eye by giving the city locations an ambient glow, but scenes that feature people talking to each other (including those between Bill Murray and Scarlet Johannsson) feel oddly disconnected. Some may argue that this mirrors the characters' frame of mind, but when all of these scenes lead up to a big romantic farewell it feels like you're getting the payoff without the proper build. As for the ""comedy"" in this film, I thought it was insulting. Everyone in the movie except for the two main characters (and maybe Johannsson's Japanese friend) are made to look either clownish or shallow. Since when is making fun of Japanese people and custom considered ""hilariously inventive"" as one paper put it. The whole conception is so narrow minded that unless you're willing to fall in love with the characters' mopey derisiveness you will find very little to grab onto as a viewer. Bill Murray has been giving this same sad-sack performance for the past fe w years. It worked in Rushmore because....well because it was just a much better film. That film had original humor, great visuals, and Murray had an actual character to play. Here it looks like there were a lot of script pages that probably read, ""Bill does something funny here."" The truth is, not much of what he does here is funny or even interesting. It's a tired performance that's being misconstrued as ""real"" or ""honest."" Granted, a tired Bill Murray is still much better than most, and he shows a few glints of spontaneous magic. Much of this movie was obviously improvised--at least dialogue wise--and Scarlett Johannsson comes out looking the worst. Often she lets her pretty, pouty face do what her mind (and probably Coppola's script) is not doing. Her performance is full of longing glances and dulled edges. It's telling that her best scene--and Coppola's best conception/composition--is the opening shot of her backside through pink panties seen from the vacant side of her bed. It's a brilliant piece of metaphorical imagery, and there's not a shot or line of dialogue in the rest of the film that comes close to matching it.** out of *****",Lost in Translation
829,incurableflame,"A very real, human film. It could happen to you.",9,31 December 2020,"Let's take a moment to appreciate how real this movie is, no Hollywood westernized gimmicks that I could perceive. This movie is very human. I forgot I was watching a film, and instead had an experience that I was totally involved in, which rarely happens. This is also a movie with a high rewatchability rate. It is perfectly shot, and the style of storytelling hides in the details. It's not pretentious, as a lot of movies of this caliber and style are, nor does it dumb things down. It was very warm, in fact. Finally, it reminded me why I've always wanted to go to Japan. The thing is, you don't have to go to Tokyo to feel lost in translation with people. But you do have to feel lost in order to be found. I would say that Tokyo, besides being a real place & setting in this film, can be used as a metaphor just as effectively. But really what I enjoyed the most is the connection between Charlotte and Bob. At first there's a mutual understanding. There's definitely friendship. Then there's an odd father-daughter relationship, which finally moves onto romantic attraction. But the whole time the two characters are somehow on the same page, on the same level. They have more in common with each other's existential state, which can be seen as the most profound kind of connection two people can share at any time. Unfortunately, it's not the kind of connection than can go anywhere, realistically. They can't be together in the normal understanding, and they never initiate their relationship or cross any boundaries. I don't know, man. This movie is like Zen Buddhism. It's satisfyingly simple and minimalist, yet it contains the deepest truths about the human condition. WITHOUT being pretentious. It's the kind of experience you feel. We may watch films with our eyes, listen to them with our ears, but Lost In Translation speaks to another kind of sensory perception, if you can call it that. It is very ambient and sensuous. You feel as if you're there. I think it's great. There were some genuine laughs and there were a lot of scenes that I feel like weren't acted at all, there's a strong authentic feel to every scene that is extremely rare to come by in movies these days.

What drew me to this film, and the reason it is my favorite, is that I connect to the characters. I feel the loneliness, the friendship, the happiness and joy. Not only do I connect to the characters, but to the situations. I rejoice when they find each other; when Bob tells her he's leading a prison break. I get angry when Bob sleeps with the red-headed singer. I cry when Bob is leaving, and doesn't really have a good-bye with Charlotte... yet, when they meet, I am overcome with joy. Also, a part that deeply affects me, is whenever bob's wife calls... especially when Bob is in the tub. It hurts me when she doesn't even care about him, nor takes the time to listen to what he wants.Another aspect, that I am head-over-heels in love with, is the cinematography. There are so many beautiful shots. namely, the opening, where Bob is in the car, and you are watching the neon signs of Tokyo, with beautiful ambient music in the background.Thirdly, you have the dialogue. There are so many brilliant lines and dialogue. Especially when Bob invites Charlotte to his room, and they talk. This film is funny, sad, and deep...

It looks so natural and pure (but I don't think its improv). It is a gentle sway, no real somethings to pop up in their way and stop them - because it is real.

836,sgcamil,Lost in Japan,6,14 March 2004,"<SPOILER DOWN BELOW>Undoubtedly a well directed movie.On the other hand it tends to be a bit stretched out. The portrayal of how the main characters experience an alien culture is uncannily unrealistic but the pace of the movie tends to whittle down after the first 45 minutes without seeming to be going further. Whilst the two main characters are constantly developing, the movie did not and tends to be rather boring after a while.On a different track, it is very interesting for such a movie coming out in 2003 not to have any sex scene between the two main characters when the plot itself was literally shouting out for this to happen!!! That was refreshing.Overall, could have been a 9/10 movie. I give it 7",Lost in Translation

The story itself was so recognizable, even for people who haven't been in such a situation. Many people noted it's about being alone, but I see it more as a movie about the best kind of friendship there is. The one that doesn't need words. The one in which you can't be lost in translation, simply because there is nothing that needs translation at all...And the end of the movie was probably the best one I've ever seen...

I didn't just kind of dislike it, but I found it one of the hardest things to sit through ever. Half way through I really wanted to turn it off, but I was sure that it was going to get better.  It didn't.  I disliked the story, I disliked the music, I really hated the mood and atmosphere that the movie created. I found it depressing.  One redeeming quality that this film offers is that the acting is actually not bad.  Bill Murray does a good job, although I thought that his acting in Royal Tenenbaums was far superior.

843,stevedep,Almost...,4,3 May 2004,"This is a movie about a two married people who are at an important point of their life. By  coincidence meet in Tokio. One is a young woman who just graduated and has her whole live ahead of her. The other is a man who has his whole career behind him. They live different lives but they share a common emptiness in their life. Both being unhappy about their marriage they start talking and eventually go out and explore the city together. After a while a special kind of romance binds them together. Because of the age difference they don't have sex. This creates a desire that doesn't get fulfilled. The film is all about the characters and their feelings, it doesn't really contain a storyline. Personally I don't think the movie captures the emotions that come to play in this situation. In American beauty similar emotions come to play, but in this movie they are beautifully expressed by using great dialogue en music. And it is exactly this what is missing in Lost in translation. Lost in translation does contain nice footage of Tokio, although I think the image that is created of Tokio isn't realistic, but this probably was the intention.

844,mattbcoach,A fascinating study of life,8,3 February 2004,"Actor Bob Harris (Bill Murray), at one time a top Hollywood superstar, but now clearly in the twilight of his career, is left with some choices. He can either do a play for a few dollars, try his hand at independent films, or do a Whisky ad in Japan for two million dollars. Not TOO surprisingly he goes for the money. While in Japan he meets the wife of a young and accomplished photographer, played by Scarlett Johannson, who seems rather baffled by life's choices. She simply doesnt know what to do with her life. Murray has lived his life, and has done very well, but he just feels somewhat insecure about the future. Oh, he has money, but what he doesnt have is the faith that he will continue to be a top star. Johannson, highly educated, graduated with a degree in Philosophy and has tried several things, none of them working real well. She seems way to intelligent to be known as ""someone's wife"" but thats what she is known as for now. In this movie we get a glimpse of the empty-headedness of Hollywood and the people that work there. This is an excellent movie and highly recommended.",Lost in Translation
845,Grifindor,How to comment on perfection?!,10,12 May 2004,"The moment the movie opened I was captivated beyond belief.  Tokyo spreads out and fills the screen, accompanied by such haunting music that I was placed slap-bang in the middle of Bob Harris' mind, joining him in his feeling of desolation and ennui.  Though Tokyo's electric city is a common view Sofia Coppola manages to instil an almost immediate impression of weariness - the camera not only shows us Bob Harris' view, but it has become his eyes, and we (de rigueur) voyeurs are suddenly allowed a glimpse not only of who this character is, but who he was and who he has become.  As soon as Bill Murray's world-weary face comes into view, those who have not already grasped the complexities of Bob Harris' character do so now with this first glimpse.  The car pulls into a tall, grey hotel and Bob is surrounded by Japanese concierges, attempting to pull him every way and pressing packages into each available nook.  However, Sofia Coppola chose well in Bob Harris' image-maker, giving Bill Murray the starring role he truly deserves.  He remains the hypnotic eye-of-the-storm, his face never changing from its bleak and tired crinkle, even as the dervishes spin around him.  This first introduction to Bob Harris permeates the whole movie and his whole character - Bob Harris is every job you ever felt was beneath you, every trip you wish you'd stayed at home, every relationship you can't understand how you got in to, and every day that feels like the long, dark Sunday-afternoon of the soul.'The Virgin Suicides' looked great and, for all its faults, was a good story, but if the ultimate aim was connection, then it failed.  'Lost.' does not fail, which is why the main factor for me will always be the satiated feeling I got from watching it.  I left the theatre smiling, and so many trimmings combined to give this to me that the result as a whole is as near to perfection as I've seen in a long time.  Sofia Coppola is rapidly maturing into a fine filmmaker and a sterling writer.  The direction is flawless and, as Ms. Coppola is wont to do, the music perfectly matches the camera flow and character movement.  From its haunting introduction of Tokyo to the ebbing and flowing of the obligatory karaoke scene, the camera and score are so in tune with each other that they appear as one.  'Air' and Sofia Coppola gave a sense of fantasy and wonderment in 'The Virgin Suicides', but here she takes it all a leap further, where the original music sounds so much the better for having being written specifically.Scarlett Johansson is a revelation in the making.  Though not proud, in her own words, of the character she played in 'Ghost World', that is exactly where she first came to my attention, outstripping the wonderful Thora Birch and proving herself worthy of notice.  Again in 'The Man who Wasn't There' she shone, and I am purposely ignoring Scarlett's earlier performances in 'The Horse Whisperer', etc, as I am now dealing with Scarlett Johansson the adult.  She interacts perfectly with the young Giovanni Ribisi (unobtrusively great - he stays in the background as much as his character, rumoured to be based on the erstwhile husband of the Director, Spike Jonze), and transfers this pleasant skill onto the older character of Bob.  This movie shows Johansson at her obstinate, spoilt, aloof, lonely, lost best - allowing her to fill out Charlotte as she chooses with smiles and gazes and body movements so simple you almost miss the glimpses of inner-character she is offering you.However, this is undeniably Bill Murray's film.  Every scene, every moment, he fills with this character and forces you to take stock of his loneliness and unbearable ache of being.  Sympathy goes one step further and the viewer is forced to feel and be Bob Harris, drowning in the pain of existence and willing him to do anything to change it.  That is why, when a girl smiles at him in an elevator, his face instantly lights up and we begin to feel the warmth enter us as it has entered Bob.  Coppola's strength is her simplicity, and moments that stand out for me are the tableau of the two strangers and soul mates lying on a bed, she curled up and he straight as a board, his hand resting lightly on her bare foot.  The moment screams with emotion, but represses it until the final departing, where both characters reveal their underlying fears.  Another scene finds the two seated in a hallway, Bob in uncharacteristically 'hip' t-shirt and Charlotte in a platinum wig, finally succumbing to who they really are.  Not the singer in a karaoke or the drinking woman, but two lost and lonely souls who just need to sit down for a while.Take-on-take, this movie offers one of the most stunningly inventive and intuitive glimpses at human nature and its resistance of fate that I have seen - a stunning portrayal of friendship forged of desperation and the recognition of a kindred spirit. If this film is about anything, it is about two people about to go under, grabbing at the only life preserver they can see - each other.  The writing, though perfectly good, covers a quarter of how the feeling comes across in this movie.  The direction and acting extend this beyond mediocrity to excellence, the actors especially allowing the many quiet moments of reflection to speak for themselves.  Silence is strength itself, and more is shown through the character interaction and facial tweaks than a thousand words could manage.  True life depiction at its finest, and that rarest of creatures - a movie to be truly proud of.",Lost in Translation

847,jupiterboy,worthless,2,5 February 2004,"More emptiness from the school of new style flashiness. The film is trying to be a gentle comedy romance, but it's hardly better than most movies like it. In fact, it's worse because it's clear it wants to be treated like art. It demands respect and recognition. The two leads are awful, and they are given next to nothing to work with. The girl always has this pleasantly embarrased look on her face as if everything offends her-you can't tell where she's coming from. And after a certain point you really couldn't care. She's a non-character. Bill Murray is slightly more interesting, but it's clear that he is not the actor for this stuff. (Then again, noone is). The only time he registers with us is when he wisecracks and does his deadpan stare number.  The movie is so boring and the acting so transparent that when a throw away character appears, she gives the movie a little lift. I'm referring to the young blonde actress in Japan to do press meetings for her new action movie. It's clear the movie is poking fun at her, but I thought she was the only person with any life. I wanted the movie to stay with her. The few times she appears, you come out of your stupor and smile a bit. It's funny how the writers come through when they want to be mean and satirize shallow actors, but when it comes to actual dialog and scenes that entertain they're lost in another world.   The only comedy in the movie is derived from Murray looking bemused while some funny looking Japanese person rambles on. It's the only joke this movie has and it's pathetic.  Plus, how is this movie a romance? They share no great feelings of passion for each other. I think the closest they get is some inocuous pillow talk. If you want to show a romance and then restrict the actors from doing anything a little crazy, what's the point? Their little adventures are clipped of any real excitement, any revelations.  It's clear Sofia Coppola thinks she's hot stuff. I've seen her in a few magazines preening as if she were totally awesome, a new great director. Her father certainly helped her get into directing, vouching for her wherever he could. I seriously doubt a young female would garner this much acclaim if she wasn't who she was.",Lost in Translation

The acting is also very good. Scarlett Johanssen and Bill Murray both play their roles with a low-key subtletly that fits the movie perfectly.Having said this, theres still plenty of a movie to argue against. The romance is simply unbelievable - both of them falling in love with each other despite the obvious age difference, despite the fact they are both married, and despite the only thing they share in common is a hatred of the place they are. The film also portrays that 'woe is me' idea that seems very stuck up upper-class. Rather than enjoying and experiencing the place they are in, the characters much prefer to stand two steps away in their 'american-ness'.

I'm glad it didn't have a Hollywood ending, and I'm glad it wasn't a sleazy romance.

It is this film, 'Lost in Translation', that (since quite some time) made me think about the importance of characters and their internal communication. A question rises while evaluating this movie: is the charm of this movie product of the script or the actors? Or is it both? Maybe neither? The beauty of this film is the setting in another country and another culture. Man is accustomed to look for familiar bits and pieces, when he or she is put in unknown surroundings. Bill Murray, who plays an unforgettable role, seeks just a little recognition and affection when everything he does is misunderstood and uncomprehended. He finds it in the beautiful Charlotte (Johansson). The openings scene, where Charlotte is pictured all alone is confronting, but showing us the atmosphere of the film: alienation and growing lonelier when facing unknown settings. This is the reason why 'Lost in Translation' isn't a comedy. Hell no! The main theme, in my view, is communication. The problem is the fact that were dealing with two sexes and that loneliness can be pretty hard to handle. So the inevitable consequence is love? Not entirely, I'd call it friendship. Helping each other through a period they both don't want to be in. But then again, now they've met each other... Coppola made a beautiful movie, that puts the characters in the centre.

The other was Lost in Translation. Words cannot praise this film enough. It's - for lack of a less wussy word - beautiful. The cinematography is stunning, simple but utterly compelling. The acting is superb from all - and found a superstar in the gorgeous Scarlett Johannson. Bill Murray proves that he is arguably the best actor in Hollywood today. Sofia Coppolla showed promise with the Virgin Suicides. With this, i'd honestly say that she is a better director, at least visually, then her father Francis Ford. This is the truest, most touching portrayal of blossoming love ever committed to celluloid. Oh yeah, and it's pretty damn funny too.",Lost in Translation
864,linyuwei1,Shallow Film Full of Stereotypes about Japan and Japanese Culture,1,3 August 2005,"This film has been nominated for 4 important items of the Academy Award and referred very often, so I wanted to check out the hype. However, the film really disappointed me and eventually I was so released seeing the end. Sofia Coppola said the screenplay was based on her life. Then I have to say that her life and her way of viewing is really neither pointing nor poignant. The plot is neither exciting nor politically correct. Important western people working in the entertainment industry (and they're Americans) come to Far East and exploit all the pre-given stereotypes they learn, rather than going to explore the local culture and to know the differences between people. While showing that Japanese is a dominant language in Japan, the director forgets that Americans usually go around the world assuming everyone speaks American English. This film does not reflect most of feelings of travellers or lost people; instead, it is just about rich people (actors and actresses certainly fall into this category) going to big Asian cities looking for fun. Many stereotypes about Japan and Japanese culture have been represented in this film apart from one, which is the unbelievably expensive living cost there. And the actors seem spend money without hesitation, perhaps just like the director herself? Before seeing this film, I admire the Oscar having nominated a female director, but after seeing the film, I fear the Oscar nominated Sofia Coppola just because she's a woman and she's the daughter of Francis Ford Coppola.",Lost in Translation

866,kylenewalker,Charming Story of Friendship,8,26 April 2006,"'Lost in Translation' is a poignant film that deals not with mid-life crisis, but life crisis at any age. Whether it be the aging action-movie hero (Bill Murray) or the young newlywed college grad (Scarlett Johannson)--feeling lost happens throughout life. Writer and directer Sofia Coppola captures this delicate story in the sometimes chaotic surroundings of Tokyo Japan. While the characters are literally lost in a sea of cultural differences, these differences are metaphors for the harder to articulate feelings of being lost in life. Sometimes the dialogue and flow of the film are lacking, but there is something to be said for a director that chooses silence over redundant dialogue. Filled with charming and well-delivered scenes by Murray and Johansson, 'Lost in Translation' is a touching story, ultimately about friendship.",Lost in Translation

868,soriano329,Sometimes You Have to Be Lost to Be Found,9,10 December 2006,"Lost in Translation is one of those movies that you walk out of and buy another ticket for the next showing. It is storytelling at its finest, with beautiful direction, an enchanting script, and a perfect cast. Writer/Director Sophia Coppola's magic story keeps you wanting more, even after the movie ends. The only thing more astonishing is that it is even better upon your second viewing.In a part written directly for him, Bill Murray is flawless in the role of Bob Harris, a movie star going through his midlife crisis. But Murray doesn't just play Bob Harris, he is Bob Harris. He looks deep into the soul of Bob's character, and makes us forget about the Bill Murray we know him to be.Scarlett Johansson, in her first major role in a motion picture, is absolutely fabulous. When you look into Scarlett's eyes, you can see the trouble she is experiencing with her husband John, and you can see her desire to be a free spirit once again.Bob Harris (Murray), a movie star on the downside of his career, travels to Tokyo in order to film a commercial for a whisky company. He has a wife and children who are all dissatisfied with him, and he's dissatisfied with them, as he goes through his midlife crisis alone on the other side of the world.Charlotte (Johansson), a recent philosophy graduate from Yale, moved out to Tokyo with her husband John (Giovanni Ribisi). John, a photographer, seems to spend more time working with starlets than with his wife, causing Charlotte to question not only her marriage with him but also her very existence, looking at a dark and cloudy future.As if by chance or because of their dissatisfaction with their lives, Bob and Charlotte meet in the bar of their hotel. They are able to form a relationship with each other, despite the age barrier between them. When Charlotte's husband has to leave for the weekend, Bob is all she has. Their experiences over this weekend, alone, are what make Lost in Translation.Lost in Translation may seem like your typical love story, set against an age gap separating two lovers. But it is so much more than that. It is a love story that was never meant to be. Fate is what brought these two together, and although short, their time together was unforgettable. Whether they are together in the end or not is irrelevant, because the time they shared together is all they needed.Sophia Coppola will no longer live under her father's shadow. With a modest four million dollar budget and little experience she managed to make a masterpiece. Two lost souls manage to find happiness in a city foreign to themselves. Sometimes you have to be lost to be found.",Lost in Translation
869,ex-x-treme,If you connect... chills guaranteed for 105 minutes,10,14 February 2006,"105 Minutes, because the chills will continue even during the movie titles if you keep on listening to the music and thinking about what you have just watched. This movie is about feeling what this people go thru and feel. A lot (LOTS) of silent language, every little detail is well thought to connect to an open audience, and certainly Scarlett and Bill did an awesome job to translate into the silver screen their strong feelings. I read some comments that talk about ""after marriage"", I think this movie goes much beyond feelings once you are married and have kids. It's about life your whole life. I can relate to some passages where thru the character actions there's strong stresses on enjoying the moment, and soon after that the futility of the moment itself once the joy fades you feel that. It hits you in the guts! And then the next moment comes, and so on. And we are talking about extremely *simple* moments, not the typical emotional movie that tries to hit with deep stuff. The overall feeling while watching this movie is that you don't want the movie to end, the same thing the characters don't want their stay in Tokyo to finish, you can actually feel that. You can feel the pain they carry every time they come to grips with the realization that their time in Tokyo will be gone and they may never see each other for the rest of their life. The movie also clearly conveys the message that is not about the place, but the people that matters. First Bob Harris will show some indifference towards the place and Charlotte will show the typical curiosity of youth. Those feelings slowly translate into joy, love for the place even love for the food (I know, they didn't like Shabu Shabu because you have to cook it yourself :) and ultimate a metaphysical love for each other that can't be described with words. I will try to summarize the type of people who might enjoy this movie (if you don't fit in any description, you might enjoy it as wellwho knows): 1) Got married and kept on thinking about the meaning of love, what's marital love, what's true love kept on meditating on love in general and see yourself on that path for the rest of your life. 2) Got married and ever fear about loosing that connection to your other significant being (after all 50% of marriages in the US crumble at some point...) 3) Got kids and got the feeling suddenly you got to some extent ""sidelined"", something typical of today's society with the pressures that a career puts on the main financial provider of modern western families. 4) Ever felt Platonic Love, with the extreme joy and pain which it represents if it finally didn't get realized. 5) Ever traveled alone to foreign cultures and felt the loneliness feeling of being a complete foreigner (in all sense of the word). 6) Have the capacity to enjoy movies with simple themes well brought to the movie screen in terms of script, music, sound, editing, etc probably 97% of critics who acclaimed this movie fit this description.After I finished watching, I couldn't get enough of it; sadly I come to the realization that it will be extremely hard for any other producer/director to match Lost in Translation, even Sofia sorry Sofia, you did too good, your bar is so high now!",Lost in Translation

The interesting part of this movie is, it gave me many hint of the possibility of ""sex"", but the possibility never comes to reality. From the first scene Charlotte's butt to the Big Bed (the director made everything very nice and reasonable, so it was never too much), but along with the story's telling, then you feel it's not gonna happen, there is no passion of that kind of feeling. From Charlotte's ""what's the purpose of life"" and Bob's ""I want to become more healthy"", and more, you will see they found they built some unusual connection between each others while they facing all kind of confusions.At the end, they are facing to choose lost again or hold it...10/10",Lost in Translation

This is certainly not one of his better films, comedy wise.  The cinematography was excellent, and the feel of the Japanese culture is well represented here. As a student of Japanese and the Japanese culture, I probably had a greater appreciation of the film, and thus scored it a little higher than I might have otherwise.  But if you're looking for Bill Murray to shine in all his whacky and zany antics, look elsewhere.  Try ""Groundhog Day"" and ""What About Bob?"" instead.

It's about observing the alienation mirrored throughout the mundane events in the lives of these two characters.This movie isn't a love story and i don't think bob and charlotte were soulmates. I just think they're two lost souls in a foreign city who in a simple moment, forged a real intimate connection with each other. They simply were both in a time of their lives where they needed a friend. And these two strangers were able to find comfort in one another, not because they're in love but because they somehow have a mutual understanding of what it feels like to be in a room full of people and still feel alone. Alone and disconnected.They could sense each other's vulnerability and were able to open up to each other. They only know the present version of each other and sometimes that connection with a stranger can be just as intimate because a stranger doesn't need the details, they just listen.In a way, this movie feels so real and familiar. Everyone's had a time in their life when they've felt isolated from everything and everyone around them. A time in your life where you feel stuck and like you're just existing. And sometimes in those vulnerable moments of your life you doubt that there is another soul in the world who understands the way you feel.

Bill's performance is the best acting job I have ever seen him do.A couple of things that are debated:(1) Stereotypes: They are not there. At the very beginning of the movie I was concerned that it would make fun of the Japanese culture, but I think it treated it fairly and understandable. Because it is so different and strage to us and the characters, it seems offensive, but it is accurate. Also comical. A fish out of water is funny. Remember Crocodile Dundee?

No, we've (unfortunately) never actually met, but this is the second time that she's been able to move me, to talk to me and leave me with a beautiful and at the same time horrific feeling of melancholy... few friends are able to do that.Of course, last time was in 1999 with the heartbreaking ""Virgin Suicides"". I can't remember how I persuaded some friends to go and see that movie, but afterward nobody complained. Except my heart, which was bleeding for a good three days after.Lost in Translation seems to be doing the same thing (although I only saw it yesterday). Thank God for independent cinema complexes in Belgium, as the large ones didn't carry the movie. As with the Virgin Suicides, the movie doesn't grip you immediately, it just kind of slowly creeps up on you. You get to like Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson for the losers they are, and, let's face it, we've all been in that position before (those who have had to travel for work anyway) - so we can relate, although we might not want to admit it. A short summary: Bob (Bill Murray) is a somewhat over-the-hill actor who's in Japan to endorse a brand of whiskey for the money, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is married to a photographer on mission in Japan. Both are lost in a country where they don't know many people and don't speak the language, and their chance meeting is the only thing that keeps them sane. And of course friendship (and love?) grows... And leaves you and me, spectators, overwhelmed.Rarely have I seen such beautiful photography in a movie (the colors, people, the colors!) - and the actors are brilliant. Bill Murray's Oscar nomination was more than deserved, as well as Scarlett's BAFTA award for best actress.

Bill Murray handles his serious role very well in this movie. At the end, you wanted him to win.
I turned the volume up on my surround sound speakers in an effort to hear exactly what Bill says to Scarlett on the street in the last scene, to no avail. My guess is he told her that it would be kind of impossible to end up together. BUT, that in reality was exactly what they both wanted. If he were single, he would find a way to make that happen. If Scarlett was single, he would make changes in his life to end up with her as soon as possible. She is a big-time keeper.

Not only is it a chick flick, all about some girl's angsty time in Tokyo that's supposed to seem all existential and meaningful just because she's bummed to find that her boyfriend is cheating on her. But its also a lame art film, which means it has no plot and lots of ""real"" characters and situations that, BECAUSE they're slow and boring, are supposed to be all noble and better than a movie with great characters, writing and plot.

On that level alone, with its mute longing and sexual tension, I can identify with him.And then there is Charlotte, a student of philosophy seeking herself, her soul lost and adrift.  She doesn't know who she is, doesn't know what she wants.  Her life is a quest for authenticity of self.  And I identify with her because so much of my life I have been seeking the same thing.This movie isn't for everyone.  They will call it boring, lifeless, limp. There are people, I realize, who have never experienced that kind of longing, who had never sought meaning in their lives, and searched for their own lost souls.  They live for the here and now, without giving a thought to the spiritual aspects of life.  A friend said introverts will love this movie, extraverts will hate it.  I think that is a fair surface assessment.  This movie is all about the inner lives of two people whose souls connect for a brief time in an alien city.

I went into this movie prepared to fully embrace it but left the theater with a bad taste in my mouth wondering how Sophia Coppola managed to trick so many people into falling for this movie. Oh it's got style, but that's about all it's got. I found the characters to be shallow and bratty, the script to be devoid of anything interesting. It's like she's being handed these accolades for an eloquently filmed piece of junk. All of the jokes were at the expense of the Japanese which leads me to believe that Sophia couldn't write a straight ahead comedy to save her life. Let's just wait and see if she can come up with another art for nothings sake movie for her third film and if the critics finally catch on to the trick. One scene that really bugged me in the movie was when 8 1/2 was playing on the TV in the hotel room. Was she trying to draw comparisons between Bill Murray's character and Marcello Mastroianni's? If so she clearly took no cues from Fellini's masterpiece and its a completely wasted and shallow gesture. That was a film with deep emotional issues light years beyond her little shallow Hollywood girl comprehension.",Lost in Translation

For the last seven minutes, I've tried to figure out the best way to start this review.  There are so many things to say about this film.  Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" is simply, perfect.  I say simply, because the film is rather simple itself.  It is what it is, whatever that means.  This is a film that will effect different people in different ways.  Me, I love this film with my heart and soul.  This is a film with some of the most realistic and honest characters I've seen.  Bob Harris and Charlotte are two people emotionally lost.  Lost within themselves, lost within their place in life.  These are real people who need each other.  Their relationship is comforting and sad.  Sofia Coppola has written a beautiful connection between two lost souls.  Bill Murray honestly gives his best performance ever.  He is that person.  You are watching Bob Harris find comfort when he meets Charlotte. Scarlett Johansson is astonishing as this wonderful person.  She is an extremely talented actress bringing Charlotte to life in every way.  You care for Charlotte, wishing her problems are solved. Every moment in this film is special.   Sofia Coppola's use of Tokyo is truly amazing.  The culture is used as a character in this film.  From confusion to comfort to overwhelmed, the city is a representation of Bob and Charlotte's relationship.  This film is great.  It's difficult to write about ""Lost in Translation"".  There is so much to say about these people.  The film is hilarious and moving. A drama about love represented in a subtle, yet powerful way.  I love how these two people want to hold each other, but can't. (SPOILER) There is a scene when Bob and Charlotte are lying next to each other in bed, talking about marriage and their problems.  She moves around, making herself more comfortable and close.  He is still, but lightly taps on her foot.  You know exactly how much these two care for each other.  The japanese talk-show: hilarious.  Bob's reactions to the japanese host are priceless.  I could go on about every scene from first frame to last, but I don't have enough space to write.  This film is special.  The ending is a perfect definition for why I'm a film-geek.  I've seen this movie 4 times as of writing this.  I can't wait to see it again.  Sofia Coppola and her cast & crew have brought a great achievment to cinema.",Lost in Translation
900,buscador26,A complex and yet simple film,10,30 November 2003,"I don't have much to add to the many comments here, but I do want to address some themes that have been popping up, particularly charges of ""American-centric"" attitudes, ""stereotyping,"" and the relationship between the Charlotte and Bob.Different cultures are, well, different.  Both Charlotte and Bob are bewildered and amazed by the new place they're in; they seek ""sameness"" simply to be able to deal with the situation they're in.  I studied in Spain in 1998, and even though I knew the language, there were many things I simply couldn't relate to (jokes making fun of Catalans, for example), and there were times when I simply wanted to sit back, watch MTV Europe and the latest episode of ""Daria"" in English.  This has nothing to do with ""otherness"" or being close-minded; it has more to do with just feeling isolated and overwhelmed.  Heck, I felt this way when I first visited New York City, and it's in the same country as me!  So I don't think Bob and Charlotte are narrow-minded or not willing to bridge cultural differences; they are simply in an odd place in life, and they can't speak very much Japanese.  (Charlotte does try to make several attempts to bridge the differences, but there are things she just can't relate to.)  Also, keep in mind that a good quarter of the movie shows them enjoying Japanese culture quite a bit, if only superficially.I don't see where this movie shows the Japanese in a stereotypical light. It portrays an innovative, quirky, complex, and vibrant culture...much like our own!  I didn't see any timid women in kimonos or geeky Japanese businessmen; I saw an amazing ultra-modern city presented in its full glory, warts and all.Lastly, I think much of Charlotte and Bob's relationship stems from the fact that they are in very similar situations.  Both of their marriages are falling apart, both are in a huge city where they don't speak the language, and both feel like they haven't been accomplishing much in their lives recently.  There were certainly hints that more could've happened, and in a lesser film, more would've happened, but Coppola takes the subtle route. It's true that Lost in Translation doesn't have much plot, but a lot of great movies don't have much of a plot (8 1/2, Cries and Whispers, and Wings of Desire come to mind immediately.)  Coppola portrays a very particular and peculiar moment between two strangers in a strange place, and she succeeds beautifully.",Lost in Translation

This movie does away with chase and romance and exposes what a connection is. Is everyone so blind? What they have in this movie is a friendship, an understanding that transcends all else.

906,markos-9,"A shallow, boring film by Sofia Coppola.",1,4 February 2004,"The story is about two people who meet at Japan by chance. A bored rich movie star, Bob Harris (Murray), who goes to Japan to do some commercial ads and a girl, Charlotte (Johansson), who is there with her busy young husband who is also there on work. Both of them are bored and tired of their relationships for no apparent reason. The husband is always at work, trying to make a living, and Murray's woman is at home doing her best as a mother and a wife.It seems clear to me that the plot and the story is written by someone that has not a deep life experience, but rather suits to a shallow personality who has led an easy life. It is clear how empty the plot is. There is too little dialogue in 1h and 40' of film. There is not a moment in this movie, that you can really identify with those shallow characters, which make no effort to recuperate their bonds with their partners, but they rather lie on the bed all the time, doing nothing but complaint about their lives.The filming is quite good, and I would be a little suspicious about daddy Coppola giving a hand to the daughter. But it's quite pointless because the whole plot can not be saved by any good photography or montage tricks.
Another meaningless point is that the majority of the dialogues is in Japanese without any explanation or subtitles. Maybe because the dialogues between the two main characters are so shallow and empty that the rest of the movie should be filled with something. An easy way to do it, is fill it with Japanese that nobody understands.This film is rated as Drama/Comedy/Romance. That needs a little commenting. Drama : There is not a single point in the movie where you can really feel the drama. What's so dramatic about two bored people who want to cheat on their partners? Unless they mean the drama of the protagonist's partners. They are the only people in the movie that do something useful and maybe the ones that you could feel sorry for. Comedy : There are attempts in the movie to make people laugh with low quality humor, like a Japanese guy in a funny suit, or a Japanese director who shouts. I mean, making fun of the Japanese is not what comedy is about I think. Not a single intelligent humorous line. Romance : Where? When? In the whole film they never have a really romantic moment. They are mostly separated, each one in his own room, doing nothing but laying on the bed getting bored and boring the viewers as well.
After one hour and forty minutes of a shallow, pointless, and boring story, comes the end. This is a significant point in the movie because here you can really see the weakness of the storyline and the emptiness of the plot. The film ends with Murray whispering something that the public can't hear in Charlotte's ear. She says ok, and the film ends with them separating but smiling. That means that you can end it! Sofia can't do it, so the public will. Everyone with his personal explanation so that we will have a chat about the movie afterwards. This ending could be  genius in another movie, but in this one, it just is an easy trick, a `Deus Ex Machina' that would save the story.In conclusion, I believe that this is a very shallow story about two bored and boring people who's lives are empty because they are empty. Excuse me for using these two words so much, but they can resume the movie quite well I think. Shallow and Boring.",Lost in Translation

908,customer-service,"Main star = Tokyo, Co-starring Bill Murray",9,30 April 2004,"""You have to see Lost in Translation before you go...""Pretty much all I heard when I told several friends I was going to Tokyo.
In actuality, I made a point of NOT watching this film before I went and how glad I was, when I arrived.In total, I think I viewed this movie 5 times whilst staying at my hostel in Azabu-Juban. I don't remember suggesting we watch it once but after the first time, I wasn't in any hurry to switch it off.Viewing Lost in Translation in one of Tokyos 23 wards (Minato-Ku), surrounded by Japanese, Spanish, Canadian, French and American Backpackers is about as good a location as one could possibly imagine. Having spent two days in the City, I had very little knowledge of Japan but JUST enough to stop LIT spoiling too many of the surprises.The first thing that struck me was the cinematography. On my first viewing, I had little interest in the role of either Murray or Johansson. The film seemed to capture perfectly the intensity of the heavily-urbanized areas, the sheer chaos that neither London or New York can compete with. The whole feeling of being the only gaijin in an otherwise homogenous society.
Subsequent viewings enabled me to get a feel for the characters and, despite having no empathetical feelings towards either one of them, appreciate their roles and contribution towards the feature as a whole. As Bob Harris, a protagonist whose problems seemingly result from his failure to fully recognise how much he truly has, Bill Murray gives a wonderful performance. Johansson's drippish character is also played very well but like Harris, she seems desperate to invent conflicts plus has a visual-facade that hides the reality of her true shallowness. Indeed, Charlotte is a most objectionable character with whom only those viewers who find their lives too void of actual difficulties, could actually connect with. However, she is the perfect complement to Murray's Harris in this sense.I gave this film a 9 because Coppola genuinely captured some of Tokyos Spirit in a way few films have managed (for any city) before.As a final point - I would like to make it clear that none of the Japanese persons in my company, found the humor offensive at any point.

She sets a mood and is very skilled.My gripe with the movie lies in the story. If I were to give this movie a grade based solely on that, I would give it a 6. It's very realistic and has some parts that made me crack a smile. I even laughed a couple of times. It's pure and believable, for the most part. Some argument has been raised on here as to whether or not it isn't, and although you could argue both ways, I think it was truthful for the most part, and not too fantastical.Even if it isn't or is, however, what's the point? The storyline is a guy in a normal marriage looking for spice and a girl in a marriage that she is questioning start spending time together. There is an attraction beyond friendship, but both somewhat realize that there's point to delve into it. A bit of emotion, a bit of fun, and we have a weak story that really doesn't say much. It's just indulgent directing carried along by a bland but well-told story. I would have cast Murray too, as his quirky humor did lift this movie on occasion.As for all the people who think that the humor borders on racial stereotyping, if you were in Japan, and you finally found someone you could identify with after many days of quasi-alienation, I think you'd quickly try and find a way to identify as well as you could with the only person who is willing and able to give you attention. The barrier of language is tough, and that point is made well by the movie.However, this movie suffered from the beginning. There really is no story. It's subtle, but more because it's not really inspired; there is no contention.I got a very Salinger-esquire feel from it, in a way. It's just a story that tries to make something out of nothing. It's not particularly aware, it's not particularly funny, it's not particularly enlightening, and yet there is a tiny piece of all of that in it.6/10",Lost in Translation

The slightest glance can mean so many things: disgust, bewilderment, irritation, incredulity or sarcasm. Then the eyes revert to their deadpan glaze, and you wait with giggly anticipation for the next subtle reaction.""Lost in Translation,"" Sofia Coppola's charmingly offbeat film, finds Murray in Tokyo, bored and existentially flummoxed as Bob Harris, a past-his-prime actor who has come to the Japanese capital to shoot a series of lucrative whiskey commercials.Harris is not a happy camper. He's surrounded by a culture that's eerily familiar -- in terms of its shameless, gross commercialism -- yet also exclusive. The incessant bows and smiles that follow him are artificial, a Kabuki show. Things aren't better at home, either. His conversations with his wife in the United States are emotionally frigid. She sends him rug samples for his new office at home. She needs his opinion but apparently not his love.At his hotel, Bob meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), the bored twenty-something wife of a fashion photographer (Giovanni Ribisi) who's also in town for some commercial gig. Ignored by her husband, who's captivated by his famous, comely models, Charlotte is at loose ends. Like Bob, she feels empty and unfulfilled. And like Bob, she can't sleep. Late one night, they find themselves sitting next to each other at the hotel bar. They compare notes. He's been married 25 years, she for two. She tells him she studied philosophy in college.""There's a good buck in that racket,"" jokes Bob. These two may be years apart in age (he's in his fifties), but it's clear they're made for each other. And in this neon-lit limbo, where everything is strange, that's very compelling.If Murray has an imposing corner on the comic dynamism in this movie, Johansson is no less compelling for her mysticism, self-assurance and charm. She's as vital to this movie as he is, for it's her life force that recharges his spiritual dead battery. Ignored and unappreciated by their spouses, they give each other newfound purpose. And you feel yourself almost screaming for these two to find some way to join souls and live the life they should.On the surface, ""Lost in Translation,"" which Coppola also wrote, is about the crazy pop-life of Tokyo. Bob has to contend, at one point, with a hooker he hasn't even requested who refuses to take no for an answer. And you haven't lived till you've seen Bob doing a karaoke version of Elvis Costello's ""(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding?"" or his new Japanese buddy (called Charlie Brown) singing along to the Sex Pistols' ""God Save the Queen.""But the movie is also about two souls getting ever closer. The crucial question is: What kind of relationship should they have? Are they aspiring friends, lovers or both? Or neither? For an entire, thoroughly enjoyable movie, they undergo a sort of delicate negotiation.

Through the film a soft and original music entangled with the commercial bright signs of the streets of Tokyo makes it even more unique. Two Americans in a place with a completely different mentality will make them come closer and discreetly flirt with each other.A movie that is not for everyone that's for sure. Most people might describe it as boring and pretentious. In my opinion this is one of the best films ever made and the reason is because of its originality and the fact that is ahead of its time. Great acting performance from Billy Murray and Scarlett Johansson. Sofia Coppola did an amazing job by writing and directing this masterpiece.",Lost in Translation
919,NeuroticMovieLover,An Existentialist Movie With Purpose,9,14 July 2006,"The first time I saw ""Lost In Translation,"" I found it to be dull, pointless, and rather alienating. However, after having watched it again a few more times thereafter, I finally saw the immense beauty of the film. Bob Harris and Charlotte, the main characters of the film, are in search of meaning...of a translation. They want to know what their lives translate to...what their purpose is. As the two find themselves hopelessly lost in their search, they discover each other. They find out that sometimes there is no certain definition to life and that those who try to define it find themselves losing its essential meaning. I think that's the beauty of this film...the message that so much is lost through translation...so much of the real things in life are overlooked in the process of trying to understand them.",Lost in Translation

(And that would have been unfortunate--don't get me wrong.) The film is well done and worth a look, but it's very much in the category of ""rent, don't buy"".I've never been to Tokyo, and I might think differently about it if I had. (For example, my Dad really enjoyed ""The Sound of Music"" (he's not a big fan of musicals) because it showed so much of Austria, where he had lived for several years.) Very early in the movie it was clear that the film was as much about ""here is what the experience of being in Tokyo is like"" as it was about anything else. That's a perfectly valid thing for a film to be about, but if something gets nominated for best picture, you might expect a little more. Now, granted, the relationship that forms is interesting--it's not like the story is pathetic and Tokyo is the only thing the movie has going for it. But...Best Director? Best Actor? Best Picture? That's just way, way overdoing it.If you want to enjoy it, go into it with this in mind: ""I want to see what being in Tokyo is like."" If that's your only expectation, you'll like the film.

Two seperately married individuals, one younger and hopeless in her youth (Scarlett Johansson), the other older but arguably more discontent yet well versed in survival in a lonely world (Bill Murray), in each other they find a missing piece in after meeting in a hotel lobby. Over the course of their stay they uncover a shared depth in one another which gives birth to an inevitable but unacknowledged friendship which blooms into something that could be so very much more. The irony that both are tied by social expectation and convention elsewhere and yet clearly anchored together by a much deeper connection and sense of understanding for the emptiness that surrounds them makes it all the more challenging to watch without hoping for them to make the right choice. But what is the right choice? A very lovely film that describes the essence of emotional connection between people that transcends age, time and circumstance.

923,goyamjain-212-381704,Shoegazing : Skywatching,8,27 March 2017,"Lost in Translation is a beautiful and well made cinema. Single thought : If there was one thing movie was trying to say is that we all are just vaguely living our half lives, unsure of our hazy present. But we can at any time grab what life is offering, accepting its incomprehensible course (lost). Overall: 8/10Story and screenplay : Well written. It is more sketching of characters and dwelling into them. Extremely grounded, there is not much else happening which is fine since one can dive deep into extremely relatable characters and common life issues being faced by them. Most of movie is about our two main characters trying to make sense out of world around. Be it language barrier scene for Bob, various enigmatic views of Tokyo, or alone trip to Kyoto. Again, So much is lost in making sense of every thing going around. But then again, why don't accept what is gained and be reactive to it. Overall: 8/10Cinematography: Its purposeful cinematography mostly. But experimentation is vast in other parts. Bridge scene of Tokyo being one such stand out. We are mostly kept in wide range to take characters along with their environment and not independent of them, at all times. Overall : 7/10Editing: Very edgy and thought provoking. Every time a scene cuts, one is left wondering and interpreting. While sudden cuts work well in most cases, it did seem rather shoved in for sake of it. Overall: 6/10Acting : oh how amazing Bill Murray is. Perfectly projecting crisis he is into. But Scarlett wins the show hands down. You have to watch movie to know how perfectly both roles have been projected. Support cast had minimum work to do but were did fine job too. Overall: 9/10Direction and tone: Sofia Coppola does fine job of going the hard way and believing in purpose of movie. Movie is grounded, close to reality and tone melds in very well. It stays true to exploration of personalities and answering common life questions. At no point characters are made to look silly due to emotions. Quirky humor here and there fits perfectly. Surely pace could have been improved. Editing could have been more meaningful. Story could have few more elements but overall a great job. Overall: 8/10Music, locations, and costumes : Use of alternate music genres with likes of My bloody Valentine and Air well used. Music is so important in the film that there is a whole 5 minutes scene with nothing but drunk people on karaoke. Music here reflects lost, edgy, yet melodious qualities that the movie is trying hard to project. Locations are spellbinding. Tokyo is mostly seen from above the horizon with city and locations itself an integral part of story. We see so many shots of Tokyo both from inside and out in the sky(if it ever is visible in Tokyo) that we bow down to its dominating powerful and chaotic presence. Overall : 9/10Final thought: go watch with patience, absorb characters, relate, start living them as movie progresses, and come out as a better person and have great experience watching good cinema.",Lost in Translation

Sofia Coppola and Scarlette Johansson were at the screening (and I'm pretty sure I saw Francis Ford Coppola taking a seat).Bill Murray and Scarlette Johansson give amazing performances, especially in the moments when they convey emotions without speaking. These performances were of course brought on by Sofia Coppola's sensitive and powerful directions.Sofia Coppola has really stepped up from the Virgin Suicides with Lost in Translation. I love almost everything about this film - the beautiful visuals of Tokyo's city landscapes, the music (similar to the Virgin Suicides soundtrack), the unconventional bond between Bob and Charlette, the loneliness of these characters, and their search for meaning in their lives...All in all this is a beautiful film.

It s just a wonderful flick with Sophia not even trying to fulfil what maybe fans of e.g. ""Lord of the rings"" would expect of a movie: a plot as the main and substancial part of a film. There IS a plot, and I think its not less original than the plots of most movies, because its quite a common theme: midlife-crisis and love - and this doesn t necessarliy have to mean that with this quite often used theme you couldn t make a extraordenary movie - it s the opposite thing: sometimes its even harder to make a good movie about an old theme. And Sophia reachs this goal. With ""Lost in translation"" she made an extraordinary movie - a movie thats oh so fresh! The marvelous acting, beautiful pictures and with love developed characters in this film create an atmosphere of warmth, desperateness, happiness and seriousness all in one! After ""The Virgin Suicides"" that were hard to top, she did it again.

His wife and family back in the States seem to have other things on their minds than him. Scarlett Johansson is a young woman in Tokyo also lonely and bored (yawn) and disappointed in her current life. Not only is she shacked up with a guy more interested in his career than her, but he has left her alone while he goes on a job assignment without leaving her so much as a sex toy with which to amuse herself.

Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson play an odd and transient pair of companions: he an older actor, on the gentle downward slope of a still-respectable career, she a recent Philosophy graduate trying to cope with the difficulties of her marriage and a creeping sense of purposelessness. Sophia Coppola tells the story of the budding affection between these two slightly lost people with great affection and skill, and sets this against the visually dazzling backdrop of Tokyo, a city she clearly loves.  With deft strokes she lays out the strange blend of confusion, fascination and alienation such visitors might feel in Tokyo.  Her shot selection is wonderful, and she has a discerning eye for the most interesting bits and oddities in a strange and magical city.  But as lovely as the setting is, it never overshadows the tenative affection that Bob and Charlotte start to feel for each other.This relationship--and what it says about the ephemeral and yet enduring nature of human connection--is the emotional heartstring of this film.

The movie is very subtle and with a toned down tempo; the main characters are well played by both Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray. But I think that Ms. Coppola missed out of something when writing this.Both main characters are like zombies in a world filled with pastiche-like technology freaks. The only times the characters live up in any way are when they met each other and not even then do they really come alive. During the entire movie I found myself thinking ""Come on, do something"". Nothing happened, so I waited for some kind of action from the characters but the lack of this was total.

939,casperfidelio,My personal favourite,10,7 November 2019,"We follow two people in different stages of life. Their bond grows so strong over the course of this movie, that it feels so real.For me, this movie hit all the right marks - sentiment, melancholy, sadness, happiness, anger, loneliness and above all, deep, deep love for each other that is more than a sensual hunger.Charlotte and Bob couldn't have been more perfectly cast - Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray, respectively - and Sofia Coppola knew that well; she wouldn't have made the movie if Bill refused to take the role.But he accepted and what we ended up with is a nihilistic, romantic story that goes beyond the dialogue. We know the feelings of each character before they meet each other, and it's not hard to relate to them. Are you the young person, striving to be something bigger than yourself but not quite sure exactly what? Or are you the person that's a little fed up with life, slowly and quietly lives it out, seemingly numb to the good things in life?The brilliant mix of these two types of characters couldn't be expressed better than in a foreign place like Tokyo: lovely, beautiful but confusing and belittling, the perfect background for someone to have their heart on their sleeve. But only those that understand each other - both literally and figuratively - can read each others' heart.Bob and Charlotte connect quickly when they find out they have a lot in common, such as insomnia because of the jet-lag, a soulmate that seems to have lost their initial soul and their interest in each other, and they decide to explore the city together. Bob is a mentor, while Charlotte is a playmate that lets him appreciate life more than he did before.Their happiness won't last longer than a few days, because then they'll have to go their own ways again, but with some marvelous experiences to make up for it. This looms over them.Yes, it's quite a simple love story and not a lot of exciting stuff happens on screen - but what *does* happen is so sincere, so beautiful and detailed, and not to mention, it'll give you the occasional chuckle.What I might find most interesting about this film is that Bob Harris sounds a lot like Bill Murray and Charlotte is close to Scarlett - the line between acting and real life has, to me, faded so much that it's hard to tell the distinction. Bill Murray used to be a huge hit-actor and hadn't seen as much success around the time this movie was made. Bob Harris is Bill Murray. Charlotte's character is based on Sofia Coppola herself, and Scarlett, despite her young age, moves her character forward with so much grace and relatibility - for me, as a young person - that it's not hard to see why she became as big of an idol as she is these days.To me, this is my staple movie, the movie that makes me feel everything I want to feel and shows me everything I want to see.

You know the fable of the emperor who was conned into believing that his new suit of clothes was so exquisite, that it was invisible to anyone unworthy of serving him, when actually he really had no clothes on. In the case of ""Lost in Translation"", the emperor's daughter produced the worst film of the year, and the critics are too afraid to say that it is an incoherent boring mess. I have seen better films directed by high school students. There are about two minutes worth of clever idea in this film, and the rest of it is strung together as if the director pulled a bunch of film clips out of a box and attached them in random order. When it got too boring, she tossed in the tasteless nightclub scene to wake up those who were falling asleep. There is no characterization or empathy created. There is nothing of value anywhere in this film.

A long side loneliness, depression is also seen, it is seen in both characters whether it's Charlotte almost constantly glum facial expression or Bob's condescending, blunt tone and way of speaking, Bob seems to know who he is and the world around him too well and seems sick and tired of everything. Charlotte feels she knows nothing and doesn't know her path in life, she is so detached from everything, often depicted by picturesque wide shots of her alone staring out of the window onto a busy Tokyo she's alienated from the world around her. Charlotte and Bob are so different, Charlotte young, Bob quite old, one with and established career, one only just out of college, however in many ways they are the same, they share the same sense of loneliness, depression and isolation from almost everyone and everything and this is where the true beauty of the film lies. They meet of course and connect instantly, Charlotte starts to smile and Bob starts to joke, both completely different when with each other, they love each other but it is far from sexual love more like spiritual love, they are almost instant soul mates.Lost in translation hits just right, beautifully filmed, unexpectedly funny, acted brilliantly, paced to perfection with an interesting ending.

See it only for them.As an American who knows Japan and speaks Japanese, be informed Americans: there are cheap shots at work here. Like inaccurate gags about Asians inverting the L and R when speaking English. And just the snide way in which Murray's character dismisses so much of Japan and its culture. American cynics are hardly heroes! It's amazing to me that Ms. Coppola could set a film in Japan and then show us so little of it. (Hotels? Whoo! Whoo!) For that reason, I found the situations between Murray and Johanssen unbelievable. Real American characters in their situations would get off their rumps and experience more of Japan than hotel cocktail lounges.Ms. Coppola is skilled in her craft, just not in her writing. There are clever moments using sound to move the plot, for example, and it's nicely edited. But that's where the praise ends.

The core of the story, an attraction between an older man and a younger woman could happen anywhere.  The backdrop (mostly late night Tokyo) made me smile, remembering 1000 similar nights jumping back and forth between cities on the other side of the Pacific.  The same bars, the same karaoke, the same ugly Americans, the same silly brushes with cultures familiar and strange.Some reviewers have complained that the movie is some sort of sniggering in-joke, with the Japanese being largely unsubtitled, and several interesting scenes (like a visit to a shrine in Kyoto) going by silently and unexplained.  The point is, it's supposed to be that way.  We're seeing Japan through the eyes of innocents abroad.  They don't understand half of what's going on around them, and you don't have to either.  If you've spent enough time in Japan or elsewhere in Asia to catch some of the background, so much the better.  If not, make like the characters.

But apart from the junk I happen to see everyday ,""Lost in translation"" is by far the most beautiful and meaningful movie I've seen lately.The story line is simple, a neglected wife and a middle-aged actor meet, from all the places possible, in Japan, in a classy, standard hotel. What do they have in common? Insomnia and a feeling of always being in the wrong place with the wrong people. Did you ever get the feeling you're the only normal , sane, human being on a 5 miles's area ? This feeling of being inaproppriate creates quite an unique bond between them. There is a very vague sexual tension, because their connection is more a spiritual one, a mutual understanding.They are both married, both unhappy, and somewhat disappointed of what life turned out for them. But they find answers and strength and most important hope , in each other . From Bill Murray's cute and innocent little jokes to the final scenes of the long awaited kiss that was bound to happen,the movie just leaves you breathless.

958,andrew4858,A Movie For Our Times,10,16 September 2004,"First of all, I found the movie to be very entertaining. I love the cinematography, dialogue, acting, characters, and especially the scenes of Tokyo. By just watching this movie I now have a strong desire to visit Japan. And of course I thought the soundtrack was absolute perfection...My Bloody Valentine, Phoenix, Jesus and Mary Chain...awesome stuff.My second reason is that I found the central theme of the movie to be a very truthful representation of many people living in our time. I believe that the main characters being in a foreign country with a foreign language was a way of showing that they felt like foreigners in general. They didn't understand why they were alive. They were looking for answers but not really doing a great job of it. They are not heroes. They are regular people struggling to understand their place in the world. The fact that they are trying at all to find the answers is encouraging to me. Most films do not even bring up the question of our purpose in living. ""Lost in Translation"" asks the big questions. In that way I would compare it to ""Magnolia"", ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""Adaptation"". Of course the film also takes a close look at marriage and romance. We see the obvious mistakes that they both make (especially Bill Murray's character). Because the movie does not present them as examples I am not bothered by this. When he sleeps with the singer the casual sex is in no way presented as a positive. The movie both shows him as feeling ashamed and just plain stupid. The innocence of Scarlett Johansen's character only brings this feeling out even more strongly in him. The fact that the two never actually have any sexual encounter also shows that their relationship is not limited to romance. This makes the movie totally outside of the norm in most Hollywood films. Usually sexual desire is something you automatically follow. ""Lost in Translation"" shows the negative effects of adultery. Murray and Johansen never have sex though. They are both seeking answers. They find some encouragement from each other. It seems clear to me that Johansen's character is especially encouraged to love her husband more than ever once he returns. I think she understands that neither of them are perfect and that's OK. Even Bill Murray's character seems inspired to go on with life through his experiences in Tokyo.I could go on even further with this movie. I could talk about Scarlett Johansen's longing to be loved and admired for her beauty (her karaoke song is just one example of this). I don't think that is a wrong desire either. Bill Murray has the desire to teach, to share, and to laugh. The key to the movie is both are seekers, not examples. If you look at the movie that way there is a power just because they are seeking and don't look for the answers in having sex with each other or some superficial answer like that. ""Lost in Translation"" asks the big question about why we are alive. What is our purpose? The movie doesn't completely answer the question but it gets the viewer going in the right direction.There is no clear cut answer at the end of the film. But that is because people in general don't know the answer to the question. The movie is about seeking the truth. And I love it!",Lost in Translation

960,goofrider,"An American ""mood film"" that works (5/5)",10,20 December 2003,"In my opinion, this movie is comparable to Kar-Wai Wong's movies -- mood movies. There's not much of a plot, the story doesn't advance much, there are many little insignificant (or even boring) little slices of life in the movie, all for a purpose of capturing a mood or a feeling.Here in ""Lost in Translation"", that feeling it tried to capture is the feeling of being isolated and disconnected, particularly from the person you love most (their spouses). Obviously, being lost in the Japanese culture served only as a symbolism to that feeling.There were quite a few ppl found it offensive how the movie poked fun @ the Japanese and how stereotypical those jokes were. Well, as stereotypical as the jokes were, they felt real (if you've ever been to Japan you'd know, e.g. it's really common and acceptable for Japanese men to go to strip clubs to socialize on a weekend). The fact that you might be offended clearly shows how different YOU are from THEM. Which is the purpose of those scenes (at least in the first half). They weren't meant to be condescending. And it's critical the the story and how those aforementioned feelings parallel each other.In the beginning our main characters only see the differences between themselves and this foreign land around them, and it was amplified multifold by the utter loneliness they already felt before they got there, which they brought with them to this land. When Bob was at the photo shoot, and poke fun of the director's English, it was clear that he's not trying to be rude, but simply trying to make himself comfortable to survive the experience. ****** It was a parallel of his relationship with his wife. ****** You can immediately see that that's pretty much what his home life is like -- his wife babbling about things that he couldn't understand (like the tiles thing), while he cracks jokes just to show that he's at least listening and wonder how he ended up in this situation in the first place.The young Charlotte wander around Tokyo alone in many little scenes. Many viewers found those scenes boring. I believe that they serve the purpose to show that maybe she was lonely and lost, but she's still ***searching****. Looking for a purpose, looking for a outlet. She hasn't given up on life and the possibilities like Bob Harris had.It's rather important that you understand how she felt when she was talking to her friend (her mom??) on the phone and suddenly bursted into tears spontaneously. That's the kind of loneliness she brought with her to Tokyo, and just then and there did she fully realized it.If you don't understand nor identify with that feeling, you probably won't enjoy the movie. I do believe the movie could've better explained their situations back at home so the audience can better understand the kind of loneliness they came from. But I understand that was what Sofia Coppola trying to do here: This is a movie that captures a feeling, and often times we don't know where our feeling came from and where it's going. This is a picture with no real beginning or a real ending, it's just a mood, a small snapshot of life. It's meant to be incomplete.As much as Charlotte is still searching, Bob is still ***hoping***. He still loves his wife. The scene where he's in the bathtub and told her ""I love you"" after she hung up, the fact that his wife calls her at the most inconvinient time and he still picks up, etc. She's not just a responsibility to him, he still cares about her, he just doesn't know how to anymore.And this is what the movie ultimately is about. It's not just about 2 strangers becoming friends for a few days in a foreign country and how they touched each other. It's about them discovering life and its possibilities once again. The real hope doesn't lie between them, but in each of them with their respective partner at home.The romance felt very convincing. It's nice to see an American movie treat this May-October romance with self-awareness and realism. They both knew the tension between them (Charlotte called him on his mid-life crisis in the first conversation they had, right off the bat). The romance is very restrained, and it emphasizes admiration and companionship rather than physical attraction. It felt just right: a little bittersweet, yet heartwarming and cute.As a film in the mood movie genre (in Kar-Wai Wong's tradition, and Sofia Coppola's own ""the Virgin Suicides""), it's plain, understated, and fully of little slices of insignificant everyday life. But it added the Hollywood touch of humor and a rather tasteful soundtrack, and rose this film above the typical Kar-Wai Wong's mood films (which I find most of them pretty boring, actually).Ultimately, a mood movie is still a mood movie. You either feel it or you don't. You won't enjoy a mood movie if you don't identify or understand the mood it tries to capture, and it'll be just a REALLY BORING film. ""Lost in Translation"" is one of those type of films. Except that it had the saving grace of the humor that sprinkled all over the movie and make it enjoyable for the rest of the viewers who don't understand extreme loneliness or never been deeply touched by a stranger before.Personally, I could identify with those feelings very much, and this is one of my favorite movies of all time.

961,Jon-Umber,A visual and aural film that conveys emotion with images and acting rather than plotting and characters,10,26 December 2014,"As is aptly covered in many of the other reviews on this website, Lost in Translation is very much a love-it or hate-it film. I know a lot of people find it boring and pointless and generally just a huge waste of time, but it's my favorite film of all-time. I catch my fair share of flak for gushing like a schoolgirl about how much I love the film, with people accusing me of being pretentious or a film hipster or whatever for liking it. Rather than retread ground already covered by the thousands of review on this website, I thought I'd cover why the film appeals so much to me in particular rather than trying to analyze it from a more objective perspective.There was a blog entry (http://marc-mike- movies.tumblr.com/post/47911260711/a-moment-stretched-to-eternity- sofia-coppolas) I came across not too long ago that really describes why I love the movie so much:""Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation (2003) is one of the great mood pieces of recent cinema, a wise, tender, and melancholy delineation and evocation of what it means to be 'stuck,' to be adrift both in a foreign land and in life. It depends not on narrative, but on feeling, on compositions that express more than a thousand words could. We see in certain scenes, and even certain glances, a range of emotional terrain effortlessly conveyed by the remarkably controlled acting given by a never better Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.Consider this scene (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsj9sMDgh-A), begun after a night away from marital issues, crisis, and existential ennui. To describe it would take away its magic. But what makes it so magical? It is a short sequence. Nothing really happens. And the scene doesn't call attention to itself in any self- consciously artistic way. Why then is it so effective? Perhaps it is simply Johansson's face that sells it so well. Perhaps it is for the evocative music of My Bloody Valentine. And perhaps it is for what the scene itself evokes: those respites from a life of uncertainty, basking in a moment that you wished could stretch to eternity, taking it all in before it's gone. Coppola captures those moments of bliss that we've all had, and we all cling to, as well as the knowledge that they can't possibly last forever.""And the film is packed full of scenes that affect exactly as the one listed above.I've seen thousands of films in my life thus far and it's my absolute favorite of all-time. It's the only one I can watch repeatedly and never get tired of. Something about the way the movie makes me feel when I watch it is what attracts me to it. The dialogue, photography, lighting, and score all combine to give it this ethereal, relaxing, and slightly melancholy feeling that I can't get enough of. I watched it literally dozens of times last year, so I specifically made a deal with myself not to watch it at all through 2014 in order to keep myself from potentially getting sick of it. If that's pretentious, then I guess I'm a pretentious man. But I'm not going to stop watching this movie several times per year... Beginning in just a few days.",Lost in Translation
962,Brave_Sir_Robin,Just plain lost...,3,4 April 2004,"Disappointment doesn't begin to describe this film.  Especially after hearing all the rave reviews.My biggest complaint was that the story plodded along at an absolutely GLACIAL pace.  No appreciable plot/character development after the first fifteen minutes.  The story took way WAY too long to tell, and in the end there was hardly anything to tell at all.In lieu of actual story pacing, though, was some very effective imagery. Many fine and varied shots illustrated the isolation the main characters felt, and especially how foreign other lands appear to us in midst of them. Often I was reminded of the combined wonder and slight unease I felt when I was overseas, experiencing new cultures.But in the end, the story was too sparse, too slow.  In fact, for me, there were but two significant moments in the entire film that had any meaning whatsoever.  Worse still, after all my patient trudging through this trying, aimless ""tale"", waiting for something to happen to qualify it as a story, I was rewarded with a big let-down cop-out of an ending.  I could not have been more disappointed.Great imagery, very fine photography, but those qualities cannot begin to make up for this waiting game of a film.  The fact that this time-waster garnered such praise makes me ashamed to be part of the American movie audience.Seems every year, we as Americans are enthralled by the crappiest movies. Any film that goes nowhere is ""deep,"" any story that means nothing is ""abstract,"" any tale that takes forever to tell is ""epic.""But then, contrast this film with the trash-heap of ""blockbusters"" Hollywood regularly turns out like ""Fast and Furious,"" ""Legally Blonde,"" or any number of inane action/chick-flick movies and their improbable sequels, and ""Lost in Translation"" becomes art-house genius.Come on, America!

963,rationalreviewer,Over-rated intergenerational romance. Shallow story and acting.,1,22 May 2011,"This is the most over-rated movie on Amazon, that I have seen. There may be others more deserving of that title but, if there is, I haven't seen both the film and the Amazon rating.This poor excuse for a film was made only because the director is the daughter of one of the Hollywood elite. She grew up as a rich brat and this film presents the world view of that worthless class. The story is drivel. I can get into a good love story, or lightweight romance like this, but this one repelled me. I can only suspect that the viewers who rated it highly have psyches so controlled by the fairy tales they were poisoned by as children that they have no grasp of reality. Other one-star reviews explain the lousy-ness of the story fully so I will not repeat them.The acting is mediocre. Scarlett Johansson has a very limited range as a performer, which could have worked if the role called for looking cute and not saying too much. This roll calls for a sophisticated, well educated, but shallow young woman. Johansson is perfect for the shalllowness, but fails the other two requirements. When I saw her similarly sub-standard acting in Girl With a Pearl Earring, I thought there might be a decent actor inside waiting to get out. Maybe I suspected wrong.Bill Murray also has a limited range but that is all that was needed for his part. That could have redeemed the movie somewhat but the character is so thoroughly vacuous that he has nothing of value to offer other characters in the film or to the viewers. The theme of inter-generational romance has been explored in many other films but seldom so badly.",Lost in Translation
964,writerbwoy,Downbeat character piece that meanders,7,1 March 2004,"Just saw LIT the other night and was blown away. The visuals were stunning. Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray were excellent. Unfortunately, too often in this movie the ""plot"" meanders and the characters too often become part of the scenery in the many beautiful set pieces. It's a bad sign when in watching the deleted scenes (I saw this on DVD) you can think of entire sections of the movie that could have easily joined them on the cutting room floor.The comedy is that of the downbeat and jaded. Ignore any critic who uses the word hilarious in his or her review.Bill Murray plays a washed-up actor in Japan to film a whiskey commercial. Scarlett Johansson is a twenty-something wife of a hot shot photographer who leaves her to work in and around Tokyo. Murray and Johansson meet and begin a whirlwind relationship, exploring a Tokyo that is a profusion of light and sound.Unfortunately, Murray and Johansson have no chemistry and there is little sexual tension between them. Watching them together is like watching an awkward middle-aged man hiring an escort for the first time. Their relationship hints at nothing deeper. The only eroticism in this movie is generated when the camera, apparently run by someone with a fetish, focuses on Scarlett's legs as she, in panties, lounges, lonely and sad, for long stretches in her apartment.The movie wisely avoids the typical older man have a mid life crisis meets younger woman trappings, but fails to offer anything engaging in its place.Coppola apparently shot with an 80 page script and improvised many of the scenes. It shows. There is a slow, pointless section that takes place at a hospital and a wild montage of a night out that, while fun and gorgeously constructed, is entirely expendable. The movie relentlessly sets up the Tokyo landscape, exploring its nuances. Unfortunately, it does this at the expense of a subplot involving a third character that would have enlivened the airless relationship between the two main characters.
The movies makes you feel the characters' boredom and aimlessness, but never transcends it to make you care about them. Indeed, this movie has zero narrative drive. That Coppola won an Oscar for the script is laughable.The best movies strike a balance between character development and plot. LIT is top heavy with the former. I couldn't help thinking this would have been a better short film, but with no market for those, this had to be expanded into a feature film.7 out of 10 stars.",Lost in Translation

I thank him for picking such great scripts/directors (see his participation with Wes Anderson, ""Rushmore"" & ""Royal Tenenbaums"" for more of his ""sweet spot"" performances). Sofia Coppola scores again with ""Lost in Translation"" (prior was Virgin Suicides). I actually felt ""Lost"" had a Wes Anderson feel to the film. If you did like this film/theme I would also recommend ""Before Sunrise"" with Ethan Hawke (sans the humor). Scarlett Johansson was amazing. I last remember her in ""Ghost World"" (also an excellent film) where she made an impression on me... terrific performance. This has been the best film I've seen in the last three years... great story (though some may not see some of the deeper meanings), great bunch of actors and a wonderful emerging director. I may have had one gripe at the beginning of the film... basically fun at the expense of the Japanese culture... but then later in the film there would be beautiful scenes of the finer more complex points of Japanese culture that said ""we are not just a micro-electronic based culture, but one of a majestic past and rich culture.""This is such a wonderful film, please take the chance and see it.",Lost in Translation

This move merely ambulated along, not making any specific impact story-wise, but being more of a film for analysis than 'enjoyment'.It seems to me that this was a real-life style story- the dialogue was choppy and at times seemingly uncomfortable... but excuse me if I am wrong, isn't that what most conversation in life is like? There is little obviously contrived, Hollywood-ized content and, to be honest, I found the acting to be delightful; Bill Murray was wonderfully understated (it reminded me at times of Billy Bob Thornton's performance in The Man Who Wasn't There) and Scarlett Johanssen was equally as formidable in her part.All in all, i never sat in the theatre feeling bored, but more content- i feel that I experienced something different and, to be honest, quite wonderful.

I don't understand how Sofia Coppola won Best Director for this picture or why Bill Murray was a nominee for Best Actor.  There's nothing even remotely outstanding about the film , its direction, or performances (Murray seems to be sleepwalking through the whole film).  It's mediocre at best.The film is slow and very linear.  Nothing exciting happens.  There are no ups and downs.  No plot.  Basically, I kept waiting for something (anything!) to happen but it never does.  It got to the point where my mind started wandering during the film because it just couldn't keep my attention.It focuses mostly on the budding love of the two main characters, who are both married and staying at the same hotel in Tokyo.  There's nothing original about it, and Coppola's directing is too safe and ""sweet"".There are a lot of good shots of ultra-modern Tokyo that are nice, but its comedy relies on taking little shots at those ""silly"" Japanese by showing all the ways in which they do things differently in Japan.  I guess that never gets old for some.In conclusion, if you're torn between renting this movie and some other movie at the video store...pick the other one.",Lost in Translation

The best moments are the candid interactions with the Japanese.For the most part, this movie is just Bill Murray being himself and Scarlett Johansson walking around in her underwear and looking bored.  It doesn't take long for the viewer to suffer the same ennui and wonder what's the point.Neither of the characters is very likable because they don't try to do anything to improve their situation and prefer being bored to getting a life.For a serious movie on the human condition, avoid this one and rent one of the French masters of the 60's and 70's (Godard, Truffaut, etc.)",Lost in Translation

977,IMDb-Kinoki,The Need of Translation,7,2 April 2004,"People today have become more and more stupid, easy things need to be translated into even more easier things. This film draws from peoples willing of not knowing, so everything is translated into something they can understand.We get pretty pictures, but nothing special, we get visual actors to translate the words of the screenplay to pictures. We have a unexperienced director with a great idea but too complex for her to understand so she loses some of the genius in the translation there as-well.The use of pictures is clever, but not necessarily remarkable, since you don't really need to translate pictures, you only need to translate the token confined in the picture, such as culture, but token-to-token translation is easy.In my mind this would have worked better with a more experienced director. The other thing that didn't work for me was Bill Murray. I think that Kurt Russell was better suited for this part. Largely due to the fact that this isn't what we would expect from his, just picture him doing the kareoke scene.The point of the film was lost in translation. Since it is based on the target audience not understanding Japanese or Japanese culture. This alienation of people is dangerous.We also have different media in the film, as video games, commercials, kareoke, and the play with-in the play is a bleak shadow of that played in In the Mood for Love.This is a film in a row of wannabe-deep-films, Ghost World is one example, but since the directors aren't experienced enough it's pointless.",Lost in Translation

It requires nothing but Bill Murray (Bob Harris) and Scarlett Johansson (Charlotte something) to find a relationship based of each other's loneliness and subsequent choices in life that lead them to a particular moment in life which is ending up in Tokyo to fulfill a certain obligation, neither of which are joyful in doing so. The age difference between the two means there's no silly love chemistry, neurotic breakups or overly-dramatic events occurring throughout the film, which some have found to be particularly boring. But certainly not me, these two characters alone are able to support this film the whole way through with just a bond between each other than thats why Lost in Translation is like no other film.These two bond so well together throughout the film with experiences so down to earth yet in turn so uplifting when these two characters experience these to occasions together. Charlotte and Bob are both complete strangers in Tokyo, thats what makes the relationship with them work so well, the essence of surprise when not knowing another individual makes the movie that much more better to watch, from one scene to the next rather than learning about Bob or Charlotte we view them learning about one another from their perspectives.By the end of the film both performances from Johansson and Murray were equaled and satisfying, both showing the glory this film set out to have, and to that, hats off to Sofia Coppola for making such a wonderful film that was driven by effortless timing and character driven emotion.",Lost in Translation

The execution, however, is boring, meandering, and pointless. The main actors -- Scarlett and Bill -- have NO chemistry. Their relationship is not believable at all. The plot moves so slowly that I found myself nodding off during some of the scenes. I'm all for taking time to develop a story, but this was ridiculous! The film tries way too hard to be deep and to portray loneliness. It never succeeds. It falls short in so many ways and winds up being dull and boring. Additionally, the characters were terribly miscast. The idea of a romance between an extremely old, crusty, unattractive man and a young, wispy 18-year-old girl is ludicrous (wasn't Scarlett 17 when she filmed this?).On top of all that, the Japanese stereotypes are offensive and overused.

980,aykut-2,So brilliant...,9,28 May 2005,"I have just seen the movie on DVD and very impressed by what I have just witnessed. I should say from the beginning that before seeing the movie, I was expecting huge laughters because it contained Bill Murray. I did not laugh that much I should say that, but it has nothing to do with this movie's wanna-give idea.The movie is about an actor ( Bill Murray ) experiencing middle-age crisis staying in Japan for a while for a commercial shooting. His life is boring, his marriage is a disaster, and he is like living the last days of his career.The second leading role is Charlotte, played by Scarlett Johansonn, who is married with a guy for almost a year. The guy is a photographer and thats the reason they are in Japan. The husband ( Giovanni Ribisi )has almost no free time to spend with his wife. However, Charlotte seems like happy to at least loving him. But deep inside you can feel that she feels so alone.That is where the movie is giving its best moments. Two unhappy people feeling lonely comes across each other staying in the same hotel. A beautiful newly married young girl, and a mature man facing the consequences of his choices throughout his life.Unlike many movies, the two characters are getting close to each other without forgetting their lifes and martial status'. They are so happy together as friends, besides that, they start feeling for each other. The movie gives the idea of regret, which I mean both characters are like; ''God, why the heck I didn't meet him ( her ) before?'' They want each other, they enjoy each other, but never let go their basic instincts. You feel so sorry and can't help re-considering the important choices you make.Bill Murray requires no compliments as being a such a qualified actor. My credits go to Scarlett Johansonn. Not only beautiful but also makes you want her not as a woman only, but as your wife for a life time.The movie is also very interesting from another angle. What is told in the movie is a situation you would wanna punch yourself of regret. But all the story told, you just watch it with a large smile on your face and fully entertained.I strongly recommend you to see this movie. You will not regret. But the choice is yours. As in your life...Regards...",Lost in Translation

It could be very meaning full and every dialog could bear a deep meaning to those who are neck deep in their mid-life crisis.The scenes where Tokyo is portrayed (which is a lot by the way), is filmed with such intensity that it makes you feel as if you are there.But the movie is really slow moving and doesn't have a lot of story.

If you want to see a comedy don't watch this one. This is a very serious movie. It does have some funny moments, and of course Bill Murray is funny as always. The reason I wanted to see this movie was because of the great reviews. And because of Bill Murray (on of my favorite actors) and Scarlett Johansson (I was curious about her). Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is in Tokyo for a commercial and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is in Tokyo with her husband, who is there for his work. They stay in the same hotel and meet each other a couple of times. They really like each others company, and they both seem not happy in their marriage. When Bob and Charlotte go out they become close friends in a few days. The scene in the end is just one of my favorites of all movies, I just love it. The first time I saw it, the movie was a bit slow, what a lot of people think. But a few days ago I saw the movie again, and I just loved it. The filming was beautiful, the music is just beautiful, the actors are great. And some scenes are just funny, when Murray is on the home-trainer, and his conversation in the waiting room, with the old Japanese man. And of course his 'Suntory Time' commercial. The first time I gave it a 7/10, now and 8/10, after the second time, and I bought the DVD so the third time....maybe a 9/10 or a 10/10. Just watch it, and I you don't know what to think of it, watch it again. And if you can and you enjoyed this movie, watch the making of.

But for me, the film was seriously flawed on 2 counts. One of these is Bill Murray's lacklustre acting. Some people who liked the film saw a middle-aged has-been actor who has nothing to look forward to except waning years of mundane domesticity, but all I saw was someone who fell asleep in his role, a fact that even the technique of the camera zooming in to show disaffectedness couldn't save. To me, his character just did not come through. By contrast, Scarlett Johansson's subtle, textured performance delivered the goods. From her, you do really get the sense of someone who feels lost in her own life, not just in Tokyo. The other problem with the film is the caricaturisation of the Japanese as little people who spoke funny. There's absolutely nothing intelligent about that.",Lost in Translation

991,woodennature,Good mixture of sweetness and sadness,8,22 December 2007,"I have never watched Sofia Coppola's The Virgin Suicides, but I thought she did one heck of a job with this film.An emotional masterpiece, Lost In Translation is about two lost souls meeting in Tokyo: One is a fallen-out Hollywood actor doing a whiskey advert there; the other, a young newlywed who feels out of place in her husband's life and does not know what to do in her life. Bob's wife is too busy with their kids to be concerned about him. Charlotte's husband is too busy with his photo work and neglects her emotional needs. Eventually, Bob and Charlotte confide with each other and explore Tokyo together, whilst slowly fall in love with each other. I felt Murray and Johansson played their roles very well and their characters click very well.I felt the ending was brilliant. Although both already have feelings for one another, both were married and Bob was too old for her and have kids. Even when Bob jokes to her about 'organising a prison break' and Charlotte fantasizes to Bob that both would 'start a jazz band together' shows that they both were tired of their lives and wanted to start afresh together, the sad truth is that bitter reality catches up with them in the end and both part unwillingly.I thought Coppola took many great scenes of the beauty of Tokyo and Kyoto and presented the oddness of Japanese culture through the eyes of an American. I didn't find it racist of any sort. Many would dislike this show because it's slow place puts people off. I felt the pace was appropriate for it's genre. I believe that the alien Japanese landscape is just a metaphor for the desire for companionship and the 'out-of-place' feeling the protagonists get. It's something many would recognise as we all go through it some point during our lives.Perhaps that's why I enjoy it so much. Watch it when you are low.",Lost in Translation
992,nobetterangel,Beautifully acted story that stays with you long after its over.,10,24 September 2006,"Bill Murray gives one of his best performances, if not his best, as Bob Harris, an aging actor who is very popular in Japan. Ditto for the wonderful Scarlett Johansson who shines as a younger woman (Charlotte) who is lost in her 2 year old marriage. The movie will no doubt appeal most to middle age men, for it is an achingly bittersweet story of how our mature choices in life often limit and prevent us from experiencing new relationships on a long term basis. The character's age difference never seems to be an issue--they connect in a way that transcends age. There are a few scenes that are so touching that watching them is almost painful and yet, Coppola never lingers or make these scenes anything but real. When Charlotte and Bob take a break from partying, she tenderly puts her head on his shoulder. And when they are in bed together talking, she touches him with her bare feet and he gently touches them. I left the movie wishing for a sequel, but knowing there would never be one. And thats what makes the movie so bittersweet. An older man and a beautiful young woman have met and developed feelings for each other but will probably never see each other again because of the circumstances of their lives. What did Bob say to Charlotte at the end that made her smile and him seem content? One can only wonder but I think it was something like ""I love you and will never forget you-ever"".

997,Kazak,Lost and Found,10,4 February 2004,"I admit to being romantic by nature, but Lost in Translation, a sweet and genuinely gentle film, could make a romantic out of Al Gore.  It may not be possible to watch this film without personalizing its message, without seeing ourselves and our relationships in it, and pining for lost romances or ones never had.  Perhaps that is why this film affected me so, but I doubt that I am the only one who watched it and felt that way.  As a middle aged male, clearly I identified with Bill Murray's character, a man who, viewed from the outside, has the perfect life, but who, under the veneer, is lost and misses the connections that we all wish to have with someone in whom we can be in love.  He has, in the film, however, settled into his life, married to a woman who appears to care more about the details of remodling their homes than she does Murray's ramshackle emotional state. Murray accepts his role as provider, as husband, and as father, even though the role is unrewardingly one-sided. Many viewers, I am sure, saw themselves in his character and felt a connection with him.Scarlett Johansson, by the way, is wonderful as the young married woman who Murray meets while in Japan filming a whiskey commercial.  Johansson has a quality about her that is so alluring that it sometimes overwhelms her role. In this case, though, she is perfect.  Frankly, I can't see how anyone could avoid falling in love with her.This film is a rare treat; please see it and support other films like it.

I, however, tend to see the plot in terms of the following two meandering storylines:
1) Has-been actor experiences a pang of (post-)midlife crisis in Tokyo. Lonely delectable young abandoned wife hooks up with him. The two are emotionally attracted to each other, but the impermissibilty of a sexual encounter keeps them back. Instead, they live out a few days of Freudian father-daughter infatuation.  2) Japan is such a strange and wonderful country!!! 1 1/2 hours of tourist tour of the idiosyncracies of Japanese social life, complete with karaoke bars, game consoles and the social acceptability of meeting your colleagues in striptease bars. On the first account - point 1), that is - I guess the film comes our more convincing than American Beauty, but.... it would have been sooOOOO much better if we'd had a couple of good actors to play the lead parts. Imagine, say, they young lady being able to appear a bit emotionally torn? It would have been so much more gratifying that just having to watch her purse her lips and play a sullen teenager.",Lost in Translation

Other than Bill Murray's performance and the settings in Japan, I was bored out of my mind with the slow, slow storyline.  To me, it was just a dull film.  I have talked with many other people, and they all agree with me.  Some walked out of the theatre; others could not believe all the hype about the film and the praise it has received. How can anyone say it is a comedy?  Who out there agrees with me?  I have been a movie attendee for fifty years, and I rate this movie near the bottom of the list.  On the other hand, I was glad to see Sofia win the Oscar for original screenplay.

Give someone in it an award and advertise advertise advertise until people think they heard it was good. I stood in blockbuster with three other people whom were as clueless as I was. All we knew is it was advertised an award winner and was never in to rent. We also knew no one could tell us how it was. If you are going to buy or rent a movie don't make it this one. It is a movie about nothing in Japan. Only problem is it is no Seinfeld and no good. If you rent/buy this movie you will do as I did.

At least one of them should have at least one defining feature/flaw...extreme jealousy? kindness? depression? shyness? Just SOMETHING to relate to in ONE OF THEM! Thats all I would have asked.Also, there is not a single funny/interesting/exciting/insightful moment in this film. As a comedy it fails through lack of laughs, as for the 'japanese accent jokes'? What is this? The seventies? As a drama/romance it fails because...well not a single dramatic/romantic event occurs. The sexual tension between Murray and Johansson? Subtle to the point of non-existence (And besides the thought of Murray's wrinkly old arse bobbing up and down on top of Scarlett...I'm VERY glad they didn't get together here, i'll give Coppola that.)

1012,petefunk23,A daring and different film- all around a must see,9,26 September 2003,"Sophia Coopola is a director whom I somewhat felt skeptical about.  Did she have a career in the motion picture industry because of family ties, or is there real talent lurking inside of her.  After seeing Lost In Translation I without a doubt believe her to be a marvelous new voice in modern cinema. This is a film that to me can be summed up by one word- touching.  It is hard to go to movies about men and women now a day and not be caught up in all the regular clichés that so often have to pop up to tell a story. Coopola uses her own original voice to tell a deep tale of personal relationship between two people lost on the road of life.   Without telling a mushy love story or some unbelievable romance she tells a story about humans.  One is a recently married girl (Scarlett Johansson) who is confused about marriage and her future.  The other is an aging actor (Bill Murray) who is in midlife crisis and has no idea where he is heading.  But the third character in this multilayered piece is the city of Tokyo, from its huge foreboding cities and lights to its magical mountains and temples.  It is a character with just as many sides as the humans, which makes it a perfect place for the two to meet and come to terms with themselves.  I don't want to go on and on with plot details but you will laugh at it's comedy, see two of the best performances of this year, and actually walk away feeling touched - which is rare and unusual in a motion picture now a days. 9/10",Lost in Translation

1014,w_vermont,The movie everyone said I just HAD to see ... but I wish I didn't,1,5 December 2006,"This is the movie that everyone told me I MUST see, yet after seeing it I wish I didn't. To understand this, please take into consideration that I am a western person, dating a Japanese person for +5 years and having spent quite some time in Japan.Now, all my western friends urged me to see this movie, telling me it was funny and sad at the same time and gives a perfect depiction of how life in Japan is for western people, the interaction between western people and Japanese and lots of cultural references. So finally my girlfriend and I rented the DVD and sat down to watch it... all I can say is, I wish I could get my 100 Yen back from the rental shop.First problem: I don't know what kind of movie this is and what the message is they are trying to convey: it's not funny, it doesn't contain any deeper message, it's not realistic and it's ultimately boring. I can only hope this was some kind of experiment to make a satire that makes fun of Japanese, and even in that regard it's a bad movie.The way Japanese are portrayed is just plain wrong: professional translators are depicted as nothing more than idiots who feel the need to 'edit' messages. I speak both Japanese and English and know full well that one cannot always just translate literally from Japanese to English, but they exaggerate this to a point that it becomes comedy. Japanese translators should be very offended by this movie.Our main characters are totally egotistical and make no effort whatsoever to adapt and blend into the country/culture they reside at that time. After only watching the movie for 5 minutes my thoughts were: guys, just go home already.The general Japanese society is depicted in such a racist way that I find it offense even though I am not Japanese myself. Having spent many years studying the language and culture of Japan, I cannot help but feel offended that a country with such a rich culture and language is portrayed as if it were an alien planet on the original series of Star Trek, with people that are retarded to the point they just can't work with foreigners. Anyone who has been to Japan and has taken the time to adapt oneself (which one should do or just not go there at all) knows this not to be an accurate representation. Sure, Japan has it's problems, but Lost in Translation exaggerates them to a point it isn't even funny anymore, making it borderline racist! Next time Ms Copolla directs a movie, I hope she will at least be more respectful to the culture her movie plays in and she will at least perform a tiny bit of research before packing and moving over there to tape meaningless scenes totally disconnected from reality.The funny (or sad) thing is that I've been to a lot of the place they've taped and have also stayed at the Park Hyatt hotel once but unlike Mr Murray and Ms Coppola, I didn't fill my days by drinking at the bar and staring aimlessly out the window like I've just been lobotomized. I basically just went there to sleep and take a shower, like normal people do and the rest of the time I was out in the city doing my business. The shooting locations in Kyoto are also places I've been. Ms Coppola somehow manages to be at some of the most attractive tourist scenes by her lonesome self ... perhaps she went there just before there was an announcement that a 9.5 earth quake was going to hit Kyoto and everyone evacuated ... and even then there would be more visitors than in the movie! But of course she needed those quiet scenes to depict the 'zen' part of Japan, as any new-age hippy would do.At some point in time, I was wondering whether I was still watching a movie set in Japan or a fictional story playing in the head of some acid-junkie who just came down from a bad trip.For those wanting to watch movies that REALLY portray Japanese life, I suggest renting or buying Japanese movies like My neighbor Yamada (Yamada-kun no tonari), which albeit being an animation has the advantage of showing a correct image of Japanese society in a funny way (a bit like the Simpsons parody US society while at the same time containing a lot of truth).Seriously, I want my 100 Yen back from Ms Coppola!",Lost in Translation

(I believe Britney Spears already did a song about a girl in a similar predicament.  Mercifully, that song was only a few minutes long while this movie is significantly longer.)  Charlotte, our protagonist, has no talents of which she is aware (""I can't write, I can't take pictures"").  To further accentuate her uselessness and lack of skills, she tells us she majored in philosophy.  She tags along with her husband on a trip to Japan and while he actually WORKS and socializes, she sits sullenly in her hotel room staring out of window.  Ho-hum.  She does this a lot so get used to it.  My major impulse through most of the movie was to slap the girl and tell her to ""GET A DAMN LIFE.""  Oh, the troubles of being attractive, young, intelligent, with a cute husband who makes a lot of money and meets rock stars and movie stars.  Oh, how horrible that existence must be.  I do not blame the failings of this movie on Scarlett Johansson, a young woman who displays flashes of talent.  She plays the part as gamely as she can.  To make a whiny, boring person tolerable for over an hour is an accomplishment.  The faults in this movie I pin squarely on the creator, Ms. Coppolla--a pampered, sheltered child of Hollywood.Overall, it's not a horrible film.  I just didn't think it was as good as the reviews led me to believe.  On the plus side, Bill Murray gave a fantastic, disaffected performance of an actor just past his prime who is all too aware of it.  The Japanese supporting cast is used stereotypically to some comic effect.  Anna Faris is definitely a young comic actress to watch.  Whether she meant it or not, her dead-on impersonation of Cameron Diaz made the movie jump alive.To sum it up, this film will remind you of every boring vacation you've had in which you met one person who made it a more bearable experience but who in the grand scheme of things, didn't mean much other than a small memory.",Lost in Translation

1020,juve_no1,Observational & Naturalistic,9,21 December 2003,"Lost In Translation is a film that makes demands on the audience much as early French new wave movies did; you're expected to do some work.Young Coppola is also a filmmaker who has swallowed Andre Bazin whole - film is observational, naturalistic, not about artificially pumped up plotting and ""character's journey"". It's about people. Real, often inarticulate, incomplete people who will stay that way for the journey of the movie - as actual folks tend to do with their actual lives.Bill Murray (in his best role since Groundhog Day - is an actor reduced to doing Suntory Whisky commercials in Tokyo. He's not happy camper and, as he says, he could be doing theatre somewhere else. But that's just an alibi - he knows he wanted the dough and the gig - he's hit the wall, in life, in love.Some of the best scenes show endless retakes with the deranged 'hot' film director of the cinema ads and reminds us of the famous underground tapes of Orson Welles endlessly redoing a commercial voiceover for 'sun kissed frozen peas': art and commerce are tragic bedfellows. And language and misunderstanding are equally fuels for waste and tragedy.But in fact the movie is about something more wistful and, in the end, gentle: missing a chance at love. Scarlett Johansson, that pale revelation as Rebecca from Ghost World (Terry Zwigoff, 2001), is a young graduate philosopher ('pro bono' for the time being) visiting Tokyo with her dazed photographer husband (Giovanno Ribisi) and finding the world abroad is less challenging and fulfilling than even her own muddled marriage.Lost in Translation is intelligent, calm filmmaking brilliance and the pace is something that comes to seem as inevitable and right as the delicately handled and serenely restrained love story that drives this quite marvellous movie along.",Lost in Translation

The last time for me (2003 - 2005), was the culmination of a career, and both personally and professionally the best time of my life (and my family's) so far. My wonderful situation there can never be recreated for me. So this movie evokes emotion in me on several levels.The story of the connection between Bob and Charlotte is sweet, and I love the fact that there is no apparent physical affair between them. It would have cheapened their relationship. In a different way, it also captures some of the relationships and friendships that are forged by foreigners abroad. If you haven't experienced it, it's hard to describe. We made some of our closest friends living in Japan. So their parting is bittersweet and the relationship a memorable one.Sofia Coppola's depiction of a Gaijin visiting Japan for the first time is right on the mark. For those of us who have lived there, it's very, very funny and captures many of the little nuances, strangeness and feel of Tokyo. She captures some of the absolute beauty of Kyoto and the train ride there.So the film brings back a lot of wonderful memories for me.

Combined with the simple, beautiful cinematography, perfect casting choices, and a subtle hand, Coppola has proved herself to be head and shoulders above many of her contemporaries. There is no MTV in-your-face crassness or commerciality, there is only real emotion, and a brilliant capture of real human despair, and hopefulness.For anyone who haves/has had the misfortune of living in Los Angeles, they will be laughing to themselves for the entire movie, as the plastic and soul-less life of the entertainment business is captured so well.

I kept on waiting for the nonexistent plot to arrive.Finally, the 'crocodile dundee' style racism showing the Japanese as one dimensional morons or subservient.  The prostitute scene was a cheap play for laughs.  Much like, most of the Japanese scenes which were the 'look at the wacky Japanese' variety with the help of Bill's snide comments.

[Warning: this review may contain spoilers]This is a story about two people meeting in Tokyo and being attracted to each other. The girl, Scarlett Johansson, is a young graduate who just realised that she married a complete idiot. The other, Bill Murray, is an aging American movie star not getting along very well with his wife but who loves his two kids. [note: his career is fine, nothing indicated otherwise. The Japanese do have famous actors coming over to endorse products, and they pick the highly famous stars, not the outfashioned. There's website somewhere on the net referencing those commercials, look for it.]This movie is all about the growing attraction between the two and what they will make of it. Johansson - the young and foolish - being clearly ready to drop her husband on the spot, while Murray - the rich and famous alcoholic with two kids - is torn between what he wants to do and what he should do.This movie will spell nothing out for you, the relationship is purely platonic. You have to use your head for a change, which makes the movie all the more believable as you wonder what will become of those two.Sadly the girl is a bit of a passive idiot, but that's the only way she could be. Who else would marry her idiotic husband and then fall for the very old alcoholic in the bar?This movie reminded me strongly of Casablanca. Two strangers in a strange land facing a choice, should they follow their feelings or do what is morally right? As in Casablanca, the decision is up to the guy.Unlike in Casablanca, this is not spelled out for you, although any one who cares to think a little will always know what is going on. The lack of grand speeches telling you what is going on makes this movie all the more realistic[If you must know, he simply exposes her the situation: what he feels and why he must leave her.

I think that the film, when we talk about the sceneries, is very similar with Francis' Apocalypse Now, the many views of Tokyo compared with e.g. the scenes from the trenches in Apocalypse Now, the views, the light and the sound.Lost in Translation is a small everyday story which is still unique.

I felt ""American Beauty"" captured the mid-life crisis struggle far better than the snail-paced ""Translation"". I did not fall for the pseudo-love story, because I did not believe Scarlett Johansson's character in any way. She did not convince me that she was SO unhappy in her marriage (she's a newlywed - why not support her husband on his big break, as opposed to running off to flirt with other men?) that she needed Murray's company.

Sofia Coppola may very well have a fantastic career as a director in front of her - but if she continues to direct films like these, it will never be realized.  Murray saved what I felt was a film that was constantly waiting to break out of its shell, but was continuously held back by Coppola's uninspired direction.I cannot recommend this movie - unless you are a Murray fan.",Lost in Translation
1034,tiffanydw2,One of the WORST movies my friend and I have EVER seen!,1,20 October 2011,"My friend and I could barely stand to sit in the theater thru the duration of this boring, ridiculous film.How it got such big hype, and nominations, is beyond me. A lot of horrible movies get lucky and set a ""trend"", therefore making them popular and gaining great reviews and even rewards. This is one of them. I don't know why people keep highly acclaiming this movie. This is not just my opinion, but that of my movie-pal as well. and everyone I know that has suffered through seeing this.After the movie had shown in theaters, we had seen that it won all these awards. FOR WHAT? For a lame plot? This movie is nothing but a waste of precious time. Don't believe all the great reviews and hype! That is all this is. Similar to many sequels that get a lot of advertising, thus apparently rooting the viewer's mind with expectations of a great film.I thought at least the acting would be good. Maybe the plot would be good. Maybe some humor would be funny. However, this movie lacks anything. I can't tell you how relieved I am that this is no longer in theaters and making so much news. The ONLY reason it made so much money and high ratings during the theater release, again was because of the hype. Many of the actors/actresses hit the daytime television circuit, as well as many late night talk shows. If they had not had the support of big A-list names, this movie would have sunk under its own weight. This is my ALL TIME WORST MOVIE!Now that you can rent DVDs for one dollar, you cannot find this one, as people are not willing to pay even a hard earned buck to see the crap. Very few people will stand up to something so popular and give what they feel are their TRUE feelings about this movie: you can't help but HATE IT! I can borrow this from my library. However, I would never presume to waste time and oxygen breathing through a couple hours of torturous hell.If you go to this movie or, rent this movie, please remember to shoot yourself in the foot first.

Bill Murray gives a performance rivaled only by his work on Wes Anderson's Rushmore, he is utterly hilarious in the scenes on the commericial shoot, and is utterly believable as a man who can't find meaning in much of anything anymore.

1040,gator3921,Beautiful tone poem,8,3 November 2003,"***1/2Sofia Coppola's lovely ""Lost in Translation"" provides Murray with a part that matches that of his work in ""Rushmore"" and is the most touching, and possibly funniest film of the year.Murray plays a washed up actor sentenced to perform in commercials for a Japanese whisky company for the price of 2 million dollars.  Johannsen plays a fresh out of Yale, young, married woman accompanying her husband on a business trip, where they stay at the same hotel as Murray.
The two recognize eachother as kindred lost souls, groping for meaning where none seems to be found; and proceed to spend a week of their lives together amidst a foreign alien culture.  That's the plot.  Nothing more.  What follows are an array of beautiful, touching meetings, particularly    a bedroom encounter that is as well written as any scene in recent memory and an instant classic final scence of which the content will be hotly debated for some time.Lost in Translation is clearly not for everyone.  Those who are the fans of the familiar Hollywood product will no doubt be bored by Coppola's work here, as it relies less on plot and action than it does on tone and feeling. Recalling the work of early Truffaut, ""Before Sunrise"" era Richard Linklater, and in a way, Murray's own work in ""Rushmore,"" it is career best work for everyone involved.",Lost in Translation

However I find myself in the similar position of mid-life crisis and away a lot of the time at hotels in strange places so it had a greater relevance. I left the cinema extremely stirred, excited and full of anticipation for what is to come and it takes much for a film to achieve that.There were times in the film when the audience were 'rolling in the aisles' laughing and at other moments it was so still and quiet you could have heard the faintest pin drop.Bill Murray is not an actor with whom I have developed any form of appreciation until now. His performance was quite outstanding and I will see him in a different light from now on. During many parts of the film he communicates with the audience exquisitely but without words.
Where has Scarlett Johansson come from, and are there anymore like her wherever it was? On screen she exudes qualities that have been missing on screen for sometime.The strongest element of this film is not the comedy lines or actions based around the language theme but the underlying translation theme between two people from different generations and backgrounds. I have never experienced sexual tension on any scale before a screen and it's that element of the film that for me made it outstanding. When you can film two people without dialogue at times and generate that kind of an impact you seriously need to make more.Sofia, give up any plan of continuing your acting career, and bring us some more films like this ..please!",Lost in Translation

To put it bluntly, this film offers nothing remotely beautiful; in fact, it is unusually ugly. Bill Murray's character is grotesque; he is a pathetic middle aged man, who seeks merely sensual pleasure to make up for his lack of personality. Scarlett Johannson plays an unlikeable moron, who idiotically visits some of the most beautiful site in Japan, yet feels absolutely nothing because she is too self-centered. The film shows two Americans having trouble relating to Japanese culture, perhaps this is because Japan IS A DIFFERENT CULTURE!!!! This film could have taken place in any country that doesn't speak English and the same feeling of isolation would have been prevalant. Coppola tries to show the main characters dependency and affection for each other, yet neither of the characters are likable enough to care about. The film merely shows a highly focused (and a little ethnocentric) view of Japanese culture, without giving any credit to the powerful and intricate history of the country. I loved the Virgin Suicides, but this film lacked the creativity and depth that I expected. This movie was cold, barren and bereft of passion.

Scarlett has been excellent in other roles in her still very young career, although hasn't quite found a movie that ranks with Lost in Translation. I was hoping this film would mark the start of a brilliant directorial career for Coppola, yet her volume of work has been on the low side over the past eight years. She's still not 40 (although just noticed she will be in a matter of days), so there's plenty of road ahead for her.This is easily Murray's best and most complete role. He brings the glib and deadpan style that he's known for, but he successfully mutes the trademark smugness that serves him well in his comedic roles, but needed to be downplayed for the more delicate Lost in Translation. He pulls it be off marvelously. Credit to Murray, and no doubt Coppola, who picked Murray for a reason.While the title directly refers to the foreign language and culture both face, it indirectly refers to both Murray and Johansson's characters, who are lost in translation in their own lives, struggling with spouses with whom they don't seem to connect. One wonders if their developing friendship will also be lost in translation, as the two are separated by time and the circumstances of their respective worlds.The relationship between Murray and Johansson is handled well by Coppola, and that's key to the movie. Things never get unseemly as the movie never quite ""goes there"", but instead leaves us to wonder what's to be with these two.A wonderful and tender film that holds up with multiple viewings.",Lost in Translation
1050,flickfiend,Stranger in a Strange Land,10,30 March 2005,"I feel this movie had an old soul nostalgia about it. I'm not trying to sound condescending when I say this either. It's the subtle, painful realization of being a ""stranger in a strange land"", made even more strange by being in a different culture. I could relate to Bob's experience of being alone in Tokyo. A few years ago, while traveling to India, my plane stopped there overnight, and I felt the same way. It's hard to describe in a few words, but this movie really did it for me.The feeling of isolation in a crowded environment sort of captures it. And the hustle and bustle of the city- the insanely manic activity of the Japanese people was emphasized repeatedly (that scene in the arcade where the young man is jumping around while hitting different colored buttons on an arcade game, for example)- culture shock.The love expressed, or even more movingly- implied- between the two main characters was so finely balanced in it's nuance (as compared to the overly blatant expression of outright sexuality, and the mad rush to express it, so common in today's movies) that it kept me on the verge of wanting more to happen. It was a continual tease that mimics the reality of life (for me). I've experienced so many ""what ifs"" in this life that, to think about them all would be too much- too painful. Thank G*d at least we're given a chance to experience a ""what if"" that realizes itself before our eyes, and in a meaningful and loving way.We all have a rendezvous with our Self at some point in our evolution, and I think LIT captures that reality between two souls connecting at that point in their lives (regardless of their physical age).",Lost in Translation

Well, fair enough, but I wasn't handed a piece of paper stating this fact before sitting down to watch the film and there wasn't a post-presentation debrief on the rental DVD, so I'm just left with my own personal impression formed by what I saw. Could I now be tempted to watch the film again to re-explore its myriad of metaphors  not really.",Lost in Translation

I saw the film at the cinema and loved it, however watching it again the other night on DVD reminded me of the one thing that irritated me about it - you can't hear the last line of dialogue. When Bob races after Charlotte and whispers something in her ear it's all mumbles. I'm guessing you're not supposed to hear, and that thinking about/understanding what he might be saying is part of the overall purpose of the story etc., but it's just so frustrating and disappointing after getting to know the characters so well that we are excluded from this final and touching resolution between them - especially since whatever he says leads to their first proper kiss!!

This film had huge potential; a great Hong Kong setting, which was not used to full advantage, here was a chance for Sofia to make something wonderful happen. Instead the movie looks sordid and appears to be created in a dark, badly lit studio (with the exception of two scenes), and comes across as a pointless piece of un-crafted trash from beginning to end. Positive reviews have to be politically based. Sofia Coppola shows no sense of humor or talent. Bill Murray seems a non-participant in this poorly performed effort. Scarlett Johansson provides a shining glimmer of hope for this movie, as she was obviously trying to make something happen. However Coppola's appalling dialogue and lack of imagination squashed her efforts. Sofia turned out a gigantic disaster. None of our friends would accept the CD of this movie, even as a gift!

1071,MidnightDrivr,What most people were not ready for...,9,22 January 2019,"Lost in Translation is a very misunderstood movie. If you are expecting to have a plot with bunch of twist and suspense, you WILL be disappointed. Its energy doesn't rely on the narrative aspect itself, but more the emotion that it provide. The atmosphere is simple on the first glance but yet very profound in terms
of loneliness and boredom. The film is not boring, but represents the lethargy of Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and Bob Harris (Bill Murray). Sofia Coppola's goal was probably to emerge an empathy in the spectator, without having to make an effort. Because whoever you are, you highly most likely felt loneliness at one point in your life. It might have been a good feeling or a bad one, but it happened. Lost in Translation provides a nostalgic response to give you a break.You know what? Maybe it's okay to be lonely, to be bored.Two americans in Tokyo; what else to redefine your identity markers. A chance to reborn, a new hope to change a painful or empty life. In a city with multiple possibilites, this movie excels in making you feel something if it isn't by the music, the settings or the well-acted characters.Take it as it is, don't expect a narratively suspenseful movie and you will enjoy where it takes you.",Lost in Translation

They share what's on their mind openly and sincerely without any fear. How many times do we find ourselves alone, in a sea of people, of friends and family, and we can't seem to find anyone to talk to, someone who will understand us, and we them.
I think this film captures that loneliness and yearn to find someone who understands us perfectly well, I feel understood, listened to.

Charlotte by her side is a newly married with a guy (photographer) that is always going out taking photos to places; Bob in the other side is married have children and it's passing by a crisis of the middle age.What I like this movie is how the characters get meet and going out just like a mature way, knowing maybe each other, that the difference of age, mature, marriage, etc. makes that relationship ""just like friends"", and that get evidentiated in a beautiful scene when Bob and Charlotte get in the bed the two of them with clothes, and Charlotte put the tips of her feet touching the leg of Bob, and him touches gently her feet.But the loneliness of both makes them get closer, not physically but yes emotionally as the movies goes on. At the end of the movie (a really good moment of the movie), both say bye (or maybe a until soon...) and a song plays while Bob gets to the taxi that takes him to the airport.Finally this movie has a magic, touching and content that few movies have.

1079,ubu55,Manhattan vs. Lost In Translation? *Spoilers*,10,8 November 2006,"(Jackp-5 asked this on the messageboard below, and it gave me a starting point to examine my own thoughts about the film.)They are broadly similar... but also very different, with those differences being why I too prefer Lost In Translation. From, or at least at, the beginning, the LIT relationship is a friendship, occasioned only by isolation in a foreign culture. Two people who would likely never have made a connection, even living in the same city and attending the same events and parties... for years, are thrown together (or rather ""at"" one another, like a life-preserver), just when both desperately need someone to relate to. It proves a happy accident, as they discover a real attraction, based not on sex (at least at first), but on shared feelings and personality traits they learn to admire in one another. The love, be it father/daughter or sexual, is based on knowledge and mutual understanding. IMO, Woody, in Manhattan, is, as he always seems to be (even IRL ), simply an aging man on the lookout for some young P^$$y. His purpose might be the recovery of a skewed version of his youth, or just (im)pure sensual pleasure, but it doesn't begin to approach the level of LIT. He never recognizes MH as an equal, or allows her to know him in the way that Murray does Scarlett. In a squirmy kind of way, the father/daughter thing is here too, but in Manhattan it feels, well... incestuous, and controlling. I might be remembering more of Juliette Lewis in Hannah here, as it's been awhile since I saw Manhattan, but I remember Woody's made very uncomfortable when he finds out how much she has perceived about him, less than flattering things, he never expected her to notice... and, because he tried to hide them, the affair is doomed. Worse yet, he discovers she's been using him, too, her sexual curiosity the equal of his own. Bob, on the other hand, hides nothing, promises nothing, and demands nothing. He's content to enjoy Charlotte's companionship (though there's evidence he's not always been a faithful husband), platonic-ly, even after it's probably obvious, to them both, they've slipped well past the father/daughter thing (about eight light-years past!). Here, for me, is where the Japanese setting comes into play again. Lost, in a culture that prizes the perfection of a sublime moment, they seem unwilling to break the spell, turn the relationship into something that inescapably involves/hurts others, and could drastically alter their lives. What they have is already perfect, in it's way. What they're both left with is a memory they can keep their whole lives, without disloyalty... and only the sweetest of regrets. Small things/gestures take on tender, yet weighty, significance. There's a subtle progression, too... from the moment when Charlotte lays her head on Bob's shoulder at the apartment (already a tad more than a daughter's gesture), to his carrying her sleeping from the cab to her room, and laying her in bed... at which point it was, IMO, already his choice to take things further. Finally, I can't recall a more romantic movie moment than when, as they're lying (fully dressed) in bed talking, Bob reaches out, and gently touches her bare foot. Remember how they both run from the blatant sexuality of the strip club? (Peaches ROCKS!!! BTW). All the stages of a sexual affair are passed through... without the physical consummation. When Bob wakes up after screwing the lounge singer, is there any doubt who he knows he's betrayed? It's a reality check, and a good thing, in it's way. They're forced to face the nature of their attraction, but absolved from taking it to the point where it will become a GUILTY secret. In the final scene they're alone, together, again. Standing in the midst of an faceless crowd, flowing past, unsuspecting. A last, shared, perfect moment/memory. What does he say to her? Everything you want him to say to her, of course. It's a very thoroughly realized film. The shoe-gazer pop is spot-on for creating the dreamlike state they drift through... the glittering silence of the Tokyo night. Plenty of contrast from other characters with only selfish concerns, putting up over-blown facades. Giovanni Ribisi is believably, nastily self-absorbed. Anna Faris is sweetly dopey, always a bit out of her depth, and completely, almost endearingly unaware of it. If I were Japanese, I think I might be able to find some things to be offended about. The linguistic foul-ups and the hooker are pretty patronizing. Suppose the best thing you can say about them is that they illustrate that finding humor is a common way of dealing with cultural isolation.",Lost in Translation

Those that absolutely loved Lost in Translation and those who, unfortunately, hated it! Yes indeed, this is one of those kind of movies that can potentially make a great judge of character! This film appeals to a specific audience of a specific nature. If you're the type of thoughtful character who likes to delve into a story and find personal meaning and wisdom, then this is certainly one for you. It appeals to your own story telling ability and understanding which left me spending many restless nights mulling over the exact kind of light this film was meant to be seen in. While the story and plot comes across as bland and mundane on a superficial level, deep to that is something terrifically real and endearing. The performances by both Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray are so life-like and exclusive that you'd be convinced their conversations were entirely improvised. Also, unsurprisingly may I add, Murray adds a great sense of humor to what became some very memorable scenes. Essentially, the audience is given loosely stringed plot.

The dialogue was pretty shallow really and I am not sure what the film was trying to achieve. I was left disappointed and empty as this film was quite long in duration. At the time it started to take off and Bill Murray was making some real decision (or so I was hoping he would), in the end he didn't! The ending was the biggest disappointment of all.

Thankfully this movie is all about thinking and feeling. This is not a chick flick. It's a human experience flick.This film examines and lays bare the intricacies of love, life and loneliness; the claustrophobia, insomnia and disorientation of traveling to a foreign country. The loneliness that creeps in after life's normality starts to wear thin. The spark of promise that meeting someone new brings. This is what life is about and what this film so flawlessly portrays.How many of you can relate to and have actually been that guy/girl on business, in the hotel in some foreign city, happily married yet feeling alone and beaten by life's banality? How many of us have been tempted in that very situation, to stray from the confines of moral adherence for the lure of a forbidden, if fleeting, joy? How many have felt that tingle- that spark- when a stranger smiles and you think, ""you know, in another life...""? Change the time, place and all of us have been there whether we admit it or not. Maybe single people don't get this movie; maybe it's for those of us who have walked down that aisle and are wiser to the realities of life.The characters here are true. Their dialog is true. The setting is true. It's all tirelessly fascinating because we can all relate to it and it involves us in a way that most movies do not. We find ourselves drawn to every moment these two experience together and apart. We are intrigued by the glances, nuances and words they share.Johanssen is brilliant and beautiful as the lonely, young wife questioning her marriage. Her beauty is classic, not necessarily sexual, though she is obviously alluring in this role. Her bee-stung lips, perfect body and haunting eyes may have something to do with that. Still she's more sophisticated beauty than mindless hottie, even at 19. This is a role tailor-made for her. It could never have been Reese Witherspoon or Jessica Alba or - God forbid- Jessica Simpson, or anybody else in that realm.Murray is simply at his best. He does ""exasperated, middle-aged and depressed"" better than most, with his receding hairline and frumpy body. You really believe that these two could connect in a physical and emotional way, as remote as that may seem on the surface. What other 50-something could ever be believed to be appealing to a young woman as pretty as Charlotte? That's a tough chemistry to fake and I can't think of a more perfect pair. What drives them to this attraction is what's intriguing to watch.Go see this. Turn off your ""Major Blockbuster-Tom Cruise-Action-Pop Culture Catch Phrase-Big Star"" mind and tune in with a more searching self. Watch this with your soul and heart, not your eyes.

Or is it The Royal Tenenbaums? Or The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? I can't remember... they were all the same to me. The problem I have with Lost in Translation, is not the lack of plot or dialog (I enjoy many plot less movies), rather the contempt for its audience. Movies are made to entertain, not to prove your hipness. Sadly, it seems, many of the ""independent"" American filmmakers seem to have forgotten this. I wanted to like Lost in Translation, really, I did. When it comes down to it, though, I could barely make it through the movie. Nothing made me sympathetic towards the characters. Nothing kept my interest.

1100,kikiru,take me to Tokyo,9,5 October 2003,"A brief and strictly factual description of ""Lost in Translation"" might go thus:  ""An American man in mid-life crisis and an American woman in young adult-life crisis meet in Tokyo, both experiencing their own culture shock, become friends briefly, and are enriched by their friendship.""  That sounds pretty boring, but thankfully the folks behind the movie were much better at making it than I am at describing it!!The film is very funny, with many of the laughs driven of course by the culture shock and language barrier factors.  Murray (Bob) and Johansson (Charlotte) also playfully poke fun at each other's personal struggles. ""Did you get a Porsche yet?"" Charlotte teases Bob.  But the movie also brilliantly balances its humor with poignant moments, as Bob and Charlotte each experience the real isolation of culture shock, and the ultimate loneliness of personal struggle.""Lost in Translation"" is also about marriage.  Bob reflects on his 25-year marriage through several baffling contacts with his wife back in America. Charlotte questions her 2-year marriage to her college sweetheart as she confides to a friend back home, ""I don't know who I married.""  At one important point in the script, I realized there must have been a large number of married couples in the movie theater last night.  The theater was nearly full, and there was all of the usual crunching and munching and slurping that you hear in American movie theaters.  But you could have heard a pin drop when Charlotte asked Bob, ""Does marriage get any easier?""",Lost in Translation

Does the reason for you being there represent YOU in any way? It doesn't matter if you like being there, it doesn't matter if you feel at home or comfortable there. All that matters is that you're there! Whenever you walk out of your hotel it feels as if you're leaving some sort of certainty behind.Bob and Charlotte have certainly been through this. They both acknowledged the fact that the 'surrogate home' they're living in is but that: a 'surrogate home'. They both long for recognition, for something that seems real, real enough to be something they can relate to.But, alas, Tokyo is NOT a 'forgive-and-forget' kind of metropolis. It comes with an extended user-manual. If you don't speak the native language it's a cruel place to be in.Never mind that, Bob and Charlotte eventually 'find each other'. Together they conquer the difficulties of an unknown and thus hostile city and make the best of it. I only need to refer to the soundtrack to tell you what it's like. This movie is absolutely amazing! There's no question that you'll love the lead roles, the tightness of the relationship brought forth here. It all feels so genuine, so life-savingly, so important!

It presented something that few other movies have--I saw something profoundly moving in it that's really (sorry for the cliché) beyond words. The producer and writer, Sofia Coppola, skillfully captured something here about relationships that usually goes unspoken. It is a poignant look at a relationship between two people who find joy in each others company while they are isolated in a foreign culture. Ms. Coppola and her crew created a film that evoked a great deal of empathy from me and watching it was an intensely affective experience. These two very real characters and their warm relationship is set off against a beautiful (and beautifully filmed and scored) but foreign landscape which, at times, takes on a sterility that amplifies the isolation of the two main characters--strangers in a strange land.An adjective that comes to mind for this film is 'reality'. It seems to leave behind Hollywood predictability and insightfully looks at a deeper, more real level of human relationships. I hope Ms. Coppola can exercise her insight again and present movie-goers with an equally affective and 'real' movie as this one.If you've ever traveled and formed bonds along the way with people you've met, this movie is a striking window into that experience.",Lost in Translation

Bill Murray, for me, is such an incredibly frustrating dramatic actor to watch. He always looks as though he woke up about five minutes before cameras were ready to roll, and his monotonous tone of voice is enough to make almost anyone suffer, cry or both. How he was Oscar-nominated for this movie I will never know.No amount of beautiful cinematography or potentially interesting character development could have saved me from boredom in this case. Scarlett Johansson was the one who should have been Oscar-nominated as a bored housewife in a loveless farce of a marriage.

1111,rallymcwilliams,Boredom captured on film,10,21 May 2008,"Nothing much happens in Lost in Translation. Consequently, Bob and Charlotte become bored, and do their best to keep occupied.They would sleep if they could, but they can't. They could leave, but various things (such as each other) keep them where they are. They spend a fair bit of time staring at walls and discussing (without much insight) their current hang-ups and marital woes. They don't make an effort to understand the Japanese people, preferring to laugh at them instead, and none of their time is spent pursuing the things they claim to be interested in. Charlotte flips through the same magazines instead of reading Schopenhauer or trying to write, while Bob is 'getting paid 2 million dollars to endorse a whiskey, when (he) could be doing a play somewhere.' Their circumstantial relationship consists of not much more than a few meandering glances and a touch here and there, and the most action they get up to is singing at a karaoke bar and dodging BB-Gun bullets through the streets of Tokyo.Coppola doesn't really seem to care whether audiences think Bob and Charlotte are likable or even sympathetic. She doesn't care if audiences are bored out of their minds watching two people be bored. The only thing she cares about is her vision, which as one user comments quite aptly, 'is the cinematic exercise in tedium for the sake of artistic expression, without tightening up.' If this film still sounds appealing to you, go watch it now. If not, then don't.My score tells you what I think, but I've always been a sucker for tedious character pieces where not much happens. Bob and Charlotte are two of my favourite people ever captured on film, and their lonely struggle against the reason for all human experience  boredom  sets them apart as people just like the rest of us, instead of characters who exist purely to tell a story.

Like most of other viewers I was anxiously waiting for this movie to be released after reading the excellent reviews. Hadn't the reviews been so great, I would probably have enjoyed the unusual pictures from Japan (there is a gorgeous scene with Mount Fuji on the back). I feel reticent to say that the jokes were funny when they are based only on miscommunication or cultural differences between the American character played by Bill Murray and the Japanese (if I was Japanese I would probably be offended by some jokes). Otherwise the movie is as boring as the characters are depressed. I waited for the story to get started during some time, but it never did. A few scenes are pointless and helpless to add meaning to the story, such as the one both go to a hospital to treat a `black toe' (as a physician black toe means necrosis to me = amputation but it never happened).

Bill Murray gives a decent performance but how are you supposed to empathise with a character who is oh-so terribly bored because he is stuck in Japan for one week - during which he is incidentally earning $2,000,000.
This movie is best viewed as a con aimed at the rich and famous about how terrible the problems of being rich and famous are and how empty their lives can be in spite of their near limitless options. All together now: ""Get over it"".I was really hoping they might take the opportunity to say something, indeed anything, interesting about life but all you get is the most cursory and trite observations about a tiny handful of subjects. And gosh, don't Japanese people do the darnedest things?

I let it sink in for a week before I decided to really say anything about it, and I hope everyone else does to. It had everything I look for in films: humor, romance, adventure, discovery.SPOILERS are going to be throughout this whole thing. Anyway, It just really all clicked together for me. I don't think I had any problems with it at all. I saw nothing morally wrong with it. They were friends, and it never went past that. It became really deep, but they both knew their limits.
Personally, I didn't think there needed to be any real deep conversations. That would've been such an obvious and silly thing and waste to put in there. Actually I believe everything that happened between them was real deep. From their 1st meeting on the elevator, it was such a small thing but it was better than any conversation the two could've had. Or when they were just lying in bed and they had a nice little conversation. It was saying what's on your mind and not caring. They had a little fun with it and were very comfortable, that didn't need to go any farther than it did. It really cemented their relationship. And Bob's little foot rub was a very nice touch. There are just so many instances in there of little things like that. They connected and nothing more need be done.Were the spouses flat? Of course, but they weren't the central characters, rounding them out would have only hurt Bob's and Charlotte's story. Those characters served their purpose and that was that.Personal favorite scenes, and I guess these are SPOILERS, were: the hooker sent to Bob, Karaoke, them in bed, meeting Kelley, shooting the commercial, and organizing the prison break.Also, I can't think of a better ending for the movie. It was really one of those moments I wish could capture in my own life. You know those two will always have eachother, even if they never see eachother again.The movie also has one of the better opening shots I've seen in a while. :)A final thought: I feel sorry for anyone that can't appreciate this film, it really just hit me straight in the heart and I could not be friends with anyone that it did not do this to. I understand opinions, and anyone is entitled to not like this film, but in my opinion they are are cold and heartless people.

No. The story is affectionate and Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanason are enjoyable on screen but the film lacks an essence of love that is necessary in this type of story. This could be more a buddy-buddy picture than a love story. The random adventures through Tokyo and midnight conversations brought across a more father-daughter relationship than two people in love with each other. In the end I feel the movie reaches a peak very early on in the film and doesn't move on...its stuck, stuck at this supposed ambiguous affection for one another between the two main characters. Murray is wonderful as a washed up actor stuck in a mid-life crisis (nut did not compare to Sean Penn) and Johanason, while not her best work (I recommend Girl with a Pearl Earring) is charming.

Johansson is so beautiful that her loneliness seems criminal. Tokyo provides them with a physical setting that depicts their emotional setting: It is familiar and tangible but does not unfold the way they expect it to unfold.Their situation is a difficult one. What do you do to find happiness? Abandon the commitments that you made 25 years ago? 2 years ago? The title invites you to not miss the point.

1136,Trekvogell,Everybody wants to be found.,10,10 August 2013,"Last night I watched Lost in Translation for the first time. It was very late and I couldn't sleep, so I went past all the movies that were on the shelf and noticed Lost in Translation, which I wanted to watch for a long time - and I don't know if this is something that I share with other people - but I never really was in the mood for it, last night I was and so I did. The funny thing is this is the first movie that inspired me to review a movie, and give advice to other people to watch it. The movie's been around for ten years now, but hey who knows, if someone hasn't watched it yet, I strongly recommend you should, because you are - like me a day ago - missing out. This is a great film which resonated with me, and I'll explain why without giving away the plot. It wasn't until a couple hours after I watched it that I came to the conclusion that it's a romantic comedy. The reason for this delayed conclusion is that it's not in the way you would expect a romantic comedy to be. All the elements are there though: you have the guy, you have the girl and you have the glances. But something happens within the film that contributes such an amazing almost depressing atmosphere that words like genre almost fade away. Using Tokyo as the backdrop for the story was a great choice, for me it felt like it was a character in itself, and added this feeling that at any moment the main characters would wake up and just resume their normal lives. Also have to mention the side characters in the world, they really embody the strange bizarre parts of the world and help make my theory of the fugue state in which the characters live in all the more convincing. I think another element that was brilliant is putting in feelings that basically everyone has felt at one point. Especially the feeling of being lost or helpless on this particular level is very strong and very well depicted in the movie. So my hat's off to Ms. Coppola.Finally, stellar performances of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson really transcend the film into being able to shift from on the surface to very deep, or from funny to serious without noticing when the changes appear. I personally feel very lucky to have watched this film and would wish that with the multiple viewings that are going to happen in the future, to have that same mixed feeling of happiness and melancholy every time the film ends.",Lost in Translation
1137,dlites,Sublime,10,28 September 2003,"Rare is the film that manages to evoke with subtlety and economy, complex emotions. Too often scripts rely on superfluos explication of the underlying themes and emotional underpinnings rather than allowing performance and audience perception to convey genuine truth. this movie succeeds at all of the above. It wisely circumvents the idiot factor as it were, and does not play down to its audience but instead takes the uncommon position of assuming that the average American viewr is in fact thoughtful, intelligent and perhaps a bit introspective. A gmable I myslef would be wary of given the myriad collection of crap that constitutes modern American cinema. That this film is finding its audience is quite encouraging. Given its low budget it seems likely a tidy profit will be turned and in so doing this film might help to open the door to others of its kind and thereby make some small headway for art rather than entertainment and give us an alternative to the prefabricated nonsense Hollywood seems to produce in industrial quantities. Lost In Translation is certainly the best film I have seen this year and I admire it its restraint particularly in avoiding the fascile exits most studios expect and enjoy.",Lost in Translation

In my opinion this film was great, because unlike with all the other romantic comedies (in my opinion it is not really a romantic comedy, but i can see how it can be seen as one), this one knows what it is doing. It's not a movie that can be enjoyed by everyone, or always. Its quality seriously changes depending on the mood you are in, and most of the times, when you cannot in anyway relate to the emotion, the film is booring and slow. But if the film has meaning its great. It seems that for a film such as this one people expected to get more immature humour, as is typically associated with romantic comedies. You can't expect two people who are having problems with their marriages to go around joking the whole time. Its not racist in any way (matrixfighter's comments), it only attempts shows Tokyo the way it actually is (Japan's younger generation is eccentric) and you are contradicting yourself when you say johanson's character is ignorant if all she does is cultural tourism.

1144,rickythakrar,A Pot Pourri,10,1 March 2004,"The talented Sofia Coppola received four nominations this year, winning the much-deserved award for ""Writing (Original Screenplay)."" I find this ironic as the film's unconventional style involves what seems like at least 100 'cutaway' scenes and very few scenes with dialogue. But then that is the film's beauty - that Murray and Johansson's chemistry (excuse the cliché) radiates through their acting and the well-directed timing of their few deliveries, leaving viewers on an emotional high throughout the movie.The film's many cutaways consist primarily of shots of Tokyo which Sofia's crew translated (under her unique direction) from still photos she took whilst touring the city. These shots can only be described as a 'pot pourri' with their rich variety of camera techniques and colourful (sometimes unusual) subject matter. I began watching the film in a confused awe until I felt I could understand the style of the movie. Experiencing this visual-tornado in the mind alone is worth watching the film for in my opinion. As well as the treat to the eyes and heart, the film's medley from around the world was a treat for the ears, begging to be played at sky-scraping volumes.If Sofia's entry into film industry was purely nepotism, it is clear from her work that she herself has the talent as both a writer and a director to become successful in it. All that remains is the torturous wait until Sofia finds or creates another work of visual poetry.",Lost in Translation
1145,saundo01,Easily misunderstood film,9,9 February 2004,"I have to declare my interest up front - I really liked this film.It is easy to dislike this movie as it presents a situation which 99% of people never face. Being trapped in a land which is so foreign to what you are used to, being unable to speak the language, dealing with customs that you are unfamiliar with.  This is an uncommon experience, and Coppola's framing of the delicate story between Bob and Charlotte is wonderfully seductive when put into the context of ""fish out of water"". As a character study it's deep in parts and shallow in others. It trots out some of what has been called by other reviewers ""tired old racist jokes"", but that misses the point. Real human beings, caught in a place that they are unfamiliar with, react with humor, xenaphobia and sometimes cruelty.
The true beauty of this film is the delicate flower of the relationship that builds between Bob and Charlotte. Forget about all the neon, forget about the Japan jokes, focus on the dynamic between the two leads and you hopefully will feel what I did - warmth, longing, contentment. When framed against the cold of a foreign city, the isolation of both their current relationships and the feeling of being remote from all the people around you, and the quiet disjointedness that they both suffer from in their ""normal"" lives, you can see why this is such a good film.",Lost in Translation

1150,nathanielg2,"A lovely story, wonderful actor and a genius directing: A Classic!",10,12 March 2004,"Did I like ""Lost in Translation""? I absolutely love it! Sofia Coppola reveals herself as a superbly talented writer, an intelligent and skillful director, and a real connoisseur of human nature. She depicts every adult's concerns, hopes and fears in an admirable way, that I would not have expected from someone that young. And the story is full of unforeseeable twists, challenges to stereotypes. You go from some very clever and funny lines, to others that dig deep inside the heart. Though Ms Coppola is not really ""new"" in this business, her career really promises to delight us much further. I am sure that we'll see her creativity and passion evolve into new stories I can hardly wait to see. Bill Murray's performance as Bob Harris was incredible. He amazingly conveys all his feelings (loneliness, regret, urge for someone beyond one's reach, remorse, ephemeral joy, sense of having wasted some of own life) to spectators, and far before the movie has ended everybody in the theater loves the guy. He truly deserved the Oscar (and not because Mr Penn didn't!). Scarlett Johansson is also outstanding in giving life to Charlotte, because that's what she did: she made Charlotte alive, a real person. It would have been really easy to leave the female role in the background with such an amazing male performer besides her, but Ms Johansson admirably overcame the challenge.

1154,looza-1,"shallow, empty and colourful.",1,25 January 2004,"""the virgin suicides"" by sofia coppola was a good movie, and since this one got good reviews everywhere, I watched it.to give the conclusion first : I did not like it at all, indeed its one of the weakest movies ever.as you may know, the story is about some old actor which meets a young girl during his stay in tokyo and for a few days they share their depression. the point is : thats all way to uninteresting for me. after about 30 minutes it started to bore me watching two very upper-class people looking all sad and talking about their problems. It simply has nothing to do with me. If I go to a movie I either want to see something totally fantastic and far out that I know its not even close to reality, or a movie about certain parts of reality, which are so special in itself that its interesting for me. An example for the latter might be ""my life without myself"" (as a recent movie). But watching these two rich and bored people celebrating their depression just made me sick. In my opinion coppola knew why she made this happen in tokyo, imagine this movie in new york or similar, and I think more people would see it as what it is : boring.also, I cant understand how a woman like sofia coppola can take part in the usual sexism in hollywood and even tries to push it even further. the movie starts with the highly disturbing image of the female star lying on the bed, shot from behind so we see her butt through a pink slip. I know that for some people this is a good start, for me its really not. I dont like movies which think they have to start off with exposed parts of a female body, especially when it has nothing to do with the story. no, I am not gay, I am simply sick of sexism and soft-pornography in movies. this first impression carried on trough the whole movie, because the director did not miss any chance to display the female star in underwear, whenever possible. another scene is in a stripclub, where we are forced to watch the performance of some japanese table-dancers, which had nothing to do with the movie at all, while a song by ""peaches"" (a very feminist songwriter, does she know this, btw ?) was running in the background. apart from this visual sexism also the role of Scarlett Johansson is higly questionable, all the time she is looking around like a little bambi-girl which cant think or decide anything without the help of men. I am sick of these kind of clichès of small and frightened woman. And no, Scarlett Johansson cant act. I doubt she can do any other face than she did trough the whole movie.The third thing which really made me upset is the high use of music, there is always something playing, often paired with images of tokyo and such, so my advice to sofia coppola is to make musicvideos instead, she surely has the ability to link nice pictures with music, but obviously she is not able to make a full-length movie with a decent story.in my opinion this is a very, very overrated movie and I will cry out loud if it gets any oscar or similar. as the headline says ... its 90 minutes of shallow, empty and colourful imagery without any interesting story and a weak cast. what a turn-off after ""the virgin suicides"".(After we watched this one we went home to watch ""bridges of madison county"" and although I dont like meryl streep and clint eastwood at all and normally a movie starring both would make me run the other direction as fast as I could, this was exactly the kind of movie that ""lost in translation"" wanted to be. go watch this instead, I mean it.)",Lost in Translation

1160,atredies,Once in a long while...,10,15 September 2003,"Once in a great while, even longer that it takes me to write another one of these reviews, there comes a movie that just happens to hit you at the right moment, that perfect space in your life that was designed to fit just a story like this one, told in the subtle and unobtrusive manner that you needed to really let go and feel alongside the characters on screen. Now it could be that I am leading you all down this path only to say, ""Well this wasn't one of those movies."", but that would be just plain mean and I'm not like that... Right?Right. This movie is one of those movies.Written and directed by Sofia Coppola (daughter of Francis Ford Coppola, also the director of the visually poetic ""The Virgin Suicides"") this is a simple tale with very simple feelings told in a setting of mass confusion in downtown Tokyo. We follow two drifting souls, Bob Harris (played wonderfully by Bill Murray, credits are unnecessary) who is a big time movie actor tumbling down the ladder of fame until we pick up his trail shooting whiskey commercials for the Eastern market, and Charlotte (played with smooth seduction by Scarlett Johansson, also in ""The Horse Whisperer"", ""Ghost World"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"") who is married to a photographer working in Tokyo and left with little to do and little to feel from her husband. When these two finally meet up, we get to witness that quirky sidestepping routine of small talk mixed with boundary searching subtext. If this story was left in the hands of someone much less adept at keeping a lusciously slow pace we might have found our two protagonists/ antagonists (because to them, they are one and the other) getting some back alley divorces by act two, but Sofia Coppola knows it's about more than that, it's about more than just the hook up. People have so many other ways to prove themselves to each other and show that they care beyond the lusty romp in the sack. As we watch, songs are sung (and not half bad either), glances are shared and even a small touch of hand to foot, but the bridges being built there are stronger by that fact alone.Riding on the wave of success from ""Rushmore"", Bill Murray has not stopped daring to impress and he succeeds here once again. I think this has a lot to do with the general consensus amongst the young and hip filmmakers that Murray is a much deeper fellow than the slovenly groundskeeper he became a star from in ""Caddyshack"". He unleashes a depth in this film, a distance behind his eyes that shows a man who's life is turned out to be everything he didn't want. When he meets up with Scarlett's character, it's that distance that we can see shrinking, collapsing that fading light in his eyes and rejuvenating it. He plays along with being young again around her, but not so much as to truly forget where he is and what his character has back in the states (a emotionally distant wife and kids that are growing used to him not being there). Scarlett's character, on the other hand, is just beginning her trip of self-doubt and aimless wanderings, which is captured on film by numerous scenes (almost too many) of her just walking around to different Buddhist temples or just plain staring out the window. Johnasson's presence on screen belies her youth (she's only 18) and comes at a time when the young and blond market is threatening to be cornered by Disney dropouts. Her voice is is softly graveled and this helps push her beyond her age, but even before that vocal tone developed people were talking about her stunning performance in ""The HorseWhisperer"" at 13 years old. In this performance, she becomes the epitome of youthful doubt and wondering, yearning to find that direction in life after college is over. She handles the screen with Murray without a hint of fear and pushes back with an equal amount of vulnerability and courage, which can sometimes be one and the same. Her career is teetering on the edge of skyrocketing with upcoming performances in ""The Girl with the Pearl Earring"" and ""A Love Song for Bobby Long"" where in both films she continues this trend of being somewhat of a temptress/muse to older men. Keep your eyes and hearts open for this girl.How to conclude a review that is so obviously positive towards the film? I would just say, go see it. There's a handful of moments in this picture that every filmmaker strives for, a true connection without words, or at least without spoken words (a wonderful Karaoke scene exempts itself) and it all caps off with what I feel to be one of the truest endings I've seen in years. I can't honestly say that this would lack much from not catching it on the big screen, but for me, my heart certainly would have lacked from not catching it as soon as I could.",Lost in Translation

I was amazed at how often I found myself annoyed, looking at my watch and wondering when I was going to be genuinely amused and/or moved by these characters. Some scenes seemed to end before going anywhere while others went on too long while going nowhere. I kept waiting for a payoff that never came while enduring too many missed opportunities. The rating would have been higher if not for the added disappointment due to high expectations from Bill Murray and the endless critical praise heaped on this mediocre offering.",Lost in Translation
1166,lhagge,The worst film I have ever seen,1,5 October 2003,"I should preface this review by saying that my husband and I both have advanced degrees, and we see 50+ independent films a year.  So filmic subtlety is not lost on us.   We drove for an hour through horrendous traffic to see this highly-rated film, yet this is the only movie in 25 years of adult moviegoing that we have ever walked out of.  It reminded me of the worst excesses of 60's French New Wave.  Long stretches of people staring.  Long stretches of silence and monosyllables.  More long stretches of loud noise and incomprehensible voices.  Short cut-in scenes that advanced the story (what there was of it) and characters not a bit.  We get it; we get it--these people are ALIENated. Big deal.Can I care about two people who are supposed to be intelligent, yet they can't think of a thing to do to amuse themselves in one of the world's major cities? Can I believe in a young woman who's supposed to be a recent philosophy graduate of Yale, who can't think of anything to do with her time but stare out the window of her expensive hotel?  Can I believe this same young woman came to Tokyo with her working husband, yet seems totally at a loss when he actually leaves to work?  Can I believe that someone who is interested in philosophy so much that she majors in it in college can only be happy bar hopping, dancing, smoking weed, and singing karaoke?  Can I believe that a faded Hollywood star who is being paid 2 million dollars for a commercial would come to Tokyo absolutely alone, without even an aide of any kind?And most of all, can I call a film that does nothing more than follow these two hapless and uninteresting people around for several days without a trace of drama or art profound?I think not.  Don't waste your money.  This is one of those rare instances when I can only conclude that there is some vast critical conspiracy to hoodwink the American public.  Surprise!

1167,maxonfilm,WHAT MORE CAN I SAY?,10,6 October 2003,"I loved this film! I am a huge Bill Murray fan and this goes up among my favorite of his films.In this mesmerizing feature directed by Sofia Coppola (daughter of Francis Ford Coppola), Bill Murray plays an aging actor who travels to Japan to film a series of commercials but ends up being more miserable than he has ever felt in his life. There he meets a beautiful young girl (Scarlett Johansson), who is equally out of place.Together, they form a bond that leds to dark nightclubs and on outrageuous chases. And unknowing to each either, they are beginning to fall in love with each other.Any other film would have had the love more apparent but this movie was not about the love but more about there friendship and them being people. It was about reality and having a character that the audience could relate to.
Some of the most brilliant parts of the movie come from simply Bill and Scarlett talking to one another:Charlotte: I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. Bob Harris: You'll figure that out. The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let things upset you.The movie is funny and in the same instant touching. It will make you laugh and bring tears to your eyes.

1172,Jefferson_Smith,Truly beautiful (and the comments below only confirm its universality!),10,13 January 2004,"Agggghhh.... I can't help feeling that the misunderstood comments below (on racism, etc) only serve to confirm what this film was all about.For me, the whole fulcrum of this film was the philosophical idea that in the (post)modern world, all external objects and feelings can never be truly communicated and have therefore 'lost' their meaning! The depressing thought that we are all ultimately alienated from the world outside our heads.This was why Coppola chose Japan as the most perfectly apt setting for her film. If anything her vision of Japan was that of a japanese cultural nationalist, NOT a racist. The idea is of the alienating and meaningless decay of Western culture where everyone is ultimately alienated from everyone and everything. (The irrefutable evidence for this is the peaceful and harmonious scene where Charlotte visits Kyoto the spiritual home of Japan as opposed to the absurdist 'Western' capital)SPOILERS AHEADTo miss this is to miss the essential and beautiful climax of the film!! Throughout the story we find the absolute and impenetrable alienation of the two central characters within their lives. Both have 'lost the meaning' of their marriages, both have lost meaning to their lives (note Charlotte's bed speech). The Japanese karaoke is Coppola's ultimate metaphor for this: loads of people dansing around singing without the slightest idea of the meaning of what they are singing. Also Bob's sex with the cabaret act has little or no meaning.This is the beauty of the final scene. The embrace of the two protagonists is for me one of the most triumphant moments of recent cinema: Without allowing us to hear their words (as if we heard them we too would have no connection to their meaning as we cannot experience them) Coppola shows how they have triumphed over the alienation of the external word through a shared empathy with each other that cannot be removed by any future experience - even though it is only fleeting.In short to talk of racism is for me to miss the whole point of this truly beautiful film! But such misunderstandings only reinforce its essential point of the uselessness of language and communication, etc.

As they grow a friendship and roam the streets of Tokyo they begin to fall for each other. At this point in the movie i stopped the DVD player, ejected the DVD and just ripped it in half. In my opinion it was a combination of poor documentary style along with acting skills. As the audience we can plainly see that the characters are going to fall for one another by their moods and yet for some reason the actors themselves have to say it. Billy Murray should stick to the 80s movies like GhostBusters and Stripes. What has happened to acting these days???

Everyone seems to have very different interpretations of the nature of Charlotte and Bob's relationship -- lots of affection, but who can tell for certain what either character wanted from the relationship? My personal feeling is that the only impediment to greater intimacy was Bob's marriage (NB not Charlotte's).  Also, I would love to believe that whatever he whispered to her at the end had something to do with further contact, but -- again -- who knows?  I think that Coppola left so much up in the air NOT to remove the focus from the sexual tension -- which was almost palpable anyway -- but to allow her viewers to walk away with whatever interpretation they liked.

My opinion will still be included, just not most of it. I could have written these 200 pages myself with how much of an effect this film has had on me.Strangely enough I agree with those that say it is boring just as much as I agree with those who say it is captivating. It really is just a movie about life, which can most definitely include overwhelming situations of both respects. Though my interpretation of these characters was far from describing them as bored.After many hours of pleasant pondering over this movie, my final word on it, and the reason why I enjoyed it so much, is that this movie makes me feel amazing. I'm a hopeless dreamer sort of person, and when I first saw Lost in Translation I shamelessly imagined truly being there. The mere thought of being in that beautiful place, hanging out and singing karaoke with crazy Japanese pot-heads,falling deeply in forbidden love (with Scarlet Johansen no less)! If and when I make my way over to Japan, I can only hope that my trip goes over half this well.What's more is the very tasteful balance of realism. All throughout studying film, every one of my teachers declared that a good film ""makes you forget you are watching a film. And that's what it did for me. I didn't just watch this movie, I felt it. The emotions it evokes are powerful and downright lovely. But hey, everyone's different.On a last note, I would like to clarify for all those who complained about the movie ""poking fun at Japanese people"": the quirky ways of the Japanese have always, to my understanding, been one of main reasons for many people, including myself, why the country is so unique and beautiful.

He captures the role with such precision that you don't realise this is the same guy who, dare I even mention it in the same breath, provided the voice of Garfield last year. You see a few traces of his characteristic smugness every once in a while, but by and large the Bill Murray you see is a lot more serious... and seriously damned good.It's such a simple story... unhappy married man meets unhappy married woman in a place neither of them are familiar with, and suddenly realise that they're all the other has got at least for the time being.

Having laughed less than three times throughout the whole movie and not once during the last hour I can conclude that it fails as a comedy. Sure the times when Murray interacts with the Japanese director and photographer it's sort of funny, but only for mere moments and then back to boredom. Okay so maybe it could be a drama, but none of it's scenes caused any type of emotional response in me except to write this review. I didn't care much about a spoiled young woman who doesn't get enough attention from her photographer husband. Even Murray's character came off as spoiled, cranky and mean. With no real humor to the character, just boredom and whoa-was-me attitude, I couldn't identify or care about him. Alright, how about a Romance? Well these actors have basically no chemistry because of the age difference. Sure maybe director, Sofia Coppola tried to convey that they were on the same wavelength and that they were the only people in all of Japan who weren't shallow or phonies, but they are shallow and phonies. Neither has very much in common except for being strangers in a strange land. So that genre fails. I guess it falls in to mystery. For example how can it win an Oscar for writing or even be nominated. For anything. Solution: Coppola. Too many pretentious Godfather fans in Hollywood.

I can see both sides of the issues. This is a deliberately slow paced character study of two lonely and isolated Americans staying in Tokyo.One, a washed up actor, Bob Harris, played by Bill Murray having a midlife crisis and feeling isolated that his career is in a nosedive, in town filming a whiskey ad, all while his marriage is suffering. The other, Charlotte, a recent Yale philosophy graduate, played by Scarlett Johansson, in town with her photographer husband who feels just as depressed and isolated as Bob is.The film starts out very slowly, showing the audience how different it is to be a fish out of water in a totally different country. It shows how each of these two characters react to their isolation and how they each deal with their environments.Then, one night in the hotel bar, they each meet for the first time, and the film's romance begins. Murray's Bob Harris is one of the most memorable characters in recent film history. Once you get to know him, the more you begin to like him. Murray's humor makes up for the slower moments in the film. However, his performance mixes moments of joy, with moments of complete sadness.Giovanni Ribissi, who plays John, Charlotte's self centered husband, and Anna Faris, a B rated ""Cameron Diaz"" ditsy movie actress in town promoting her latest movie also give memorable performances.Some of the best elements of this film are not it's humor but it's amazing beauty. Quiet scenes such as Charlotte taking a trip by herself to Kyoto to see a temple while placing a paper wish on a tree, while a Japanese couple get married, is an amazing sight to behold. The beautiful cinematography alone makes this film worthwhile. All this mixed with moments of Bob Harris' great humor, especially his scene with a Japanese ""Tonight Show"" host which is hilarious, and a memorable scene in a Tokyo hospital with Bob trying to communicate with a Japanese elder! There are people who feel that the way that these two characters interact with the locals is ""racist"" which is complete nonsense. Coppola shows the most respect to the Japanese people and since her characters don't understand the local culture very well, it just shows their lack of understanding of Japanese people and it's culture. It takes a mature person to understand the real meaning of Bob and Charlotte's interactions with the Tokyo locals, their confusion, and why they make some comments about it.I cannot state how powerful and moving this motion picture is. However, it is not for everyone, especially those looking for a ""faster"" moving motion picture. It's a slow character study piece, not an action movie. By the end, if you are not completely moved by what happens to these two characters, then you have a lot of growing up to do.This is by far Bill Murray's finest performance, and he should have definitely won the Oscar for Best Actor. His next film, Wes Anderson's The Life Aquatic, is highly expected to be a sensation with multiple nominations. Hopefully Murray will pick up the Best Actor Oscar next year. He's finally starring in great movies, such as Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums that take advantage of his dramatic acting over his famous comedic skills. Hollywood is finally beginning to notice Bill Murray the actor, over Bill Murray the comedian. I'm glad that Murray is taking riskier roles over conventional comedic roles these days.The beautiful and talented Scarlett Johansson finally has the Hollywood spotlight on her, despite memorable roles in The Horse Whisperer and Ghost World. She actually filmed this movie when she was only 17, despite her character's maturity. With this, and Girl With A Pearl Earring, we can hopefully expect more mature performances from Johansson as her beloved Charlotte.Sofia Coppola, who wrote and directed Lost In Translation has her legendary father's gift for direction and you can be sure that Hollywood will be highly anticipating her next project. I'm glad that Oscar rewarded her for Lost In Translation's screenplay.Thanks to all involved for this moving and touching movie!",Lost in Translation
1199,xelaqlito,Amateur directing,3,24 March 2004,"This film seemed directed by an amateur. I don`t understand why it got such great reviews. It's kinda bad (not actually terrible, but almost). Flaky flaky. The camera work seems old and the acting isn't anything to write home about. Bill Murray does ok. He isn't being the off-the-wall character he usually plays, but his smirks are quite endearing. She cries a lot, although we can't be sure why. She's obviously not comfortable with her husband's job and the people he deals with, but, didn't she know that before. They have been married for two years already. In any case, her problem is not Japan or his job. They're just not made for each other. The ending was ok because it was ""real"". They couldn't really have gotten closer together. Still, a weak film all along.",Lost in Translation
1200,alysonkarson,A Subjectively Realistic and Classical Love Story: A Critical Essay,9,22 May 2015,"The late 1920s to the early 1960s was a significant era that the American film industry experienced, which is called the ""Golden Age of Hollywood"". During, there was a very distinctive cinematic form established in the way films were directed artistically and the actual narratives that were being presented. Rudimentary to the classic Hollywood film is the utilization of all stylistic elements to enhance the understanding of the narrative, which is accomplished through the practise of continuity editing. The classical narrative is a three-act structure which advances through the film as a result of tight cause-and-effect events fuelled by the actions of ambitious leading characters. In contrast to the Classical film rose the art film, in which the director is self-consciously expressive and tells a story through a realistic approach. As a result, the art film seeks to solve a problem through ambiguity and the cause-and-effect linkage of the story is loosened. In Lost in Translation, Sophia Coppola starts the movie using a unified classical Hollywood style to direct the narrative, but she also deviates from that which can be seen as authorial expressivity. On the other hand, the narrative that is being told can be viewed as totally one of an art film; the events lack strong causality, and is both objectively and subjectively realistic. The combination of differing style and narrative allows this film to be a hybrid of both an art and a classical cinema.In Lost in Translation, a narrative defined by art cinema emerged, rather than one of a typical classic. Charlotte, is alone in her hotel room and makes a phone call to a relative/friend and expresses that she is questioning if she really knows the man she has married. Charlotte becomes emotional during the conversation and the call soon ends when the recipient is too busy to recognize and address the problem that has become apparent. This reveals to the audience that Charlotte has a complex psychological problem that is expressed to her friend, but remains hidden from everyone, including her husband —part of whom is the problem —and it does not become resolved. Charlotte, a main character, is upset over whom she married and begins to question her love for him, yet she fails to demonstrate any action or goals to change her situation. She is shown immediately in the proceeding clips reapplying make-up and talking casually to her husband as if everything is fine. This demonstrates a realistic narrative which is objective through the situation Charlotte is in, and subjective in her inaction which causes the loosening of the cause-and-effect events throughout the film as she continues to drift aimlessly from one situation to another. This causes ambiguity in what Charlotte will do to solve her relationship problem with her husband and with her newly-found, chance friendship with Bob Harris. The audience is left with an awareness of an authorial presence from the purposely open ended conclusion that generates many questions to fill with subjective interpretations. In order for a classic Hollywood story to be told in the most effective way the style of the cinematic representation must be unified and 'invisible'. In distinction from classical cinema, the art film defines itself against all of the established normality's in the narrative and in result, style. The art films loosened cause-and-effect events and episodic narrative structure allows for a less strict approach to cinematic style than the classic. ""The art film requires the classical background set because deviations from the norm must be registered as such to be placed as realism or authorial expression"" (Brandy and Cohen 781). Lost in Translation demonstrates a hybrid of both classical and art cinema style. The opening scenes and on many other occasions, the style by which Coppola chooses to convey events is of a classical Hollywood style; establishing shots, the 180° rule is abided by, shot-reverse-shot and three-point lighting is used when they the protagonists converse. Not long after the first scenes continuity editing is disrupted and a more stylistic approach is taken to the devices. The jump cut, rack focusing to a fully out-of-focus frame, and lack of three-point light are all used to create an authorial presence as the techniques draw attention to themselves and draw from the story. One scene that demonstrates a style of an art film starts off as a jump cut to a low-angle shot of Bob Harris in a pool with diegetic energetic music playing. The manipulation of the filming through the camera angle, movement, level, speed of motion, and sound are all used in the proceeding shots. Bob and other swimmers are shot in a slightly slower rate, the camera is beside and tracking Bob in the water, with the music muted (as if underwater), and is constantly breaking at the top which then allows the audience to again hear the music clearly. Formal features associated with classical and art film are both evenly used to tell the narrative.Through unique manipulation of the filming and with the occasional use of a classical approach to style, the film studied can be seen a hybrid of both an art and a classical Hollywood film. Coppola becomes notably authoritatively expressive as her 'invisible' style fades to a more noticeable one to the audience. The loosening of the cause-and-effect events and the apparent ambiguity of an art film standout in the film's narrative as it lacks the three-act structure and the goal-oriented protagonists of a classical Hollywood film. Lost in Translation is a motion picture which tells a subjectively realistic love story as a man and a women see desire for each other, but remain in their current relationship. The location and time the characters spend in Tokyo, Japan is rather objectively realistic, as it is not a fantasy land that is depicted in a typical classic. The realistic and authorial expressive motivations behind the narrative can only lead to one fate of Bob and Charlotte's relationship, one that does not have proper closure.",Lost in Translation
1201,cloakedcrow,An emotional masterpiece,10,26 March 2004,"Before I begin, let me say one thing: THIS MOVIE IS NOT A COMEDY.  It has funny bits, but it is not a comedy.  Why it was advertised that way, I have absolutely no idea.  Do not approach this movie as a comedy, because you will be disappointed by its ""slow pace"" and ""sarcastic demeanor.""As a matter of fact, I'm not really sure how to classify this movie. Drama? I guess that's the established genre it most easily fits into, but to me it refuses to fit.  Lost in Translation is a story. . . no, scratch that, a documentary of two people who feel completely alienated by their family, friends, and society in general, who find in each other something that they actually understand.  At least, it would be a documentary if the characters had actually lived at one time, and if this interaction between them had actually taken place.  I call it a documentary because the entire movie feels so real.  It doesn't sound like these are actors reading from a script, it sounds like they're real people saying what real people would say, living out actual lives.  Because they are so real, their emotional pain is that much more heartrending; both are stuck in lives which, at the moment at least, they neither want nor understand nor fit into.  The fact that they are in Japan has nothing to do with it; their very lives have been lost in translation into the real world.  In each other, they could have found romance; instead, they find something much simpler and much more fulfilling: friendship.  They actually pay attention, time, and energy to each other, something the rest of the world has been loth to do.My friends watched this movie after hearing me rave about it and didn't care for it.  They said it was too slow.  Well, it is slow.  Life is slow.  A narrative doesn't just spring, fully formed, from a director's forhead. Emotions and friendships take time to form, especially for cautious people. I didn't think it was slow; I thought it was beautiful.  With every shot of the ""filler"" that my friends disliked so much (such as Charlotte's walks), you could see thoughts and emotions going through the characters minds. These scenes, besides being beautifully shot in themselves, are vital to the development of characters.Well, I've gone on this sappy schpiel long enough, and I've worked myself into a corner from which I can think of no suitable conclusion as an escape. So I'll just say again, this movie is absolutely gorgeous in every way: characters, themes, emotional content, cinematography, and pretty much everything else that makes up a good movie.  10/10",Lost in Translation

But IMDb are very fascist about these things!! Any ways I would have given this great movie 10/10 but didn't due to (drum roll) two reasons. One was my hard to shake Hollywood bias, the lead characters did not end up together. After the brilliant acting the leads pull off they managed to make me forget my ""he's a bit old for her isn't he?"" prejudice to the point where I'm routing for them to break off their ""other"" relationships for the beauty of the moment. Last reason which is connected to the first reason is Bill Murray's character Bob Harris does the right thing. In the bathroom scene where Murray takes the call form his wife and he complains about wanting to eat more healthy and his wife tells him to stay there if he likes it so much I wanted him to say ""yeah well I have met this very hot chick who's half my age and I think she is going to be my fourth Wife how do you like those apples?"". For some reason the on screen connection is so good it makes you forget your moral code and say f&*k it, f&*k your material wife, f&*k the kids who are used to you not being there, f&*k your husband and his Facebook pictures and like Ben Stiller ""Do it Do it!!""

Truth is, its just one of those films that absolutely everything is admirable about it. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansenn are excellent. They both depict two characters that have come to the proverbial ""crossroads of life."" The sense of loneliness is enhanced by the wise decision made by Sofia Coppola to not have the two leads actually interact for first half hour. Through their meeting a very suttle and beautiful relationship takes place. Its not a sensual relationship, but it is intimate. And its not really romance. I don't know what it is, but there is something quite captivating about their relationship. Bill Murray's performance is quite similar to that of Phil Connors in 'Groundhog Day,' a man trapped and lonely (although Groundhog DAy obviously takes this notion more literally). The film, shot almost entirely on location by Sofia Coppola, shows a magnificent Tokyo, and the cinematography is often breathtaking, particularly of shots of Scarlett's character walking around the city and its outskirts.

LOST IN TRANSLATION MADE ME THINK. It made me question my life, its purpose, whether I was happy or not, and what I want do with it. Never has a movie touched me in such a way, and for that reason, this is the one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. That doesn't mean its the best movie ever made, in fact, I can name many that are technically better than this film, like the one I named before. But I cannot name a movie that has had more effect on me than Lost in Translation, and that is why I love it and will love it forever.Think of the last movie that really made you think, one that had such a great influence on you that it somehow changed your life, even for the littlest bit.

Very un-American and very European in its underplayed, lovingly filmed attitude.My only criticism is that it verged on the xenophobic in places. Instead of sympathising with the couple being baffled by the Japanese culture, I didn't like the way the film sometimes made that culture seem wrong, and I felt occasionally like shouting ""of course it's different: just accept it and get on with it !""And - I'm sure this has been said before - it's a superb adaptation of Noel Coward's ""Brief Encounter"" theme.",Lost in Translation

The scenes, the beauty, everything is captured so wonderfully.Some people might think Lost in translation is lacking the notion of a plot.But please do not misunderstood, basically the movie speaks about two people isolated and lonely, trying to find company in each other's hand. And that's what it's trying to convey to the viewers. And the feelings are expressed in what viewers might think 'lacking plot' scenes.I have to comment on one fabulous scene where Charlotte sits facing the hotel and the camera just zoom around her and the city. Here, we can all feel's Charlotte's pain and loneliness. And i think that is one hell of a film that trys to touch people's heart, and succeeding. It gives a feeling of 'this girl lost in this big city' feel.Bob and Charlotte just wanna be friends, they just want to know they are not alone. And japan's spiritual traditions and their living in also captured in this film.What more do u want in a film? This film has it all!! The beauty, the culture, the friendship, the love, the loneliness. And even the veteran actors. Even at 17 (or 18), Scarlett johansson captures a 25 woman so well, and this is why she's one of Hollywood's up-rising star.So please think again if u think this movie is lacking a plot.2 thumbs up for the best film of 2004!!!!

1231,robthecoppo,Sofia rocks,9,14 March 2005,"The movie takes place in Tokyo, Japan. It is about two persons who stay in the same exclusive hotel not knowing about each other at the very beginning.One of them is Bob Harris (Bill Murray). He's an aging, burn-out film-star who has come to Tokyo to shoot a 2$ whiskey commercial. Most of the time he's plagued by jet-lag and sleepless nights. In addition he feels trapped in Toyko because he neither can speak Japanese nor he has someone to talk to. His marriage has reached an all-time-low and he's in the midst of a midlife crisis. Consequently, for him there seem to be no more challenges on horizon. Obviously he feels lost in his life and trapped in Tokyo. This isolation becomes very clear when he's shooting the commercial or when he sits alone in his hotel-room not knowing what to do. His situation is an air-conditioned nightmare.The other person who stays in the same hotel is Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) who's at the age of 25. She accompanies her husband who has come to Tokyo for business reasons. In opposite to Bob she's at the beginning of her life. She's newly wedded, has graduated from Yale and she's looking for her place in life. Like Bob Harris everything in this city is absolutely alien to her. On one hand there is this strict cultural tradition in up to every gesture and on the other hand there is this amount of technology which over-floats Tokyo. For her Tokyo seems to be a shifted version of western modernity. In addition she's most of time left alone because her husband works all over the day. All these circumstances strengthen Charlotte's feeling of isolation. You can say that she experiences a similar air-conditioned nightmare as Bob does.As YOU can guess -All these parallels are just waiting to be connected:After a few days they discover each other in the westerized hotel-bar in the middle of a sleepless night. Bob Harris is glad for having found someone he can talk to. On the other hand there is Charlotte who needs Bob's humor and attention. Out of their kind conversation develops a strong friendship. I think that these little moments of the development make the film very interesting. After the bar, better said their discovery they meet each other more often. They enjoy Tokyo's nightlife for example by doing karaoke in special bars, once they visit a strip club which they leave fast or they just meet in the bar or in Bob's hotel-room. With every conversation they are more connected to each other and at the end there develops a slight sexual tension between them and both realize that the time in Tokyo is running out ... -----------Great FILM-------------",Lost in Translation

This was all the more disappointing because I do enjoy films based around character studies just as much as I can enjoy a good action movie or period drama. The problem for me was that the film just gives too little insight into the leading characters - for the first half of the film we get almost no clue as to the motivations of the two leads. This alienates the viewer and makes the characters just as much emotional ciphers as any square-jawed hero in a summer blockbuster. A character study lives or dies by engaging the audience's interest in the characters, but instead of concentrating on this aspect, huge swathes of the film are wasted on showing Tokyo cityscapes and background shots - beautiful, but it feels like just so much padding that is one more barrier between the audience and the characters.

1234,robert-hughes,Excellent,9,2 May 2005,"If you like and appreciate American Beauty, I'm pretty sure you'll like this film too. The photography is very good, the insights are very well observed and portrayed, and the lead characters are very well acted. There are many subtle touches throughout the film that set it apart from mainstream and make it special. Scarlett Johanssen delivered a great and sensitive performance for such a young actress.The film examines loneliness, and the challenges of married life as experienced at opposite extremes, right fresh at the start, and after many years. In this sense it was very perceptive. If you are married and you travel internationally, you will relate to this film in a major way. When abroad, one's life is always viewed much more dispassionately for what it is, when the surrounding context is absent. It's not uncommon in that situation for doubts and longings to set in. Both characters seem to be wondering if they will make it. Can Charlotte endure what seems to be developing in her life? For another 20 years? Can Bob put up with the continuing inanities of his married situation? But although Bob is severely tested, he appears to come though with the wisdom of experience. He tolerates the craziness of everything with resignation, but fortitude. He gives Charlotte some hope. But at the same time, as we all do at times, he's yearning for escape from the confines of his married situation.The title seems a very good one as there are many themes explored within the context of communication. Are each of the spouses communicating? The fax machine never stops and the phone keeps ringing, but Bob and his wife don't really communicate anything meaningful. His weary, rote ""I love you"" is even cut off. Charlotte's husband never stops talking, but he isn't listening to his wife and apparently doesn't care what she says. He says ""I love you"" a lot, but he's apparently dead in bed is so focused on his work that his wife might as well not exist. Likewise the Japanese hosts never stop yakking, or the talk show hosts screaming, but nothing much is communicated. The nightclub crooners croon but again it falls on deaf ears. The real stuff happens in the small group at the nightclub and when C and B are alone together. Translation can also mean displacement in space, and that is what has happened to our protagonists. Good title.Despite their frustrations, C and B remain basically true to their spouses in the end. They share a lot of intimacy and experience something unique that they will never forget, but life must go on, and they know they have to keep trying (at least for now). This is true to life. This film is an affecting vignette of an experience that you feel could happen. If you haven't seen it and like films with depth and subtlety, you won't be disappointed.",Lost in Translation
1235,curvesetal,fresh air from Coppola!,9,1 June 2005,"I have just watched 'Lost in Translation' for the first time. I apologise if I sound like I am the only one who has ever seen it but it is so rare to come across a film as accomplished as this is.What makes it so refreshing is Coppola's skills of narrative development, which is so sadly lacking in most 'quick-fix/high drama/histrionic acting/special effects' mainstream cinema. Those who found the film dull, plot less etc etc were no doubt suffering withdrawal symptoms from gorging on this easily obtained diet. Coppola's narrative development was almost novelistic in the careful, understated, impressionistic way the central relationship was developed. Refreshingly, she granted her audience with intelligence and the patience to follow her leads. In fact I think a lot of directors should take some time off and immerse themselves in the 19th century novel and see what they might learn from the kind of exegesis that the practitioners of that art exemplify. They will find surprising similarities rather than startling differences between the two forms. Coppola does not need that lesson.Howwever, the director's talents could only be realised by the quality of the acting. I had to check on Johansson's age to verify that she really was as young as I thought. She reminded me of many of Britain's fine, middle aged actresses who bring twenty years of life and acting experience to their roles. I only hope her obvious beauty does not lead her in the wrong direction. At a time when the Star Wars Juggernaut has recently rolled into town again, it is reassuring to be reminded that somewhere out there real talent lives on.",Lost in Translation

1239,YASUE-SAN,Perfect Sympathy in Mysterious Tokyo,8,11 July 2005,"Two lonely Americans who feel isolated from their own partners meet and spend time in Tokyo. Lost in Translation (2003) is the story how they come to be in perfect sympathy with each other in a few special days as they try to plug up the holes in their hearts. The film is directed by Sofia Coppola (The Virgin Suicides 1999), who once worked in Tokyo and decided to use the city as the setting for her film. LiT was given many awards and received acclaim from critics and viewers all across the world. Some reviewers, however, have been critical of this movie because of what they claim is anti-Japanese racism. They say that Japanese in this movie are portrayed without dignity, as funny, ignorant and inferior to the American characters. I agree with some of what they say. For example, some reviewer says that none of the Japanese characters were portrayed as being human or having any feelings. I think so, too. For example, Bob is surrounded by short and similar middle-aged Japanese men in an elevator. They seem to have no feeling. As this, Japanese are described as the movie's background. Undoubtedly, Japanese in this movie are so ridiculous that some Japanese might angry. But Sofia Coppola didn't make the film to criticize Japan. In an interview at www.greg.org (August 31, 2003), she says about Japan, ""I've never been in another place where I really felt like it's another planet."" I think the most important thing for her was to put two American people in mysterious surroundings, someplace like Tokyo. The movie is about feelings of loneliness and sympathy. It has nothing to do with Japan. In fact, I think Coppola loves Japan. During the end credits, you can hear the song by Happy-End, a Japanese band interested in the protection of Tokyo's old street scene. One of Japan's famous artists, Keigo Oyamada, introduced Happy-End's music to Coppola, who liked the song at once. I think she understood not only the song's good sound but also its meaning as well. The song is her way of paying respect to Tokyo and Japan. LiT is surely a strange movie for Japanese, but it reminds us again of the mysterious attraction of Japan.",Lost in Translation
1240,Ms_Granger,it's depend on your view,4,11 July 2005,"Lost in Translation is a film about a famous actor named Bob and a lady named Charlotte who come to Japan for work. They feel alone because no one cares much about them at home or in Japan. For a few days, they spend a happy time together and dispel their loneliness before leaving Japan. This film is portrayed trough the experience of the director, who once worked in Japan. During interviews, Sofia Coppola said that Tokyo was the starting point for making Lost in Translation. Although this film is set in Tokyo, the Japanese play no major roles. Some reviewers have said this film made them angry because it portrayed the Japanese people as cartoon characters who can not pronounce English words correctly. They think that there is nothing humorous in Japanese mispronunciation of English. I can sympathize with them to a degree but I think the film portrayed accurately the serious problem of the Japanese education system, in which most Japanese study English for six years but still can not carry on a simple conversation. In my life overseas, I have met non-native English speakers who could speak much English quite fluently and who studied for much less than 5 or 6 years. Other reviewers were also offended by the attitude of the main characters, who do not even attempt to speak Japanese. But to me this seems quite natural. They were in Japan for work not to make friends. If they had come to Japan for travel, they might have made Japanese friends and so learned a little Japanese. But essentially they are not interested in Japan, which is fine. As a Japanese, I tend to watch these scenes from a Japanese point of view. But as a Japanese person with experience of the outside world, I tend to watch through that lense of experience and so I am not as offended as some overly sensitive Asian reviewers.",Lost in Translation

Bob is a famous actor who comes to Tokyo for work, while housewife Charlotte is in Tokyo because of her husband's job. They feel lonely, happen to meet and fall in love. However, Bob has to go back America and their love is in vain.Director Sophia Coppola once lived in Tokyo and has said in interviews that when she first came to Tokyo, she felt as if she had come to another planet. It seems that since that time she was interested in making a movie in Tokyo, and a wonderful representation of Tokyo, capturing the look of neon, buildings people. It is a good movie for people to learn a lot about Japan. However, there are several things I don't like about this film. The first is that Japanese are shown as lower or less than westerners, as shown literally in the scene where Bob is shown on an elevator with the diminutive Japanese, or when Bob laughs at the Japanese for being unable to distinguish between the sounds of ""R"" and ""L"". Second, I couldn't understand what Coppola wanted to express. Bob and Charlotte happen to meet in Tokyo and fall in love. However, Bob had to back to America. I wonder what Coppola wanted to express. This story's subject is very vague and should have been expressed more clearly.

1242,sumitaki,much to appreciate if we watch with an unbiased view,6,11 July 2005,"Set in the city of Tokyo, Lost in Translation introduces us to Bob, an alienated middle-aged actor, who meets an equally alienated young lady by the name of Charlotte. Their shared unease and anxiety stem from their unfamiliar surroundings and their displaced families. This film describes how they find modest relief through their encounter.Director Sofia Coppola produced this film on the basis of her own experience in Tokyo. Inspired by the mood and view of the city, LiT is a record of what she perceived and felt, honestly described from her delicate point of view. The Tokyo she depicts is inorganic and also creates a stateless atmosphere filled with neon and locked rooms, like a karaoke room and a parlor. She also includes comedy elements developed from what she found amusing and funny in Japan.Some people criticize the way Japanese are portrayed in this film, arguing that they are portrayed too one dimensionally. Indeed there are some portraits that create unpleasant feelings and are not convincing. For example, the scene in which a woman suddenly comes into Bob's room and tries to seduce him goes too far, even if it is intended as a joke. Although non-Japanese viewers may be naively amused, some Japanese viewers may feel unpleasant and insulted.On the other hand, the portrayal of Japan in this movie may be truthful to the experience of foreigners, who may at first find Japan queer, eccentric and mysterious. To see in the same country within a matter of days neon cyberpunk scenes in Tokyo along with traditional Kyoto temples and gardens must be striking for visitors. And scenes such as Bob's head jutting out of the crowd of small Japanese in an elevator can be seen almost anywhere there are westerners in Japan.In the end this movie, though, is not about Japan and or about cultural differences but about alienation in a foreign environment. Bob and Charlotte, who share a sense of loss, could never be attracted to each other except in this kind of foreign environment. If they were in their homeland, they would live without being aware of a sense of loss for themselves and would not approach each other. Their encounter is possible and valuable because it takes place in a foreign environment in striking contrast to their own.Lastly, the overall atmosphere of this film is very attractive. The scenery of the city is especially attractive, even to Japanese used to seeing it, and the music adds a tasteful and melancholic air.

Her other works are Lick the Star (1998) and The Virgin Suicides (1999).Some reviewers have criticized this movie for making fun of the Japanese inability to pronounce English words correctly, often confusing R and L sounds. Probably some of these critics feel that they are being made fun of by Coppola, but the director used what is obviously true for humorous effect. While I feel that Coppola is not mocking the Japanese, it would have better if she had Bob and Charlotte trying to understand Japanese and speak a bit of Japanese while in Japan. Other critics say Coppola makes fun of the tiny Japanese with scenes of Bob towering over a crowd of Japanese in elevator and using a shower that is too low, but Coppola only represents reality directly and humorously.Regarding Japanese culture, Charlotte confusion about Ikebana and shrines is an expression of what Coppola felt when she first came to Japan.

The plot, the exploration of the Japanese surroundings, the characters and their bond and even the photography, which although beautiful, was not enough to save this movie, or to make it comparable to the slow paced European films whose main quality is the cinematography.I believe the idea could have been explored much more deeply. The film could have either kept the aesthetics and lost the romance (or whatever that was, the inexistent relation between the characters) OR spent more time developing a connection which would have made the ""emotional"" scene at the end justified.Not knowing which direction you are going in or having a midlife crisis are not good enough premises to assume depth in the story.",Lost in Translation

I believe that you can talk and share your deepest feelings with a stranger more than what you can do with a familiar face, they can connect the dots with you. The protagonists are both struggling emotionally, but Bob seems to be way less caring than Charlotte. i guess it maturity that makes you not to care anymore and just let it go maybe however, Charlotte is still young, confused and worried about her future and marriage. ""I don't know who i'm married to"" is a very powerful exclamation that sums everything in Charlotte's mind. The title is a bit ambiguous, the kind that makes you think and it has more than an interpretation and all of them are true, all of them fit the story. I guess marriage is all about communication and if you lose this then it's over. Communication is what gets us all together.

Anyway, I finally saw it the other day and was really captivated by the emotional depth that this film conveys. The characters, both so different, are displayed in their stark isolation against the ultra modern, exotic, but alien canvas of urban japan. I found myself analising both of them closely. The need to maintain a front of control and geniality despite the emptiness all around. Their attraction - human rather than sexual (but we all sense it!) - is problematised by their ages and personal backgrounds... I, as a male can already empathise with Murry's character and am sure I will more and more as I get older. I'm sure the same is true from a female point of view.

1250,ttbw7,A true masterpiece,9,29 September 2007,"Of the many hundreds (or perhaps thousands) of films that I have seen in the past few years, this is by far my favorite. The only ""complaint"" that I could possibly have is the fact that it is barely long enough. I felt that the film would have been even more powerful if it were in the 2.5 to 3 hour range - giving us much more time to understand the characters. I do wonder if perhaps, in her infinite wisdom, Sofia Coppola chose to place the film at under 2 hours so that the audience would feel the encounter between Bob and Charlotte was as brief as they may have thought it was. In only a few fleeting moments of beautiful acting/directing/editing, in my opinion, we are left with one of the most powerful yet enigmatic films of the past 15-20 years. The resolution of the film raises numerous questions and answers very few, but the brilliant cinematography and scoring of the film place it on par with some of the most poignant moments I have seen in film history. I think that perhaps only Michael Mann is the only other modern/active director who could possibly create such an incredible final sequence for a film (judging by Heat, Collateral, and even Miami Vice - which I enjoyed immensely despite a poor critical reception).",Lost in Translation

It's about a middle aged American actor and a college graduate who meet in japan.
I am glad that I watched this movie. Though its looks a bit old as more than 15 years have passed since it's release. But the screenplay is amazing. The story line, music, dialogues everything still holds true at present. The acting looks effortless. It's not the quintessential romance were people meet and fall in love. It's about how they meet when they have their own crisis going on and how an unknown culture and country binds them into a companionship. It offers you everything drama, romance, emotions mixed with a dash of comedy. The story line flows smoothly and transitions so well from them being just
acquaintances to developing a platonic relationship and ultimately a deep sense of affection for one another. There is no mushy love or heartbreaks which one might expect. There is this soothing connect and bond between the leads mixed with a certain amount of lingering sadness. It ended on a pretty satisfying note according to me though I will always wonder about it.",Lost in Translation
1252,spaamvessel,generic,6,10 December 2005,"Slow doesn't bother me; I just felt it was too formulaic all the way. There were a lot of things I liked about the film but I didn't think there was much creativity or invention.The flat dialogue, the shots of La Dolce Vita, the mechanical arrangements of meetings, all gave me the impression of a student film, missing magic or surprise. I thought there were lots of pretty shots of Scarlett Johanssonn and Japan. I liked how it was intentionally slow and peaceful, even though it struggled to slow down at times.Unfortunately Bill Murray is not really the action figure. He is a comedian and sometime and ordinary Joe. He just didn't really fit in this role. It would have been easier to change the script to reflect this, than to try to change him. His real personality kept showing through. Scarlett was more convincing, but perhaps due to Murray's personality, she just did a lot of smiling along and did not have real depth.I felt a little disappointed in the end too. How did he see her walking through town when he just left her at the hotel? The whole film was a buildup and then he just gave her a kiss and that was it. Isn't there more?",Lost in Translation

But if we are to get something about ennui or alienation it just ain't going to happen if you slit your wrists before getting to the end of the film. Someone said it was slow moving - slow moving? It's a like a dead snail on Mogodon! I found no saving graces at all - it was hard to know how good or bad the acting was as I kept nodding off. As for the production and direction it could as easily have been made in a broken lift - that's elevator to my US friends - as the backdrop was as irrelevant as the film was pointless.

1254,an_irish_scotsman,Not What It Appears To Be,10,26 March 2006,"On the surface, Lost In Translation is an excellent movie. After the first view however, it gets more complex.The plot is this; Bob Harris, a middle-aged actor whose star is fading, takes a trip to Japan to do a whiskey advertisement. His wife chooses not to come presumably she must take 'care' of the children. Charlotte is a newly-wed whose workaholic husband neglects but doesn't have enough courage to admit he doesn't want her there. Charlotte and Bob are both lonely people, unable to find company or solace in their work/partners. They meet by chance in a hotel bar (they are staying at the same hotel) and strike up an unusual friendship.Sofia Coppola has perfected these characters, and gotten inside them completely, so that when watching, one can actually FEEL what the actors are feeling. The immediate attraction between Charlotte and Bob is obvious, and what they have is more than a friendship, its a total acceptance of each other, and who they are.Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson have great chemistry on screen chemistry together and perhaps this, and the excellent script, is what makes the friendship so plausible. While i watched the movie, I felt like I was there beside them each step of the way, and, I'm not ashamed to admit, my eyes did well up at the end. Truly a masterpiece.10/10",Lost in Translation
1255,shinbucks,Takes itself way too seriously...,3,1 January 2006,"Director Coppola taps into that feeling of being lost we get every once in a while and turns it into a 2-hour movie.To magnify and sustain feelings of isolation, artificialness, and being 'on the outside', Coppola plops her two characters in Tokyo, a perfect choice thanks to its distinct 'foreign-ness' but lack of 'ickiness'. Dialogue is generally at the level of the stuff you do your best to ignore while walking down the street, so when a good line of scripted dialogue comes out of a character's mouth (e.g. Scarlet's phone call early in the movie), it seems out of place. You can tell it had been in Coppola's little diary for awhile.Personally, I'm waiting for Lost in Translation II, where instead of two rich white people, the Murray character is a Colombian on a one-year visa working 10 hours a day, 7 days a week in an assembly line at a Toyota factory sending his entire paycheque home to his family, and the Scarlet character is a 17-year old Filipino with a fake visa whose passport has been confiscated by the yakuza and is being forced into prostitution.But I suspect the people who like Lost in Translation wouldn't like it so much if the characters had real problems.A disappointing 3/10 for the silly Lost in Translation.",Lost in Translation

Just sit back, and let the film take you for a ride (and what a ride it is).This film is beautiful because it takes you inside the lives of two characters who are decades apart in age, but in many ways in the same exact boat. The movie doesn't make judgment, manipulate or romanticize the characters, it just flows with the lives of Bob and Charlotte, until there paths intersect in the most natural way.The characters learn from each other, grow from each other, but all the while don't quite know what their relationship is, or can be.If you like being a fly on the wall, this film is a real treat.",Lost in Translation

To be honest, I almost walked out on this movie the first time I saw it. I went into the theater expecting an intelligent, controversial movie that discussed all sorts of complex cultural issues, with some drug running, bizarre sexual discovery, and possibly a political statement or two. But this film wasn't about obscure mental masturbation. This film was about understanding feeling and spiritual connection (which is why I'm not so much reviewing it but rather reflecting on it's greatness). It's not something I was used to say the least. I actually did get up and begin to walk out of the theater. What stopped me from going home was the karaoke scene. For some reason, something hit me and I just had to stay because I could feel at that moment this movie was emotionally building towards something true to the filmmakers heart.

Check it out.The system says I have to write ten lines or my review won't be accepted so let me say a few more nice things about this film and the first film, ""Somewhere."" I can see now why Sophia Coppola used the long camera shots in Somewhere. She was conveying the boredom experienced by a lost person who is living an improbable and empty life. We're all ""somewhere"" but it's a drag when that feels like nowhere. I was probably a bit harsh on ""Somewhere."" The film just sort of works on you after a day or two. I appreciate Somewhere more after seeing Lost in Translation. Murray and Johansson share a lifetime in a brief fugitive moment of authentic joy -- soul to soul.

I remember there was a funny gag: the Japanase man giving instructions in Japanese during the shooting of the whisky TV ad. However, after repeating same gag several times it lost its effectiveness, like happens to all jokes.When the protagonists part I didn't sympathise with them in the least because there was so little going on between them to sympathise with.In short: this movie/script lacks interesting dialogs between Bob/Murray & Charlotte/Johanson. Maybe that was the idea: to present us two ordinary persons who meet in a hotel in Tokio and start talking trivialities.

Bill Murray was amazing...very funny scenes happened when they were shooting his commercial. The bar scenes dragged but the music was good. The landscape and photography is amazing... yet not appealing in the communication areas....I guess we are all lost in translation. When these two characters connect.....the chemistry works well.

1265,Uncle_Sal,One of the most beautiful films ever made.,10,23 March 2006,"Modern Hollywood is a business often overrun with movies that offer not much more than large explosions, gratuitous gore and sexuality, lifeless characters, and unnecessarily complex, often over the top scripts.Its times like these where it is so refreshing to see a movie where it creates incredible beauty from something simple. Lost in Translation is such a movie.If you do not know the plot of Lost in Translation, it is simple. Bob Harris (played flawlessly by Bill Murray in a role, literally, made for him) is an American Actor in Tokyo making a whiskey commercial. Charlotte (a mesmerizing Scarlett Johansson)is a young post-graduate tagging along with her photographer husband. They are both alone and lost in a foreign place. They meet and develop a relationship that touches them for the rest of their lives.Let me say that this movie is not for everyone. It is a movie about human experience and personal relationship. It isn't out there to entertain (although there are some VERY funny scenes), it is out there to make you feel. People who have very strong empathetic tendencies will adore this movie. This movie is about characters and the relationship between Bob and Charlotte is so authentic, so free of Hollywood trappings, its an absolute wonder to behold. Charlotte needs Bob for his humor and charm, and Bob needs Charlotte because she is a reminder of the youth he longs for in his past. Their parting ways at the end is absolutely heart-wrenching, but at the same time, makes one feel so inexplicably happy that one can't stand it. If they ever reveal what Bob whispers to Charlotte, I never want to know.Another aspect of what makes this film so incredible is the cinematography. The shots of Tokyo are breathtaking, a contrast of the hyper-modern city of today and the Imperial majesty and beauty that was feudalistic japan. Not to mention the soundtrack- it just wouldn't be the same movies without it.In closing I really need to remind people that you may not like this film. You may hate it. But watch it again.

At almost no point within this piece will a normal person laugh out loud, altho' you'll smile here & there throughout.I can't say I'll be viewing my copy another time, unless I'm bored & alone: none of my friends will ""get it"" & care to join me, and it's just too darn slow in story pacing to satisfy unless you're already climbing the walls in boredom.",Lost in Translation
1271,rex-16,Captures the boredom of hotel rooms exquisitely,3,27 February 2005,"A lot of people like this film, supposedly. I haven't actually met any of them, but I gather these people marvel at the subtle progression of the relationship between Bill Murray's world-weary actor and Scarlett Johansson's neglected young wife. To them, those moments where the camera sweeps back and forth, back and forth behind Miss Johansson sitting in her underwear on a windowsill, looking out over the soulless grey cityscape probably come across as poignant. They may even feel the home movie style montages of the neon-lit city streets capture the ambiguous atmosphere of urban Japan in a quaint, yet wilfully spontaneous fashion.I suspect these same people could watch paint dry and glean intellectual fulfilment from dreaming up all sorts of dynamic subtext to enliven the gleaming Dulux finish as it dries to a subtle matt shade of 'gentle fawn'.I am not one of these people. I am one of those philistines who found the music muzak and the montages pointless and cack-handed. The acting is commendable however and the relationship between the two leads is handled with charm, but these successes are hamstrung by the movie's biggest failing: it is a short film. It is ten minutes of drama, padded out with 90 minutes of fluff that only helps the audience truly empathise with how dull getting stuck in a hotel room can be. Though hotel rooms have mini-bars and cable television and, if you're lucky, a bidet. When I saw Lost in Translation in the cinema, I had none of these amenities and therefore came very close to walking out and/or slipping into a coma. I have never suffered such a tedious experience in a movie theatre.So, in conclusion, if you are one of the lucky ones who can take a block of wood and then carve it into a fantastic figurine using only the power of your imagination, then I recommend going to see Lost in Translation: it is a big, blank block of wood, perfect for your creative talents.

1272,Felix-26,"What Sofia Coppola depicts is not a clash of cultures but the rubbing of American pop culture against Japanese pop culture, influenced by America.",4,30 May 2005,"ROST IN TLANSRATION I disagree with some points raised by BBCi and Roger Ebert. While welcoming the absence of the overworked violence and pyrotechnics, I miss any respect for the true differences between the two cultures. The film loses itself in showing the modern Japanese behaving like Americans and offering the minuscule differences as points of interest. In short, what Sofia Coppola depicts is not a clash of cultures but the rubbing of American pop culture against Japanese pop culture, influenced by America. The gaudy talk show master for instance, is definitely more American than Japanese. The only difference between the neurotic neon advertisements around Time Square and those on the Ginza is that they use different sets of characters. Americans the world over are staying in American hotels. So they can be sure of getting more of what they're used to and meet with fellow Americans. Few of them show any interest to get involved into what is truly different in the culture they have immersed themselves in.GLOBALSATION AT ITS WORST When Harris appears for his television appointment, he does so in an open shirt, while all the Japanese studio staff wear a necktie. Certainly not part of their traditional costume, but copied from the Western businessman's. Now this would seem to signal a difference in culture. But its the other way round from what Coppola wants us to see. The attempt to portrait two cultures meeting head-on just backfires. Americans tend to equalise ties with accomplishment, so it's highly unlikely they would ever attend a business meeting abroad in casual attire. Given any motive in the Harris character, I would admire the man for his individuality. But I can find none to warrant this.LOST IN PURITAN HYPOCRISY Hollywood shows us Americans as having difficulties to express themselves, but Charlotte and Bob top anything we have ever experienced before. When they do converse, what they say is utterly meaningless. It comes as a relief, when there is a 45 second scene where they just sit side by side saying nothing at all.INCOMMUNICADO Americans tend to be particularly incommunicado when it's time to share their feelings. After reading the critiques we expect quite a bit of deviation in this movie. We are bitterly disappointed: Neither do Murray and Johansson manage to convey feelings nor do they philosophise on culture, the world and everything, as some critics have it. They just don't find the words even when given the time to do so. The two protagonists seem happy in their misery but utterly desinterested in looking for the differences between their culture and that of their host country.A STORY OF MISSED CHANCES ""Lost in Translation"" fails to show anything worth being called humour. With few exceptions the quips uttered by Murray are not funny. The ability to make jokes about their own idiosyncrasies is lost on American satire. The film is full of missed chances. Although both the Americans and the Japanese seem to think they are superior to other people, they do so on entirely different grounds. Americans see Big and Powerful as synonymous with Great and Good, the Japanese are convinced that their intricate ancient culture preceded and surpassed anything the West had to offer after the fall of the Roman Empire. The Japanese people shown in this film are not the traditional Japanese, but Americanised Japanese. When they say ""Welcome"", ""How're you doin'?"", ""Have a nice day"", ""Are you OK?"" or ""...you know..."", these meaningless bits were picked up from American, not European culture. Empty word shells to bridge awkward moments of inhibition.",Lost in Translation

Scarlett does an equally well job, bringing back feelings that we can all relate too in sometime or another.

Not only does it drag and suffer from trying to be too sensitive and witty without anything actually happening, but upon learning of her relationship problems with Spike Jonze, the movie sunk to a new level of suck for me.  It is obvious, despite her denials, that this is a piece about her relationship with him, he the hotshot director (in this movie a photographer) and she the poor sensitive lost individual.  Are we supposed to feel bad for this overly-analytical person just because she can't figure out who she's supposed to be?  Why even mention that she went to Yale other than to rub it in that she's really smart?  I feel Sofia went above and beyond to make herself look like a victim when in fact she made herself look like an overly-sensitive snooty ivy leaguer whose problems are dwarfed by the average person's.  ""Oh no, I graduated from Yale but don't know what I want to do so I'll just follow my rich and successful husband to Japan and hang out there.""

Yes, it was like a modern day 'BRIEF ENCOUNTER', which gripped cinema audiences just as tightly in its day. Just goes to show the elderly (like me) cynics that very modern films can still be great, and show the modern ones that truly memorable films don't need millions of pounds' worth of special effects to make you hold your breath. I wish I'd seen it at the cinema. I thought the sound was playing up on my little old TV when I couldn't hear Bill Murray's whispered last words! I kept rewinding that bit, with the sound turned up to its limit, and also came onto this website to ask what his words were, so it was very interesting to read above that we are not meant to know.

While Coppola did do a good job of capturing the jet-lagged first couple of days in a distant city, that's the end of the accomplishment.  The premise, the story, were underwhelming at best.  A well educated philosophy student can't find anything better to do but navel gaze in her room or hang out in the hotel bar on her first trip to Tokyo .  Bill Murray's character made more sense, but I didn't buy the connection with Charlotte or the emotional build to the end of the movie.  I expected another facet of the great character he played in ""Rushmore"".  Instead, we got a good characterization of a middle-aged man moping through an assignment he'd rather not have.

The cast is wonderful--Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson gave award-winning performances--I think he lost the Oscar unfairly to Sean Penn, and she wasn't even nominated...shame.

1284,Robsson,Two people who are lost in translating their thoughts,10,29 May 2006,"It seems that Hollywood wants movies to be big and extensive, complex and in a way exhausting. The big movies are rewarded and paid attention to, they are shown in cinemas around the globe and become famous beyond belief. And in this stream of long, elaborate movies only some quiet and unobtrusive, somehow reserved films succeed in entering public attention and approval: Sofia Coppola's masterpiece ""Lost in Translation"" is one of those seemingly small productions that are nearly as much rewarded as they deserve to be. But this picture, having a clever and soft plot, a story that makes you expect the worst, is very big - concerning its contents and the beauty of Coppola's very personal language. We are plainly shown how two Americans that are on the surface totally different from each other - which is summed up in the difference of age that obviously is unmasked as fully unimportant in the course of the movie - get to know each other in a strangely speechless Japanese city. Technically this is reflected by a sound-mixing that seems to stress that all the Americans perceive is either quiet and hard to hear at all or loud and indistinct. The two Americans do not experience any real speaking, conversation, communication with the Japanese. And as the title already hints at it, this superficial problem of not being able to communicate properly in a culture that is entirely strange to them is the topic of the movie. But the state of being lost that seems more vital to the meaning of the picture is the incapability of the protagonists - a young newly-married woman who wants to be a philosopher, staying in Japan because her weird husband, a photographer, has to work there, and a comparatively elderly former movie star who produces commercials in Japan - to speak things out, to say what should be said, to change what obviously needs to be changed. Only in the end does this problem suddenly seem to change, for Bob obviously says something wonderful and significant, but inaudible in Charlotte's ear - though this is not sure and just one possible interpretation of the open ending. It is a sociological, psychological and very personal view that we are given at the same time. An unequal couple that develops something that is - up to a certain point when there should be some words - beyond sex or words, relationship or marriage. It is an adventure in this place where everybody is somehow lost and alone, a joyride through the possibilities of the night in this anonymous city. They come closer and closer without clearing their relation, without any need of it. And when they are lying in bed - a decent and typical distance of a foot or so between them - Bob simply touches her injured foot, saying nothing. And this is the magic of the story: The protagonists do those little things that can change a life, those trivial and small movements, faces and gestures. And Sofia Coppola emphasizes them very indirectly, subtly by showing us pictures without words, sequences in which the distracting sound of the people is faded out and all that is left is this wonderfully emotional rock music. She seems to know what it is like to be part of a flush of feelings and activities, to lose oneself in wild adventures with people, music and looking at each other. And so she takes her time to let those two Americans come closer, making the viewer fully understand why a relation like that is possible, why it is so much better than being married to the young and agile photographer, or being rich and famous. She knows her thing and spends a whole film on a development that other directors would have spent minutes on - to finally deal with something more captivating than just human interaction. And this is what makes this film an unbelievably splendid piece of art: It stresses a thing that is so normal, so average and mediocre: falling in love with the wrong person, not being able to maintain something you truly need, losing yourself in a place and a person for a short and unforgettable time of your life. And it tells a story that is unlikely and interesting, exciting and entertaining: a mature man and a girl being so close and falling so passionately and quietly for each other. It is a lovely, patient, authentic and fantastic film that teaches us what the best and most thrilling moments of your life can be and how fast they are over - but something always remains: the memory of having lived in those very moments that form you more than years can do.",Lost in Translation

I don't like seeing films when they first come out as they usually come wrapped in hype and (in this occasion) public opinion that demands YOU SEE THIS FILM.The whole impression of this film is that it is greater than the sum of its parts. I felt at times that I was watching different films from different time periods. Mainly the early to late 70s when Ms Coppolas father was at his zenith.For instance some of the ""slapstick"" sequences featuring Murray could have come from a Woody Allen picture circa 1973.French Cinema appears to be an influence. I would urge anyone who has seen this to watch the 1980s film Subway with Christophe Lambert.The beautiful and almost claustrophobic detail of Tokyo is beautifully outlined by Coppolla with many different styles of shots including steadi-cam that keep the whole film fresh and moving.You feel that you could almost read the minds of the people and the plot. Again a feature of French Cinema. The people are far more important than the slim plot.It is entirely believable and this type of complicated and touching relationship is not dealt with too often in Cinema because it is complicated, deep and difficult to convey unless you have been there. I was able to work out exactly what would happen and when as if I had been there before.Heck this is great film, great soundtrack, great location.

That feeling of not knowing who we are right now and not knowing what we are suppose to do, to be. ""Translation"" is what we search.

1290,P-Schoppe,A wonderful movie about an unusual friendship in a fascinating environment,10,29 June 2006,"*May contain slight spoilers*This movie, directed by Sofia Coppola, is truly a masterpiece. It is about an extraordinary relationship between an aging American movie star and the young wife of a photographer in an extraordinary setting, namely Tokyo, Japan. Although Bob Harris and Charlotte couldn't be more different at first glance, there's still one thing that connects them - the feeling of awkwardness and oddness they have towards this country, the people and the culture. This culture shock creates a bond between the two characters, which develops to friendship and even a slight love affair. But this is not mainly a romance, but rather a comedy. Bob and Charlotte encounter several funny situations, mainly resulting from the fact that they are ""Lost In Translation"", as they don't understand the language and many of the customs are new to them.Some people say that they didn't like this movie because it's just too unrealistic to see a kind of love affair develop between a man in his fifties and such a young beautiful woman. But those people didn't understand that there is a third ""main character"" in the movie who makes this relationship possible and which isn't visible at first sight, and that is the city or the country in general. This movie's plot would simply not work in any other country. The relationship is inspired by the magic and beauty of the things they encounter in this strange environment. This is where the movie finally becomes a masterpiece: The car trips through Tokyo and Charlotte's trip to Kyoto draw a fascinating picture of this unaccustomed country.And just as Sofia Coppola said, this movie wouldn't have worked without Bill Murray as Bob. Some even see this as the best role of his career. And Scarlett Johansson's acting as Charlotte is flawless as well.And finally, this movie's soundtrack is amazing. It fits so well to the plot, to the pictures and the characters. Especially if you like Japan, you just have to watch this movie.

And the music is mixed into the scenes to paint the kind of tone poem/pictures that meld seamlessly into the film.Perhaps ten minutes too long otherwise near perfection.Johannsen seemingly has little to do but appear desirable but she matches Bill Murray's subtle portrait of ennui and isolation with her growing sense of detachment from her husband and their slowly, delicately dance of curiosity and desire.Beatific pacing.",Lost in Translation
1292,fragmented_psyche,Not really a review ...,9,21 April 2007,"This is one of my favorite films of all time. However, I do not think it is brilliant as everyone says it is, hence my 9 out of 10 rating.I believe it lacks a lot in terms of having a proper plot, and it does not seem to have a direction in terms of development. I find this to be true when I question the (budding) relationship between the two main characters. Are they falling in love? or could it be possible that they find a spiritually special connection that is essentially platonic between the two of them? The subjectivity of this question makes this film rather difficult to comprehend. The kiss at the end was unscripted - if Murray did not improvise, would everyone have considered them 'in love'? The karaoke scene is also pretty subjective - do their 'longing' glances mean that they are 'falling' for each other. OR could said glances suggest that they realize that they share this special platonic connection and/or realize that they are essentially platonic soul-mates? I couldn't decide between the two, because as I examined the latter choice, I realized that both choices could equally be possible.The subjectivity of the relationship between the two main characters leaves a lot to be questioned/desired. However, I do find that the subjectivity of their relationship to have a rather mysterious factor to it. Yet, the subjectivity should not shroud the central theme; Finding that someone/being found by someone and sharing a special connection (be it platonic/romantic) is universal.The piece comes through cohesively/coherently, surprisingly enough. I really believe Coppola lucked out on this one, having Murray (and Johansson) to cover for her script-writing deficiencies. The chemistry between the two is astounding. Murray particularly shines in this role, and it's sad to see him not get the Oscar for this role.I would praise the film, but it's redundant to say what has already been said.9/10",Lost in Translation

Secondly, this movie stars Bill Murray, a likable actor, even though I have not seen a majority of his movies. After seeing L.I.T, I think they couldn't have picked a better actor to play the part of Bob Harris, a movie star turned whiskey commercial actor with a semi rocky marriage.Bob Harris is having a terrible time in Japan while shooting a commercial for a Japanese whiskey. He spends most of his sleepless nights at the hotel bar, where he ends up meeting a similar companion by the name of Charlotte played by 18 year-old Scarlett Johansson (The Horse Whisperer.) Charlotte's husband (played by Giovanni Ribisi, Gone In 60 Seconds,Saving Private Ryan) of two-years is a photographer who is sent to Japan on business is going through the same thing.Despite the age difference, Bob and Charlotte form a beautiful friendship. They do various things around Tokyo, and other places. Bill forgets his troubles, as does Charlotte. They hang out with some of Charlotte's Japanese friends and they go from dance club, to karaoke room and briefly to a strip club (which seemed kind of pointless aside from getting them to wander off alone.)Even though it has an awkward love story, the movie is hilarious; Harris' tall man's struggle to get along in a country where small is the norm. Charlotte, lost in a world while not knowing what to do in life. The scenery is great, as are the shots of downtown Tokyo.

To relive the excitement they used to know. To fall in love again. But at the same time, they know that this is just a temporary relief, and they cannot really escape their lives. And they also know that should they try to, despite all problems it would bring, over time a new rut would probably just set in. In a sense, it is a very fatalistic movie. The beautiful thing about is the way it so accurately portrays people trying to break through this glass ceiling of fate, but not REALLY trying, because they know it is no use, no matter how much they would want to. They at the same time restrain themselves, although frustrated about the limitations of their lives, and try to make the most of the week while it lasts.

The colors, the music, the humor, the strange scenery and the two main protagonists, amazingly portrayed by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson - everything falls into place.

Not your kind of movie. I had to chose between ""The Last Samurai"" and this one, and I'm glad that I went for ""Lost in Translation"" (will see Tom Cruise sooner or later anyway).So what do we have in Sofia Coppola's brilliant little Film? Two lonely people, cast into a world they do not understand - neither the language nor the rules of society there. Watching this clash of cultures was very funny, yet no situation felt constructed or unbelieveable. This is Japan as it is. People there are weird when judging them by our standards. But as the story evolves, as Murray and Johansson get to know each other (and as we get to know them), one cannot help but wonder which society is weirder, the Japanese or the American? Why do Bob and Charlotte need to leave their home country and go to a place where they feel like complete aliens, to be able to realize that they have become aliens to their own lives?The characters do not really develop, it's more what they learn about themselves and their lives what makes the movie so good. Everything is totally believable. There may be silly moments, but there's nothing that you or me couldn't experience in our lives. The characters portrayed are very credible, and so is the relationship that develops between them. We can follow every step of this process, and if you listen carefully to what they say, if you watch them just as carefully, you will be able to predict the development. No surprises, as this is what happens a million times a day, all over the world - and that's the secret of the movie: it is true!Add to this some wonderful actors, brilliant photography and an amazing musical score (I rarely buy soundtracks, but this one I WILL buy!) and you get what to me will be one of the movie highlights of this year (it just started here in Germany).

There are many great interactions between Charlotte and Bob Harris (played by Bill Murray), but there aren't any times where Charlotte shows any other facet of her character besides her emptiness and sorrow. Her being that pitiful the entire time she's in Tokyo just makes her unbelievable to me. Real people are multi-faceted. Even when they're distraught or sad, or just feeling empty, they will have those up moments when their inner strength kicks in. Charlotte never displays this. Perhaps there are people out there in the world that are this weak. But I just don't believe it.I wish I wasn't so bothered by the character development of Charlotte because there are some excellent aspects of this film. Many of the shots between Charlotte and Bob are perfectly crafted to convey their underlying connection. And Bob's character is developed well, as he comes across as a real person with multiple facets to his personality. Overall, I would still recommend this movie, especially as a rental.

At one end, this movie could be a spring break fling (keep in mind that there is no bikini contest in this movie).  I assure you that it is not.  For anyone that has been in dark hotel in another land (not necessarily a bad thing) in the lounge and seen someone across the room and just wanted to know them more than through a simple smile, this movie fulfills that desire.  Most would be scared to leave their other life for a moment and jump into something else head first.  Lost In Translation is not quite head first but just a toe in the water.  It is so damn moving that I feel special for seeing it.  I like Lord of the Rings and Braveheart, but I assure you that the people who said this movie was boring hold a special place for the two movies I just mentioned.  You have to become emotionally available to this movie in order to enjoy it.  I loved several scenes, especially where Bill Murray sings Roxy Music's ""More than This.""  The look from Scarlett Johansson during this scene is as convincing as any I have seen from any movie in years.

There is not a lot of chemistry between the two main actors, and they seemingly get together (in the unbiblical sense) merely to move the plot along. The script is sparse, seemingly used only to set up character depth that the characters themselves are incapable of revealing otherwise. The directing is okay.

1336,babibeli-1,"lost - location, words and direction",9,20 February 2008,"With the over-development of materialistic cravings, 'Lost In Translation' examines the loneliness and search for oneself of two Americans in a city different in culture but similar in spirit  Tokyo.As with her latest flick  'Marie-Antoinette', Sofia Coppolla tells about human dazzlement and frustration in life, and the inclination to use physical engagement to conceal those feelings. This time, the setting has changed from the extravagant Versailles to the highly-advanced Tokyo.The story started with Bob Harris (Bill Murray)  a middle-aged regressed movie star arriving in Tokyo for a Sunatory wine advertisement shooting. On a sleepless night, he met Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson)  a fresh graduate who was accompanying her newly-wed and hyperactive photographer husband to a business trip. They shared the strange insomnia abroad. Looking for a way to kill time, they joined hands in exploration of this bizarre city. During the 5 days, they exchanged their frustrations and puzzlement in life.Bringing with them discontentedness, in Tokyo, Bob and Charlotte left their comfort zone and are faced solely with themselves. They had a big cultural shock, literally no friends, they couldn't sleep  they didn't know why. Deep in their heart, they knew it was hollowness. In the perfect setting of Tokyo, they experienced many local entertainments (from slot-machine to table-dance) and literally slept because of physical tiredness. The 7 days was no happy vacation, it was a cycle of think-stuck-play-sleep.Sofia Coppolla was successful in bringing out the cultural shock by painting the overwhelmingly-bustling side of Tokyo. The miniature and high-tech where the Japanese culture executes in a fast pace gives us a slight discomfort  if we are not watching the film like another episode of the Lonely Planet. The gigantic brightly-lit advertisements, dense skyscrapers, the short shower makes every experience a dense one, if not eccentric. Compiled with the excellent soundtrack, it only made the whole atmosphere more of a confusion. The dreamy electronic music captures the soul of the movie. It unsynchronized beats and tone drives away from pop-music popular in city scenes, and the soul of the listener too. In fact, as with Sofia Coppolla's other works, she makes a perfect blend of the far-fectched indie and lo-fi music into our imagination. Pointing to this aspect, the movie is an usual gem that introduces audiences to culture in a wider ground.Though not stated, the movie portrays how modern people lost themselves in face of contentedness. The contentedness comes from the societal expectations, they follow a routine to happiness, they succeed. However, it does not last, the wanted to run after what they really crave. To take such a step takes courage, they constantly lack it. This is frustration, but when they are used to it, they accept it.The combination of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson creates great chemistry. Bill Murray, as in 'The Broken Flowers'  did an excellent job in playing a cynical mid-aged men used to frustrations in life. The prophetic yet emotionless eyes tell all about 'Bob's mind. At moments that ridicule Japanese oddness, we could echo Bob's contempt simply by looking at his eyes. Scarlett Johansson made a refreshing performance. Both her eyes and body language plays Charlotte who is still searching for her path. When Charlotte is in doubt, she approaches Bob, and then Bob sees exactly himself in it. Their expression of the friendship, understanding and illusioned love.The scene that gives us a taste of true cultural shock and language difficulties was the shooting of the Sunatory ad. Where Bob was asked through the translator by the Japanese director to add more intensity. He looked totally puzzled. At that moment, even those who find this soul-searching movie boring would couldn't help but laugh aloud.'Lost In Translation'  aptly named, is a story about lost in location, for words, and for direction. This film may be totally clueless to some of the movie-goers. It actually brings forward the confusion that everyone of us face or shall face. Above pondering on the big question, we may also feast our eyes on the breath-taking beauty of Scarlett Johansson and the scenic Japan. This is definitely a trip worth-making.",Lost in Translation

Kind of a 'cute' movie, riding on that independent film vibe of the individual's search of meaning in life, struggling mightily against an ignorant and heavily cynical world. Sounds like a downer? Never fear, this movie spends 85 percent of the time making fun of japanese people.
If these were scathing attacks, perhaps this movie could almost pass as parody, making fun of stereotypes by overkill is quite effective. Except these were literally, 'let's make fun of the Japanese as bizarre little benign aliens who want to become like us.' This is about two white people trying to have fun in an alien land, shaking their heads at the ridiculous customs of these funny little people, marvelling at how the Japanese could be so different from our own sensible caucasian perspectives. There is no japanese character in this movie who is not grossly caricaturized. Also, whenever Sofia Coppola directed a long lull in the film, hey, insert reocurring joke about height/accents/culture and make the audience laugh, again! There is no such thing as a tired joke in this movie, some jokes are methodically inserted every 15 minutes.Actually, it's really worthwhile to watch Sofia Coppola deftly direct the profoundly subtle relationship between a 21-year-old yale philosophy major and a washed-up 55-year-old actor. Sure...they both...don't like their lives, do like to drink at the bar, eat food (hey at least no more jokes about monkey brains, huh? good thing this wasn't a korean movie), crack jokes about the japanese! The movie should have the tagline, ""How any two white people, no matter how different in age and personality could become soulmates once thrust into this horrible technologically advanced but spiritually backwards world."" Or ""Peter Pan and Wendy in Captain Hook's Oriental Nevernevernightmare."" This movie can be metaphorically summarized by how any two people can fall in love on a deserted island, a deserted island full of poisonous snakes, fetid water, quicksand, and erupting volcanoes.I challenge anybody in the world,including any type of funny little aliens, to logically prove that the particular setting of Japan was necessary to the plot of the movie. Would the relationship between Bill M. and Scarlett J. be any different, if say, it took place in manhattan? Absolutely not, but we wouldn't have the 'comedy' aspect of the movie. And what makes it comedic? Are you laughing at comedy, or are you laughing at the Japanese, these common, stereotypical jokes?

I would write about something that happened if anything actually had.

1345,Aufwiedersehen,So simple yet so much depth,9,29 October 2003,"This truly is one of the greatest films I have seen in a very long time! Having read absolutely no reviews and seeing none of the TV trailers, I walked into the theater expecting to see your average not-so-special comedy flick. To my surprise, this movie gave me so much more. Many criticized that it lacked in feeling and emotion. To those I only have one thing to say; you're either a very cold hearted individual, or you just don't obtain the intellectual characteristic that's necessary to grasp the essence that Coppola so beautifully exemplifies. Although this film is simple, it really holds a profound meaning that many people can relate to. I personally felt connected to the film despite never having gone to Japan. I was able to feel connected to the genuine relationship that Murray and Johansson exhibited, and when the movie ended (***possible spoiler***), I was able to feel a synchronized feeling of satisfaction and anguish (It truly was a beautiful ending, possibly one of the finest I have seen in years).This movie, unlike most of the trash Hollywood produces, will linger and continue to linger! I needed gratification, so I went to see it again and again. Instead of noticing the usual flaws that viewers tend to discover after seeing a movie for the second time, I was only captivated by its beauty once again! I gave it a 9/10, this movie touched me!!!",Lost in Translation

With Sofia Coppola's poetic vision; combined with Bill Murray's effortless dry sense of humour and scarlet johanson's powerful and emotive portrayal of loneliness and despair...Together these faces have created a masterpiece.Some critics have actually criticised the narrative, claiming it lacks depth especially with its purposefully vague open ending, but I strongly protest as people are only taking the film at face value, for if you delve deeper into the film- past the mesmerising city lights and the funny cultural differences ( this will require more than one sitting), you will find a very deep and provocative look at the dynamics of relationships, often exploring the often tangible sense of loneliness and isolation that we all face especially when away from home. But most significantly, people seem to be forgetting that essentially this is an independent film which ultimately means it mirrors social realism, therefore if you enter this film expecting a typical Hollywood narrative with its generic conventions of slapstick humour and larger than life action sequences, yes you will be disappointed...But once you accept the message and purpose behind this film, you will be able to appreciate what a monumental achievement the film really is, and how actually it is far more complex and thought provoking than any of the predictable and bland blockbusters that Hollywood keeps churning out by the dozen...So if you are fed up of wading through genre's that are becoming repetitive and cliché, and fancy something that is refreshing to the eye but still delivering on the entertainment factor; often making you laugh, cry and ultimately engage with the text...Get lost...Lost in translation.",Lost in Translation

I first watched it only as recently as September 2005 while I was actually staying in Tokyo for 3 months - working as a cameraman. In fact the day before I had been at the very hotel where the movie is based, at the very bar - before I had ever watched the film or knew the locations. I was homesick at the time & could relate to the plot pretty well 100%. The cinematography is fantastic as well. It just goes to show that with a strong idea/script & the passion & expertise of this director,crew & cast, that you don't need 100 Million dollars to make a top movie. 10/10 - PS Get the soundtrack - it's a work of art in itself & get yourself to Japan & get a life!!!

1348,asian_on_mail,Pretty bad - I'm lost!,4,24 May 2009,"Why would someone direct a movie like this one is really beyond me. Bill Murray acts predictably - same funny jokes as in other movies, not bad. That's the only good part. Movie starts off with a camera focused on see-through panties of the main heroine, and yes you can see her buttocks clearly well. Then camera fades away and dives into a movie. Why the scene? No reason. Never explained. She continues to wear those panties throughout the movie, why? I guess she is hip or something. There are quite a few disjointed, unexplained scenes like that. No, I don't need everything spelled out for me, but such scenes which mean nothing at all and should've been cut are just stupid. As some other reviewers said, this movie makes fun of Japanese like crazy, even to the point of plain stupidity. For someone who said that this movie is 'down to earth', this statement is wrong. This movie is the pop culture of the day, from beginning to end. This is reflected in explicit content, such as nudity (which is a part of Japanese culture, indeed), but is not necessary for the movie's story. Bill Murray is supposed to be married and is in his mid-life crisis, and while on his trip to Japan, sleeps with another woman, then in the end, flirts with the main heroine and then returns back to America to his beloved wife. Is this not the pop culture of the day? Sex with no consequences, behind back of your partner. This movie is about pop culture and promotes it, is not down to earth, but just down. The movie is boring. It has no story of any kind, doesn't end the story in any way, they both return back home, after having cheated on their spouses and having made fun of Japanese culture and Bill is still in his mid-life crisis, and the girl is still unable to sleep, or whatever her problem is. No point in watching this movie. It is relatively short, has some charm, but ultimately no story. It's downsides (racistic humour, pop culture all over the place, disjointed scenes which add nothing to the movie) outweigh it's positives (lots of scenes depicting Japanese culture, Bill Murray's humour).",Lost in Translation

I think they fall in love, and I'd love to know what it is Bob whispers in Charlotte's ear at the end. Could it be the famous ""I'll be in touch""?

1354,nitesh999,The most touching & meaningful story of relationship ever,9,26 September 2010,"I found this film to be completely true (in the 'keep it real' sense), absorbing, thought provoking and really touching that I find myself with a real urge to write a review, not because I feel like it but to reciprocate in a small way the way this film has contributed to my enjoyment of cinema in general.It tells a story about two souls who, despite having talents (one is a movie star & the other is philosophy student from Yale), relationship (both married) and surrounded by people they find themselves lonely and melancholy but not because they are in a foreign land with different language, custom & culture that they are not used to but because they find themselves in relationship which they come to realise that it will not lead to any meaningful conclusion.Although he film is set in Tokyo, Japan this has no resembles to the main point of the film which is being stuck in relationship that is petty, meaningless and uneventful. Sophia, the director, or the film is not trying to prove any point, good or bad, about the Japanese or Japanese culture but is merely using this as a backdrop.This loneliness and detachments from people that matter in their life brings them increasingly (I must stress that this word is a crucial element of the film and I shall talk more of that later) bring these two lost souls closer together. The two most important aspects of the film, as far I'm concerned, that I would like to elaborate about are the timing and the need to view it twice!The movie starts with the two main characters Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) completely differently but come increasingly together which is really appreciable on second viewing. To really appreciate the movie you do need to see it twice as what might've seemed as trifle or boring routine to be an important part o the film. I would like to appeal to those who find this film boring or uneventful n the first 10-15 minutes and therefore likely give up, is that please try to persevere with this film as I'm sure that by the end of the film you will see that it was worth it.The film starts with the two shot individually for some time before they come in to contact where only one is cognisant of the other, second time they both acknowledges but don't speak, third time they speak but ever so briefly etc. It is about forming a relationship (ill defined though it might be) of two people of different age (23 v. 55 in my opinion) with increasing understanding, appreciation and love. The main point of this film was that these two people have complete and mutual understanding of each other and find Zen in each other's company without having to have falling in to love head over heels or having physical relationship.The film has music that is tune with the main theme of the film and it has a great, albeit an inclusive ending which like the ending of Planet of the Apes makes the whole film rewind in your memory.

The actual plot comes across very simple and realistic to begin with but it evolves throughout and you find yourself constantly evaluating the scenario thinking what would I do? Bill Murray as always is brilliant (possibly his best performance) and Scarlett Johansson brings the beauty and sparkle to the movie. I don't want to babble on about what happens because you should watch it first! Sofia Copola's trademark shots from outside the car looking in and sunlight bursting through tree leaves etc capture the emotions of both main characters in a way that's so difficult to do and with the addition of outstanding music that fits SO WELL its hard not to like this movie If your looking for an action packed thrill ride then I suggest you look elsewhere but for a film that's real, complex and aesthetically beautiful Lost in translation takes a lot to beat.8/10",Lost in Translation

1365,throwout01,Pleasantly surprised.,9,24 September 2003,"I too thought this movie was over-hyped (among the alternative media, anyway... there was hardly anything in the mainstream media) and went in half-expecting another empty, overly ""artsy"" waste of time.In fact it was a solidly written, directed, and acted film. Yes, Bill Murray was/is probably today's most masterful comedic actor and this film is an excellent example of what he can do when given a great script and directing. But this movie isn't just about making the audience laugh at the differences between East and West. It's about the absurdity and confusion the two main characters are experiencing; life for Murray and Johansson's characters is not what they expected or hoped, yet the two are able to see beyond their frustration and find momentary happiness in their bonding.The only issue I could bring up about the movie is its apparent lack of focus. At times it seems like Sophia Coppola is just making a montage of hip/artsy imagery... blurry landscapes and well-composed actresses in windows, etc. When I was watching the movie I wasn't too bothered by these slightly aimless moments, but they still broke up the pacing of an otherwise quick-moving film. Obviously these bits are almost a form of audience participation; while watching these comparatively slow-moving segments, I had a palpable sense of the lead characters' general malaise.The realism in this film is astounding. I have been to Japan, and the movie made me feel like I was walking through Ikebukuro's red light district to the Yamanote line (on my way to Harajuku or Shibuya) all over again. Partially, this movie resonated with me simply because of the connection I felt with the situations and characters LIT presents. But the connection goes beyond the superficial. I'm sure many people go through much of their life in varying stages of confusion and uncertainty... if you're one of them, go see this movie.

Despite the fact they are stuck in Tokyo for business they took advantage of the time spend by builds an incredible bond. Bob and Charlotte show how two strangers meet during a time when both of them are frustrated with there lives and decided to become friends and eliminate some of the everyday stresses.

Bob helped Charlotte get out and enjoy life. Bob helped Charlotte smile again. The directed did an excellent job with the lighting this movie had a dark or low lighting showing how it an emptiness each character held. How each character is withdrawn and dark within themselves.

They expect something big because if features Bill Murray and is directed by the daughter of a famous director. All of this over-hyped expectations are enough to blind people of actually seeing their own hand in front of their face.Also, the outcries of the film being racist are ludicrous and stupid. The elevator scene which Murray is taller than most of the other Japanese people is racist? Gimme a freaking break. Japanese people acting stupid? FOR YOU WESTENERS PERHAPS, does every person of different culture have to act the same as us westerners?

Is that so hard to understand? Any typical Hollywood director would've made them lust for each other and screw each other, but that's not what this film is about. It's about the basic thing that makes us human which is ""friendship, love and respect,"" and Sofia Coppola made a hell of a job depicting it.You people should watch this movie for what it is, not for what you THINK it will bring, and if you do, you'll find a more beautiful and meaningful film than what you could possibly find, because it's within us, and we have lived through this.Ignore the hype, and ignore the negative comments, Just watch the movie.

1374,flyingchow,self-indulging effort,4,21 September 2003,"I sincerely came upon this movie with a wish that Sofia Coppola would show some (potential) talent in filmmaking with her resources and her position in the film industry. I wished she would made a splash in a mundane, tired American Cinema. I really did since Virgin Suicide was a quite some effort.Unfortunately, Lost in Translation was badly written, and it falsely disguised as a character film with no characters that could carry the film. This is a senseless film if not only mediocre. Do not fooled by the hype of it being a subtle, silent, private moments kind of film; Lost in Translation is almost self-indulging to a large extend. Its cliche are embarassingly student film like, with the usual cultural differences, and ha ha that's wacky about the Japanese type of humour. It is severely ignorant and racist. In other words, brainless humour.The private moments are too familiar, the emotional reactions (or lack of) towards each other's spouses have been told too many time in plays and films, and the usual emptiness one feels is overstretched. Nothing in this film and no characters in it are idiosyncratic, nor utterly themselves, nor special enough for us to be attracted to.It is about a space that is neither spatial (nothing about the notion of ""lost"") nor emotional. It is purely narcissistic of what Sofia Coppola as a writer wants. The film apparently suffers.It is as if the writer merely had a general idea of how a fading and aging star might have felt, or a young neglected wife would have gone through, and put together a cinematic story. It just does not work that way. It is purely writer's type of self-indulgence. There is nothing ""sensitive"" towards emotions nor towards relationships with people, with spaces, with oneself. The film is not thoughtful in its writing and building.It is obviously a failed attempt of an inexperienced writer/director making a film about life as she has no knowledge of such, at least not conceptually and intuitively.Bill Murray gives a decent performance but unfortunately is limited by the character he portrays. A man with (past) glory left with much room and space to introspect is a notion worth exploring. But the director/writer has looked pass this and subsequently made a film about a whiny (rich) man and cliche rendering of her idea of mid life crisis.A philosopher wanna be young woman who claims to have a philosophy degree, goes around town and shrines to find inner peace and spirituality is still only a wanna be.Put all this together leaves a film which is a bad imitation of neon light city (spatial and emotional relations) as has been done successfully by Wong Kar Wai, and private gestures of emotional life and intimacy as done quietly yet profoundly by Lynn Ramsay (also just had her sophomore effort with ""Movern Callar"").It could have been beautiful to explore a relationship between an older person and a younger one. This theme is already intriguing to explore properly. Unfortunately the film ends up with a question, ""why are these people feeling so empty, oh poor stars, they must suffer..."" Even if so, the film could have been all about that. It goes nowhere.There are moments which are noteworthy and lighthearted. They earn a few laughs. But overall, it is a overhyped film where its supporters blindly believe it as a beautiful, sensitive film.

1375,tinseltoes20,"boring movie, inaccurate view of Tokyo",1,22 September 2003,"I think the film makers have spent a few weeks or months in Japan maximum, and did things like go to night clubs, weird parties, and the usual tourist spots. Probably due to this the movie comes off with a view of the country like Americans usually have of other countries-- inferior to their own and things that they encounter and do not understand, instead of trying to comprehend they just brush off as quirky or act like they are putting up with something.  The only American who fit into Tokyo really well was a freaky American actress there giving interviews for a new martial arts flick.And the plot... a wife goes on a business trip with her husband and gets p***ed because he is working all the time? A father's kid runs out of the room and refuses to talk to him when he calls home? What kind of father is he when he is home to have a child who reacts like that?I had no sympathy for these characters whatsoever.I further got annoyed when they reflected their own insecurities onto their host country. Made jokes about Japanese people (both in their presence and not) and sulked around. And the film makers didn't even get the jokes right -- one really not funny one was how the 2 main characters went to a hospital and no one spoke English.  Bill Murray made some crack about how they were not going anywhere else and the female looked blankly at the doctor.  Ha ha. Americans making fun of non-English speakers in non-English speaking countries is not humorous to begin with. Especially in a country where the language is so far different from English and really difficult for native speakers to learn.  Would it be funny if Japanese tourists came here and laughed at Americans because they cannot speak Japanese? And it was actually inaccurate because Japanese medical doctors pride themselves on their English ability-- they are taught quite a bit of English in medical school. And the hospital most likely would make sure to give the non-Japanese speaking American tourist visiting a hotel there a doctor whose English is especially good.And the translator for the advertising company, in the first scene her English was quite good but then she could not translate the simplest things the camera man was saying to her.  The camera man was saying really simple things in Japanese, things like-  you are waiting for an old friend as you drink your Suntory- it does not matter if he turns from the right or the left- this is a top of the line expensive whiskey, treat it that way- (when he said this the translator said something like- do it more slowly).  How could the previously adept English speaking translator not get any of it right.And is doing group exercises really that funny?  Maybe that is one of the reasons Japanese people are not as fat as Americans because they exercise regularly (and eat healthy food, which the Bill Murray character did admit).Japanese people cannot pronounce 'r' and 'l' sound? Don't we all know this? (and don't think it much of a curiosity. very few in the audience laughed at this one) Incidentally, Japanese has a sound that is actually pronounced somewhere between 'r' and 'l' and it is a rare Japanese-speaking American who can get it right.I think the goal of the Kyoto scene was to add a (gratuitous) touch of the exotic. Japan is in the mysterious Orient, after all.",Lost in Translation
1376,allwrite13,What's getting 'Lost In Translation' here?,9,22 September 2003,"The basic human feelings we all have.  We can all say these things, but how much time are we devoting to what truly is being felt in a world that is getting more systematic through technology & language?
Charlotte & Bob are caught up in lives that don't have time for 'smelling the roses' with someone other than themselves.  Though they are both attached, neither of them is able to connect with their significant other(or anyone else for that matter) The relationships they engage in are forced through mundane, or false gatherings with people trying to make phony insights(the Cammy Diaz-esque character was a nice touch), or in Murray's case, people wanting to leach onto whats left of his fame.  When they finally meet, they realize, even though they are seperated in age, job, & experience they have a common want - feelings of life from outside the rat race.  Someone who they can simply be themselves with, sharing the time.Coppola does a tremendous job here of making the audience feel the loneliness & needs of her characters, without being overdramatic or by usi ng cliches.  This film has a very autobiographical feel to it, i'm shocked that Sophia has made such a personal film, and with great imagination & honesty.
Murray & Johansson are magnificent, especially Johansson, who transforms herself almost identical to the writer/director, who I believe this film is based on.  The opening shot basically gives that point away, if you understand the meaning.This is the best film i've seen this year('American Splendor' is close 2nd).

A truly refreshing change from the ""put it out to make a buck movies"" that have become too common. I believe the genius of this film is how the director was able to convey the feelings and atmosphere of Charlotte and Bob at different points in their lives reaching a sort of crossroads aggravated by jet-lag in a foreign environment. The scenes at times focus on the individuals and a sort of fear and loneliness each face while apart and at other times combine them into a bittersweet romance. If there is anything negative about this film it is the editing of the film. Two scenes in the film left unanswered questions. Charlotte sends a drink or something over to Bob's table. (I missed something here, this is the first time she really notices him.) And how did Bob know where Charlotte's room was when he first picks her up?

1382,TakeTheCannoli,Stop whatever you're doing and go see this film.,10,5 October 2003,"With so many heavily-hyped blockbusters due to be released in the coming weeks, ""Lost In Translation"" might get overlooked. Combined with the news that the MPAA will no longer distribute screeners to Academy voters, I'm concerned that LiT won't get the exposure it deserves. That would be a shame: it's fantastic.To be sure, there will be a lot of people who don't ""get"" this film: if your ideal movie is one where Something Must Explode/Someone Must Be Killed/Will Smith Must Say Something Cute every five or ten minutes, then stay home and watch your copy of ""Charlie's Angels"" for the fifteenth time. Otherwise, stop whatever you're doing, cancel your plans for the day, and drive yourself down to your local CineMegaGooglePlex RIGHT NOW!This film is absolutely inspiring, and I'm hoping that it will receive enough buzz to warrant attention at Oscar time, specifically:Bill Murray: Was he really Carl Spackler 23 years ago? Murray's work in LiT is confident, nuanced, and controlled, despite reports that many of his scenes were fueled by large quantities of sake. Sure, he deserves some Lifetime Achievement recognition, but his work here stands on its own as well. It's his best performance, ever.
Scarlett Johansson: She was excellent as Thora Birch's sidekick in ""Ghost World,"" and she's even better here. In ""World,"" she gravitated between obnoxious sarcasm and sarcastic obnoxiousness, and while there's some of that here in LiT, this is a fully realized performance. It sure doesn't hurt that she's heartbreakingly beautiful  also. And that voice! I love her voice.
Sofia Coppola: From now on, I will go see every movie she ever writes or directs. This is a smart script that still left room for improvisation. Her direction conveyed what it feels like to be claustrophobic, even with the sprawl of a city like Tokyo spread out in front of you. Every shot is perfect, every angle well-constructed. She also shares her dad's talent for using reflected images.We saw this movie two days ago(in different cities, separated by three time zones), and my wife and I haven't stopped talking about it since.

The relationship between the two characters is so well portrayed and seems so real that, as an observer, you do not want it to end. Overall I think this film is brilliant, as far as acting, photography, and soundtrack.  The fact that much of it is based on Coppola's own experiences in Japan adds to the depth of it. The ending was very well thought out. Only the reaction of the two characters is seen, we cannot hear what is said between them...will they meet again?

It's a great story of an American movie star who is lured away from the USA to shoot some liquor advertisements in Japan.  Once there, you get a sense he feels a million miles away from normality, as he looks out of the cab and sees nothing that he is able to read.  The plot only thickens as he attempts to take a shower, only learning firsthand that showers in Japan are made for people under five feet! It's a hilarious stint of American humor in Japanese Culture.As for the writing and the direction of Sophia Coppola, she does a wonderful job in pacing the story.  There is an intimate feel to the film that very few American movies possess.  I was thoroughly impressed in how the film had a continuity that gave it a quality of dreamlike status.  Sophia Coppola truly did a fantastic job as a young writer and director.The acting in the film is phenomenal.  From the fast talking Japanese director, to Bill Murray's comical reaction to it, you should be rolling within the first ten minutes.  Scarlett Johansson turns in a remarkable performance as young married girl searching for her true identity in a country where she can barely speak!  It's a very courageous role, and I applaud her for taking it.  The exchanges between Murray and Johansson are often quirky, however genuine.  Although generations separate who they are and what they'll be, they both find a common bond in a land that is far different from back home.Overall, I think the film has to be one of the top films of the year.

1390,doug212,Wasting Daddy's Money,1,20 October 2003,"Sofia Coppola has triumphed by extracting from Bill Murray the kind of dramatic flair he had hoped (but failed) to project 19 years ago in ""The Razor's Edge.""  Unfortunately, Coppola, as writer, producer and director, fails in almost every other aspect of this film.While Scarlett Johansson's performance was spellbinding, she is much too young an actor to have made this role believable.  Although her character delivers a line in which she says she is one year out of college (or about 22-years-old), Johansson could not fool the camera.  She was 17 years old when filming began, and looked even more childlike in the nightclub scenes when she was smoking.  Obviously, the age difference between Charlotte and Bob was one of the more significant aspects of their unlikely liaison, but that disparity would have worked had Coppola chosen an actor in her early 20s to play the role.  In this instance, there is no way a man of Bob Harris' age, social status and background could have looked twice at, let alone contemplated any kind of relationship with, someone who looks like a junior in high school.I also must wonder why Coppola chose to display Ms. Johansson's panty-clad posterior above the titles and kept her in panties in virtually half her scenes.If one closely examines the dialogue, there is hardly an exchange between Charlotte and Bob that would justify their spending any time together or explain why they found each other's company enjoyable.  Just because they were overwhelmed by their surroundings and alienated from their respective mates does not mean two people of such diverse backgrounds would have forged a relationship.  They needed to connect with dialogue and Ms. Coppola's script does not convey any hint of why they would be attracted to each other.The film reverts to so many scenes of nighttime Tokyo, this viewer wasn't sure if he was watching a feature film or a travelogue.  Add the interminable party scenes and countless shots of characters fighting insomnia in their hotel rooms and one is left with a film that can best be termed ""tedious.""Ms. Coppola has the funds and the backing to make a better movie than this. Unfortunately, ""Lost In Translation"" is an amateurish effort.

Perhaps casting Bill Murry as a lead confused some, but in my opinion he played the role perfectly.

The acting was superb, very delicate and touching.  I would hope that Bill Murray receives an academy award nomination for this work. But, the storyline and the characters somehow seemed incidental.  I was profoundly touched by another quality in the movie that I don't understand and can't explain.  It is something akin to the feeling I had when I saw ""Life is Beautiful.""  A feeling that there is an underlying goodness to life, in all circumstances and in all places, IF we ""let it be.""  The Japanese setting seemed to provide universality and a certain timelessness to this feeling.  Perhaps the feeling I am trying to describe is a touch of Zen.  I found myself carefully watching every second of the movie and loving every little touch in every frame.  But, then, I am an older (age 62) woman.

One young with potential, one older on the downswing.  I get all that.  But again, where is the story?  That they form an unlikely friendship?  Well, that's mildly nice but not compelling enough to make a great, or even good film.The main characters did not undergo any mild or major transformational experience; they did not learn anything of consequence; they did not contribute positively or negatively to their own or others' lives. Nothing happened.  There was no there there.  Some of the scenes were humorous, but they were not connected to each other.  Was watching Bob on the treadmill funny?  Sure, but how did that relate to anything?  There were just too many scenes like that.  Pretty much the entire film was like that.Yes, the cinematography was fine -- but as Robert McKee would tell anyone, that is not enough ... you need a good, or if we're lucky, a great story. Go see Whale Rider for a film with much lower production value that nonetheless tells a great story -- you care about those characters.  I didn't care about Bob, Charlotte, or anyone else in Lost in Translation.

Like Bilbo Baggins it feels a little 'thin and stretched'. However, it did have two good performances, although I'm not sure they deserved to win BAFTAs'. A little to often it felt like the film was being padded out with bits of improvised dialogue that didn't really move the characters and the story forward, or add any real depth.

It's true story that doesn't go for a Hollywood-ized picture perfect world. The film is centered around these two characters who lost in more ways than one. Eventually, the help each other not become lost - again, in more ways than one. They find truths within each other, and they grow because of it. The story is not overly analytical or detailed, and it does not need to be. The strength and power in this film stems from its simplicity. It also captures the best acting by Bill Murray, ever. Scarlett Johansson gives a wonderful performance, as well, and should garner her first oscar nomination. Take my advice, and see this movie! You will be glad that you did.",Lost in Translation

At one point I actually turned to my mate about an hour in and asked if we should go cos it was so mind numbingly dreary but we decided to stick it out - it had to get better surely!!  It might have its funny moments (not many mind) but even these didn't help the film in the end.  The chemistry between the two main characters was so absent and laughable I wanted to slap Sofia Coppolla round the face as a wake up call! I can't recommend this nightmare of a movie to anyone cos I wouldn't want them to bash me into the ground after witnessing its atrocity.Lost in Translation was a real disappointment for us all after the critics said how great it was - I really wanted to like this film too.Lost in Translation is something that I would give to someone suffering from insomnia - keep your Nytol pills and whale music CD's for Lost In Translation is the cure you need.  I thought Sofia Coppolla's Virgin Suicides was dire drivel and pointless and her follow up is even worse in my opinion.Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! - the hate towards this film is growing to unparalled amounts as I type - and we all had to pay 6 quid to watch it!!!

But it is all about Sofia.

Not since Kubrick's ""Clockwork Orange"" have I had such an intense visceral reaction to the mood of detachment and alienation so exquisitely crafted by Coppola, her cinematographer, cast and production designers.Bill Murray, whose subtle and poignant performance made me simultaneously roar and weep, deserves to be recognized as the dramatic/comedic genius he is. This made all the other Oscar nominated best male lead performances of 2003 appear overblown and contrived in comparison.Scarlett Johansson's performance was a revelation. Not many actresses can match Murray scene for scene, (witness Andie McDowell in ""Groundhog Day"") but she nails it with every drag on her cigarette and quiver of her lips.Tokyo, the third lead in this film, playing itself, was perfectly cast.

Two lonely persons meet accidentally (all great things in life are accidental, right:) ) in a foreign city, and become acquainted with each other and with the city.Tranquil. Thats the word I was looking for when watching this for the first time. The beginning of the movie is almost perfect. When Bob wakes up in a taxi, and the quiet music on the background...I just knew this is going to bee a good one.The karaoke scene brings a great contrast into the plot, but it quickly, in a perfect kind of way, grows softer when Bob's and Charlotte's eyes meet.

1424,sup_james22,Attention to Detail,10,22 March 2004,"I personally thought this movie was excellent.  I can see how some who are normally used to the Hollywood schtick just picked it up from Blockbuster just to check it out after the Oscars were probably turned off.  I've seen the movie mislabeled all over the place as the center plot or idea being that of Bill Murray living temporarily in Tokyo on a business trip and encountering all these cultural and language differences and difficulties. However, it's not truly about that.  The setting in Tokyo and that constant emphasis is simply a driving factor for the core story of Charlotte and Bob Harris.  The whole ""foreign advertising/commercial making"" scenes weren't just for comic relief but more importantly character building and creating the gap from America to Tokyo.  This emphasized the loneliness and feeling of isolation the characters felt.  The direction of the film and its detail is what made this movie brilliant.  Notice how Giovanni Ribisi is almost phased out of the movie as the characters fall into that hole of loneliness. The only somewhat recurring white character is the Jazz Singer which was obviously done deliberately for reasons of foreshadowing.
The camera work is also very good.  Again with the attention to detail you see one of Bob and Charlotte's first encounters to be when they are sitting at the bar.  The two of them are on the extreme ends of the shot with this large gaping hole in the middle.  It is very noticeable and a normal filmmaker would simply widen and open up the shot to make the audience see that this gap isn't so empty.  However, it was on purpose because later on in the film when the two are now very close a shot very similar is seen and this time the two characters are so close there are large gaping holes on each side.The fact that this movie was filmed in 30 days was unbelievable.  The editing job was excellent and the movie didn't seem to be rushed at all in this sense.  As if the atmosphere of Tokyo didn't give Lost in Translation enough tone the music in this movie was the garnishing detail.  One of the highlights of the movie was when the My Bloody Valentine song almost chimed in.This movie was very well done.  That's all that needs to be said.",Lost in Translation

If you could cut all the scenes when they're walking, sitting and drinking there would be 25 minutes left. But I don't want to write about this, because so many people here wrote their reviews that I completely agree with. I'd like to mention a different subject. Is it allowed in such a movie that a microphone plays a leading  part? For a couple of times a microphone appeared on the top of the screen. As it was such a boring movie all the people in the cinema were playing the game `who's gonna spot the mike first'.

1427,Scoooter,Lost In Pregnancy,10,31 October 2005,"I found this movie a breath of fresh air. So many films nowadays leave nothing up to the imagination, where as Lost In Translation lets you ponder all of the possibilities. I thought the casting was great and cannot wait to see Scarlett Johansson in future films.Although the forum has covered all of the likes and dislikes of this film I was quite surprised that the possibility of Charlotte being pregnant was not discussed. I know, I know let me explain myself here! Well, if you do get an opportunity to watch this film again notice the positioning of her hands in several scenes, she seems to constantly have them comforting/shielding her stomach. She is also overly emotional as most women are when they are pregnant and almost seems to be questioning whether or not her husband will be a good father to her unborn child.I definitely had a number of questions running through my mind when leaving the theater. Several being, Is she on the trip to Tokyo to try and approach the subject with her husband and let him know she is expecting? Does her husband already know? Suggesting she should stop smoking early on in the film. Another possibility though much more taboo would be that she has already decided not to have the child and is therefore not concerned with smoking and drinking. Or could it be that no one knows including herself which would explain her bad habits. Not to mention the baggy clothes throughout the movie. Now before you completely try and discount my theory take the time and watch for yourself and this time pay attention. There is a key conversation between the two leads regarding parenting and how on one hand parenting can be scary while on the other in can be absolutely delightful. Listen to this in depth and notice the placement of her hands.Don't get me wrong the bottom line is that I loved this film although I was not impressed with the editing. It seemed to be very choppy and in some aspects out of sequence, which could be a consequence of studio execs not liking the pregnancy subplot then editing it down to 96 minutes, excluding credits. Would the continuity of this film been more fluid with the pregnancy footage? Well, your guess is as good as mine!",Lost in Translation
1428,superkaetzchen-251-513305,Best movie i have ever seen,10,4 February 2017,"Lost in Translation is actually not a movie. It is an audio-visual projection of the inner mind state of an individual with an exceptionally high personality trait of openness onto the world while reflecting on it at the same time. The movie works very well as a dream experience, but not in an archetypical way at all. Rather, disregarding the hero's journey and its unfolding over time almost completely, it seems to exist in a timeless space. Out of this background of still presence – which is nowhere and everywhere at the same time, waiting, building a constant atmosphere, consisting of the one substance you would call ""atmosphere"" itself – arise seemingly disjointed scenes, which constitute the foreground ""experience"", only to pass away into the background again, without leaving much of a trace. Like a finger trying to write words on the surface of water, nothing seems to exist on its own for a reasonable amount of time. Remarkably, this depiction of impermanence and essencelessness of experience - which would usually induce feelings of nihilism in most people - is only leading to a slight feeling of melancholia for what is lost(!) and mostly leading to a reaction of childlike, playful equanimity in the protagonists – indicating a high degree of spiritual maturity, but not high enough to be completely immune from wanting, searching, finding and loosing. Reality itself is never really there - to be anything at all, but also never really lost and destroyed - to be nothing at all. Rather it is a sea of potentiality, a state of still wonder, a playground for a child's soul. This movie has a specific potential. The potential to lead people with open eyes – or rather open hearts – back to something long lost. What this something is, that is for everybody to find out on her and his own.",Lost in Translation
1429,MovieMind26,Found in Translation ...,7,4 July 2004,"First off let me say that this is the first time writing a review of a film since Vanilla sky.I will not write a review unless it impacted me in some way.This movie indeed did.Although my thoughts of this film are not entirely positive ,I will say I came away from it thinking a lot and having many different emotions floating through my head and heart while watching.That being said I thought it was a great film.I relate to this film entirely,within the last 2 years I have been in many hotel rooms and have received treatment beyond my wildest dreams but have come away feeling as empty as a person can actually be. Why is that ? Because at the time being at these places I have been in a very vulnerable time in my life.Lonely above all and without the person i really care about.I'm a male but relate more to Scarlett's character.The time she spends sitting on the window sill of her hotel room ledge glaring down to the beautiful city made me shake being I related to it so much.The Phone call near the beginning of the film to her friend and the tears she let's out were so real.Overall she is feeling completely lonely and needs something or someone to make her feel alive.How many times have you smiled at someone and made a nice gesture towards them but have never truly gotten to know that person.This film breaks that barrier.Bill and Scarlett share a warm moment in the elevator where they trade smiles, while Scarlett departs with no intention of ever advancing that smile into a conversation or a Hello to really find out about each other.Only until later at the bar we find out that these two people truly need each other emotionally and not sexually to become actual people again.Bill and Scarlett still care for their spouses, it is evident throughout the movie.We see Scarlett flipping through photos of the seemingly good times her and her husband have shared , while on another occasion towards the beginning we see her snuggle up to her husband on the bed only to hear him snore rather loudly without any regard of his wife being there.While with Bill we hear his wife scolding him or being very direct almost in a parent sort of way with each conversation they have over the phone with Bill trying almost reaching to make something real of the conversation , but in reality Bill normally agrees in angst and heartbreakingly hears his wife hang up the phone before him each time with no warm goodbye at all.Now we don't know what kind of husband Bill Murrays character really is at home , maybe his wife is cold for a reason.But on the other hand we do see Scarlett's interactions with her hubby with her seemingly stretching for affection with no luck.I can only guess it is the same way at home for Bill Murray's character.People are unfaithful for a reason, it just doesn't happen spur of the moment.These two characters give their hearts to someone else to make them feel alive again and you can never ever bash somebody for wanting to feel like a person again.I felt the laughing and joking between Bill and Scarlett was very uncomfortable at times,But this is only a minor setback to a great movie.What really made this movie come together was the scene at the very end where the two characters engage in a heartbreaking hug along with a whisper from Bill to Scarlett which for a reason is very hard to make out.I feel it is up to us , the viewers, to imagine a perfect goodbye message from our own experiences in life.To end off i would like to say Great acting by both Bill and Scarlett.They truly captured the feeling of two people lost and refound but knowing they will be lost again but now with great memories of the time they spent together. That's all you can ask for in life when you are not with the person you shared something special with.",Lost in Translation

I'd like to find someone to share my misery after watching this debacle of a film.  Sure, the scenery is sometimes pretty, but that's Japan's fault, not Coppola's.

The way they looked at each other in the various scenes told you everything you need to know about how they felt in that scene.  I would recommend watching the movie once with no sound just to feel how powerful the physical acting is (I haven't done it yet myself, but the DVD's coming out soon so maybe I'll try it then).(It may be too much to hope that the film and Sofia Coppola beat out Lord of the Rings and Peter Jackson for the Oscars, but at the very minimum, let's root for Bill Murray!)",Lost in Translation

I know that everyone who thought it had no plot or was boring or that Sofia Coppola just pointed her camera at downtown Tokyo and passed it off as a ""cool"" flick won't agree with me, but I think Lost in Translation surpasses every other film of the year on so many levels. Very few films can truly move the audience (I doubt that anyone felt truly touched by Return of the King or Cold Mountain), fewer films offer so much with the camera, and even fewer films give performances that say so much while saying almost nothing at all.  Murray and Johansson's performaces communicate the deepest and most genuine feelings and thoughts when they are saying nothing at all (like when they are sitting on the bench at the karaoke studio, or staring out the taxi window).

The performances by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson were wonderfully executed.  I often got the sense that I was not watching two actors exchange dialogue, but instead was eaves-dropping on a real conversation.  The film was creatively shot and visually interesting.  There were a couple of very funny scenes, but I'm not sure if I would classify this movie as a comedy.Ultimately, the positive attributes mentioned above could not make up for a lackluster story.  I found neither character to be particularly likable in the end.  I found the brief glimpses of Japanese culture to be one of the more interesting aspects of the movie.

I understand the arguments of those who ""get it"", but if you are that desperate to see people wasting away their time in a depressing setting, go visit a homeless shelter. All the arguments for and against this movie seem to be about the characters' connection with the audience. Many advocates say that they can relate to the two main characters, who are obviously feeling above their current social status. The rest of us feel like we have spent two hours trying to feel sorry for people that should just get on with their lives. I personally find this movie to be an insult to people in this condition (mild to severe depression).

1460,ilya_stone,"""I'm pacing myself, Captain""",1,26 February 2004,"Reviewer: Ilya Stone (see more about me) from Temple, TX United States Spoiler Some people have complained this is a dull, boring film. Others say this is simply a slow-paced artful film that only sensitive intelligent folks will get. Is LIT one of the latter?In LIT, Scarlett Johansson portrays Sofia Coppola in this apparently autobiographical film. In the film, Johannson sits around in her hotel most of the time (in TOKYO!!!), despondent over her failing marriage to her emotionally distant photographer husband (ie.Coppola's ex - Spike Jonze). He seems to enjoy the lighthearted phony company of Cameron Diaz....I mean, the character who plays a Diaz-like actress. Anyway Charlotte (that's the Johannson/Coppola character) rolls her eyes whenever she speaks, so we the viewers, will know to prefer the less-vulgar and sensitive Charlotte. Why cannot her husband see that his own wife, while displaying no intelligent ideas or thoughts or emotions, is the preferrable one to hang around with?! I mean, Charlotte IS beautiful, but like many beautiful women she is actually VERY sad. She admits to Bob (more about him later) that she has no idea what she wants to do and her various artistic endevours are ""mediocre"". She has tried photography (apparently not out of love for the medium, but rather to ""find herself""), and still her photographer-husband cannot seem to connect with her. What is HIS problem?! Anyway, because of all this, she sits day after day in her hotel room. (BTW, did I mention she's in Tokyo?). Eventually, she picks up with dull-man #2, Bob (played with even more hound-dog-face than usual by Bill Murray - STILL one of my heroes, despite this venture). You see, Bob is a movie star who is going through a ""mid life crisis"" as Charlotte puts it. Whatever THAT is, exactly, is never really displayed. Anyway, Bob is being paid 2 million dollars for 2 days work on a whiskey commercial, but he remains sad, as he truly wishes he were ""Doin' a play somewhere"". Aside from this deep display of love of theater (and strong argument for the revival of Communism), Bob is confused by all these funny people around him. For one thing, they talk funny. And what they are saying, nobody knows! Well, these funny-faced people constantly get up in Bob's face and jibber-jabber all the time!! Why won't they stop?! They talk on and on, but the funny-faced translator says next to nothing....just like the bugs bunny cartoon on the Pacific island. Regardless, these people are truly frustrating!! Will someone please make them act normal! What is it you call them again? Anyway, Charlotte hooks up with Bob at the hotel bar after their glazed eyes meet, and they soon become the dullard-duo. She teases him with insightful cliche's about his probably wanting to buy a Porshe. He concurs he is lame. Later, they sing bad karoke together, while the viewer's mind begins to wander about how nice it would be to drive a Porshe. Meanwhile, their encounters continue with the energy of terminally-ill cancer patient. You see, Bob has a shallow life...I mean Wife. We know she is shallow, because she is only concerned over picking the right carpet color. This is illustrated in a long scene where Bob cannot seem to choose from carpet square samples over himself and the floor, as he further succumbs to a barely-breathing motif of wealth does not equal happiness. Still not convinced of our hero's circumstance? Well get an earful of his deathbed rendition of Roxy Music's ""More Than This"", which he sings as if he has never heard (how cool to be uncool, eh?). Anyway, Bob and his newfound glob seem to connect, despite their decades-separated mix of world-weary apathy and beautiful-but-misunderstood depression. Unfortunately, all this must soon come to end. You see...aside from some kids he's squeezed out, Bob must go back to pick out that carpet square in person. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention...Bob has 2 kids back home. Anyway, our heroes eventually part without saying the appropriate soulful goodbyes, so Bob chases down our mallrat-with-undeserved-money-and-opportunity until he finds her...and soulfully....kisses her. Then, he wanders off with the activity of a digestive tract, presumably only to be seen on various subway ads. She smiles and cries. The audience smiles and cries. I cry. Then we all try to get the DVD back to Hollywood video ASAP so we can get a buck back.
Want to see a GOOD ""pointless"" movie about 2 people connecting in Japan? Try the absolutely beautiful ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"". All the arty-farty you'll ever need, but time well spent. Plus, it ain't racist. Want another good film? Try ""Being John Malkovich"" by Spike Jonze. IT'S excellent! AND it has a great performance by Cameron Diaz!",Lost in Translation

1465,jussi-widstrom,A touching movie that compelled me to write a small thank you,10,2 March 2004,"Hullo everybody!I do consider books, for the most time, somewhat superior to movies and it actually came as a little surprise when I completely fell for Lost In Translation. Now,  after a few days of munching I love it even more.Those, who didn´t like the movie, I´d ask not not read, but not to argue as I´m not writing an argument, but rather what I feel - let everyone feel what they want.Probably only a few will ever read this text as its posted with number 1000 or so, but to those, who, like me, really felt something special after seeing the film and have to browse through every comment, I write this:(The following contains SOME SPOILERS, but none fatal or even serious. And hey, this movie is all about the feel and thus impossible to spoil with revelations!)Why I loved the film, is rather simple in the end. This movie isn´t supposed to have a smart or complex plot or too many characters and discussions and this is a good thing - as all who have read a touching book know, movies rarely come close and never reach the written word´s level in these matters. However a book can only create so a wonderful atmosphere with words and no three pages of flowery adjectives can quite make you feel what a picture with live people and music does. It is this what felled me watching LiT.In the movie Bob Harris and Charlotte are both having a situation that almost all of will face one day. It´s not that they both are married and at loss with their spouses, but rather that they have difficulties with how to change things for the better and stop just wandering with massed people, alone. Both are having a terrible time, but chance whisks them together and they shall find each other and themselves.Now I could go on and on about the story and the relationship of the main characters, but I think the whole film was about the light and lovely feeling the film created, the humor and lightness with which one should see the world. Not everybody sees the world this way, but I at least try to and if I sometimes loose it, films like this one help me grip the right rope again. Now, if you  consider the film as I do, you will soon understand what a wonderful overall the subtle acting, Charlotte´s easy smiles, Bob´s slowly melting ones, the moody music, beautiful views and the not too serious jokes about the Japanese create. The lightness and humour that everyone should have in their lives. I am  grateful and touched. :)
PS. My opinion about some discussions on the actors: Scarlet Johansson is a young lady, who kills boys with her smile and plays a lovely role in the LiT. She acts well the boring figure in the beginning and easily makes most people feel good as the movie goes on. That is her essential role and suits her good. Bill Murray too is a great actor. He is bored to death, but gradually melts. Yes, he can joke in the whiskey-ad, but that´s not melting. Melting happens in the end and those who can grip the film melt right there with him!PPS. About Oscars: Scarlet Johansson will get one yet, she is young, and too much fame is no good for anybody either. Bill Murray deserves one, but as Sean Penn said, there are many good ones and only one can have it. It is sad that the LoTR got Oscars on year only and not gradually as this stole many prizes from other good movies this year, but that is loss of Oscar-happening. Also Oscars are REALLY Over-Rated (with capital letters!) and not too much value should be given to them .All smart people and actors and Europeans :) know this. ------------------------------------------------------------------------I write as I think and partially I write to think clearer, so don´t wonder if you don´t understand or agree. I´m twenty and Finnish, which may also explain some things - I´d love to see the age of some writers here. So, all you more matured, feel free to think yourselves superior to me... I´d love to have comments from people who think along same lines about the movie (especially girls..:) ) and would also like to know if there is a some sort of official fan-page for Bill Murray, Scarlet Johansson and Sofia Coppola, preferably one they might even read.Thanks for all who spent their brain-energy reading through this!",Lost in Translation
1466,prescotian,Tedious and Insulting to the Japanese,1,4 March 2004,"I really disliked this film for its concentration on the only showing a seamy and oddball side of Japanese life. How Hollywood would have complained if the film was made in reverse with Sunset Boulevard and all its downtown grubbiness was shown in the background. I did think that Murray's character had this sort of cynical depth, a desire not to engage with japan and just get the heck out of there as soon as possible. I have now seen Scarlett Johannson in both her major films and she must surely start demanding roles with an adequate volume of words, the knowing looks can not always be relied on to convey her feelings in the film.

1467,frogs1970,Absolute Rubbish,1,8 March 2004,"This must rate as about the most disappointing film in recent memory. Absolute nonsense. I strongly advise anyone who is seriously considering wasting their money on this sorry excuse for a film to save their money and spend it on genuine quality such as Mystic River or 21 Grams. The very fact that this film exists demonstrates that nepotism is alive and well in Hollywood, does anybody seriously think that directionless nonsense like this would have been made had it not been a Copolla at the healm?? I think not.Now onto the film itself. At the end of the day this is simply a concept film where the concept is seriously deficient. OK, I get the message - all out relationships, with one another, with our family, our work colleagues, our neighbours are, to a lesser or greater degree, 'lost in translation'. By transposing the film to Japan where the language barrier further accentuates that concept we are forced to consider the other barriers that exist between us beyond that of language, i.e. emotional barriers.And I get the fact that the lack of dialogue is supposedly used to further demonstrate that language is never the key barrier between individuals, that people don't connect through words but through their attitudes, ideas, emotions, beliefs etc. The problem with this film is that Copolla doesn't know how to express this concept in any meaningful way. The lack of dialogue does work on occasion but it needs to be supported by powerful emotive performances on the part of the leads (Bill Murray deserving of an Oscar?? - you have to be joking!) and at least a hint of dialogue, however subtle, to pull the strands together (how on earth Copolla won Best Original Screenplay for a film without dialogue is beyond me). The only dialogue that exists is trite and shallow. Maybe that was the intention, that the characters can't express themselves in words, but I just found myself crying out for the characters to reveal a little more of themselves and their situations.
Ultimately, the film comes across as a series of set-pieces that just feel like fillers. Bill Murray striding mournfully across a golf course does indeed express his disconnection from his own and others lives but then so does him lying on his bed night after night after night unable to sleep, and so does him sitting at the bar alone, and so do numerous other 1 minute scenes. The same applies to Scarlett Johansson. We don't need it hammered home quite so tediously and repeatedly that the prime characters are feeling lost and removed from time, people and place - we get it in the first 15 minutes. Copolla should move on and build the film around that fact but instead wallows in this single concept, very boring and very disappointing. I think you'd call it flogging a dead horse.It also struck me as a film bordering on the racist. I read a few reviews that suggested that this was a comedy - well the only alledged comedy I saw was all at the expense of the Japanese and the supposedly hilarious fact that they don't speak English. After about the 10th shot of Bill Murray looking bemused at a Japanese speaker I felt angry more than amused, I thought we'd left that ignorant brand of comedy back in the dark ages of cinema where it belongs.Ultimately, I left the cinema feeling that in the hands of a more accomplished writer/director this film *may* have worked but as it stands it couldn't be any wider of the mark.",Lost in Translation
1468,davidd12,An below average plot that can bore even those that like slower paced movies.,1,10 March 2004,"Watching this movie was almost torture it moved so slow and I kept hoping it would get better. I don't think since the English Patient have I been more disappointed after some have hyped this movie. I saw this after the Oscars and was hoping it would win since I wanted to see Bill Murray say something funny up there and Sofia just seems like an interesting person. But WOW after finally viewing this I am at a lost of words that some would even call this ""Hilarious"" it was slightly amusing in one or two scenes, but doesn't excuse the weak plot. Bob Harris Bill Murray's character in the movie is so shallow and uninterested in everyone and everything from talking to his family to pretty much all the Japanese people, to even the admiring Americans in the bar. He spends most of the movie making cracks or smirks about everything, he is usually much better at this in other movies however. Then we have Scarlett Johansson's character, Charlotte who is just as bored and lonely as Bob, but is at least a little more likable, she is shot in her underwear throughout the movie, a cheap way to keep people interested in a otherwise borefest of a movie, she stares hopelessly out the window. At one point she is in tears on the phone yet it is never understood why she is so unhappy living what seems to be an extremely privileged life in a new marriage with a husband that is just slightly busy with work. The only thing that they share is being bored,lonely and slightly hot for each other in Japan, ""oh boy what storytelling"". I don't really wanna touch the stereotype issues, but if you love laughing at certain stereotypes of certain races or minorities maybe you will love this film or as long as the jokes not on you.

The girl was good and I can see her taking on roles that would be more likable in the future because her depression was believable... she made me depressed!!!! I was told by some friends that I didn't have a romantic bone in my body just because I hated this film. I don't think that is true at all... to me there was not much romance in this film at all. A friendship yes... and a connection, but no romance. Hopefully other people enjoyed this more than I did. I just wanted to turn it off.",Lost in Translation
1474,jossy-royale,THought it was good,6,4 October 2013,"Johanssen is good and beautiful as the lonely, young wife questioning her marriage. Her beauty is classic, not necessarily sexual, though she is obviously alluring in this role. Her bee-stung lips, perfect body and haunting eyes may have something to do with that. Still she's more sophisticated beauty than mindless hottie, even at 19. This is a role tailor-made for her. It could never have been Reese Witherspoon or Jessica Alba or - God forbid- Jessica Simpson, or anybody else in that realm.Murray is simply at his best. He does ""exasperated, middle-aged and depressed"" better than most, with his receding hairline and frumpy body. You really believe that these two could connect in a physical and emotional way, as remote as that may seem on the surface. What other 50-something could ever be believed to be appealing to a young woman as pretty as Charlotte? That's a tough chemistry to fake and I can't think of a more perfect pair. What drives them to this attraction is what's intriguing to watch.Go see this. Turn off your ""Major Blockbuster-Tom Cruise-Action-Pop Culture Catch Phrase-Big Star"" mind and tune in with a more searching self. Watch this with your soul and heart, not your eyes.

Having said that, I don't know if it would have opened up to me the way it did if I have never traveled or resided in a foreign country before. However, I suspect that minus the personal intimacy, the movie would still have been a wonderful commentary on life, stripped of any pretension, full of visual nuances and every bit the great movie anyone mature enough claims it to be.Rather than being ""boring"", it kept me awake the entire night, thinking about the past, the things that might have been, and the things we still have a chance to discover and rediscover.This movie is not so much a story or a simple statement.

The dialogue was downright pathetic and so was the acting.  The ""look-how-quirky-the Japanese-are"" was as unoriginal as it was boring. Bill Murray has done the same character for all of his recent films, some of which his character was better suited such films as  Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums by Wes Anderson. Scarlett Johansson has the same shtick, pout her lips, say very little, and hope that people don't notice she really can't act.  For a character supposedly being a Yale graduate in philosophy, one would think they would show they had actually learned something.  Did people actually believe Ribisi was a) her husband; b) a photographer on assignment in Japan? I actually thought he was her little brother.  This film should have never been nominated for any of the awards, much less come away with best screenplay.  That award should have gone to American Splendor, a far better film about two people in a relationship, and with far better dialogue and story.

We get to see many of the sights and sounds of Japan as the two main characters travel around the country.

The main characters don't even try to understand or analyze anything, they just bore and think about how life is empty and senseless. I don't think that if I was visiting another country, always fascinating and new, I would spend all my time at the hotel, drinking and flirting with men of my father's age.

Bill Murray is excellent (he was literally robbed at the 2004 Oscars) and Ms Johansson is just truly sublime. Sofia Coppola truly captures the essence of what one may feel when stumbling along in this overwhelming universe seeking true fulfillment and connection, and the abundant emotional exuberance one does feel when they indeed achieve this, illustrated extravagantly through Bob Harris and Charlotte. Sofia Coppola is a brilliant prodigal film-maker, that deservedly was praised for her magnificent screenplay at the 2004 Academy Awards. If this film is any indication of her unique cinematic vision then I for one (like hopefully many others out there) am definitely looking forward to her future works, until for now I must say without a doubt that getting lost in the Sofia Coppola filmic experience has never felt so good!!!! **********/********** One truly amazing experience""Let me tell you what like a virgin's about"" - QT (Mr Brown)",Lost in Translation

It's not a comedy, and it's not a romance, though there is some of all these in it. One could say it's about two foreigners in Tokyo, but the location doesn't matter much. I'd say it's more about two lone souls in an alien land who become each other's beacon of normality in an universe which stands beyond their understanding.That, in itself, is an uncommon plot, but it's not here that lies what makes this movie a masterpiece. It's the way Sofia Coppola gets you to feel exactly what these characters feel without ever mentionning any feeling : this movie is just like a haïku, it makes you experience another one's state of mind just by using images and situations. The feelings are not told, shown or described, they're just grown out of yourself. But that's also why so many people don't get this movie : it's an unusual exercise for a spectator, since it doesn't require wit nor taste nor artistical sense but empathy.Maybe it's not the first time someone tried this in a movie, but it's certainly the first time great acting, writing, photography and directorship all come together to make it a success, and a true piece of art.",Lost in Translation
1483,letoile85,A rare film for modern Hollywood.,9,7 May 2004,"I'll try to not repeat other comments. In a several words (a maybe more :) film summary: it's a simple and very realistic, believable history with superb casting. The main actors completely correspond to their characters. I love Bill Murray generally, especially in ""Groundhog day"". At this film he has a easy enough part but it was played great, ideal, with typical Murray's ironic style. Therefore I'm sure he might win Oscar as well as he wins Gold Globus. AFTER MAYBE SPOILERS. Scarlett very touching. It's really hard part and she gave very well & realistic performance of it. Beauty moviestar and her dialogue with Sharlotta's husband is acted in the parody on stupid_and_the_most_part_of_the_teenager's_comedy style. This girl is really empty inside. Unlike Sharlotta. It's a rare film in modern cinematograph 'cos Sofia Coppola (my great respect) had made a simple, realistic, gentle film that have no cliches and happy ends with a loving couple that slow goes forward towards sunset. Because happy end here couldn't be. In spite of this the movie gifts to you very ""warm"", light mood with sadness. It's an ""atmospheric"" film, i.e. it takes your mind after first 30 minutes, penetrate in U and still with U even after final titles. You can go from this movie for hour and after this watch remained part of film - but the feeling, sense of it are with U all that breaktime (it was only with me of course). U don't need any dialogues at the most time, especially when Sharlotta walks on the Kioto's garden, the first scene when Bob-Murray sits at the car watching for lights of a megapolis. Fantastic director's work: Sofia is a big talent.9/10. it's the best film of 2003 on my opinionPS I don't agree with people who says that Tokio is comic and it humiliates Asian world and culture or smth like this. The Japanese people are comic only for western ones like Bob, Sharlotta, me and most of you. It doesn't mean they (Asians) are stupid but means that for western human it's too hard and odd to grasp this huge boiler living on his own rules.

Just like the subtleties of the romance it is the subtle events, conversations, and casual mishaps that slowly bring two very different people in a strange land together. The way the romance is built up with very casual and innocent gestures is what makes it so very believable. You feel like this situation could really happen, and that is what makes is such an ingaging story: you just can't wait to see what subtle flirting, conversation, or situation will bring these two back again.And even if in the course of watching this movie and you don't feel like this movie was all that it was cracked up to be, wait until you see the ending, which for me brought the movie to a great end and made it just that much better.",Lost in Translation

They both feel empty for their own reasons, and they are lost in Tokyo. They are an unlikely couple but they form an intense emotional bond and friendship after meeting in the hotel. I cannot begin to tell you how much this film touched me, you can feel everything by just looking into the characters eyes. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson play their roles amazingly. Not a lot needs to be said sometimes, you can just feel what they are thinking and feel their connection. I can relate so much to this film as I recently moved to America from England, to be with my husband who has a very demanding and time consuming job. In fact he is out of town right now. It touched me so much that the actors and director could capture the feelings I have on film so well. The loneliness, the feeling of not belonging, the lost and confused emotions. I can relate to Charlotte so much. I always liked Bill Murray but hadn't seen much of Scarlett Johannson before this film, now she is possibly my favorite actress.

She is drop-dead gorgeous because she pulls off that natural look so perfectly.] Anyways, if there is any reason you haven't seen this film, go buy it.

I'm not gonna dwell into a huge review of the movie...let's just say I loved in from every angle...acting, directing, cinematography, etc. What I am going to tell you is that when this movie was over, I felt like I was happy, sad, and somber at the same time. The effect has worn off a bit, but for a while I felt like I was walking 6 inches off the ground. I haven't had a movie affect me like this since I was a teenager and watched Summer of 42 and Edward Scissorhands. Back then, I was young, innocent, and naive.

Also, the setting helped isolate the leads to make them seem more alone, despite being in a major city. The clever use of silence in the scenes also helped enforce this perception. The storyline was as poignant as I've seen for a long time and it is one of the few movies to come out for a while without gratuitous sex or violence. I found it very endearing and the best movie I've seen released since ""Life is Beautiful.""",Lost in Translation
1505,graeneyo,Come be alone with me,10,21 March 2014,"We see an old man, having seen everything of his world, becoming tired. We see a young woman, whose life has been on fast forward, her world still under construction. Somewhere, between rush and modernism, they've lost themselves. They meet in Tokyo, far from home, with nowhere to go and nothing to hold on.At the beginning we can see what they only sense.When Bob and Charlotte meet first, they don't fall in love. Bob looks at her in the elevator. Probably only because she's beautiful. Later on, they exchange glances of understanding. Charlotte is married to John, with whom she's lost connection since he pays more attention to his work than to her. She loves and trusts him and he does the same, but it's just not enough to spend an entire life together. Bob is married to his wife - whose name we don't even have to know - since before people started using home computers. He loves her and their children, but ""it's hard"".One night, in a hotel bar, they share seats, then words, then drinks. Very slowly, they start to realize that they belong together. The cold and distant city becomes a colourful playground full of dancing people, weird names and culture while Bob and Charlotte get to know each other.In a very beautiful karaoke-sequence, we see them singing, ultimately to each other. The vulnerability they share couldn't be more intimate. Confessing that ""I'm stuck"", and in response holding both feet with one hand while lying in bed and falling asleep together is truer and more close to love & affection than being naked.Sofia Coppola treats the movie, the fragile connection between two lost souls, in a very caring manner. She knows that too much explanation will destroy the bubble. As a viewer, you have to explore each scene for yourself. Observe every little glimpse and gesture of the characters. It's everything there, waiting to be translated.They way Bill Murray handles the art of not showing too much, but making sure that it's enough. How Scarlett Johansson studies strangers and cracks a little smile, as if she found out something only she knows. How they form a bond of profound understanding in isolation.And how they created a world for them to be alone together. A world that shows a final culmination of emotions and words in their last encounter before moving to a place only Bob and Charlotte are allowed to visit.At the end we can only sense what they see.",Lost in Translation
1506,TheAlwaysClassy,My Favorite (so far) of the Decade,10,6 January 2006,"It's probably predictable that some people would watch Lost in Translation and say that the emperor is wearing no clothes. Films like this, which bring wild applause, media hype and an original means of delivering the message are often ridiculed by those that don't get the point as being all fluff and wankery. Lost in Translation was never made to please the masses. It doesn't involve one car chase, puts emotion over lust, and forces you to think for yourself as to what is going on in the characters' minds. Deal with it.Bill Murray is Bob Harris, an aging US movie star traveling to Japan to endorse Suntory Whisky. Clearly his life has seen more interesting phases, and he's only here for the quick and easy cash payoff, but Bob doesn't really need the money, and he sure as heck doesn't need to be sitting around, alone, in a Tokyo hotel while his wife faxes designs for his new office furniture for his approval.Up a few floors, a different story is playing out. Scarlett Johansson is Charlotte, a bored young wife of a boring young rock photographer (Giovanni Rbisi). At some point she obviously thought this artiste she's married to was a creative genius, but as his career takes off and his attentions wander to movie star Kelly (Anna Faris), Charlotte begins to lose it altogether. Alone in her hotel room, listening to self-help tapes for some kind of inspiration, she and Bob meet and something begins to brew.At this point, your typical Hollywood writer/director begins the passionate lust, the secret meetings, tongues in ears and boobs in cameras. But Sofia Coppola has shown, not least of all with her first big directing outing, The Virgin Suicides, that she's not a cookie-cutter director. Lost in Translation is full of dialogue that you don't hear, voices that say nothing, and emotion that is kept inside. And that's what makes it great.Look, reality is far different from a Ridley Scott movie. While most films are made with a rule in place that if it isn't said, it doesn't exist, audiences aren't always requiring such things out of their stories. I don't need Bill Murray to say ""I'm sad and lonely and, though I can't have you, I really enjoy pretending that maybe I can,"" out loud, I can see it in his darn face when he looks at Scarlett Johansson across a karaoke box. And that is something I respect, because it respects ME enough to catch it, without shoving it down my throat.Lost in Translation is consistently funny, consistently sad, consistently impressive and spooky. The music is a film in itself; I can say this, because I've listened to it on repeat for almost a week and I'm not sick of it yet. But it's the quiet moments, when nothing at all is spoken, that appeal to me the most. Watching Murray and Johansson engage in an across-the-bar conversation without moving their lips is the stuff that only a daring filmmaker would write, and only a nutbar would put to film. Thankfully, a daring nutbar filmmaker is simply a long way of saying 'a genius' and, in my opinion, that's Sofia Coppola down to a T.Shot on location for less than $4m, this is the kind of film-making that inspires generations of up and coming filmmakers to copy. Like Linklater did with Slacker and Smith did with Clerks, Lost in Translation will bring in the new wave of young filmmakers who realise the power of emotion and introspection and the audience thinking for themselves. And I, for one, can't wait.",Lost in Translation

She is bored also, and they go out and drink. The fact that these two actually did SOMETHING and stopped being depressing was quite a relief but again, a very uneventful night in a strip bar and party.. I guess that's what they make of a holiday. Neither of them wanted to be abroad.At the end it's time to say goodbye, and that's it.",Lost in Translation

After watching LIT, I mentioned to my wife that the DVD cover said that the movie had ""over 80 4-star reviews"". She asked, ""where, on the internet?"" Apparently so, as this movie has garnered an 8.0 rating on IMDb as of this writing. This alone has totally negated any value that IMDb holds for me as a ""pre-review"" site for determining whether to check out a movie or not. This is a SNOOZER! Both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give lifeless performances with minimal emoting. IMDb categorizes this as Comedy/Romance/Drama. A comedy? Based on one (the ""lip {rip} my stocking"" hooker) scene? A romance? Based on a poignant moment or two? A drama? Ooh, those video parlor scenes were exciting! Oh, maybe they should include ""Travelogue"" because there are a (very) few nice shots of the countryside. The best thing about the movie is that I got it from the library and thus didn't have to spend money on renting it!

The shots of Tokyo are truly breathtaking and the way they capture the culture of the city is fabulous.

1512,james-cantu,the pain of impossible relationships,10,9 January 2005,"""Lost in Translation"" is, as I like to call it, a painful, yet it feels so good movie. This is a film in which two people flirt cautiously with each other and it somehow forms this ""single-serving friend""(see ""Fight Club"" and my apologies to Chuck Palahniuk) relationship that can only exist in this highly foreign and ephemeral setting. They meet on only one level and relate perfectly while the rest of their lives must go on without each other. The ending shows an acceptance of this which is politely and effectively kept private. We know there is a bond that is love and understanding on some level, yet we appreciate although suffer through the lack of its continuation. I personally thought this was one of best films in a while and clearly shows that Sophia Coppola continues to impress as a writer and director.

How come this movie has been hyped so much? The strange thing is that the racist parts are complete useless for the plots. The movie doesn't have anything to do with Japan, but the Japanese people are presented with all their stereotypical behaviour. How come this racism is tolerated by almost everybody?

Personally I think that this movie is a pure work of art. I even think that this movie shows us that the movie of our days are not only entertainment but can also be very artistic. I liked Lost in Translation because the essence of the film is not the events taking place in this movie but the emotions felt through the movie. I found that both actors gave great performances because we can feel how lost they are and how they manage to open themselves so fast to someone they barely knew. Its so interesting to see how both characters are not understood by their own entourage of family and friends but can be by a complete stranger. (Both scenes where Bill And Scarlett are on the phone are Incredible! Can't you see the huge Cry for Help!) This is a pure work of art.After telling you what i think of the movie, I am curious to see what everyone as to say about the points I have brought on the table. I hope no one will use the usual simple arguments that the movie is slow and nothing really happens... Because it is completely true..

1518,davidejorgensen,"Very touching cinematography, acting, sound, music, story.",10,25 January 2005,"Lost in Translation is my favorite movie so far. Everything in it truly connected for me. Coppela successfully reproduced many of the most memorable feelings and experiences I have from visiting Japan and my relationships there. Something I never thought could be documented or explained to others, yet there it is on screen, on DVD, for anyone to enjoy. Everything about the entire movie just hit very close to home for me.Although the movie portrays the protagonists as pampered and well-to-do (living in their Hyatt ivory tower), this actually lends to the believability of their work (in real life I'd guess Coppela and these actors -are- pampered and well-to-do) and it lends to the sense of distance and alienation of the characters, a central theme in the movie. Adding in a believable love story, some phenomenal cinematography, sound, music, cultural insight, etc. and summing it all up in about 100 minutes was a very impressive feat if you ask me.One thing worth mentioning before I continue, is that despite its accuracy and realism depicting Japan, the movie isn't really about Japan, or even Japanese people, as much as it's about the kind of introspection, personal confusion, and perhaps bonding, that can take place when all other elements of familiarity are removed. I think it's to all parties credit that in fact this personal side of the story is told with such subtlety and so believably that it goes without much criticism. Despite this, having traveled to nearly a dozen different countries, I have to say Tokyo is one of the cities that feels most foreign for me (even though I lived in Japan a few years), so frankly I can't imagine a better location for filming this kind of story. Again though, it's worth pointing out that this isn't so much about Tokyo as much as it's about two people helping each other feel not quite as lost as they'd otherwise have been (not just culturally, but emotionally as well).The movie is a brilliant combination of personal and shared experience. The polite Japanese formalism and expressions which leave you feeling you've met everyone but don't really know anyone. Its a phenomenal introspection and brilliant depiction of being emotionally lost in a new marriage, or in mid-life crisis, accentuated by being lost in a strange culture. The scenes at the Karaoke parlor, heading home that night, and a later discussion on the bed are all very endearing and extremely well done. Depiction of the younger couple's differences, as well as Bob's handling the grind of his home life, I think were very accurate, introspective and tie well into the overall sense of isolation and confusion felt by the characters.The movie's cinematography is phenomenal. It does a great job showing Tokyo's modernity, it's crowded gray expanse and cool urban feel, its taken for granted technology and glowing neon glitz. The huge advertisements, videos and signs which blare their messages to the illiterate visitor. The extensive hotel footage and sense of living from a suitcase on top of a bed represents real life for most visitors to Japan. Wandering here and there and making no sense of it, is also the common experience for visitors, and it's conveyed extremely well. Being led by friends to their favorite clubs and hangouts in Japan is a rare treat for Japanese visitors, and for moviegoers to watch. It's simply wonderful to follow the characters as they swim through such a personal and unique experience. There's also very insightful use of sound. The chimes, automated voices, whirs and wisps of cars, trains, automatic doors, elevators, ventilation systems... the troubled English, continual street noise, poor karaoke and constant Japanese spoken in the background, even the international programs on Japanese TV... These truly capture the sound of the foreign experience in Japan, and compliment the internal confusion the characters feel. The dreamy, synthesized music also matches well with the confused, frustrated and sometimes dazzled feelings a person has facing modern Japan alone. The combination of the music with the scenery rolling by (in the train, etc) help convey what it feels like to be pulled around through the country without much control over the trip. The scenes which depict the traditional beauty (in temples, traditions, ceremonies, even flower arrangement) without true comprehension, are amazingly accurate depictions of what an outsider feels in Japan. I'm very impressed with the combination of cinematography, acting, sound and music all driving in a consistent direction to communicate the story and emotion in this film.Some have complained this is a 'stereotypical' depiction of Japan, and of Japanese people. However that's extremely unfair to everyone involved with this movie. The Japanese people are very homogeneous and their culture only involves outsiders at a very surface level. Frankly this 'stereotype' seems honestly the most accurate and truthful way to portray an American's experience in the country. Of course not every Japanese person fits the stereotype. They're not all friendly, polite and hoping to serve rich foreigners. Not all of them are clean-cut students, workers or businessmen. But to Coppela's credit, she introduces a more than generous number of these stereotype breakers as well.I've been sad to read how few people appreciate this movie. Perhaps some people lack the insight, experience and introspection to appreciate the kind of love story, cultural struggle and personal isolation that pulls the characters together. However I truly think this is one of the most thoughtful, insightful, beautiful and touching movies I have ever seen.",Lost in Translation

As Bob Harris realizes Charolette has the same CD as him, she asks him ""did it work for you?"" and he responds ""obviously""...Its more than just moping around all the time its about feeling something that is missing inside. Thats why Charolette is unhappy with her husband who is always blowing her off, and why Bob Harris seems uncomfortable or unsure of his wife.It may be a boring movie but if you put yourself in a time where you have ever felt empty, but found someone that seemed as close to the definition of 'soul mate' can get, then by the end it will be a bittersweet realization, rather than just another movie.",Lost in Translation

She immediately said that it was the worst movie ever, and I was grateful to learn that she was as bored as me throughout the entire thing. The only good thing about this movie is that no matter what movie you ever watch you will never feel that it is as bad as this one and, therefore, you will never again feel like you have totally wasted you time watching a movie.

1523,lauralauralaura,the most romantic story ever translated.,9,1 February 2005,"When this film came out at the cinema, I was torn between going to see it and waiting at home, thinking about whether romance was still alive. In hindsight, I now see that I made the wrong decision in not going to see it, as seeing it would have let me know that love can still blossom.Charlotte is a young newlywed, staying in Japan with her photographer husband. Neglectful of her and swanning off around the busy Tokyo streets, Charlotte meets Bob, an old, washed-up actor advertising Santori whisky. in Tokyo by himself, he joins Charlotte on her tours of the city, in sitting in the hotel bar when suffering from insomnia and in sharing marriage troubles that he has with his wife at home in the states. Will they kiss or won't they? You ask yourself this the entire way through the film.Many people see this film as boring and pointless, but it really is a story about love and the fact that it is still alive. I think this is one of the most romantically silly films ever made, and the chemistry between Johansson and Murray is amazing.The Tokyo mise en scene is breathtaking, and the attention to detail from Coppola is close to perfect. Every shot seems to be carefully planned out, from the metropolitan yet tranquil view out of hotel windows, to the busy arcade scene.This is truly a feel-good film which rekindles your interest in silliness and the things done for love.

The two main rolls are very believable, and I can't agree with anyone who thinks that it is insensitive to Japanes, it is just the reverse. Full marks to this film. It is good to see a film maker who is prepared to make a film that does not follow all the usual trends and predictable story lines.

Is beautiful to appreciate something in it; whether the photography, direction, acting, sound mixing, edition, writing, etc. but also this qualities make us judge a movie harder. I found Sofia Coppola's direction very similar to her other movies. Avoiding drastic drama, slow dialogs and very unrealistic scenarios. The pair of actors in this movie don't have the chemistry needed for a couple on screen, at least to prove they can develop romantic feelings, he looks more like a father figure. I seen a lot of ""over the top"" reviews, judging this independent film for that particular reason only. I find independent films very attractive to, nevertheless I also can spot the qualities to make them unique and outstanding. This has none, I can understand that EVERYTHING can happen in a movie, but this film focus, or at least pretends to be real, keeping itself far away from reality. Trying to make us believe that a Hollywood veteran and a Yale graduated find nothing to do in the world's major city but look through a window or whine about their hard rich lives with each other is the very first and major problem. The opportunity for people to go and find out culture, food, traditions, language, people, costumes, etc. in another country without the time or responsibility limits is an unique opportunity in life.

1530,pcwolstencroft,A real film about people.,10,17 February 2005,"This film is fantastic. I believe all the characters, because you are not spoon fed feelings, thoughts and fears. Even the pauses and glances are true to life. It allows you to take yourself to a place in your life where you think the characters are. There are not many films like this and definitely not to this standard. Its one of those films that you don't want other people to see because it feels like it belongs to you, like a piece of music you have just heard for the first time. If you think the director is living off her fathers name then think again. I would probably go as far to say this is the best film I have ever seen in this genre.",Lost in Translation

The only parts of Lost in Translation that are supposed to by funny are the parts where they make fun of Japanese people or blonde women. The fact of the matter is that this movie was made so that people who think they like art films will feel smart. If you are going to make a movie about a relationship, as this one was supposed to be about the relationship between Bill Murray and Scarlette Johansen, you should include at least some development of that relationship. The two characters exchange about 5 words, and then the movie shifts into a series of montages. Montages are cheesy and not to be over-used. If your viewers are watching a movie and say ""hey look, a montage"" then you screwed up. I hope Sophia Copola never makes another movie and I hope she apologizes to her father for taking his last name.",Lost in Translation

Johannsen and Murray are perfect for each other in this film: very real, very heart-felt.As having traveled to Japan....the film accurately depicts the cultural uniqueness of the country and how that can sit on the American mind in a jet-lagged state.I'm proud to have the DVD as part of my library.

Bill Murry is excellent as usual and Charlotte is exquisitely beautiful.

They fall in love, and in an unusual break with tradition decide to go back to their normal life.The music is really great and performances are good.

My girlfriend also told me it was enjoyable. However to me the words 'good' and 'enjoyable' aren't enough for a film as magical as this. Somehow, I never got to see it at the cinema but oh how I wish I had.I eventually got the chance to watch it after my dad brought it home on DVD. I sat on my own and watched a magical piece of work unfold in front of me. I watched it once. I watched it again.The reason I would have loved to have seen the film at the cinema is due to the vast shots of busy Japanese life contrasted to the serene and peaceful shots that help give the story so much meaning. The work of Sofia Coppola as director must be noted. She had the courage to mix brash and bold scenes with the slower paced shots and in doing so created something very special.The karaoke scene is one of my favourites. It managed to overpower me in my bedroom on a 12 inch screen so I can only guess that at the cinema I'd have been in awe.I tend to enjoy a lot of free hand camera work in films and the scenes in the film are magnificently shot. To me the film seemed to contain fast moving scenes that were structured in such a way so they seemed so much longer. Normally if a film drags on without actually having a progressing narrative I'll lose interest, but Lost In Translation makes you sit and take in every inch of detail.I fell in love with this film and the characters.

Sorry to disappoint those of you reading this but that's only MY opinion. I found this movie extremely boring and I normally love all the movies I see.

My mum and her friend actually walked out of the movie because they felt they had better things to do than watch a crap movie.

I might sound like a very pessimistic person but I'm not at all, so maybe this movie was just not my type.

And, of course, the inevitable sleeplessness and boredom that is typical of a hotel room in a foreign leads to experiences for the characters that are spot-on and in their 'true-ness' very humorous. At times the humor of the movie is bitter-sweet but more sweet than bitter.While some viewers (particularly some Japanese viewers) may find the portrayal of Japan stilted or stereotypical -- it should be recalled that Translation is a comedy.

But there's just something about it that rubs me the wrong way. I'm all for minimalism... being slow to reveal what happens in your story, etc.... but this film had nothing. It was nothing. It was a completely autobiographical piece where Sofia used Ms. Johansen as her doppleganger to complain about the distant relationship with her then-husband, and to comment on human loneliness.But there's a good way to comment on human loneliness, and a bad way. This, undeniably, is one of the worst ways. Static, quiet stretches where nothing interesting is happening. sure, its artsy and pretentious, but it doesn't really prove anything except that the writer is uncreative, both in her subject matter (a vacation to Tokyo) and the way she spends her time (inane nothingness, rather than productivity).Much like Was Anderson, this film seems to revel in wasting Bill Murray. A comedic genius, he is degraded into acting bored for almost three hours. Why is this? Why do people think Bill Murray acting bored is funny? The man is capable of great things, yet unimaginative hacks make careers on sticking a camera at him as he deadpans. Its insulting.I do not truly think this movie deserves a ""1,"" but with so many people who want to appear intelligent or ""with it"" giving it a ""10,"" I feel its my place to offset it.

This person obviously cannot appreciate quality films considering he bashed both 'Lost In Translation' and 'American Beauty' in the same post.Just because a movie is dry and does not have overly dynamic characters that does not make it a bad movie. 'Lost In Translation' has very beautiful and unique cinematography and has a refreshingly realistic plot. Two Americans, who are very different, find a common bond through their awkward feelings in a foreign country. Bill Murray portrays an American actor who is hired by the Suntory company in Japan to advertise liquor. He does not assimilate very well into the Japanese culture and finds himself alone, until he meets Scarlett Johansson. Johansson is a newleywed who is being dragged to Japan by her photographer husband who constantly leaves her on her own. The two meet in the hotel bar and continue to experience the country in many hilarious ways.Even though the movie is mainly set in a hotel that does not stop it from having great scenes. The hotel itself, the Park Hyatt in Shinjuku, Tokyo, is one of the most beautiful hotels in the world.The director's portrayal of the Japanese culture and people stayed very true to what it is actually like. I have visited Japan and my grandparents are Japanese so I can state this and have experience to back it up. Anyone who has visited would be able to sympathize with the character's inability to sleep from jet lag and the character's surprise to how different the culture really is. We may find the situations stereotypical but that does not necessarily mean they are untrue or patronizing to the Japanese people. I believe the director was just trying to make the film as realistic as possible. Which is a respectable action, to me.Not everyone will like this movie because there are many people who cannot even begin to understand what a good movie really is, but if you enjoy dry humor, Japanese culture, and / or Bill Murray this film will definitely end up being one of your favorites.",Lost in Translation

After reading multiple reviews for Lost in Translation, I certainly understand that many people will find it boring and a waste of time with lack of payoff, however it is the deliver of such a simple story in which makes it spectacular. With thanks to a successful casting choice of Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson and Giovani Ribisi they are able to effectively deliver the smallest of hints in their facial expressions to portray their character so perfectly that is written into the story. The narrative is touching and sweet from start to finish, by making the audience understand both main characters' situations whilst also making it relatable on a personal level.The chemistry between the two protagonists is flawless and is made effective as you see them grow throughout the course of this movie, making their eventual depart at the end heart-wrentchingly difficult to watch. The cinematography is also astonishing with every frame put to consideration to make it perfect and to capture every detail required for the correct amount of time in the shot. I rarely rate movies a 9 out of 10 (this is my 13th) unless i have genuinely really enjoyed it, appreciated it's style and it keeps me thinking afterwards.

1559,saraplattx,Moving!,9,23 February 2015,"Unlike most films dominating today's silver screen that are centered on plot, Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation is highly character-driven. Coppola's characters that effervesce with raw emotion and depth shape the quality of the film; and, it is the confounding performances given by the actors that make Lost in Translation a superb movie. The director's expert casting of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson to play the lead characters play an integral part in the movie's success. Bill Murray portrays a middle-aged, well- known actor by the name of Bob Harris who approaches a mid-life crisis. The role was originally written for Murray, admits Coppola in an interview: ""When I was writing it I was picturing him and he really inspired it, and I wasn't going to make the movie without him"" (""Sofia Coppola Discusses 'Lost in Translation' on Its 10th Anniversary""). Although the role of a movie star is not relatable for most, Murray depicts Bob as an identifiable character. He displays an exasperation when Bob talks to his wife that is characteristic of many middle-aged men. In one particularly haunting scene, Murray wades in a pool hopelessly while his wife blabbers about carpet samples, and he mutters a tired ""I love you"" before she hangs up. You can feel Bob's self-loathing as he endures silly commercial shoots for an unpopular whiskey, when his acting becomes sort of a self-mockery. Murray's mere facial expressions demonstrating the loneliness that Bob feels is evident through his glazed-over eyes and shortness of tone. One critic remarks of Murray's performance in his New York Times review: ""Here he supplies the kind of performance that seems so fully realized and effortless that it can easily be mistaken for not acting at allhis capacity for absorbing everything around him has taken a toll, and the visibility of that burden is what ''Translation'' is all about"" (Mitchell ""Lost In Translation (2003) FILM REVIEW; An American in Japan, Making a Connection""). Murray is also able to add a humorous side to Bob, which is apparent in his At the time of her casting, Scarlett Johansson was a relatively unknown actress. Though her character is a twenty-five year old married college graduate, Johansson was merely eighteen years old during the movie's filming. However, Johansson masks her age through acting prowess and is able to embody the emotional and physical maturity of her character. Johansson's low, husky voice that carries a somber tone aids in her depiction of the wilting Charlotte; Johansson invokes goosebumps when Charlotte becomes lachrymose and mutters, ""I didn't feel anythingI don't know who I married"" (Coppola ""Lost in Translation""). Her adeptness at expression exhibits the yearning that Charlotte feels for Bob that is seen through her wistful gazes directed towards him. The disparate age gap between the two characters could be a point of contention (and creepiness) for the movie had any other actors been chosen. Bob and Charlotte's romantic relationship is not overtly sexual (""They share something as personal as their feelings rather than something as generic as their genitals,"" quips Robert Ebert), but it exceeds the platonic. While Bob is old enough to be Charlotte's father, their age difference does not seem strange because of the light-heartedness and youthful humor that Murray brings to the role. ""It's a lot to do with the casting, admits Coppola. ""That could have been creepy, but it's just something about how Bill is that it never came off lecherous. Maybe because he's such a kid"" (""Sofia Coppola Discusses 'Lost in Translation' on Its 10th Anniversary""). Murray's and Johansson's on-screen chemistry is remarkable as well. They are able to share an unspoken earnestness and create a sense that no one else is around in their jovial pursuits in Tokyo. A lot of the scenes in the movie were improvised, including the kiss that Bob and Charlotte share at the end. Johansson's ability to indulge in Bob's caress when it was a complete surprise, along with Murray's organic instinct to give the kiss, demonstrates their collective ability to develop an authentic intimacy. Their chemistry is doubly impressive because the two actors did not even meet until the day filming began. Coppola wrote a compelling script accompanied by expert directorial work, but her casting for Lost in Translation was the selling point for the movie. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson individually and collectively perform with an array of depth and humor that allow the audience to connect so well with the movie. Their feats are well-summarized by famed movie critic Roger Ebert, who astutely claims that ""Coppola and her actors negotiated the hazards of romance and comedy, taking what little they needed and depending for the rest on the truth of the characters."" It is precisely this ""truth"" that not only creates a moving story, but also a universally relatable one.",Lost in Translation

I was totally lost as to why so many critics and art house types loved this film. I come from the old persuasion that a good movie, should still be somewhat interesting. There is a little humor stemming from Bill Murray's performance, but that's about it. The movie meanders along at a snail's pace and the idiosyncrasies of Tokyo are just about the only thing that kept me watching to the end. The bond between Murray and Johansson is cute, but ultimately goes nowhere and is vague as to what its nature truly is. By the time the credits roll, I am left to think: ""What the F** was the point of that?"" In essence, I never got the point, and wondered where that two hours of my life had just gone.",Lost in Translation

But sadly many otherwise intelligent people have been fooled by this surface gloss into thinking this is a piece of high cinematic art. It isn't.What it is is a mean-spirited little film about two spoiled Americans who, given an opportunity many of us would dream of - a week's free stay at a luxury hotel in one of the world's most exciting cities - do nothing but mope around moaning about how bored they are and how they can't sleep, occasionally breaking off to laugh at those crazy Japanese. The old ""flied lice"" jokes may have been funny when Benny Hill was doing them thirty years ago, but surely things have moved on? As well as an unpleasant vein of racism, there is also a seam of snobbery running throughout. Is Charlotte - lying around in her hotel room, living off her more proactive, more talented husband - really any better than B-movie starlet Kelly? The latter may be an airhead, but she has her own career and is enjoying the opportunity life has granted her while it lasts. And is Bob - who has travelled across the globe, missing his son's birthday in the process, just to prostitute his talent by filming a whisky commercial - in any way superior to the Japanese director and TV presenter he sneers at? Coppola clearly thinks so.Ah yes, Bill Murray. How ironic that an actor whose reputation was founded on the film Groundhog Day should spend the following years endlessly playing the same character with diminishing returns, fooling critics into thinking he's more than a one-trick pony with that hangdog expression. Which brings me to irony no.2. During the video shoot scene, Murray's character pokes fun at Roger Moore, as if to say that Murray himself is the vastly more versatile actor. He isn't.The film's one saving grace is Johansen who, despite the blankness of her character, lights up the screen every time she appears and has you looking at your watch when she leaves. A stunning performance, wasted on such otherwise vapid material. A film which promises an intellectual fix but ultimately says nothing.",Lost in Translation

They stay at the same hotel, and both of them feel loneliness because no one talks with them in English and no one around them understands what they think. They become friendly and spend happy times together. The director of this film is Sofia Coppola. She worked in Tokyo when she was in her twenties and wanted to do move in Tokyo since then.After I watched this movie, I thought that this portrayed Japanese (who can't speak English) as inferior to the main Anglo-Saxon characters (who can't speak Japanese). Bob and Charlotte don't try to speak Japanese even just a little, but they take it for granted that Japanese should speak English. I think it is a mistaken idea. While staying in Japan, they should speak Japanese, just as when I stay in the USA, I should speak English.There is some humor in this movie, though. Bob's head above the heads of a group of Japanese men squeezed into a hotel elevator humorously captured the difference in size between Japanese and North Asians.

1568,axtaryal,"Two character, separate from each other in their lifestyle, meet in Tokyo and form an unlikely bond.",8,24 February 2017,"Everything that can be expressed through a form of language is translated before it is perceived, you need not speak different languages to get involved in the process of translation for we all no matter how similar we are to our acquaintance/friends or anyone we frequently communicate to there is a certain difference in how we perceive things, ideas and emotions. Every time we communicate with someone may it be through words or without we translate what we get from others and translate it to our understanding; sometimes, we receive the same ideas/emotions as what they are expressing to us other times something is lost, or sometimes twisted in translation, even when we are speaking the same language. More than language, expression depends on how we grew up, it depends on our lifestyle, how we are living and how do we see the world; it is exactly like the question ""Is the glass half full or half empty?"" In the movie, translation occurs in emotions/feelings more than it occurs in between language. The characters of the movie portrayed by Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson are different to each other even though they come from same culture; they are both lonely yet in different ways, due to different reasons; they both are in desperate need o getting over their loneliness and to hold on to something like a feeling of love or friendship or even affection in the changing life. They travel to Japan, a break from their culture (a way of viewing the world, inclusive of everything physical and abstract), and as I believe, their time in Japan make them feel lost but free from their problems of emotional constraint of life. Their friendship grows so deep within such a short period of time because they are experiencing the emotions that are alike in spectrum; they communicate their stories and their feelings to each other but still they can't comprehend their emotions, fathomable in understanding of the words but intangible in reality, separated by space and time. Their moments of an unexplained familiarity, in a foreign land to the natural perception but an island of individuality in other sense, ends in a causal way; no one is obliged to present to other a gesture of gratitude but it is easy to understand both the character feels an impulse to met before they part like friends who are part of each other's life.Life returns back to normal, I perceive, after they both part from Japan and return to their homeland but their time together has made a wave in each other's life with a separate meaning for both and different for those who evaluate from outside.

1571,gewoondario,the movie that tops American History X in the drama section,10,6 August 2005,"Let me first comment on a peculiar phenomenon that influences my choice of film. I sometimes have this feeling where i'm in the need of easy and fast entertainment like blade 3 or bad boys 2, so when i'm about to rent a movie I often prefer these movies above, for example, Lost in Translation, while at the same time i find these sort of movies to be ""less"" than the likes of more mature movies. so it took me a while before i decided to rent Lost in Translation and now that i have seen this movie I must say and I must comment on this site, how great this movie really is.This means a lot coming from a guy who prefers movies like FightClub,Hero and Scarface over drama. But is this because i don't like drama or is it because I have the wrong idea of drama. Drama films to me, almost always mean people crying every 5 seconds, unwanted and misfit sentiment with a story that 4 out of five times couldn't interest the biggest titanic fan ( really crappy movie ). If this defines drama then Lost in Translation is not a drama film.It is the only movie i've ever rented 2 times in one week, and for a movie without any excitement or action this really is a wonderful feat. As is the fact that it left me with both a smile as well as a head full of thoughts because it is a movie you don't quickly forget about. technically it has great acting, a plus for Bill Murrays subtle but brilliant role, and Scarlett Johansson for great understanding of a character, it has a simple but greatly executed storyline, and has been expertly directed by Sofia Coppola.This all makes it a good movie, but it's the feeling about the whole movie, that cinematic magic that can't be captured in words, that makes it a great movie. Which movie has got and which movie hasn't got this magic all depends on the person who's watching it, but I can easily say that you don't have a clue about film if you say this movie sucks.So no matter which movie genre is preferred by you, take my advice, watch this movie or you will miss out on a great part of ( now already )film history.psi.I'm Dutch, so there's my excuse for the odd grammar mistakes.",Lost in Translation

The use of music and sound (or lack of it!) are touches of genius and the performances and stunning - Bill Murray with depth? who'd have thought it and Scarlet has to be the find of the decade. The use of members of the public as unknowing extras is a well tried trick to add realism into a film and seldom works, but here it adds to the whole mood of the film perfectly giving it the secret ingredient - totally believable characters and situations.Bittersweet in its plot, it kept reminding me of Last Encounter (silly as it sounds) and fears of spoiling it all with a sickly sweet ""Hollywood"" ending were thankfully unfounded.It's one of those rare films that you don't watch as much as let wash over you -never quite understanding what makes it so good or enjoyable.

It was clean, dreamingly beautiful and artistically and professionally designed yet nothing is familiar to an American: the time is flipped as compared to American, no surrounding announcement or instructions were understandable because it was in a foreign language. Provided translation was too simple to explain the whole situation. It was a place where people could tie their wishes to an actual tree, sing karaoke with their friends in an elevator bar, use Zen stones as hopping steps when crossing a pond and where people could see fireworks on balloons? Would you feel lost there? Many American would, just like the two main characters did in Lost in Translation. This was a beautiful story about two Americans in Japan: Charlotte (Johansson), the curious young woman, often portrayed in pink transparent underwear, fresh out of Yale with a degree in philosophy, was in Tokyo, with her husband, a photographer whose work takes him away that week. Bob Harris (Murray), the jaded and melancholy mid-50s, a semi-retired movie star with a wife and young children, was in Tokyo to make $2 million doing a whiskey ad. alone. Charlotte and Bob were far apart in age yet the art of ""feeling lost"" drew them close in heart. On the surface, they were lost because of their culture shock experiences in Japan. In fact, they were confused because of a different kind of culture shock: they felt disoriented at certain unfamiliar point of their life.Once again, LIT was beautifully photographed: the exotic Japanese culture was vivid. There was a giant digital diplodocus motioning across the wall of high rise buildings, there were ivory hydro-trains taking people pass by world famous, gorgeous Fuji Mountain and there were ancient Buddhist shrines of deity delivering holy bell rings.Sofia Coppola did a great job in unfolding the meaning of ""lost"" and ""translation"".

Japan where the film is set in a country where the modern and tradition meet. the movie shows scenes set in both the traditional temple and in the busy streets with neon lights flashing. The characters have lost in this separation, they are on the brink of everything, and are indecisive of where they want to go. Bob at the start don't know what he wants and relies on his wife (e.g. with the carpet choosing) and directors to tell him what to do. Whereas Charlotte doesn't have any guidance and no company despite she is in Japan with her husband.The two end up running through the streets of Japan and they seem to find their places and what they want in life. The audience see how they have changed day by day and take actions to take control of their lives again.The cinematography reflects truly of the plain angles that people take to view life as it is. For example there is a scene where Bob has spotted Charlotte being lonely with her husband and friends. The angle is far away but at the same time it also focuses on Charlotte and one can notice her loneliness.

I watched it all the way through so I could write a fair review, and after watching I just thought to myself 'what was the point?'. Now, the reason I gave this a 5/10 and not 1 is because there was absolutely nothing wrong the the acting, directing etc, just the plot. It was non existent. Just two people meet in Japan and hang out, then he leaves. I have to admit, I did laugh, once. Looking through the user reviews for this film, all I can see are 10s, and critics reviews... Roger Ebert loved it, but hated The Usual Suspects? I don't understand. I'm not saying this movie is terrible, but I just don't understand why it gets praised so much.",Lost in Translation
1594,daleshephard,Life altering,10,28 December 2005,"This film i saw to, hopefully, to validate the hype surrounding it. And boy, did it live up. I was fortunate enough to experience this film 6 times on the silver screen, and could not get enough. The soundtrack proved to be the soundtrack to my life for the preceding few months. Every single aspect of this masterpiece blends so well with everything else. The music, the cinematography, the acting, the story, the little nuances of each actor lending themselves so naturally and seemingly unintentionally to their respective roles.I sit with bated breath for Sofia's return to the Directors chair...PS If for some reason you have not yet seen this film, see it. End of.",Lost in Translation
1595,sara-elisa,The most beautiful lovestory I´ve ever seen,10,18 June 2019,"The movie is very calm but because of the simplicity, the feelings it wants to transfer feel very real. It´s an outstanding mix of romantic, subtle humor and melancholy. It has never been too cheesy or cliché. The story is easy and the love of the characters is too, but the circumstances aren´t, or maybe they are? The movie left me happy and sad at the same time but mostly with confused feelings (in a good way).
Furthermore the pictures of the scences are beautifully aesthetic and so the music choices are.",Lost in Translation
1596,censor3000,Exceeded Expectations,10,30 June 2009,"I had heard a lot about this film, but for some reason had never gotten around to watch it. But I purchased it on DVD as it was a good price and I knew I could easily sell it if I didn't like the film. However this will be a film that I keep in my collection forever.I'm 20 years old and I found that this film made me look at life a little differently. Throughout the whole film you find yourself emotionally invested in the two lead characters and the acting is fantastic by both.Overall I'd says it's a film you must see and one I found to linger for a week or so after watching.",Lost in Translation
1597,captionchesse,A movie of love and melancholy,8,24 June 2019,"A feeling of melancholy is felt through this film. It's as if you are right there beside the 2 main characters, tired and strung along a sleepless journey. The two main characters explore a strange relationship, Bob feels neglected by his wife and children and he is no longer interested by his job. Charlotte is a newly-wed who has begun to see the low lights of marriage. These two strangers meet in a world that is foreign one with bright lights and bad translators. They're whisked along a tiring path of boredom. A feeling a sleepy melancholy is present thought the whole film as if you are right there with the two of them. They explore an unorthodox love as they make a connection in a world unfamiliar to the two of them. The movie explores a character story, driven by two characters who are vastly different but able to connect.",Lost in Translation
1598,cupcakeworld,Beautiful..,8,11 November 2007,"This movie was overrated.. but I still loved it. It was hyped and pumped up too much..but still an amazing movie. Not what I expected..in a good way though. Most people complain about it being a pointless story..no plot, a lot of random happenings. That's what makes it so perfect..it's a break from all the heavy drama movies these days where everything is mapped out perfectly with the intricate detail, and the mastermind twist endings with the spot-on dialogue. This movie is a simple love story..a documentation of two people's amazing and personal connection in a huge foreign city, and truly shows how sometimes the loneliest place to be is in the middle of a crowd.",Lost in Translation
1599,saurabhmawle,A masterpiece for many aspects,7,12 January 2020,"I watched the movie once, appreciated it a lot. But a month later a specific feeling and urge to watch this movie again hit me so hard that I re watched it.",Lost in Translation
1600,calin-8,The refuge of reinventing yourself as a different character,10,28 February 2006,"Lost In Translation is an original story on the delicate subject of missing opportunities in life. It is all about spontaneous connections, about trusting and caring for more than conservation instincts when passing through difficult times, about platonic interpretation of feelings and internal beliefs. Sofia Coppola introduces the normal, average watcher, into a world that might not seem (at first glance)as special as the one of science fiction/horror movies, as it resembles to our own in almost every aspect except for the one of revelations. In such an environment, that is almost the same and yet different from the character's expectations, the internal compass of any person begins to malfunction, while the knowledge of the particular elements we reject each day at the level of traits amplifies itself in a totally unexpected way. Only in such a place will human conscience become aware of all a person's failures in life, as here loneliness and fame taste more bitter than anywhere else. On the other hand, only in such a place will the individual be given a new opportunity of redemption. The characters interpreted by Murray and Johansson are in a similar situation, they despite their marriage by understanding the mediocrity of their status in life and their constant lack of ontological freedom. Moreover,only by association will unsatisfaction be removed: an association that does not imply sexual attraction or pathological possession, but only the profound friendship between persons that do not expect anything from each other. In a way, Lost In Translation is a film about refuges, profound refuges necessary in the case of being objective enough to understand that the world is beyond balance or purpose. The film expresses the common questions of any interrogative subject, without offering theoretical solutions, but practical ways of understanding reality. It suggests that a certain individual may be seen as a loser as a result of the superior quality of its dreams,which did not offer the possibility to be fulfilled. On the other hand,such an individual might also represent a conqueror, if he accepts the responsibility implied by the strength of his most desperate ideals. Therefore,a loser is not the equivalent of a mediocre being, since such a person might offer metaphysical solutions to problems and accept the pain of not being strong enough to be promoted at the level of God. All these philosophical problems and more are debated in this film in a unique and subtle way, which gives the impression of a labyrinth without walls. The correct message can be understood only by appealing to internal knowledge and by surpassing all possible forms of nihilism. In the end, as Johansson's character suggests, ""nobody talks about these things"". That is why Coppola's film should have been reinvented if it hadn't already existed in the protean subconscious of particular images...",Lost in Translation
1601,mallyak,very good movie,10,13 March 2006,"This movie is a mixture of soft romance and comedy that makes you think more about your personal life and how lucky one is in this world who has found true love.Amazing performances by both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson are the stars of the show. Sophia Coppola has done a really good job in getting the best out these two actors, so much so that, by the end of the movie, you still end up waiting to see more of them.The movie showcases a mature relationship between two adults(the loner Bill and the neglected Scarlett) who know how difficult marriage really is, as they get to find each other in Tokyo.",Lost in Translation
1602,rick_milan17,My review of lost in translation,10,21 March 2006,"Lost in translation captures the essence of every lengthened breath and penetrating stare. It mixes pure innocence with problems of life and shows how something so simple is so much more grand than anything else. The confusion and questions that we all have deep inside regarding our identity, our soul, our purpose, our happiness, so quickly resolved by that one person who may not be quite the same as you, but fits you perfectly. It allows so much emotion without the loss of it's innocence. Their fear, alienation, loneliness and build up of hidden feelings and wonders, attach us greatly to the characters in a way that melts us as the movie develops. A series of sounds, stares, thoughts read by the viewer, an unexplainable yet obviously true, natural, and loving relationship that leads us to believe true love could actually be. The fear of marriage or commitment and what it may cause to the relationship (by past experience) lead us to believe that is why both characters are doubtful of where to take this wonderful encounter without ruining a second of it. There are a wide variety of scenes in which (because of great direction and perception of viewer) many hints can be caught on, explaining us the movie, drawing us a picture, allowing us to figure out and feel what they experience. The general mood itself is so relaxing, loose, natural, as love should be. The fact they are in a land where they can almost only understand each other shows how beautiful it is, how it can happen anywhere, how in a place and time where both felt lost, they found the path to happiness, this path was each other, and nothing else mattered. In times of doubt and fear, both gave in, preferring to preserve an already beautiful experience than to risk damaging it, nevertheless, inevitably, as if by force of destiny, soon they are drawn once again to each other in a compelling scene where, if not spoken, then created by the viewer, each creates his own interpretation. A great production by a great director, truly a master piece.",Lost in Translation
