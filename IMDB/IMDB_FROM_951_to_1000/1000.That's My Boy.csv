0,TheLittleSongbird,"Didn't care for it on the whole, but Adam Sandler has done much worse than this...",4,5 December 2012,"Judging by the rather unnecessarily condescending tone of some of the positive reviews you'd think it'd actually be against the law to dislike Adam Sandler or his films. The bottom line is, it is not, people have different tastes and the word ""opinion"" is around for a reason, if you like them that's fine but please try to be respectful to anybody having a different opinion to you instead of accusing them of ""not having a sense of humour"" or ""trying to be part of the bandwagon"" (that is true of any positive reviews for a movie that is critically panned). Surely it can't be THAT hard to be accepting of other people's opinions, could it? As for me, I am neither a detractor(I am not going to use the term ""hater"" as I can't stand that word) of Sandler or his films. Nor am I exactly a fan. In terms of Sandler's films, I loved or thoroughly enjoyed Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, Spanglish, The Wedding Singer and Happy Gilmore. But he has churned out some terrible films as well, Going Overboard, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry and You Don't Mess with the Zohan are bad but even they aren't as awful as Jack and Jill. My opinion towards Sandler is pretty much the same, some of his performances like in Reign Over Me have been great but there are others especially in Jack and Jill where he is unbearably irritating.That's My Boy, seeing it out to curiosity to see whether it would be either another dud or a return to form, is neither among his best or worst. For me it is a mediocre film rather than a terrible one, and it does deserve credit for actually being significantly better than Jack and Jill. I do think that That's My Boy does have redeeming qualities. The best assets were the soundtrack and the performance of Vanilla Ice. The soundtrack I found to be great, managing to be upbeat and catchy, it also fits with the film very well. Vanilla Ice sends himself up and the way he does it makes for what is the only thing that is genuinely funny about the film. Milo Ventimiglia manages to be beautiful and earnest, and Andy Samberg gives his all and it shows, it is such a shame though that his role is so thankless.Unfortunately, I didn't care for Sandler here. He has proved that he can be powerful, funny or endearing, but his performance in That's My Boy shows neither of those qualities. Instead I did find him irritating, in the sense that it is essentially a one-note performance that also has a tendency to be overly-exaggerated. He does do that dumb character shtick that we see a lot in his films, but there is nothing fresh or likable about the shtick. It just feels tired and as a consequence makes it difficult to properly engage with him or his character. Leighton Meester isn't bad, but is underused and has nothing worthwhile to say or do. Then we have actors like James Caan and Susan Sarandon showing up, and while it was nice to see them again I just couldn't think of any real reason as to why they were there in the first place, other than maybe money or just another film to add to their resume.On a visual front, there are cheaper films out there, the locations are nice though nothing extraordinary, but the editing does at times have a rather rushed-through feel. Sean Anders' direction is flat and lacks any kind of vitality for my tastes as well. On top of that, the characters are stereotypes that are so bland and obnoxious that it is difficult to care for them. You know there is something wrong when the best actors in the movie have next to nothing that is remotely worthwhile. I would forgive the fact that the story is predictable, a lot of movies are even movies that I find enjoyable, if it engaged me at all. That's My Boy didn't do that, it was unevenly paced with a lot of the parts aiming to be funny coming across as forced and there is no real heart. There are a fair bit of sentiment here, sadly it's the kind that is cloying in alternative to touching.But it was the humour that really hurt it. I can see what it was trying to do but in the end it just wasn't funny. I don't think I laughed or smiled much if at all during That's My Boy, Vanilla Ice aside. For a comedy, that is really bad news. The rude, raunchy kind of humour has worked before, though admittedly is not my style, but the slapstick in That's My Boy though is very shoddy and reeks of been there, done that, and the gross-outs are both unsubtle and laboured. There are jokes about rape and incest, as well as the fart jokes you'd come to expect from Sandler's kind of humour, the problem is that these subjects are not ones to laugh at, so the jokes come across as crude and rather offensive. And to cap everything off, the script is embarrassingly bad with no lines that come across as quotable or even remotely amusing, and a lot of it is very juvenile.In conclusion, a mediocre film that tries hard but doesn't deliver or for me entertain. This is not Sandler's worst film and not quite bad enough to be down there, but this is really not him at his best. As I've said, while I've given an honest opinion BEFORE having read any of the critics' reviews(though I did have a suspicion) I am not going to say that you are wrong to like it. If you do, good for you, just don't expect everybody to feel the same that's all. 4/10 Bethany Cox",That's My Boy
1,SnoopyStyle,Adam Sandler better than other recent effort,5,17 August 2013,"Donny (Adam Sandler) had a son Todd in high school with a teacher. Todd (Andy Samberg) is now grown up and estranged from Donny. Todd is marrying up-tight Jamie (Leighton Meester) when Donny shows up trying to reconnect with him.Sandler is not as annoying in this one. He is more human and less cartoon than all of his more recent movies. He isn't mean spirited. However, he is still a loser always looking for the next score. The fact that he's playing a more likable character makes this movie more likable. However there is still missing the childlike joy that infected his earlier movies. I'm still waiting for the joy.",That's My Boy
2,mark.waltz,"For movie theaters and DVD, the point of sale really is P.O.S., and I don't mean point of sale...",1,7 September 2013,"It is a sad day for Hollywood that films have sunk to this level of slime. Especially comedy. It used to be that the infamous slob comedy mixed elements of farce, screwball and even drawing room. Compared to this, ""Animal House"" and ""Caddyshack"" were Noel Coward. As Adam Sandler is the star, you've got to expect a bit of grossness and plenty of immaturity. But his earlier films mixed in a big heart, and underneath idiotic characters like ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Little Nicky"" was a sweet innocence that is profoundly missing here. I am a big fan of his two films with the lovely Drew Barrymore, but after this film, I will watch his newer films with great reluctance.Sandler is the grown-up And I use that term loosely... father of a son (Andy Samberg) he squired with his high school teacher who tries to establish some sort of adult relationship with him as he prepares to marry a wealthy young lady (Leighton Meester). And I use that term loosely, too. If finding humor in things such as incest, practically every combination of human waste being let loose on a wedding dress, which the bride then licks, and excessive masturbation references, then the viewer may be amused, but I feel sorry for people like that.There's a huge supporting cast of unfortunate actors who seem to be intent on proving what slime-balls humanity has become. There's James Caan as a violent priest, Vanilla Ice as a parody of himself and Tony Orlando as an obnoxious relative. Veteran B western heroine Peggy Stewart is the somewhat senile granny and the hefty Louelle is the proverbial exotic dancer with an alleged heart of gold. At least Susan Sarandon has the benefit of a cameo as the cougar teacher, still in prison, but her minimal participation has me asking one question: why?",That's My Boy
3,nogodnomasters,HE WASN'T A GREAT DAD,6,15 September 2018,"Adam Sandler returns to the screen as Donnie Berger who was famous as a child for having sex with his teacher (Eva Amurri Martino). While in prison she gave birth to their son Han Solo Berger, who left home at 18 and changed his name to Todd Peterson (Andy Samberg). Upon seeing a wedding announcement in the paper, Donnie crashes the bride's home. His son, embarrassed by his foul mouthed, rude, uncouth father introduces him as an old friend. Donnie is immediately recognized as his infamous self which allows the family to tolerate his vulgar ways. Donnie also needs $43,000 to avoid going to IRS prison, but this major plot point becomes secondary once the antic start. Not Sandler's best work, but certainly not his worst.Unlike ""Jack and Jill"" I was able to sit through this entire film. In spite of the excessive bad language and low brow humor, the film did have some appeal to it.Parental Guide: Excessive F-bombs, sex talk, brief nudity and sex.",That's My Boy
4,kosmasp,Ice is back with his brand new invention,5,5 January 2013,"And his brand new invention is acting. Although you could argue the point that playing oneself might not be considered acting, I can't really tell, because I don't know who the real ""Vanilla Ice"" is. What I can say is that he almost steals the entire movie from established actors. And he's not shying back on making fun of himself. In a good way that is. Sandler and Samberg on the other hand sound way better on paper than they are on screen.Don't get me wrong, compared to ""Jack and Jill"" (or some of his/Adams other lame comedies) this looks like a masterpiece! But the trailer did suggest more fun than you actually might have. Some odd cameos (Adam always gets whoever he wants to or at least it looks that way) that I won't spoil are fun and the tone gets set pretty early on. The R-rating is there for a reason and it touches a nice subject matter. Of course you won't get too deep into the whole thing (no pun intended), but it makes for awkward (=fun?) comedy time.It's really predictable, but if you let yourself enjoy it (and you will know if it is for you right off the bat!), you will have a good time watching it",That's My Boy
5,jboothmillard,That's My Boy,2,20 October 2015,"I saw on Wikipedia that this was on ""List of films considered the worst"", I have a seen a majority of films from the star of Big Daddy, many of them have been rubbish, I had to see if this one would be the same story, from Razzie nominated director Sean Anders (Sex Drive, Horrible Bosses 2). Basically in 1984 young Donal ""Donny"" Berger (Justin Weaver) has a crush on his teacher Mary McGarricle (Eva Amurri Martino), she is a hebephile (has a sexual appetite for teenagers), she begins a sexual relationship with him. This relationship is discovered during an assembly, Mary is sentenced to prison, it is revealed she is pregnant, custody of the unborn child goes to Donny's abusive father until Donny is a mature age. Twenty-eight years later in 2012, adult Donny (Razzie winning Adam Sandler) is a broke alcoholic slacker who spends his time with his friends, bartender Brie (singer Ciara) and her stripper mother Champale (Borat's Luenell), his grown up son changed his name to Todd Peterson (Andy Samberg), he is embarrassed by his father's immaturity, he is a successful businessman planning to marry his fiancée Jamie Martin (Leighton Meester). Donny learns from his lawyer Jim Nance (Rex Ryan) that he owes $43,000 to the IRS in back- taxes, he will be imprisoned for three years if this is not repaid by the end of the week, with his previous period of celebrity he agrees with TV producer Randall Morgan (Dan Patrick) to attempt a televised reunion with Todd and his mother in the women's prison, for $50,000. Donny arrives in Cape Cod, finds Todd, and tries to convince to take part, Todd introduces everyone to Donny as his friend, having previously told them that his parents are dead, Todd refuses to reunite with his mother in prison, not knowing about the TV show. Todd initially argues constantly with his childish and obnoxious father, but slowly he changes his opinion, even imitating his behaviour, Donny is allowed to attend a bachelor organised before the wedding, and his son bonds with Brie at the strip club. Todd does finally agree to meet his mother, the older Mary McGarricle (Susan Sarandon), at the prison, having bonded with his son Donny tries to stop Todd from going, knowing that the TV crew are waiting, but he is too late, Todd does get some time with his mother, but they are then ambushed by the crew, Todd is disgusted and leaves, therefore Donny does not get the money. But then Donny hears a conversation Jamie has that could change everything, he assumes she has been sleeping with Todd's boss Steve Spirou (Tony Orlando), this turns out to be false, however she has been having sex with her own brother Chad (Heroes' Milo Ventimiglia), she is willing to give Donny $50,000 to keep quiet about the affair. Donny decides to go against Jamie's hush money to stop the wedding, he gets the help of his celebrity buddy (Razzie nominated) Vanilla Ice, he reveals to all spectators that he is in fact Todd's father, tears up Jamie's cheque and forces her to admit her infidelity, he is disgusted and breaks up with Jamie. In the end Todd finally acknowledges Donny as his father, he even goes back to using his birth name Han Solo Berger, he starts dating Brie, and offers to help Donny to pay the unpaid taxes, he refuses and is prepared to go to prison, in fact Donny gets the money he needs winning a long-shot bet he placed, Donny and Han celebrate with all their friends. Also starring James Caan as Father McNally, Will Forte as Phil, Blake Clark as Gerald and Razzie nominated Nick Swardson as Kenny. Sandler has played a slacker many times, his character is also a former tabloid celebrity with his claim to fame being that he screwed his teacher, in this he is just another boorish moron, Samberg is mildly alright as the more mature son of his, the appearances of great actors like Caan and Sarandon is pointless. This film I will admit made me titter in some small places, probably the same goes for the critics that give it two stars out of five, but it is crammed with predictability, not very amusing slapstick, stereotypical characters and annoying sentimentality, and its gross in some moments as well, it's just a terrible comedy. It won the Razzie for Worst Screenplay, and it was nominated for Worst Screen Couple for Sandler and either Meester, Samberg, or Sarandon, Worst Screen Ensemble for the Entire Cast and Worst Picture. Pretty poor!",That's My Boy
6,paul_haakonsen,Not your average comedy...,5,29 September 2012,"I had no particular high expectations for this movie when I sat down and watched it, as it is an Adam Sandler movie, and they all have a tendency of being remarkably generic and seem to be cut from the same rock.However, I did enjoy this movie actually, because of the twisted, bizarre storyline that it had. It was abstract and absurd to the point of being great. Sure, the jokes in the movie weren't all that great, and the movie didn't really hold a lot of laughs. But still there was something uniquely enjoyable about it.The characters in the movie were also nicely thought up and had some really great quirks. Each and every characters was bizarre in their own special way and came together for a greater whole in a nice way.I must admit that it was difficult to sit and listen to Adam Sandler do that strained and hoarse voice that he seems to enjoy do and put on that horrible accent. You just want to ram something in your ears at times. However, in my opinion, it wasn't Adam Sandler who was carrying this movie, it was Andy Samberg by far.""That's My Boy"" has some a pretty great list of people cast for the various roles. And hats off to Andy Samberg for his performance in this movie. And, although a fairly small role, then James Caan really had an amazing cameo in this movie with a great character. And also wacky Nick Swardson had a really hilarious character in the movie. Odd though for an Adam Sandler movie that you didn't have Rob Schneider in the movie.Personally, I am not much fan of Adam Sandler as I believe that once you've seen one of his movies, you've basically seen them all. There has only been a handful of his movie that have stood out in my opinion, ""Anger Management"", ""Click"" and now ""That's My Boy"".Don't expect to be in for a 116 minute of laughter, because they are far apart. However, the characters, the twisted storyline and the absurdity of it all makes the movie worth a watch.",That's My Boy
7,hitchcockthelegend,Risible!,3,4 February 2017,"That's My Boy finds Adam Sandler on auto pilot, for this represents him not giving a care in the world about his fans or anyone remotely interested in watching a decent comedy. Sure this has fans, and it's not my want to chastise people's personal preferences, especially with what makes them laugh, and certainly making light of serious issues doesn't have me signing up for the next PC Brigade march, but this is pathetically played.It was a colossal failure at the box offices, and it deserved to be. Sandler and his writer, David Caspe, blend edgy offensiveness with base juvenile comedy, throwing erection and sperm gags together with incest and statutory rape was always going to be tricky to successfully pull off, even more so when Sandler and co seem to think shouting loud makes scenes more funny. It's just that it never comes off as a funny whole, just a series of mind farts dotted alongside a potentially warm bonding between estranged father and son thread.Next to this Little Nicky looks a masterpiece! It's a tough film for Sandler fans to defend, and I have been one in the past, but when Vanilla Ice sending himself up is a highlight then you got problems. Whilst Susan Sarandon and James Caan should look in the mirror and ask questions about appearing in this... 3/10",That's My Boy
8,zardoz-13,Sandler's Back to Bowel Humor,8,28 June 2012,"Adam Sandler can turn anything into a joke. Whether you laugh at the former ""Saturday Night Live"" comic's degenerate sense of humor is an entirely different matter. Typically, juvenile delinquent fantasies fuel Sandler's gross out antics. ""Sex Drive"" director Sean Anders and ""Happy Endings"" television series scribe David Caspe have ramped up Sandler's impudent humor far beyond anything the lowbrow comedian has ever tried. ""That's My Boy,"" casts Sandler as a shrill, low-life, irresponsible, adult adolescent who never matured. Imagine the protagonists of either ""Billy Madison"" or ""The Waterboy"" as unrepentant hemorrhoids, and you'll have a good idea what to expect from ""That's My Boy."" Actually, from premise to performance, ""That's My Boy"" qualifies as Sandler at his raunchiest. Nothing aberrant like the thoroughly unwholesome ""Hangover 2,"" however, happens in ""That's My Boy."" Nevertheless, Sandler hasn't made anything this tastelessly hilarious since either ""Big Daddy"" or ""Little Nicky."" Most Sandler characters, such as Billy Madison, Robert 'Bobby' Boucher Jr., from ""The Waterboy,"" Happy Gilmore, and Sonny Koufax in ""Big Daddy,"" emerge as saints compared with Donny Berger. Before his second-to-last movie, Sandler had shown signs of mellowing. He made movies about middle-aged guys and their families, such as ""Grown Ups"" and ""Just Go with It."" Earlier, he appeared in two genuinely memorable films: ""Funny People"" and ""Punch-Drunk Love."" Admittedly, Sandler's last movie ""Jack and Jill"" scraped the bottom of the barrel. ""Jack and Jill"" amounted to cretinous idiocy about identical twin siblings. Sandler dressed up in drag when he wasn't playing it straight. Nonetheless, he played a middle-aged father with a middle of the road family. Happily, no matter how awful ""That's My Boy"" is, ""That's My Boy"" is still ten times better than ""Jack and Jill."" At the same time, ""That's My Boy"" may challenge even the staunchest Sandler's fans.The premise of ""That's My Boy"" is audacious. The year is 1984, and the setting is the Boston suburb of Somerville. Thirteen year old Donny Berger (Justin Weaver) finds himself in detention, but what happens is nothing like ""The Breakfast Club."" Donny's ultra-hot looking, nymphomaniac math teacher, Mary McGarricle (Eva Amurri Martino of ""The Banger Sisters""), rapes him without shame. During a middle-school function in the auditorium, Donny and his naked teacher are caught in the act on stage. She flees in humiliation with a flag wrapped around her, while Donny basks in a standing ovation from both students and faculty. Never has the double standard in sexual relations been more pronounced. A sign in the auditorium heralds Donny's makeover from nobody to somebody: ""Some have greatness thrust upon them."" Never has statutory rape been celebrated in such a cynical manner. Donny emerges as a tabloid celebrity, while his teacher winds up pulling a 30 year stretch in the Massachusetts Women's Prison. Worse, not only has Donny gotten Miss McGarricle pregnant with a son, but also McGarricle admits no shame in their liaison.For the record, Anders, Caspe, and Sandler have modeled their comedy on the infamous Mary Kay Letourneau case in 1997. Mary Kay was a married school teacher who seduced one of her 13-year-old students, Vili Fualaau, in Des Moines, Washington. Eventually, she had two daughters from their illicit romance. Difficult as it is to fathom, the people who produced ""That's My Boy"" have displayed a modicum of discretion in their depiction of the notorious romance between Mary Kay and Vili. In real life, Vili claims he never felt like a victim of sex abuse. Later, after Mary Kay left prison, Vili married her and wrote a book about their adventures. Some of this transpires in ""That's My Boy."" Similarly, Donny and his teacher have little boy, but Donny turns out to be the worst parent imaginable.During an expository dialogue scene between Donny (Adam Sandler) and his grown-up son Todd (Adam Samberg of ""Hot Rod""), we learn about Donny's shortcomings as a daddy. Initially, Donny named his son Han Solo after Harrison Ford's ""Star Wars"" hero. Not only does Todd scold his father for this ridiculous moniker, but also for pandering to his sweet tooth so that he packed on hundreds of pounds and contracted diabetes. Donny turned his 8-year old son into an obese urchin and exploited him as a designated driver when he was too drunk to drive! Once he was old enough to disown his dad, Todd changed his name, claimed his parents had died in an explosion, and became a profitable businessman as a hedge fund manager. Todd is poised to marry his sweetheart, a wealthy heiress, Jamie (Leighton Meester of ""Date Night""), and live happily ever after. Forty-year old Donny learns about his son's wedding in Cape Cod and crashes it. Things haven't been too good for Donny. The I.R.S demands $43-thousand for delinquent taxes or they will put him in prison. A reality TV show producer promises Donny the dough if he can persuade Todd to appear alongside him on camera at the woman's prison where his mom is incarcerated.""That's My Boy"" concerns reconciliation as well as dysfunctional families. Donny may be Adam Sandler's least sympathetic, most outrageous, and best role to date. At times, Sandler looks like a cross-between of Al Pacino and Paul McCartney in 1980s garb. The running joke is everybody loves Donny except Todd who initially hates him. Most of the action takes place at Cape Cod where Todd's future boss, financial guru Steve Spirou (Tony Orlando), has planned their wedding. Tony Orlando is not the only leftover from the 1980s. White rapper Vanilla Ice appears in an extended cameo as one of Donny's buddies, and James Caan plays a pugnacious man of the cloth. This politically incorrect farce carries an R-rating for pervasive vulgarity, sexual humor, nudity, drug use and some comic violence. Most of ""That's My Boy"" will either make you grimace in disbelief or laugh without restraint.",That's My Boy
9,neil-476,"Stupid and horrible, with Sandler at his most awful",3,11 September 2012,"I am one of life's natural optimists. That must be the reason why I keep going to see Adam Sandler movies: you see, I know that he is capable of giving good performances, and I guess I am just hopeful that the next film will be one of them. That's My Boy dashes my hopes once more, however.Let me start by going through the plot in some detail - you need to know this in order to fully gauge the awfulness of this movie. 14 year old Donny Berger, a boy who never stops talking yet has nothing of value to say, makes coarse and inappropriate sexual overtures to Ms McGarricle, the hottest teacher in school (you can tell she's the hottest, because she moves in slow motion). Continuing at the level of credibility already established, Ms McGarricle responds to Donny, and their hot affair culminates in a sexual encounter which takes place in front of the whole school (which, as I am sure you expect, erupts in applause). Ms McGarricle, heavily pregnant, is sentenced to a rather extreme 30 years in prison for statutory rape (which nobody thinks about appealing, apparently) and, when he reaches 18, Donny is to gain custody of the child (named Han Solo Berger). Jumping forward 25-odd years, we discover Donny about to be jailed for $43.000 tax arrears, and his son (now calling himself Todd, having jettisoned his father at the earliest opportunity, and now a successful hedge fund manager) about to get married to hottie Jamie. Having been promised $50,000 if he can get together for a TV crew with Todd and Ms McGarricle for a prison visit, Donny descends on the wedding party at the posh house of Todd's boss Peter, where a pre-wedding get-together is being hosted for Todd, Jamie, Jamie's parents and her brother Chad, an uptight Marine (curiously, it apparently never occurs to Donny to go for the simpler plan of simply being crass and objectionable in order to try to extort money to stay away: just as well, as the other people present, apart from Todd, seem to find his crassness and objectionability endearing). Donny, passed off as Todd's best friend (Todd having written his real parents out of his past), proceeds to wreak various sorts of havoc with the wedding plans, messes up the priest and the venue, and takes the male participants on a stag night involving offensive behaviour, criminal damage, and spoiling the enjoyment of various other innocent people going about their business, all of which is ""hilarious."" Todd goes to the prison to visit his mother (having had the idea put in his head): by this time Donny feels genuine warmth towards Todd and tries to stop him, but too late - the emergence of the television crew (who capture Todd soiling himself) destroys the tentative relationship which was beginning to form. Donny discovers that Jamie has been cheating on Todd with both Steve and also her brother Chad. She pays him off with the money he needs, but he decides he has to save Todd, and interrupts the wedding (which, of course, dissolves into chaos). Donny is now expecting to go to prison when a plot twist even less credible than what has gone before solves the problem.Let's not quibble with the glorification of paedophilia and the surprise plot twist of incest (apologies for ruining the surprise): these have always been areas of comedy gold, have they not? (no they haven't. However). What makes this film so truly horrific is not the preposterous plot nor the areas of tastelessness it encompasses. No, the true horror of this film rests on the shoulders of Donny Berger aka Adam Sandler. This appallingly conceived character - a crass, crude, witless slacker whose every act is offensive - is clearly intended to be a lovable kook. He is not: he is objectionable. I hated him, I hated being in his company, and I wished bad, bad things for him from the opening frames onwards. Sandler chooses to portray him with a massively annoying voice, in a massively annoying way, in what may be the worst performance of his career. The film is built around this character, and he's awful.The only reasons for watching this movie are Leighton Meestor and Eva Amurri as Jaime and Ms McGarricle respectively, both of whom are easy on the eye. And the casting of Susan Sarandon (Eva Amurri's real-life mother) to play Ms McGarricle 25-odd years later is the film's one good gag. But none of this is reason to watch this film.Incidentally, to take up a couple of the points I see in other reviews, particularly from those who enjoyed it:1. I'm glad you enjoyed it. You had as much right to enjoy as I had not to. But there's no need to be offensive towards those who didn't.2. I have no problem with Sandler's adult direction, although I am always a little bit puzzled at the reason for having old, fat and, frankly unattractive people (and I speak as an old, fat and, frankly, unattractive person) running around naked whilst keeping the young slim and, frankly, sizzling hot young ladies doing no more then exposing a demure length of bare back. Double standards! (although, to be fair, the film does give more than a nod to geriatric sex).",That's My Boy
10,anaconda-40658,That's My Boy's Mistake.,5,24 June 2015,"That's My Boy (2012): Dir: Sean Anders / Cast: Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Leighton Meester, Vanilla Ice, Susan Sarandon: Perhaps the most vulgar contraption released this year. It is a comedy about where we come from and how we deal with it. Premise regards a student teacher relationship that results in a pregnancy. The teacher goes to prison for thirty years while the high school boy lives off the fame. This premise would work on its own given society's obsession with celebrities. For example, the whole Chris Brown abusing Rihanna ordeal seemed to make him even more famed and admired by female fans. That said, the premise here had sick promise. Unfortunately is dissolves into formula years later with the kid growing into Adam Sandler who is having tax trouble and needs cash or he will face jail. Andy Samberg plays his son who has put his past behind him and is engaged. Obviously Sandler shows up and makes life miserable for the son who would rather keep their relationship private since he told his bride to be that his father died in an explosion. This is disgusting with relationships of illegal proportions but Sandler and Samberg have fine comic chemistry, and Vanilla Ice steals scenes playing himself in a state of regret left laying in the bushes in a drunken faze. Leighton Meester as the bride is underused until a vile revelation is revealed. Susan Sarandon makes the best appearance in the film playing the older version of the teacher who is now in jail. There are those whom will find this tasteless while others may get the dysfunctional joke in all of its detestable glory. Score: 5 ½ / 10",That's My Boy
11,FlashCallahan,Duran Duran earrings?.......,6,3 September 2012,"in his teens, Donny fathered a son, and raised him as a single parent up until Todd's 18th birthday.Now, after not seeing each other for years, Todd's world comes crashing down on the eve of his wedding when an uninvited Donny suddenly shows up.Trying desperately to reconnect with his son, Donny is now forced to deal with the repercussions of his bad parenting skills.....So after the crisis that was Jack and Jill, Sandler comes and gives us one of his most bizarre and bonkers comedies probably ever, and to be fair, it's not too bad.Plotwise, the film is non-existent, it's just an excuse for some crude humour, dirty language and childish behaviour, and I must admit, I chuckled on several occasions.Yes it's going to tank, and yes, the critics will hate it, but this isn't Sandler on auto-pilot, this is Sandler basically saying 'look what I can do because i'm the third most bankable star in Hollywood'.Fair dues to him, he gets great cameos, some wonderful lines from his regular crew, and a twist ending so, so bonkers, it has to be seen to be believed.Sandler haters will see this, just to have a snipe, but if you are a long term Sandler fan, it's good stuff, totally perfunctory, and a step up from his last film.",That's My Boy
12,namashi_1,I Laughed!,6,11 November 2012,"Sean Anders's 'That's My Boy' is crass, crude & offensive. BUT, I Laughed!

Now, after not seeing each other for years, Todd's world comes crashing down when Donny resurfaces just before Todd's wedding.'That's My Boy' is the kinda film, that you'll either enjoy & or simply hate. I did laugh & I did enjoy it. I didn't go in looking for an epic comedy, I knew it was mindless & abusive, so in that context, 'That's My Boy' comes up safely. David Caspe's Screenplay is crass, crude & highly abusive, but it offers laughs. Anders's Direction is fair. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are passable.Performance-Wise: Adam Sandler delivers the rudest performance of his career. As the absolute snob, Sandler plays him as despicably as possible & impresses sporadically. Andy Samberg isn't at his best, but he does manage to leave a mark. Leighton Meester is decent. Milo Ventimiglia is earnest. James Caan & Susan Sarandon appear in cameos & add star value.On the whole, 'That's My Boy' worked for me.",That's My Boy
13,StevePulaski,"A loathsome, painfully unfunny affront to comedy",1,16 June 2012,"That's My Boy is content with being a belligerent vulgarian comedy that it is willing to concoct any setup, any one-liner, or any character as long as it's on par with its irredeemable crude standard. It's first fatal flaw is that it erects so many raunchy situations that it completely undermines the characters that are involved in them, which is the whole reason we laugh. We laugh not at the situations themselves, but how these characters react to them. But this is only the icing on the cake of disgust.Such topics covered in the film are teacher-student molestation, strippers, poor parenting, child abuse, browbeating the less fortunate, incest, and many more. Only Sandler would take such heartless and degrading topics and throw them all into a film where no wit, soul, or morals can be found. They are employed with such carelessness and such a disregard for humanity that it becomes utterly revolting. The only laughs to be found come from, not a main character, but one that shows up at the end of the film (something you should expect from a Happy Madison picture). He is Abdoulaye N'gom, who was also in the Sandler produced Grandma's Boy. How come somebody didn't think to put him as one of the side characters? The story can be summed up in fragmented words such as lazy, overwritten, camaraderie, inconsiderate, offensive, demeaning, and mean-spirited, but let's focus on the plot itself. It starts out on the ever-so bright note of teacher-student molestation, where young nitwit teenager Donny Berger is happily seduced by his teacher, Miss Mary McGarricle in a closet. It results in an unexpected pregnancy, where Miss McGarricle goes to prison, and their baby is left with the teenage Donny, who can barely take care of himself, let alone another child.Donny names the kid ""Han Solo Berger,"" and at eighteen, the kid becomes estranged from his parents, telling people they died in an explosion, changes his name to ""Todd Peterson,"" and begins a new life. Donny (Sandler) went on to live off a six figure deal to sell his story to a Television show, and carelessly blew all the money, forgetting that he needed to pay taxes on the earnings. Donny now owes the IRS $43,000, and winds up striking a $50,000 deal with a filthy reality show executive to get him, Todd, and his mother (currently in prison) to do a reunion event on camera. It's scummy and outlandishly selfish.Todd is Andy Samberg, who is stunned to see Donny show up uninvited and quickly tells his wife's family that he is a close friend of his, and this leads to some contrived shouting matches between the two as to how Donny was the worst parent ever. This is true. It's a too little, too late effort, but Donny decides it's time to make nice with Todd, so he stays at their house during the wedding to reconnect with his son, while trying to conceal the fact that he's only there for money.This is yet another Sandler film I like to dub an ""anti-character"" study. First off, there is hardly a likable character in the film, except for Todd, who is just a poor man's version of a neurotic success story. The character Donny comes equipped with Sandler's most horrendous accent since his character in The Waterboy, and this could very well be Sandler's worst film in years (I have not seen Jack and Jill). It aims to go for the baddest of laughs, but due to the lack of discipline, plausibility in the writing (why isn't the baby given to child services?), and the removal of heart in its material, it's a middle finger to morals and an ode to chaotic, mean-spirited circumstances.That's My Boy inhabits a world of such cruelty to almost everyone involved. The males are incompetent caricatures, motivated by ego and greed, the women are no better than the size of their breasts and buttocks, shown in a misogynistic light almost saying that women exist to either show off parts of their body or to be ditzy, foul-mouthed bimbos, and every middle-age side character is shown as an amoral horn-dog, both men and women alike. Remember Big Daddy? One of the few Adam Sandler films sort of slanted and aimed more for children? It involved a louse who is stuck raising an illegitimate kid for his best friend. You could sort of label That's My Boy the raunchy sequel to Big Daddy, an explain it extracted the heart and sentiment out of it. But saying that would give the film more purpose than it's entitled to. It's a loathsome, painfully unfunny affront to comedy.Starring: Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Leighton Meester, Susan Sarandon, Will Forte, Nick Swardson, Peter Dante, and Abdoulaye N'gom. Directed by: Sean Anders.",That's My Boy
14,KineticSeoul,Epitome of immature humor that isn't funny,2,29 June 2012,"This movie was just immature that has almost no funny moments. I know Adam Sandler is probably trying to go back to his roots of ""Billy Madison"" and ""Happy Gilmore"" style of movies. But those movies are coherent and is actually funny despite how awkward and immature it is. This just has Adam Sandler doing his trademark voice while acting like an idiot. Which would be fine if it was funny, but it's not. The story is this, Adam Sandler's character knock up his teacher at a young age. The teacher goes to prison and Adam's character just lives off that fame and publicity until it dies off. Anyways the guy is in debt now so he decides to get some money off his now successful son who wants nothing to do with him. So now he tries to be a father to his son despite him being way more immature and retarded. Like I said before characters in movies acting retarded is fine if it's funny but again that just isn't the case. It seems like Sandler just doesn't care anymore as long as he is raking in money. Sean Anders has been part of some funny comedies but this is far from being one of them. Some of the audiences even walked out of this movie and the rest just seemed annoyed and few gave some fake laughs.2/10",That's My Boy
15,Hellmant,This Adam Sandler movie does have a relatable somewhat realistic lead character and he's played by Andy Samberg!,6,27 June 2012,"'THAT'S MY BOY': Three Stars (Out of Five)Adam Sandler teams with another younger 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' vet, Andy Samberg, for this father-son tale about a former child star who fathered a son as a young teen, with the teacher he had a crush on, and is now trying to reconnect with him before his marriage. The film was written by David Caspe and directed by Sean Anders, who also directed one of my favorite comedy films 'SEX DRIVE' (he also co-wrote 'SEX DRIVE' as well as 'HOT TUB TIME MACHINE' and 'SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE', two more of my favorites). The film is a change for Sandler, it's much more raunchy and explicitly vulgar (being R rated) than his usual PG-13 films. This has shown at the box office though, it's performed less than half as well as his usual big hits (due to the fact that his usual big hits are aimed at twelve and thirteen year old boys which can't get into this one). The movie is a bit funnier than Sandler's usual trash but it's still extremely hit-and-miss with many jokes falling flat. The film begins in 1984 when Donny (Sandler) is a 12-year-old (than played by Justin Weaver) with a crush on his teacher Ms McGarricle (Eva Amurri, daughter of Susan Sarandon; who plays the same role in present day). The two begin a sexual relationship and Ms McGarricle becomes pregnant when the two are discovered. Donny's teacher is sent to prison for thirty years leaving Donny to raise their child, who he names Han Solo. At age 18 Han (Samberg) moves away and changes his name (to Todd Peterson) wanting to forget his father and the childish ways he raised him. In present day Donny is now in trouble with the IRS and owes $43,000 in taxes (on money he collected from his celebrity status due to the teacher hookup / child parenting incident) and if he can't come up with the money by the end of the next weekend he'll be forced to go to prison for three years. Donny turns to a sleazy TV producer (Dan Patrick), who used to produce shows about him during his celebrity years, for help and is offered $50,000 if he can arrange a reunion with his son. Donny then attempts to reunite with his recently engaged son, the weekend of his wedding. Leighton Meester co-stars as Todd's fiancé. The movie is packed with the usual lowbrow unclever attempts at humor you'd expect from an Adam Sandler movie. It also has the normal cheesy attempts to tug at the heart that you'd expect from one of his poorly written and poorly made sappy films. This movie is a little different though in that it does have a relatable somewhat realistic lead character and he's played by Andy Samberg. Samberg's character does bring a certain human element to the film that you don't normally see in a Sandler comedy and his performance is topnotch as well; he's actually funny and doesn't overact like Sandler. The two together as a father and son buddy duo does work as well and their age difference in real life is actually the same as it is in the movie (12 years). So the core element of the movie works and for every bad joke there's about one that does work as well. Anders directing is decent for the material as well but the script definitely could have used several more rewrites. As far as Adam Sandler movies go (at least lately) this one is a little above average and worth a look if you're a fan.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAxZQ69Tess",That's My Boy
16,thesar-2,That's My BadFor Watching This,1,17 January 2013,"The funniest part of That's My Boy was that since the movie was void of any humor, they couldn't even come up with the obligatory outtake scenes in the closing credits.This movie, as stated, is lacking any comedy, any originality and it's a wonder people still flock to an Adam Sandler film with a string of horrid and over-long films starring him. Watching this painful mess – and I use those terms extremely lightly, I kept wondering if it would be Sandler's worst. As disgusting as this was, Grown Ups remains his worst.Of course, this comes in a VERY close second. Let's just see how bad Grown Ups 2 is and where that'll rank.I digress. In an age old lie-film plot, a young boy impregnates his teacher and when the time comes, said boy leaves his (milking this ""achievement"") father and becomes successful. When daddy tries to make unpaid tax money off his son, so-called hilarity ensues at his son's wedding.You have to give this writer credit, or allow his punishment to become A Clockwork Orange's repeated viewing of this abomination. EVERY SINGLE JOKE either tanked or was seen coming from 600 frames back. Sandler even did his World's Most Annoying Voice again. I've always loathed that whiney and unimaginative sound and here, he performed that for a solid two hours.Yep. This movie with a 5-minute premise is stretched for almost two hours. What the bleep is wrong with Sandler, aside from his dried out ""humor,"" that he feels that every movie of his has to exceed the needed 90-minute comedy mark?Mercifully, virtually no one saw this. Could this be a sign equivalent to World Peace? Could people finally saying NO to Sandler? I hope. Wishing he would retire since he's pressed snooze on his fifteen minutes 27 times is probably like requesting the Circle K clerk to give you the winning numbers when you buy a Powerball ticket.But, here's to hoping.",That's My Boy

18,Robert_duder,I'm beginning to wonder if Adam Sandler has anything left,1,14 October 2012,"I am certain that this review will receive all kinds of hate. Why? Because people seem to love stupid. But then movies like this one aren't making money...in fact they are losing money...so I think I am more right than wrong. Adam Sandler was king of the comedy box office for a long time. Even his ""bad"" movies made 50 million dollar openings. But now his summer blockbusters tend to fall flat with movie goers (Jack and Jill and now this.) I didn't think a Sandler movie could get much worse than Jack and Jill...I was wrong. That's My Boy is literally the biggest, most immature excuse to use naughty words and talk about sex I have ever seen. It is reduced to utter garbage by sheer childish humour with no story and disgusting jokes that boils this down to being complete garbage. I think the film was probably created strictly on the basis that people always say Andy Samberg looks like Sandler. Then they sat around saying bad words and laughing at their own stupidity. It was just painful to watch. Shock humour rarely works. You can yell out body parts all you want, that doesn't make it funny to anyone with even a quarter of a brain or someone older than 5.I don't doubt Adam Sandler's abilities. He is a talented comedian, producer, and actor. He has proved his ability in movies like Punch Drunk Love, Click, Spanglish, and even his more silly comedies like Big Daddy or the hilarious Wedding Singer. But is just plain reducing himself to nothing in this. And enough with the stupid voice already. I don't know why he thinks talking like that is funny but its not. It's stupid. Andy Samberg is brought down by this film. I don't think he could ever carry his own movie anyways but he just looks like he's fighting to perform in one of the worst things ever written. Leighton Meester who I like a lot is actually probably one of the highlights of the film as the uptight rich fiancé of Samberg (like that would ever happen.) But eventually she too is reduced to spewing obscenities and sex terms in order to be funny. Milo Ventimiglia is just awful as a stupid, pumped up goon that they use to further the weak story. He should be ashamed of this. The supporting cast might be the only saving grace for this. A cameo from Vanilla Ice is actually almost amusing and performances by Blake Clark and Tony Orlando are welcomed but hardly used. Other supporting members from the SNL alumni catalogue are awful, annoying and ridiculous.Basically everyone involved in this should be ashamed and anyone who found this even remote amusing needs their head examined. I know to each their own when it comes to movies but this was bad...really bad. I thought after seeing The Dictator recently that comedies couldn't get worse but this was worse. Director Sean Anders should stick to writing because he has actually written some half decent comedies but I can't even blame him because the script for this just had to be awful. I only blame him for even taking the job. Basically, you'll see this if you like Sandler or think you're in for a gross out comedy but I won't recommend it to anyone...ever. This is Sandler's swan song because you'd have to do an awful lot of convincing to get me to pay for a Sandler movie again for a very long time. 1/10",That's My Boy
19,MLDinTN,incest and statutory rape are not that funny,2,10 February 2013,"I'm not sure what the writers were thinking when they came up with this script; but it is disgusting. This is supposed to be a comedy centered around an adult teacher copulating with her teen student. It's disgusting not to mention illegal, and she does go to prison over it. What I didn't like is how the boy, Donny, is celebrated by the whole school when caught with his teacher. Out of this comes a child, Han AKA Todd. Donny gets famous because of it but blows it all. Now it's 30 years later and his kid has nothing to do with him and owes nearly 50,000 in back taxes. So he comes up with a scheme to get money by having a reunion with his kid and the teacher televised.So Donny finds, Todd, whom happens to be getting married that weekend. Most of the movie is Donny acting inappropriate while trying to get in his son's good graces. Then at the end is when the other disgusting part of this movie is revealed and I'll just say it involves incest. It's gross, not funny.FINAL VERDICT: This was trash; I don't recommend it for anyone.",That's My Boy
20,g-bodyl,Not As Bad As People Make This Seem!,8,7 January 2014,"Adam Sandler's latest vehicle, That's My Boy, happens to be way better than I expected. After reading such awful reviews and coming off the very bad Jack and Jill, I was expecting lots of dreck. But entering into R-rated foray, Sandler does relatively well with the new material he was given. Sure this movie seems to be mean-spirited and crude, but I took it as a good sign that I was laughing for the duration of the film.Sean Ander's film is about a former high school student who knocked up his sexy teacher. As a result, he is gifted with a son(named Han Solo!) Many years later after the father, Donny and his son stopped talking, Donny attempts to make up with his son in many hilarious manners.For a film like this, the acting is relatively good. Adam Sandler is certainly better than his last film, Jack and Jill. Andy Samberg, who can be a comic genius, does pretty good. There are some surprising but pretty funny cameos by Susan Sarandon and James Caan.Overall, this is a funny film despite much vulgar and mostly tasteless jokes. Maybe it's because I had such low expectations and was expecting awful things, but I was pleasantly surprised. There were some unfunny moments at points(looking at you Vanilla Ice!), but I laughed during most of the film. I can't believe people are hating on this film as much as they are, but I enjoyed it. I rate this film 8/10.",That's My Boy

Suddenly, at a detention, she turned the tables on the lad, Mary Kay Latourneau style. The two began an indecent fling until they were caught ""in the act"" backstage at a school assembly. Teach was sent to prison for 30 years but not before she delivered Donnie's child. This son, Han Solo Burger (Andy Samberg) was parented so badly by his juvenile dad that he left the house when he turned 18. Meanwhile, Donnie burned through all of the millions he acquired from interviews and reality shows until he, at present, lives in a dive and drinks too much beer. Unfortunately, he also owes the IRS nearly 50 thou. How can he save himself from prison? Well, a television sleazebag producer says that if Donnie can find his son and head to the prison for a Mother, Father and Child reunion that will be captured on film, he will give Donnie the tax money. By chance, Donnie does find out that his brilliant, hedge fund investment son has changed his name to Todd and is about to marry a Boston blueblood, Jamie (Leighton Meister) in a few days. You guessed it! Donnie shows up at the mansion, claims he is a long lost friend of Todd's and tries to work up the courage to spring the news on his son in private. Naturally, Todd is aghast at this terrible turn of events but he gradually loosens up and permits his dad to hang around, incognito. Will anything good come from this? This is a flick that should make Sandler's fans happy and Samberg's, too. BUT, while it is very funny, it is also the poster child of vulgarity, bad taste, and offensive humor. Those with any serious decency qualms will stay away. The cast is great, with Vanilla Ice, Tony Orlando, and others complimenting the main characters well. Also, the Boston setting is quite lovely, especially the rich haunts, while the script has a ""go for broke"" comedy that makes one laugh in spite of being subjected to the the lowest forms of humor.

While this is not among Sandler's best and I will probably never watch this again I do have to say that this was much funnier then I was expecting. As a warning though this is not a typical family style Sandler movie, there is a ton of swearing and nudity and sex humor that the R rating is very justified. Mixed in with the typical Sandler movie cameos are some very raunchy but funny scenes that as gross as they are you can't help but laugh at, at least I couldn't. For fans of Sandler this will be hilarious, for those that just like comedies this may be a little much but still funny.

I sort of get the exhibitionist thing and getting caught, but only for adults. The idea that the entire school would stand up and cheer? Including the younger children who don't understand what is happening? or the girls doing the same? Perverse and demented.I get the copying of real life, the teacher who banged her student, got pregnant, then married him after he turned 18, then had another child with him.

33,rgkarim,Not So Nice Nice Baby,5,16 June 2012,"What do you think of when you see Adam Sandler? For me it is a funny actor who hit his prime early on with movies like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore and has had a few cute movies from time to time. Unfortunately his latest movie titled That's My Boy, is not one of those movies and instead takes a turn down the more vulgar comedy route. Was it good? To save you some time, not really, but for more informative details read on about this latest addition to the ""comedy"" family.As I'm sure you have all seen, That's My Boy tells the story about Donny (Sandler) who at the hormone crazy age of thirteen decides to have sex with his teacher. This act of statutory rape somehow boosts Donny's reputation and makes him a child super star loved by millions. Thirty years later, Donny is on the fringe of going to jail for back taxes and decides to use his soon to be rich son ""Todd""( Andy Samberg) to bail him out. After not seeing each other for almost ten years, Donny decides to visit his son days before his wedding to attempt to reconnect with his illegitimate offspring, while also keeping his eyes on the prize.If you think the trailer looked good, then I'll let you know now this movie is for once summed up in the trailer. That's My Boy is a party flick with lots of booze, boobs, and sexual innuendos that are sure to make the party hard fans laugh and cheer in delight. From square one the movie shows many details I cared not to see, such as inappropriate sex scenes, various gestures of self-pleasure, and even a few scenes of disposed sexual tools that were more than I needed to see. When Sandler and the bunch aren't getting their freak on, they are filling their time with excessive alcohol consumption. Yes, just like the song that promoted the movie, there is seldom a scene where Sandler is not holding a beer. In fact, he actually has quite a soiree of tools to open the bottles, some of which are amusing, and some that are rather stupid. You might think that this would lead to some humorous antics, but instead it's filled with rather childish actions that are more annoying than fun. A few of the scenes have their moments, such as a convenient store owner joining in a drunken rant and a few humorous catches during the baseball scene, but that's it. Now you might think that the dialog could help make up for the lack of situational comedy, well you would be mistaken. Like the plot, the various jokes and lines are incredibly shallow that are mainly filled with sleazy innuendos and in some cases pretty racist humor. I'm sure it's no surprise as well to hear that the major word used in this movie is the F word that seems to be the key to humor these days. Perhaps what weakens the dialog even more is the delivery of it. Sandler uses that throaty/horse scream he has made famous, while Samberg brings that teenage whine that becomes rather annoying. However, the writers did have a few well timed jokes and anecdotes that had me and the audience laughing, but they are few and far in between, most of which are not in the trailers. Aside from that though, there is nothing really special or entertaining to report on. Surely there must be something good to this movie I can report on. Perhaps the biggest strength of the movie is the soundtrack. Throughout the film there were some fitting tunes that had me tapping my toes, especially the two eighty hits that were very catchy for me. When the audience isn't being blasted with music, there are some rather heartfelt moments between father and son. Although cliché, these reuniting scenes pulled at my heartstrings and helped bring back memories of times with my dad. The last thing I can say was a positive was the camera work was pretty well done. While this may not be what you are looking for in a movie, the camera team did a nice job picking the right angle to make the limited humor as funny as it could be. Unfortunately it was not enough to save the movie. On a final note, those looking to check out some beautiful ladies may want to give this movie a shot. There are countless moments where one will see a very pretty blonde or brunette spinning, twirling, soaking in a hot tub, or just prancing around in tight shorts. That's My Boy is definitely one of the more vulgar movies I've seen this summer. People who are fans of movies like The Hangover, Project X, or the latest Harold and Kumar should give this film a try. However, if you are looking for a film with more balance, better humor, and less annoyance I urge you to avoid it. If you're a Sandler fan however, I understand if you have to go see this film, but I encourage you to wait until Netflix or Redbox has it available. Here are my scores: Comedy: 6.0 Movie Overall: 4.5-5.0",That's My Boy
34,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,That's My Bowel Movement,1,29 October 2020,"What's the audience for Adam Sandler movies at this point?
I mean, he was tolerable on SNL, but that was in 2-minute segments. And viewers could turn the channel when he'd trot out his baby talk or brain damae shtick.
But stuck in a theatre watching him act brain damaged for 90 minutes? Why would anyone subject themselves to that?
Sandler is capable of making funny comedies. I love The Wedding Singer and Happy Gilmour and Anger Management. And he can make mature movies like Punch Drunk Love and Spanglish.
But good lord when he goes low he scraps the gutter until it's clean of all living matter.
And while I'm thinking of it, I'm starting to realize that Will Forte is quickly climbing my list of Bad Movie Indicators, and may one day challenge Will Patton and Oliver Platt.",That's My Boy
35,Kamurai25,"Todd Peterson: I'm Okay, I Promise",4,13 July 2020,"Bad watch, won't watch again, and can't recommend.I really couldn't believe I didn't know about this movie before. I've organized a series of Happy Madison watch parties before, but after watching it, then I know why I didn't know about ti.Now I'm not a big fan of either Adam Sandler (though he has movies I enjoy, repeatedly) or Andy Samberg (I think he's better at creating comedy than performing it), but this was really like he was at a party with a big head and bet someone that he could make anything funny.So, of course, the movie starts with a statutory rape case. Now, MAYBE, he was making a message out of the ridiculous double standard about whether or not the minor is male or female, but the seriousness of the situation (though flatly stated in the movie) is not conveyed properly.Since most of the movie is about sex, and possibly alcoholism (again, the point isn't made very clearly), there is a fair amount of sex positive messaging throughout the movie, being inclusive of maturity, skin color, body type, handicapability, and open expression. However because there is a key component of adultery and incest used for humiliation and comedy, it throws any of the previous sex situations into comedy bits, which means not only the message to laugh at people in a messed up sex situation because of incest / adultery (the morality between the two directly addressed), but also statutory rape, the elderly having sex, people expressing thoughts about sex, sex with big black women as things that are comical and that you shouldn't do and should repress. And if that's a thing, then fine, but don't make a movie about it and make me think about it, and then call it a comedy.All of that is on top of the usual thing where everyone wants to bang Adam Sandler, and then he's an alcoholic on top of it, and then we add the litany of things that happen to Andy Samberg's character, to include child neglect, and probably abuse. And it's great for a family to rectify and come to terms together, but to make a movie where they bond over Donny's awful social magic is a weird message on which to make a production.Look, I like being able to turn off my brain and watch some silly movie, and I was ready for it, but then I go thrown into a someone else's debate about if it's okay for a high schooler to knock up his teacher, and it kind of ruined it for me.",That's My Boy
36,saadgkhan,Do I have say what it was...? Huh..!,1,2 October 2012,"That's my Boy – TRASH IT (D) Reviewing an Adam Sandler's movie these days is like slamming your head on the wall again and again. He is Adam Sandler in all of his movies these days. Few years back he use to do something different with his characters but ever since he has crossed 40s he is just interesting in producing trashy comedies with no sense at all. That's My Boy's concept is funny but the direction, humor and screenplay is so gross and tedious that even sweet actors like Leighton Meester, Milo Ventimiglia and Andy Samberg are doing things you won't ever think imagining them. In the end, its gross and one of the worst movies Adam Sandler ever made in his entire life sadly these are a lot these days.",That's My Boy
37,rivertam26,What you'd expect,5,8 January 2013,"I wasn't expecting much from this film. The trailers didn't seem to original or funny at all. And honestly when was the last time Sandler made a funny movie or even a good one at that. Well I was right on target. That's my Boy is another in a long line of overly mediocre cinematic duds from him and his troupe. The thing is we've seen this film before from it's generic gross out bathroom humor to the overly clichéd story of an immature father trying to reconnect with his mature son. Sure maybe the angle of a young boy who has sex with his teacher and is given ward of his lovechild hasn't been done. Resulting in a lot of bad parenting decisions that that aren't very funny. Not to say it's all bad. There are maybe one or two laughs, Leighton Meester looks gorgeous as does Milo Ventimglia (can this guy always be naked please), a few semi funny cameos from talented actors slumming it, James Caan and Susan Sarandon and the adorably dorky Andy Samberg isn't too much of a bother not like the ghastly turn from Adam Sandberg and the rest of his company. It's really a shame that Samberg still hasn't found the right vehicle he's a talented guy and I wish he'd get better material. All in all it's pretty much what you'd expect. Little to no laughs, sordidly gross jokes and a lot of forced humor. Now don't get me wrong I love a dirty joke just like the next guy. I laughed hysterically through The Hangover, Wedding Crashers and There's something about Mary as well as so many others. But those films had something this one doesn't they were good.",That's My Boy

39,blott2319-1,Sorry excuse for a film. Everyone involved should be embarrassed.,1,31 August 2020,"At this point I feel like I need to recant any statements I once made in defense of Adam Sandler, in fact I wonder if I need to burn some DVDs of his films in repentance for watching this nightmare. That's My Boy validates every criticism anyone has ever made about Adam Sandler, and it takes everything further because it was allowed an R rating. This movie delights in offending everyone, taking extra time to mock the elderly, overweight people, and anyone who actually experiences some form of shame. Andy Samberg plays the straight-laced man who is trying to be a normal, well-behaved human being. But the moral of the movie is that he needs to loosen up and be more like his psychotic father whose brain is frozen in adolescence. It's absolutely disturbing that the film asks us to root for this abusive man who should never have been given any custody to his child, and should have instead been sent into counseling for a long time in order to recover.""Recover from what?"" you may ask. Well, you see, the premise of this movie is based around the fact that when Sandler's character was an adolescent boy, he was raped by his teacher (resulting in the birth of this child.) Now you'd think this would be a good way of creating sympathy for a man-child who never figured out how to grow up, but instead That's My Boy basically says that it's cool because the teacher was a hot woman and so her students should want to sleep with her. The media even makes a celebrity out of this young man, and people are constantly telling him that they would have slept with their school teachers if they had a chance, too. It's an embarrassing concept and if you flip the genders I can't even imagine this movie getting the greenlight. Anyways, because of the way he is lauded for this situation and forced into being a father at the age of 18, he never learns to be a decent human being (or anything that resembles a grown-up.)Part of why I found That's My Boy so upsetting is that I knew, no matter how despicable they made Sandler's character, the movie was going to expect me to see him as a good guy by the end. It's kind of astounding the lengths they must go to in order to create a villain that is worse than him. There is virtually no offensive stone left unturned in That's My Boy. The film relishes every opportunity it has to do something rude or disgusting. From gross bodily functions, to unpleasant sexual relationships, this movie has it all. I would almost be less embarrassed if I was caught watching porn for 2 hours than watching this monstrosity of a film. There was one line delivery from Andy Samberg that made me chuckle and I was appalled at myself for granting this movie even a slight reward for its lazy and grotesque attempts at humor. It's a rarity for me to find a movie that I would say would be better off never being made, but I think that's the case with That's My Boy. I would rather the people involved in the making of the film go begging for change on the street than be rewarded for playing any role in the creation of this pile of garbage.",That's My Boy
40,natashabowiepinky,Let's Go Round Again...,5,28 May 2013,"This is the first Adam Sandler film I've seen in years, so how has his style changed since Happy Gilmore, his first big hit? The answer is: Not much at all, apart from he seems rather preoccupied with sex.Yep, almost every single gag here is related to copulation in all it's guises, including a few you probably haven't heard of. After about the billionth masturbation joke, you become desensitized to the whole shebang... But it does show a sad poverty of imagination that they couldn't come up with something slightly more clever. Maybe he needs therapy to rid himself of these dirty thoughts...There's also lots of good-natured mocking of former rapper, now 'Reality TV Star' Vanilla Ice (Doesn't THAT tell you plenty). I would tell you I feel sorry for the aggro this fella has put up with over the years, but the truth he's earned rather well from all the public vitriol, so... Not really.If the Wedding Singer was Sandler's ode to the to the 80's, That's My Boy completes the cycle. Apart from putting Mr Robert Matthew Van Winkle (Look it up) in a starring role, we also have references to New Kids On The Block, ALF, Duran Duran and various other culture defining milestones. It all feels a bit lazy, but since when has Sandler been known for subtlety?One thing in his favour is his ability to make even the most unpalatable oddball likable... and believe me, you're not short of them in this film. They sort of stand around, sipping on their beers, reacting to events and dishing out one-liners. Most of them don't have a purpose other then to stand there and big-up Sandler's character... Are some friends of his in real life? I suppose that would save on the extras fee...To wrap it up all then... No, it's not brilliantly written, it ain't a comedy masterpiece and everything gets rather tiresome by the end, but there is a strange charm to a movie which is so graphic and yet so sweet at the same time. Of course, you could always watch something funnier... 5/10",That's My Boy
41,bellino-angelo2014,Not among Sandler's best but could have been better,4,29 April 2021,"I have liked most of Adam Sandler's movies (especially 50 FIRST DATES, BIG DADDY and LITTLE NICKY) and I consider him among the funniest actors of these last decades. However I have to admit that he has done some terrible movies (such as GOING OVERBOARD and JACK AND JILL) and while THAT'S MY BOY is not as bad as those two, it still wasn't as good as most of his movies.The film begins in our lead Donny's years in high school. He was turned on by a teacher (Eva Amurri Martino) and even made love to her (and she is sentenced to prison). This moment was very embarassing for me, and I cringed a lot. Donny has then lived greatly, with the reputation of having slept with his teacher. In the present day an adult Donny (Adam Sandler) is a loser on his 40s who is on the verge of going to prison if he doesn't pay taxes but he soon finds out that his son (a likeable and underused Andy Samberg) who hasn't seen him for a long time, is getting married to a gorgeous blonde lady. Donny decides to go to his son's mansion on the eve of his wedding for crashing the party, but also for rebonding again with his son since he has been an absentee father and obtaining the money needed for avoiding prison time (and he will also manage briefly to reunite his son with her mother still in jail). He will succedd in all but not without making also one disaster after another.The idea for the plot was good and it could have been a greater movie. However I bet the writers must have been very lazy as it looked like it was picked from a bad TV movie of the 1990s. Lots of embarassing moments (such as the one in the beginning that led to Donny becoming an underage dad, lots of vomiting, fart jokes galore, an incestuous love story and lots of swearing) that at times turned me off VERY much as they are subjects on which there is nothing to laugh about and so they come as crude and offensive, zero father-dad chemistry (and I have to admit it, Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg don't even look alike) and even pointless cameos by respected actors such as James Caan and Susan Sarandon... all these elements just sum up that the movie must have been cut and pasted various times before the end result.However I liked some things about the movie; the soundtrack that is full of well known songs from the 1980s that fit like a glove the movie's situations (such as BETTE DAVIS EYES, DANCE THE NIGHT AWAY and ICE ICE BABY) and some good locations all through Massachussets, and also the nice cinematography. Sandler here was mixed, at times good and at times bad. I really hoped that all through the movie he was good. And it's quite fitting that in the beginning Donny's teacher is played by Eva Amurri Martino and in the prison scene halfway in the movie she is played by Susan Sarandon (Eva's real life mother).In substance, not among Adam Sandler's worst movies and not even among his best either, but falls somewhere in the middle. I know that there are many Sandler detractors who automatically hate all his movies made after JACK AND JILL as it has become quite fashionable in recent years, but when he has a good script and a good director, he'll still give a great performance. Before going to this movie I didn't read the reviews as I wanted to have only my personal view with this movie without any prejudices during the viewing, and I think it worked.Overall, I think that given a good re-writing, it could have been a much better movie than what it is actually. Not a complete disaster, but still with lots of faults.",That's My Boy
42,AngelHonesty,Adam Sandler is Back!,8,6 October 2021,"Finally, a newer Adam Sandler film that feels like the old Adam Sandler movies. I loved his earlier films as he was just down right silly and funny, he brings that silly funny Sandler to this movie. I had no expectations when I saw this film and was expecting it to be bad, but soon became surprised with how much I liked the movie. The plot was different from most comedies and they kept throwing curveballs that I did not expect during the film, it felt like it defied most of the cliche's. I found the movie genuinely funny. This is defiantly an R rated comedy through and through from nudity to swearing and extreme crude humour, but most of it was tasteful and added largely to the comedic affect.",That's My Boy

But, both films are certainly better than the last 3 or 4 efforts from these two actors.I wouldn't say this is laugh out loud funny stuff, but it's pretty entertaining throughout.That's My Boy suffers from the usual predictability issues with these types of films, but the middle of the film gains steam when the boys go out for the bachelor party. That's when the film is at it's best - when Sandler and Samberg reconnect.There were over-the-top moments, but nothing too extreme like what you might find from some Schneider/and/or/Sandler films. A little restraint and even pacing goes a long way here.I can give it a marginal recommendation. In the top half of the Happy Gilmore productions.",That's My Boy
44,cynthiahost,A mix bag but still entertaining,8,27 February 2013,"Some of the jokes in the film were a bit off timing.But before I saw it on Starz on demand,a year earlier. I got a petition from one of those political correct censorship groups wanting me to sigh a petition to let Sony company ,that distributed the film,to let them know that they should not glamorize rape.This was nothing but attempted at censorship in the name of the rape victim.I blasted them back to say that there is a difference between fantasy and realty.That bad things are not a reflection of art but that art is a reflection of what was going on in the real world good and bad.I got a message back from them.They stated .""You never been a victim of rape,I feel sorry for you.I send them back a message that if a movie offends you don't see it.Well I have been a victim of rape.But I over cam it in a month.I was strong minded.Violence in films still did not offend me.But this movie did not glamorize rape.It Put down child molesters,with humor.They deserve it.Perverts!I believe Adam Sander chose the subject for humor in criticizing the real teacher in real life for taking advantage of the little kid,in real life.All of a sudden,after he grew up and she was let out of prison.The real man was still in love with the teacher.This probably angered him.Even feared this could happen to his child.So he made a movie to show what happens when a child from a f-! up family, is molested by a teacher , how screwed up his mind is going to be as an adult.He was criticizing perverts in his film through humor.He also made fun of marriage,the military and the wealthy too.This was almost like a modern day Marx brother film.He also criticize incest too.Besides Andy Samberg,playing the son,of the victim played by Adam Sandler.We have the molesting teacher bitch!played realistically by Eva Amurri Martino.Lieghton Meesters as the bitch Fiancé,who suppose to marry Sammy,but is secretly has an incestuous affair with her own brother a Warped military man, played by Millo Ventimiglia. Round off The cast is Tony Orlando as the dysfunctional wealthy Business Man Father of the incestuous daughter.Vanilla Ice plays Adams best friend,who's mad at Sander for screwing Ice's mother.Legendary actress of low budget westerns of the thirty and forties Peggy Stewart,playing Grandma Delores,whom Adams has a perverse hots for .His other friends includes a Fat black stripper ,played by Luenel ,who owns the club.Fellow stripper played by Ciara.

45,Christian_Dimartino,"You won't believe your eyes and in this case, that's not a good thing.",1,16 October 2012,"After the successful year that Adam Sandler had at the Razzie's last year, with both of his flicks Just Go With It and Jack and Jill(a clean sweep, winning almost everything it was nominated for), you'd think that he'd have some sort of awakening. Matthew Mconaghay and Ben Affleck have had this awakening. But it seems like Sandler hasn't, and probably isn't any time soon.Sandler's new movie is called That's My Boy, and it came out on DVD today. I will say that it has a few ""ha"" moments, but that is really as far as it goes. It's a two hour comedy that is at times disturbing, disgusting, painful, cliché, dumb, and simply, just two long. A comedy that runs on two hours is sure to run out of steam, but really, That's My Boy hits the ground running.So, here's the premise, and get ready, it's something: When Donny Berger(Sandler) was a teen, he had sex with his teacher (played by Susan Surandon's actual daughter, who's character grows up to be Susan Surandon). She got knocked up, sent to jail, and for the next few years, Donny had to take care of their son, Han Solo(who grows up to be Andy Samberg).It's now present day, and Han has changed his name and life to get away from Donny, who is now a broke drunk womanizer. In an attempt to get some money, Donny goes up to visit Han, who is getting married, and pretty much wrecks his life, but everyone else likes him. With the exception of Han's fiancé(Leighton Meester).I've already told you what doesn't work about it. That is pretty much all that needs to be said. I enjoyed the appearance of Vanilla Ice of all people, and of course Susan Surandon is always a delight. But never before have I seen a movie quite like this, and i'm not so sure that that is a good thing this time.Sandler and Samburg can work well with the right screenplay. This is the wrong screenplay. Never before has a movie touched upon the topic of both incest and underage sex in one movie, and that definitely shouldn't show up in a comedy. And if it is in a comedy, that comedy shouldn't have Adam Sandler. It's almost as bad as Jack and Jill, you might even cringe more. Skip it.C-",That's My Boy

She has a baby, goes to jail, and Sandler's Donny becomes a media sensation seen through the opening credits. The real story begins thirty years later as Donny's uptight son ""Todd,"" played by Adam Samberg a hybrid of Seth Rogan and a cartoon alligator is about to land a big promotion and marry his beautiful high-maintenance fiancé.Meanwhile Donny, in his own seedy neck of the woods, owes a bundle for taxes and will go to jail if he doesn't get fifty grand. With an offer to appear on a tabloid show, he has to maneuver his son, who he hasn't seen in years, to visit mom (the teacher) in jail for a big payoff.Dad and his boy reunite in Todd's boss's summer home before the wedding, and most of the film has the duo tricking everyone – Donny's supposedly his best friend and Todd, living a lie and having changed his name from ""Han Solo,"" just wants to be normal.With an abundance of ""toilet jokes"" that keeps pushing a ragged envelope – from masturbation to incest to everything you can possibly imagine – the plot is all but forgotten. Donny's a sloppy playboy but lacks the charm that'd make us believe any woman would fall for him while Todd remains a deer caught in headlights, never changing his ""I can't believe this is happening"" expression.And an all-night bachelor party, trying for the stuff THE HANGOVER characters would have forgotten, is full of bawdy situations completely lacking humor or purpose. Not even pop culture punchline Vanilla Ice can save the day... or night. It's in the 11th hour, when the wedding approaches and the truth of Samberg's betrothed is in question, that we begin to wonder what'll happen next.

Made by Happy Madison (Adam Sandler's production company) Sandler found a way to keep his name in the mud for making crappy movies and found a way to drag Andy along with him.This movie did have one high note though, when you thought you have seen the worst, as in incest is the most disgusting and the worst thing I can ever imagine to see on the silver screen, this movie's ending is worse than the incest plot.The movies story goes thus: While in his teens, Donny (Adam Sandler) gets to fulfill the life-long dream of many teenage boys, which is to screw the hottest teacher in class. This started bad when the whole world found out about their mess and the teacher was found to be pregnant for Donny but it got better when Donny milked the publicity for all its worth.18 years after Donny is flat broke and is about to go to jail for unpaid taxes so he decides to sell his reunion (between he, his son and his high school teacher) story for enough money to not go to jail.Adding to this twist is his son Han Solo Berger/Todd Peterson (Andy Samberg) who wants to have nothing to do with him.As lame as the plot sounds lamer is the implementation on the silver screen, directed by Sean Anders who wrote the movie She's Out Of My League (2010) comes a movie that makes you wonder if the makers actually watched it before releasing it.Adam Sandler's movie before this was Jack and Jill which is unique for winning 5 Razzies which include Worst Actor, Worst Actress, Worst Screenplay and others. I think this movie may topple Jack and Jill in the Razzies.Save your money.",That's My Boy

54,nickmesafilms,"That's My Boy (2012) - What's Up!!! (Oh God, Now I'm Doing It!)",4,26 June 2012,"Adam Sandler has been starring in a couple of ""god-awful"" films these days, from ""Just Go With It"" to ""Jack and Jill"". Now, returning to the classic drunk, absent-minded, and squeaky-voiced man-child role, which has made him famous in the first place, Adam Sandler now stars in ""That's My Boy"", which although is better than the other crappy movies in Sandler's career, is still a disgustingly obnoxious, and incredibly insulting film that will leave audiences cringing...out of disbelief. In the prologue, a young Donny Berger has had sex with his school teacher, which gets her pregnant, and she's then sentenced to 30 years in prison. Wait, was this supposed to be funny, or am I just going crazy? Donny has then lived a successful life, being famous for having knocked up his teacher. Now, 28 years later, an older Donny, played by Adam Sandler, is a 40-something loser who's in jeopardy of going to prison, after failing to pay taxes. Can this plot get any more unrealistic? He then finds out that his impregnated son, played by the likable and funny Andy Samberg, whom he hasn't seen in a long time, after leaving his child for a father, he's now getting married to a very gorgeous Leighton Meester. Now, Donny decides to crash the party, to not only be reunited with his long-lost son, but also using him to get the money to get him out of prison, by having is son reunited with his still-imprisoned mother for a reality TV special. Now, they lead their way into idiotic and chaotic ""father-son"" adventures. Weak! Now, I think Adam Sandler is a very funny comedian, and a great dramatic actor. It just upsets me that he keeps being a part of one mistake after another. But I don't really blame Sandler that this movie was bad, so I'm not mad at him. By the way, Sandler and Samberg had ""zero"" father-son chemistry. Yes, they look alike, I get it. But they don't have any chemistry at all, and I'm not even sure if it was good or bad. Besides Samberg and Meester, the rest of the cast just includes a variety of random cameo appearances from celebrities such as Will Forte, Tony Orlando, James Caan, Vanilla Ice and Todd Bridges as themselves, and a cameo from a legendary actress that doesn't deserve to be mentioned in this review! Either way, everybody looks quite embarrassed to be here. This movie tries it's best to go beyond the R-rating, from jokes involving urine, vomit, and semen, and characters that insult the obese and the elderly, and not to mention, that almost every female character is a stripper, prostitute, or an insane addict. But not all that is actually funny. In other R-rated raunchy comedies, some of them know how to take their R-rating more seriously, by going down a more clever road, and still try to be funny. ""That's My Boy"" is just not that type of comedy. But I still laughed out loud, a couple of times, during the movie at times. At least it's better than not laughing at all. There were some funny moments, and Adam Sandler did make a better movie than ""Jack and Jill"", but overall, this was just a dumb, annoying, unrealistic, and unbelievable movie that really tries it's best to go beyond the odds of a comedy....way too much! I suppose that maybe somebody looking for a fun time at the movies, will find something to enjoy in ""That's My Boy""...well, if they're drunk! ""That's My Boy"", in my review, ""obnoxiously insulting, but not technically awful"".",That's My Boy

57,rollernerd,Wassuuupppp,7,19 December 2020,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the wicker comedy That's My Boy (2012) starring both the Sandman and Samberg as the odd father and son duo. The flick starts in the year 1984 where 15-year-old rebellious wild child Donny Berger asks his hot teacher Ms McGarricle to a Van Halen concert. He gets into detention and a teacher student affair happens. This gets caught out many months later and Ms. McGarricle is put on trial for statutory rape and cops a 30 years in jail as the affair resulted in a pregnancy. 30 odd years later, Han Solo Berger played by Brooklyn 99 fav Andy Samberg is estranged with his old man by creating a new life. That is until his old man rocks up unexpectedly on the eve of his wedding day, turning the long overdue reunion into a tailspin...but there is a secret agenda as to why Donny wants desperately to reconnect with kid. This cracked me up when I first watched this flick in the cinemas and once again it cracked me up again. Super crude but funny as fudge jokes, the formula is simple and every character has their moment including Vanilla Ice man himself. From the giant bachelor party which ended up with a mannequin getting barf and jizzed on to heaps of 80s callbacks and the New Kids On the Block tattoo on the back and even Susan Sarandon and her daughter playing the same character but of course at different ages. Plus, you have a great heartfelt moment between a father and his son...this movie has it all. Great chemistry between Sandler and Samberg. Sandman's character of Donny is pure genius. Overall a funny flick if you have an open mind and like your SNL sketches regardless of the topic, 7/10",That's My Boy
58,Chris_Pandolfi,How Do We Make Statutory Rape Funny?,1,15 June 2012,"Why do I go into Adam Sandler movies with the hope that each new offering will be the one that redeems him as an actor, a writer, and a producer? You'd think I was a masochist or delusional or both; although I've willingly subjected myself some truly abominable projects of his in the past two years alone, including ""The House Bunny,"" ""Grown Ups,"" ""Just Go With It,"" ""Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,"" ""Zookeeper,"" and ""Jack and Jill,"" I've also seen him expand his horizons towards more mature, more compelling endeavors like ""Punch Drunk Love,"" ""Reign Over Me,"" and ""Funny People."" Hell, he even won me over with ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan,"" which certainly is of the same raunchy, tasteless caliber as most of his other films. He has surprised me before, and I live in hope that he will surprise me again.I had to keep telling myself that as I sat through his newest film, ""That's My Boy,"" in which Sandler doubles as the star and the producer. For him, and for everyone involved, this is a pathetic new low, representative of nothing apart from a desperate plea for attention. With its bizarre blending of disgusting toilet humor and heartfelt moments of drama, it exemplifies a complete lack of understanding on the filmmakers' part about who the movie was intended for. When you include a scene in which an obese stripper eats an omelet while using her legs to hang upside down from a pole, there is no conceivable way to believably work in a sentimental father/son bonding story. There is only one kind of audience this movie is made for, and I'm fairly certain it will respond more to the stripper than to any depiction of family drama.The story begins in 1984, when a boy barely in his teens has sex with his hot female teacher, who quite willingly came onto him. They're eventually caught having sex in the school assembly room while, wouldn't you know it, a full assembly is in progress. The intent is obvious: To make light of recent news stories about female teachers seducing their male students. But hold on a minute. Imagine if the foundation of the plot had been an adult male teacher seducing his female student. Would we consider that funny? Of course not. We would rightfully think of the girl as a victim. So then why is it funny when the gender roles are reversed? Why is the boy a stud instead of a victim? In either case, this is statutory rape we're talking about, and the last time I checked, this was not suitable material for a comedy. What we have here is not only a glaring double standard but also a warped sense of humor. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves.The affair resulted in the teacher's pregnancy, which in turn resulted in a thirty-year prison sentence for her. As for the teen, he was required to become a single parent to his child, a son he named Han Solo, until his eighteenth birthday. Initially, it turned out pretty good for him; he won the respect of his classmates, he became a teenage celebrity, and a TV movie based on his life was produced. But then we flash forward to the present day, at which point we find that the teen has grown into a slovenly, foulmouthed, beer-chugging slacker. His name is Donny Berger (Sandler), and if he wants to avoid a three-year prison sentence, he must pay the IRS $43,000 in back taxes. He strikes a deal with a sleazy talk show host: If he can film Han Solo reuniting with his mother (Susan Sarandon) in prison, he will pay Donny $50,000.There's only one problem. Donny's now adult son (Andy Samberg), who has legally changed his name to Todd Peterson, hasn't spoken to his father in years and has made every effort to hide his past. Now a hopelessly neurotic diabetic, he has become a successful businessman and is engaged to woman named Christina (Leighton Meester). Donny tracks Todd down through a candid publicity photo, reenters his life the weekend before his wedding, and poses as Todd's oldest best friend. Even though he has the social skills of a drunk on a bender, Donny is inexplicably able to win over all of Christina's family. This would include her rather elderly grandmother (Peggy Stewart); not only does Donny masturbate to side-by-side photos of her as a young woman and as she appears today, he will also have sex with her. Yes, she initiates it. And yes, he willingly accepts her advances.As the plot lumbers ahead, we see James Caan as a priest with a thick Irish brogue and a rotten temper, bear witness to a disgusting and completely unnecessary plot twist involving Christina and her testosterone-pumped military brother (Milo Ventimiglia), and endure a few visual jokes involving vomit and semen. We also watch as Vanilla Ice plays a parody of himself as Donny's best friend, made all the more unbearable by the fact that he's actually a pretty decent actor. All the while, we're expected not to laugh at the phony drama of Donny and Todd working towards repairing their relationship. The people behind ""That's My Boy"" make countless mistakes, but the biggest was to believe that this subplot could in any way, shape, or form be taken seriously. I take that back. The biggest mistake was making the film in the first place.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",That's My Boy
59,cinephile-27690,It would have been better if it were less raunchy.,7,25 April 2019,"I didn't hate it, but I don't think I'd really see it again.I happen to like Adam Sandler movies. They're not Citizen Kane, but I have fun with them if I'm in the proper mood. That said, I feel this is kind of a let down.That's My Boy is about a preteen who becomes a father after having sex with his teacher. This actually makes him famous, and his son that they create follows the dreadful shadow of being the result of the pregnancy.When the boy and teacher are caught having sex, the students cheer, which I found annoying. Teacher-turned-pedophiles can actually get higher sentences than murderers, and such cases should not be cheered for, let alone be used for comedy!Near the end, when the son is about to be married, Adam Sandler's character catches the fiance having intercourse with HIS SISTER! And while everyone praises Sandler for banging his teacher, everyone screams and faints at the news of INCEST!The profanity is also overdone, but that's kind of a nick pick for this movie, honestly.The other parts are a lot of fun, but I don't need to see this movie again. The praised pedophila and the incest aspect is enough to keep me away from now on. At least it's not Grown Ups 2!",That's My Boy
60,D_Burke,And Now The Excited Southerner Makes a Stupid Movie,2,17 May 2012,"A dumb lead character in a comedy can result in a funny movie. However, if every other character is dumb enough to be even slightly charmed by a vulgar, drunken, slovenly 41-year-old man with an annoying voice who looks like a washed-up Guns N Roses roadie, plausibility flies right out the window, and so do the laughs.""That's My Boy"" has more promise in its male leads than it ultimately delivers. After all, Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg have a lot more in common besides initials. They're both Saturday Night Live alumni who made names for themselves by writing original, funny songs. They also both practically single-handedly revitalized SNL's popularity by attracting a younger following.You would think a movie starring both of them would showcase each of their talents. Unfortunately, in ""That's My Boy"", Samberg was restricted to a straight man role, while Sandler routinely eats scenery with his atrocious Boston accent that sounds more Louisianan.The film's premise does not leave much room for laughs as it is. Sandler plays Donny, a native of Somerville, Massachusetts who, when he's 13 years old, has a thing for older women, particularly his teacher, Miss McGarricle (Eva Amurri Martino).When Miss McGarricle takes too much of a liking to the young Donny, they have sex, they get caught, and Miss McGarricle gets pregnant. She bears a son, but gets sentenced to 30 years in prison.In a contrived, totally unrealistic plot point that only serves as fodder for jokes later on in the film, young Donny is ordered by the court, who apparently had never heard of child care services, to raise his newborn son. Even more unrealistically, Donny becomes a celebrity, sells his life story for six figures, and blows his money away.The second part of that scenario rubbed me the wrong way already. Do you remember the name of the boy with whom 6th grade teacher Mary Kay Letorneau had sex? I don't. That boy was featured in the New York Times, but not on the cover of Teen Beat!Anyway, Donny's son Todd (Samberg) grows up to become a successful hedge fund manager, but only after moving away from Donny when he turned 18 (Again, child services anyone?). Donny, on the other hand, spends his money so irresponsibly that he ultimately owes $43,000 in back taxes.When he finds out about Todd's engagement to beautiful Jamie (Leighton Meester), Donny convinces a TV talk show host to pay him $50,000 for exclusive footage of Donny, Todd, and Todd's biological mother (still in jail) reuniting at last. Such a contrived plot point serves as the reason Donny shows up unannounced to Todd's wedding site days before the wedding.Rather than the wedding party, consisting of Jamie's family and Todd's boss Steve Spirou (Tony Orlando), being repulsed by Donny's disheveled hair, ratty clothes, vernacular that consists of the f-word spoken every third sentence, and his irritating faux Boston accent, they somehow see his charm. It's surprising, because if a guy who acted like Donny showed up at my wedding, I would call security before he even opened his mouth.Naturally, because Donny is a boy who never grew up, his shenanigans supposedly ruin Todd's plans for the perfect wedding. The usual cliché plot points happen when Donny and Todd have a falling out the night before the wedding, sentimental music borrowed from ""Full House"" reruns play during the night scenes, and the climax happens right when the bride and groom are taking their vows.I should note that there's also a plot twist involving the bride that was so out of left field that it landed in another ball park. Without giving it away, I really wish the film hadn't gone there. That twist made me cringe far more than it made me laugh.Add those hackneyed wedding movie story lines to Sandler's constantly disseminating his tired onslaught of fat jokes, penis gags, fart noises, antics revolving around elderly people having sex, and homophobic humor, and you've got ""That's My Boy"". The difference between him doing those jokes in this movie and his last movie, ""Jack and Jill"" (2011), is that here, when using an irritating voice, he doesn't cross dress.Don't get me wrong, though. I don't hate Adam Sandler. In fact, ""Happy Gilmore"" (1996), ""The Wedding Singer"" (1998), and ""The Waterboy"" (1998) still make me laugh both because the jokes are fresher and funnier, and because Sandler's character in those movies had heart. Here, he plays a buffoon so obnoxious you want to punch him in the face.The other jokes not spoken by Sandler, but by other characters, fall flat 9 times out of 10. New York Jets coach Rex Ryan plays Sandler's financial adviser who happens to be a huge New England Patriots fan. Get it? Because he's actually the Jets coach in real life? Hardy har har!Among the many cameos in this film, the only one that's genuinely funny is Vanilla Ice, who plays himself. He surprisingly does such a good job parodying his image from 20 years ago that Happy Madison Productions should actually give him his own movie.However, Vanilla Ice's role in the movie reflected the problem of ""That's My Boy"": when Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg are in a movie together, the funniest person should not be Vanilla Ice! Sandler really needs to reevaluate his on-screen humor and his career. While his movies are making money, he's gradually losing credibility.To paraphrase an earlier, funnier Sandler movie (""Billy Madison"" (1995)), ""That's My Boy"" is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever seen. At no point in this rambling, incoherent film was Sandler even close to anything that could be considered funny. Everyone in my screening room is now dumber for having seen it. I award this movie 2 out of 10 stars, and may God have mercy on Adam Sandler's soul.",That's My Boy
61,jonathanruano,That's my Boy,2,19 February 2015,"The set up for this movie -- which has a teenage boy impregnate his female teacher -- played to the lowest common denominator, and was exploitative, tasteless, and mean spirited, but at least it was funny. The rest of the film, which has Donny (Adam Sadler) trying to bond with estranged son Todd (Andy Samberg), does not have a single funny joke. Not one joke worked at any level, though the number of gags must have numbered in the dozens or maybe over a hundred. Instead, ""That's my Boy"" is unrelentingly loud, obnoxious, and boring. At one point, I even felt sorry for Vanilla Ice who gave a cameo performance in this movie. I think Vanilla was trying to present the image of a cool, humble, and genuinely nice guy, but unfortunately nothing can offset the jarring performances of the rest of the cast. Perhaps what I hated most about this movie, apart from the fact that there was not a single funny joke after the set-up played itself out, is its underlying message. This film appears to be saying that Donny's obnoxious, rude, drunken, and downright stupid behaviour is superior to the civilized and ethical behaviour of polite society; and that everyone would be better off in the end if they were as obnoxious, rude, drunken, and stupid as Donny himself. If this message (which was clearly targeted to the people who show up for the Jerry Springer show) was not clear enough in the beginning and middle of the film, it was positively deafening at the end. As it turns out, fiancée Jamie (Leighton Meester) may seem like a sweet, polite, and civilized rich girl, but that's all fake because she was secretly having an affair with two relatives while engaged to Todd. So given its lack of laughs, the way it celebrates bad behaviour as something for others to emulate, and its cynical use of father-son bonding to make itself seem sympathetic and the opposite of mean spirited, ""That's my Boy"" gets a resounding thumbs down.",That's My Boy

64,MinistryofDoom,That's My Boy = That's Kinda Funny but Not Really,5,28 October 2014,"Much like the majority of Adam Sandler's movies, this one has a dumb premise. I can picture Adam and his best buds (most of the guys that appear in nearly all of his movies) sitting around drinking beers and coming up with this one, and OK, while it is a dumb wacky premise, after reading Gawker on a weekly basis, I can kind of see how this might actually happen in the real world, albeit not exactly as Sandler imagines it.Still if you can get past Andy Samberg's poor acting, and Adam Sandler's over the top/overly annoying New Yawka accent, there's some pretty good laughs in this one. Strangely though I felt that some of the minor characters were more interesting than Samberg and Sandler's; part of the reason is that their chemistry as dad and son is just plain awkward and weird in almost every scene. Samberg in particular was as stiff as cardboard.The saving grace for this flick, in my opinion, was one Mr. Vanilla Ice. His presence was completely unexpected but oh so entertaining and he did a damn fine job bringing out the chuckles.This isn't one of Adam Sandler's best movies, not by a long shot, but it certainly isn't one of his worst either.

65,troy-manatunga,One of the better Sandler Movies,7,3 October 2012,"The summer has been one dry spell after another at the theatres. It most certainly has not been a great summer for comedy. Some of the most popular names in comedy seem to be consecutive failing at large over the past few summers with an exception of one or two movies of the genre. Adam Sandlers worst was when for some reason he took up the project JACK N JILL. Why he did the movie is beyond ones understanding. The above mentioned movie raked in quite a number of Razzie awards for Sandler and as a follower of his work that was easily the lowest.Once you hit rock bottom it is said there is only one way to go and that's up. Sandler collaborating with small time director Sean Anders has redeemed his putrid showcase of 2011 with the comedy THATS MY BOY. Whilst this isn't the funniest movie to get into screens, this is by far one of the better comedies of 2012. Fitted with a stellar cast Sandler sets sail into calmer waters leaving behind the disastrous storm of 2011. Teaming up with Andy Samberg from FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS the duo takes on the screenplay written by David Caspe. For a debut motion picture screenplay Caspe does well. Carefully crafted around a collection of characters the farce is shared instead of Sandler hogging the spotlight and failing like he did with JACK N JILL. Guest star Nick Swardson should have ideally have been given a larger character to play. However given the circumstance what Swardson got was the best to suit his talents and he shredded his limited screen time into massive laughter at every turn.Donny became a legend in his high school overnight when the curtains opened during the valedictorian speech to showcase Donny sleeping with his teacher Ms McGarricle (Eva Ammuri Martino). Donny was in his teens when fame came knocking on his door due to his showcasing with Ms.McGarricle. Ms.McGarricle was sentenced to 30 years of prison time for statutory rape that resulted in her pregnancy. The tabloid fame money did not last long and Donny burnt through all of it pretty quick. Donny's son leaves him when he turns 18 and changes his name with the hopes of distancing himself from the walking shame and man-child Donny.While one will not crack their ribs laughing through the entire movie, one will laugh and one will certainly laugh loud when the jokes come rolling down. IMDb ratings show that the movie is simply and average comic attempt whilst this critic is convinced its above average and it most certainly will be enjoyed by any mortal with a sense of humor.Get with it, if its still at the cinemas get in line, if not its out on DVD!TITLE: THAT'S MY BOY DIRECTED BY: SEAN ANDERS STARRING: ADAM SANDLER, ANDY SAMBERG, LEIGHTON MEESTER & NICK SWARDSON RATED: R RATING:07/10 RUNTIME: 116MINUTES",That's My Boy
66,Bravesfan17,Adam Sandler's films are still fun.,8,17 June 2012,"To me, almost every Adam Sandler movie is fun to watch. I also include the ones that aren't as well liked, such as Little Nicky and Jack and Jill. This one I absolutely enjoyed.That's My Boy begins with a 13-year-old Donny boasting about having Van Halen tickets. He then asks out his teacher, Mary McGarricle, in front of his friends to make himself look like a big shot. She then gives Donny a month's worth of detention, where she reveals to him that she has had a thing for Donny all year. They immediately form a secret relationship and have sex. This all goes awry when Donny and Mary are hiding in the back of the stage doing it loudly during an assembly where Donny looks like a hero. Miss McGarricle is then pregnant with Donny's child and sentenced to spend 30 years in prison.Donny, now played by Adam Sandler, is a huge success earning a lot of money from his story and then blowing it all away. Transition to present day, where Donny now owes the IRS $43 thousand by the end of Memorial Day weekend or he's going to prison for three years. Donny then finds out that his son, Han Solo Beger (played by Andy Samberg), has changed his name and is getting married. Donny then goes to the place where Todd Peterson (Han's changed name) is having the wedding to try and get Todd to give him the money.The film's primary focus in on Donny trying to reunite with Han and be a good father and friend to his son. That's My Boy is directed by Sean Anders, who is directing his first Adam Sandler film. He does a good job of keeping the film together and continuing to keep the film funny.Sandler again has played another hilarious character in the slacker Donny. The best part of his performance was making Donny the teenage slacker who didn't grow up. Andy Samberg does a hilarious job at making Han the socially awkward guy who always ends up saying or doing something stupid. Another standout in the cast is James Caan as a priest conducting the ceremony who has a history of violence and will physically hurt people. The other big standout in the cast is Susan Sarandon, who has one scene in the film as the older version of Donny's lover Mary McGarricle.This film is fun to watch, especially if you are a fan of Adam Sandler like I am. The film fits in the same group as his other films like Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, Mr. Deeds, Anger Management, and Grown Ups.",That's My Boy
67,jaxbubba,"To say this film is bad, would insult ""bad movies""...",1,19 July 2012,"Adam Sandler has a net worth of $300 million. I can only hope and pray that with this latest debacle of movie madness that Mr. Sadler would hang up his ""acting"" career (and I use the term loosel...y), and gracefully bow out of the industry however, I know that this is only a dream, and it will never come into fruition in the nearing future. I also know that I will have to continue to endure the pain and agony that his films inflict on me. However, the real sadness of this film is all the wasted talent this film has at its resources: Academy Award Winner Susan Sarandon, Academy Award Nominee James Caan, Grammy Award Winners Tony Orlando, Vanilla Ice, and Ciara with cameo appearances from Todd Bridges and ESPN's Dan Patrick just to mention a few. I cannot for the life of me imagine what was going through Susan Sarandon's mind to say ""YES"" to this script I would take dignity over payday every time!!!! Loosely based on the true-life ""rip from the headlines"" story of a thirteen (13) year old boy who had sex with and impregnated his Middle School teacher, ""That's My Boy"" takes a look at what could have occurred 26 years later after the birth of their first child.This film has no redeeming qualities. From sixty (60) year old strippers to jerk off humor, from incest to fighting clergy; this film is a no holds barred/no subject matter too controversial that it cannot be exploited on screen. And though I did make it through the whole film (unlike ""Ted""). I can not/ will not give this film a recommendation for viewing.That said, this film is so awfully bad, that it reaches that other plateau The ""this film is so awfully bad, now I really have to see it"" film, because on that spectrum, this film hits a homerun!!!! It's a real guilty pleasure in that aspect. One scene in particular rings in my mind, and this description will not do the scene justice; however, here it goes One of Donny's (Sandler's) favorite hangouts is the ""Bacon & Legs"", a local strip club and Omelet bar restaurant. As Donny is explaining his money woes to the clubs featured star ""Champale"", the sixty year old performer, she continues to do her ""act"" (shimmy, shake, and pole spin) all while being served breakfast by her daughter, the club's manager. The scene is so over the top, you just sit there and say, ""Oh MY God, I cannot believe what I am watching on the screen"" And on that note, I bid you a fond farewell this film is like driving past a car accident; you just can't seem to keep your eyes off the screen!!!!! The worse it gets, the more you want to / have to watch it!!!",That's My Boy

69,cadillac20,Adam Sandler's Funniest In A Long Time,7,13 June 2012,"Yes, I know, I'm surprised too. Adam Sandler has been delivering one horrible movie after another lately, but That's My Boy is actually pretty damn funny. It hearkens back to the days of Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore, when Sandler made comedies people liked. Like so many other of his comedies, this won't be for everyone. This is a raunchy, immature, foul mouthed film, and anyone turned off by this kind of comedy will certainly hate this film. But if that's your thing, and I do like my raunchy comedy every now and then, then you'll most likely find this hilarious.The story is somewhat original for a comedy of this type, and that helps with said comedy. Sandler plays Donny, who, in his teens, has sex with one of his teachers. She gets pregnant, goes to jail, and Donny ends up raising the kid himself. Years later, the kid, now named Todd (Samberg), is a wealthy hedge fun manager about to be married. When Donny needs to get money to pay taxes so he can stay out of jail, he tries to reconnect with Todd and hijinks ensue.As I said, the film is raunchy and immature. When it isn't making you laugh, it's leaving your jaw on the floor. Not to say that things here are surprising, but some of this stuff is pretty out there. I won't spoil any surprises, but even when you expect something, you might be a little taken by the fact that they did, in fact, go there. Performances are fairly solid. Sandler is in top comedic form here as he once again proves he's mastered the Man-Child form of comedy. And, as you would suspect, he's really a decent guy here with his heart in the right place. He has a buffoon's charm, and it plays well off the other characters. Samberg leaves a bit more to be desired. Also usually a goofy guy, here he plays it mostly straight, if awkward. While the two comedians work well with each other, Sandler steals most of the show, instead of sharing the spotlight with Samberg. However, the chemistry is there, and they play a fairly convincing father-son duo.Of course, the film isn't the perfect comedy, and in an age where slapstick and raunchy comedy have taken a slightly different form, this feels a bit like an antique. That isn't to say it isn't funny, it is, but the film somehow seems more like an exception. There's also nothing terribly surprising here. The film is fairly predictable. Even Sandler's character has nothing new to offer. He's a likable guy, but we've seen him before in so many other Sandler roles. The film also takes massive leaps in reality. I rolled my eyes numerous times on several plot points. While the plot is certainly more original than you'd expect, it takes liberties with it's reality and they seem like nothing more than setups for jokes. Luckily the jokes are funny.This certainly isn't the best Sandler comedy, and it's far from the worst. Most of all, it's surprisingly funny and I had a good time with it. If you're looking for a good comedy to go see and enjoy the raunch and immaturity of Adam Sandler comedies, I think you will find this quite entertaining.",That's My Boy
70,ssvfolder-1,Funny one. Better than most.,7,30 September 2012,"I'm not really sure why all the hate towards Sandler's latest movies. I personally loved this one. You don't suppose to take it too seriously like some of the reviews at this website. Who hasn't dreamed, in their teens, to have a gorgeous teacher to teach you new exciting stuff? Basically every boy's first fantasy. The movie exploits the situation further and into the future with really funny (yet cliché) situations. Even Vanilla Ice looks right at place in this one. Don't look for intellectual jokes in this one, there are none and this movie does not suppose to have any. Don't believe all self-righteous ""critics"" that are looking for what is wrong with that movie, forgetting that not all movies must contain deep message or have visual effects of avatar - this one just to pass the time, and have a few laughs without really thinking about it. In my opinion, this one is better than ""just go with it"" (too serious), ""grown ups"" (too family) and ""funny people"" (too sad. This one I loved, and I really want to see more of this.",That's My Boy
71,mbs,am i the only one who mildly enjoyed it?!?!?!?,6,16 July 2012,"Yes, its not nearly as good as anything Sandler starred in in the 90's but i would argue that its about on par with most of the stuff he's been in in the 00's laugh wise. (On the scale of movies from the 00's,I think its probably the equivalent to ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck And Larry"" if only Andy Samburg were as good playing off of Sandler as Kevin James was. Samburg's not bad, but the movie really doesn't let him do anything outside being the straight man here.) Its certainly got more laughs in it then Jack and Jill at the least. No, not everything that's in it is funny, yes it goes on for way, way, way longer then it should. Yes, some of the jokes are pretty awful. Yes the premise is quite unbelievable. (30 years after the student/teacher affair scandal rocked the tabloids--why would random people still know who Sandler's character is by sight? especially if he hasn't been in the media in a good decade or two at that point and he was near completely broke???) Plot holes aside I would still be lying if i said that i didn't laugh at a fair number of things that happen throughout the film, and i would be lying if i said that i didn't think the semi serious scenes between Sandler and Samburg didn't work. I thought they were really effective. The scene where Sandler is hugging Samburg and tells him he regrets letting him go all those years ago and that he wished he'd been a better dad and samburg drunkenly forgiving him and kind of shrugging off the years of resentment actually felt heartfelt and genuine. That's really what drunken forgiveness looks like. It was kind of similar to the scenes in ""Chuck and Larry"" where Sandler stands up in open court and says how he feels flat out about people who call him names and how much they hurt more then he'd ever care to admit in public. Sure those scenes were written to give both films some semblance of dramatic heft--and to give Sandler something dramatic to play-but to me they were both effective, and they both show how even in somewhat tossed off comedies Sandler can still manage to maintain his dignity on screen and come off as a better actor then the material. Maybe he really has become a better actor as he's gotten older, because i really think he's a lot better at playing these serious heartfelt moments towards the last half hour of his films where his character is supposed to learn a lesson then he's ever been before. (Especially in something like Click where the humor turns much more bittersweet in the last half) Its because I felt that Sandler geuinely wanted to be a better person to his kid, that i thought the ending worked, (even if the end reveal does kind of come out of nowhere) and i thought the movie to be a resonably good time if you've liked sandler's movies these past number of years more or less....and c'mon some of the things happening are pretty funny.Also the very quick scene with Vanilla Ice where Sandler asks him to drive him at the end and Vanilla goes ""You Kidding Me????"" and then strikes a pose and then Sandler waits a beat and says ""Is that a yes or a no? I don't know what that pose means Ice."" was pretty hilarious--and that was just a tossed off thing. (Why wouldn't Sandler's character be friends with Vanilla Ice anyways???)",That's My Boy

73,HorrorOverEverything,"It Is What It Is And ""It's"" Not Very Good",4,17 July 2012,"Lets face it, we all know that the days of great Adam Sandler Movies (Water Boy, Billy madison, Happy Gilmore) are behind us. That Adam Sandler is gone, and when movies like this try to bring that Adam Sandler back they just end up being a big mess.For me ""That's My Boy"" felt like an R rated ""Grown Ups"". The cheesy humor and corny acting is still there but in place of the Pg-13 potty humor we have R-rated potty humor, which is slightly more funny but still not funny enough to make this a good movie. All the actors in this film seemed like they didn't want to be there, it seemed as if they just wanted to get their lines out so they could get their paychecks and get out of there.The movie tries so hard to be offensive and gross but it really just ends up coming off as dumb. Most of the jokes missed big time in the theatre I saw this in, Sandler would say something raunchy and the theatre would just be filled with silence except for a few 13 year olds who snuck into the showing. Now I know im tearing this movie apart but the truth is with all the bad stuff put to the side, this did contain a few pretty hilarious parts. Id say I busted out laughing about 4 or 5 times and the scene with Vanilla Ice were pretty entertaining, so this movie wasn't all bad. It was def better than Sandler's last couple of films excluding ""Funny people"". Far from the worst Sandler movie but still not a very good movie. 4/10",That's My Boy

It wasn't outright hilarious ALL the time, but it had several moments that made me laugh out loud, which is rare for a comedy these days. The movie also had a surprising amount of heart and a nice message in the end about family, and about how cool it could be to have an Uncle Vanny. Also it's important to always have a pocket full of chicken nuggets, and an extra pair of underwear handy.Overall, i liked it. It wasn't anywhere near as awful as most people say.",That's My Boy

Todd was abandoned as a child by his father, and despite the odds he became successful and changed his name so that his father could not find him.Despite all the trouble Todd went through to complicate the chances of his father finding him, Donny was able to track him down and find him. Donny is a low-life and wanted to use his son to bail him out of trouble. It started as greed for personal gain, but it soon evolved into Donny wanting to know his son and be the father he was not all the previous years.Donny's journey and adventures are full of laughter and excitement.",That's My Boy
76,tpaladino,Maybe we're missing something here...,1,16 June 2012,"After seeing this horrible film (on a dare), I was confused. How could Adam Sandler take such an absolute nosedive in his career so quickly and completely? I mean, he's demonstrated that he has some talent and knows how to make a funny movie (Wedding Singer, Zohan, etc.), and even his mediocre movies (all the others) aren't really truly awful... until Jack and Jill and now this. He does seem to be actively campaigning for his very own Razzie category at this point. Then I had a revelation. Maybe this is all part of some elaborate real-time performance art piece, á la Joaquin Phoenix in I'm Still Here, in which Sandler deliberately tanks his career in the most public and humiliating way possible. Then after finally hitting rock bottom, he'll go on Letterman and proclaim the last five years a hoax and release an indie documentary about the nature of fame, Hollywood, and the human experience, finally going on to win a prize at Sundance.At least that's what I hope, because if that isn't in fact what is happening here, the other option is almost too sad and depressing to think about. So fingers crossed for the whole hoax/indie documentary thing.",That's My Boy
77,Legendary_Badass,"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, but it does roll",5,13 June 2012,"Buckle up! There's a new, raunchier Adam Sandler comedy in town. In That's My Boy the of late family man takes on the role of Donny Berger, a washed up reality star trying to reconnect with his grown son. In 1984 Donny Berger (Sandler) was the kid who wowed America by living his dream. In other words he had sex with his teacher Ms. McGarricle (Eva Amurri), to such an apparent extent that she becomes pregnant with his child. Acknowledging the law, Donny has to raise the child as a child.Years after what little star power Donny possessed has faded, he's behind on his taxes. A promising TV reunion could bail him out, but the trick to pulling it off lies in tricking his now grown and successful son Todd (Andy Samberg), who is in the middle of wedding festivities, into visiting dear old mom.I'm going to groan my way through some superlatives, but there are refreshing elements to be found within That's My Boy. The crudest and rudest of Sandler comedies, there's a graduated level of humor. Less toilet humor, more sex humor. Donny is an unapologetic, uncontrollable mess, which makes for a more appealing Sandler than successful-family-man Sandler. Among the burnout clichés that Sandler lampoons: a Pontiac Fiero, reliance on audiotapes, and always a beer in hand.How R rated is That's My Boy? The tame moments involve implied sexual encounters with senior citizen. Efforts go toward the gross-out effect, but never achieve Brüno or Farrelly brothers levels of reaction. It's like cussing out someone when you don't know the language. The Happy Madison team may have upgraded their act, but there are still ingrained fallbacks. Conveniently starting in the '80s provides for a circumstance for Sandler's '80s music to take over the film. I do have to give due props for the score which is reminiscent of films of the era, recalling Tangerine Dream and Vangelis. Celebrity cameos are numerous and mostly deplorable. I wonder how well Rex Ryan's turn as a New England Patriots fanatic will hold up should in a year's time he's out of a job or never finds a Super Bowl ring with the Jets. The more reliable running gag is Vanilla Ice, a celebrity whose situation is known by all. Being washed up himself, I can envision Ice's manager denoting That's My Boy as his comeback, likely referencing Mike Tyson's work in The Hangover. I have some bad news for you Mr. Van Winkle, these Sandler films are far more expendable. You should have plotted your Sandler buddy comedy in the mid to late '90s.The formula for the plot is entirely predictable, but the structure is reliable. Of course Donny and Todd are going to rub each other the wrong way only to find some common ground. It's not a new idea, but That's My Boy moves along well enough that boredom doesn't have time to be established. As strange as this may come across, the antics of That's My Boy are more enjoyable than the Darwin Award intelligence of the scientists found in Prometheus—yes, I went there. These are dofusses in a world where sex with the teach is praised, which beats morons playing out an expensive space drama. That's My Boy is a slightly more competent film than the latest guise of the Sandler movie. There's even gags the writers recall with a degree of competency. The lack of maturity found in Billy Madison finds itself taking on a more adult-oriented lack of maturity. So, if you grew up with the lazy millionaire you may have very well witnessed his fall to depravity. That's how Billy grows up.Check out my video review as well as all of my reviews at my website VaughnOnMovies.com",That's My Boy
78,nathanschubach,"Bummed out about Sandler's choices, this one doesn't improve",3,21 July 2012,"I'm pretty speechless about this movie. Obviously it's a counterstrike against ""I Love You, Man"" by the crew at Happy Madison because it borrows tons of tropes and shots from that movie, ""The Wedding Singer,"" ""Step Brothers,"" and a host of other ""are they or aren't they"" wedding movies. The twists are a Sandler-specialty because they're everywhere in most of his films, but there has to be a moment when the crew should say enough is enough. It's too bad that Andy Samberg got drug along on this hellride through D-list celebrity cameos, endless masturbation jokes, and Sandler's low-brow buffoonery, but Andy did make a hit with his comedy troupe with a song referencing premature ejaculation so I guess that was enough to impress Adam.It's possible that younger audiences might get a laugh or two more than I put out there, mainly because this movie feels like a ""been there, done that"" movie, a byproduct of mixing up ""50 First Dates"" with ""Happy Gilmore"" and throw it some tribute to the late MCA from the Beastie Boys in the wardrobe department from ""(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party!)"" days. Sandler we've seen the silly fart-joke/moan- joke/masturbatory shtick before. I say stick with the more touching scripts from now on.",That's My Boy
79,DJ_Shilo,Sandler Freakshow,1,6 June 2016,"June 16, 2012Adam Sandler is an idiot in this picture. He's not up to his usual antics, he is actually an unfunny idiot and Andy Samberg is not funny either. He's the Lonely Island guy from ""Hot Rod,"" a much better picture but this film makes no use of his talent. It made me feel so uncomfortable and dirty as it's ugly, disheartening, tasteless and mean-spirited. Quite frankly, this is Adam Sandler worst picture he has ever made and last year he flopped with ""Jack & Jill."" I guess this was the next best thing but another bad choice for Adam Sandler.It's about a high school kid, Donny Berger (Justin Weaver) who begins a relationship with a hebephile teacher, Mary (Eva Amurri Martino) in 1984. When the relationship is discovered, she is pregnant and sentenced to prison. Donny's father is given custody until Donny is legal age. 28 years pass and, Donny (Adam Sandler) is a lazy, alcoholic, slacker who blew all his scandal money and spends his time in a strip club. When the IRS comes looking for back tax money and threatens Donny with a three-year prison sentence, he attempts to re-connect with his son, Todd (Andy Samberg) who hates his father, in an attempt to collect money if he can get a reunion between Todd and his mother on live TV from the Prison. Donny ends up crashing his son's bachelor party and Todd must deal with his father's immature behavior before he ruins everything.Adam Sandler has made some really bad films. ""The Waterboy"" springs to mind. A terrible film where he played a handicapped man who everyone makes fun of and were supposed to laugh at that? I didn't laugh once. ""Billy Madison"" was so dumb, you felt dumb for watching it and ""Click"" didn't make me laugh once. Adam Sandler ranks high on terrible films and this is the worst one he has made. He can make a good film when he is being serious. ""Reign Over Me,"" ""Spanglish and ""Punch-Drunk Love"" were fantastic. The sweet comedy, ""50 First Dates."" made me clap at the end. This picture prepares you the extreme and explicit sexual content that is thrown at you and none of it is funny.I'm not sure if he is part of the Sandler crew now or if he is a new friend but you remember that idiot from ""Just Go With It,"" the guy who did the terrible German voice who called himself Dolph Lundgren? He was also the guy who played ""Bucky Larson."" Nick Swardson is thrown into the picture as an offensive moron who looks like a mental patient in a strip bar. Nick was a funny guy in ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry"" and now he lowers himself to a hateful character we see two or three times. ""Bucky Larson"" reminds me of this freakshow as a truly bad film. Nick even had the gull to try to defend the film. It's sad when I walked out of ""Bucky Larson"" and it takes a lot for me to walk out of a film. Anyway, he was the character I really despised in this film. It also glorifies a stripper who is a big black woman eating waffles, I think. Again, tasteless and offensive that only strong Sandler fans will enjoy. These are the people who have never seen a good movie and settle for the profane and stupid. We see Donny in 1984 where his teacher passes him explicit notes. Soon after, they are caught behind the auditorium curtain and the film begins. I love how this film glorifies teacher-student relationships and that was one of the things that bothered me. That's a subject that shouldn't be glorified and this picture does a good job of that. The credits role and Donny is treated as a celebrity for knocking up his teacher. When Adam Sandler comes on screen, he is a complete clown and it seems like he is trying to relive his glory days with the character of Donny. I remember him as Opera Man from ""Saturday Night Live"" and he was funny. This character is an unfunny mess with a slurred speech right down to a forced drunk stagger. Todd's character, somewhat, tries to be presentable but he quickly becomes like Donny and we don't care about him either.Todd's bachelor party weekend serves as the second and third act of the film with him marrying a gold digger, Jamie (Leighton Meester). Donny shows up and crashes the party with vulgar one-liners and a desire to re-connect with his estranged son. Todd is stunned to see Donny and tries desperately to get rid of him. Several characters appear that we don't care about. What follows is a vulgar mess with an ending that is so disgusting and despicable, people started gagging in the theater. This is where I drew the line with the film. Strippers, Student-Teacher molestation, poor parenting and child abuse serve as the ruse for the story but it's executed with such carelessness, we really don't care in the end. I don't know why Sandler feels the need to act like a total idiot in his movies. When he is serious, he shines but when he gets together with his crew of morons, he sinks. I am targeting Sandler here because he's the drive to the film but it's so pathetic and painful to watch, no one in their right mind would find it funny. It even goes as far as to shine a light on incest. ""Jack and Jill"" was a terrible film but this shows Sandler is content with childish jokes instead of using his talent and for that, I feel bad for him.0/10",That's My Boy

Adam Sandler is so irritating in this film especially with the accent he does. The whole story from beginning to end is nauseating. The film starts with Adam Sandler's character getting his teacher pregnant who turns out to be Andy Samberg. Adam Sandler's character goes back into his son's life and meets his fiancée Jamie. The most nauseating scene was the part where Jamie is found having sex with her brother! I'm all for comedy and a good laugh but those subjects in my opinion cross the line.

While the plot of the show is interesting and does deal with forbidden situations what put me off the movie was the crass crudeness of this movie
The swearing and bad language which reaches new heights in this movie turned my stomache
The movie would have been far better if it had not been for the dirty behavour and swearing of THATS MY BOY
I'm not a prude and I admit I do swear sometimes but the language used in this movie is well over the top
Would love to see a remake of this movie minus the crass crude language used in this movie with Adam Sandler
His movies are good and even though his movies sometime are crass and dirt humor it is at a reasonable level
This one crams more foul language into every five minutes than all his other movies put together
When he plays against Drew Barrymore and some other actors one sees the best in him
When he plays against others the worst is brought out in him
Drew and some of the other actors bring out a charming Side of him
One that one would be proud to introduce him to your family
I've seen many movies with bad language but sorry
In its present form it is the worst

She is pregnant
Baby born and brought up by the boys father who manages to damage both his son and grandsons life so much so that his grandson wants nothing to do with ether of them
Later son lands up in trouble with the IRS and arranges with a TV Show to televise a meeting between the son and his mom
His father discovers that his sons fiancée is doing something immoral and tries to stop the wedding

His character here also has an obscure and irritating voice, it's not funny or unique, its dumb. My IQ dropped a thousand percent watching his antics as a dad who rekindles interest with his long lost son that he hasn't seen since turning 18. With a name change and an impending marriage into a wealthy family, washed up former child celebrity Donny, seeks him out for ulterior motives. There is supposed to be a family message here somewhere but I couldn't gel with any of the sentimental rubbish. If a grandma getting funky in bed or a big fat pole dancer popping out tennis balls floats your boat, go see this absolute undesirable bad aroma of a movie that makes The Wedding Singer look like The Godfather.

Along the way he made a few that weren't classic but I always pulled for his character and found the redemption of his characters charming and fun. But Sandler has lost something and it shows. Grown Ups was awful. There were no laughs in it. That's My Boy is a step up from that but a step down from Just Go With It. So he's firmly in the hit or miss category the last few years. That's My Boy first half is dull and uninspired. Sandler phones in the whole performance. Samberg is okay as the straight guy but he didn't really yuck up the screen either. Somewhere, halfway, the movie grows on you. Vanilla Ice owns his role as Vanilla Ice and you really wind up liking the guy. So the movie gets cute, you smile...but laugh with silliness? That's missing BIG TIME. The plot is mad thin, there's no doubt where it's going and where it will end but that's forgivable if Sandler does his thing. He doesn't and the result is an average Sandler movie that falls down into the bottom 5 or 6 movies he's done. It is, of course, a must for Adam Sandler fans but if you don't like the guy I insist you avoid it. Get your old crew back Sandler. Your missing someone in your crew dude and it shows.",That's My Boy

91,FilmStallion,That's My Boy...1 out of 4 Skittles,2,6 September 2012,"Adam Sandler is back at wasting the time and money of movie viewers once again. It seems like Sandler follows a simple formulahe comes up with a funny voice and attempts to make a movie out of it. He's done it before with The Waterboy & Little Nicky, and sadly, I'm sure he will do it again. It's obvious Sandler enjoys making movies that immature guys will find funny, and he doesn't seem to be looking to change. And why should hepeople keep paying money to see his Happy Madison productions.But the honesty of the situation is thishis latest film installment, like most of his recent flicks (Jack and Jill, Just Go With It, You Don't Mess With The Zohan, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, Clickshall I keep going?) absolutely stinks. Actually, saying it stinks is letting That's My Boy off the hook way to easy. It's abysmal. It's a nearly 2 hour movie the feels like it lasts 4. From the moronic casting of people who can't act (Vanilla Ice, Ciara & New York Jets football coach Rex Ryan), to the jokes so forced they seem to be written by a panel of fart and puke loving 12-year-olds, to Sandler's stupid Boston accent that loses any sign of amusement within the first 10 minutes of screen time.It's sad to see Sandler refuse to grow as an actor, especially since he has shown glimpses of what he can accomplish with the right project (Punch Drunk Love, Funny People). That's My Boy is what isa very dumb, rarely funny comedy (if you can classify it as a comedy). I suppose those who have enjoyed his other stink bombs might get a kick out of this one too, but if you're on the opposite spectrum of comedy films like me and enjoy believable stories that seem to be grounded on this planet, do yourself a favor and see Safety Not Guaranteed or Searching For a Friend for the End of the World instead. You'll be much happier that you did.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",That's My Boy
92,Spencer-Staggs,Some Unneeded Scenes Put The Film Off,6,2 March 2021,"I think that Adam Sandler's ""That's My Boy"" is most definitely better than it's trailer and some of it's reviews. I can see where a lot of the people not liking this movie come from, but to be honest for the most part I had a ball with this film. Donny Berger is a 41 year old man who had a relationship with his I believe middle school teacher. After this relationship when Donny & his teacher are being idiots and decide to have sex behind the curtains on stage at an assembly they get caught and Donny's teacher is sentenced to women's prison while Donny is stuck with a child. Now, Donny a 41 year old man must pay $43,000 in taxes or else he will be sent to prison sees his now grown up son on a flyer (I believe) and decides to go to his house. His son, Todd, is getting married and now Donny pulls the surprise on him that ""Hey, it's me your dad!"", and since I don't really want to get into a lot of stuff and don't want to deck out a whole summary for the film I'm just going to say that Donny and his son Todd (or Han Solo as his birth name) get a lot of bonding experience over the course of the film. . . even throughout the tough parts.p.s.

It needed to make it look like Todd is really better out without Jamie.2) Donny's and Todd's relationship was still too complicated for Todd to forgive his father so easily for setting him up.3) And as to the ending, I don't know why Todd didn't sign the release form. The final scene in which Donny wins the marathon bet would have been unnecessary if he would have taken the 50 grand by signing the release form.-----------------------END OF SPOILERS-----------------------Overall, it was a funny film and it had the potential to be one of Sandler's best movies, but it needed to develop the characters and plot more.

95,george_cherucheril,Kill it,1,15 October 2013,"From start to finish if you like this movie you have got to be a stupid, immoral animal. I fast forwarded through most of the movie. Humor can be based on a simple concept. Writing good humor takes a smart, creative mind with an understanding of the human spirit.This movie tries to find humor in the most base and perverse things that people may do. Maybe it was the Susan Sarandon's stunning looking daughter or Leighton Meester as Andy Samberg's fiancé that kept me watching. Perhaps I anticipated some real humor from Sandler or Samberg. This movie wasted my time. Read the news and notice the rash of stories about female school teachers sleeping with young male students. It is not funny and it is not cool. Yes, Donny's teacher gets a 30 year prison sentence but at the end of the movie his son admits that he too would get with his ""hot"" teacher if he had the chance. I don't think that Donny's teacher when we see her in prison 30 years later as Susan Sarandon would be so confident as Sarandon seemed.The ending makes me sick, Meester's character has been cheating on Samberg but worst of all she is caught having sex with her brother. Again, there is good reason for taboos and brother/sister sexual intercourse is a good taboo to avoid.Finally, Adam Sandler's character disappoints, he cannot pull off the ""infamous I slept with my teacher cool guy."" The supporting actors who receive him as cool are not realistic. The jokes do not work. All copies of this movie should be destroyed.",That's My Boy

Even though this is an R rated movie and not for anyone under the age of 17 or 18 I still had an awesome time watching this film. The best part about it is the jokes. It's a laughable comedy that takes it to another level. Not as good as Vince Vaughn's movies but it still is a great one. Adam Sandler is better in the Grown Ups movies. But he still makes me laugh. There's ups and downs of course.The one thing that I wasn't crazy about was all the drinking he did throughout the film. And the wrestling scene with his son. What was all of that about? I mean yeah it was funny. But up to a certain point. I had a good experience. But this one wasn't a big blockbuster film to me. So this film did have me laughing.

Sadly I was wrong.This movie fails in every aspect/angle you can imagine. The acting would be bad even if this was some low budget amateur movie, specially Adam Sandler who makes a voice for his character that sounds as fake as it gets. The Humor is the very cheapest you can expect from a Comedy and is entirely composed of lame sex jokes that will hardly be funny to anyone past the age of 15. While I enjoy clever humor I also enjoy silly comedies once in a while (had a good time watching TED) but that isn't the case here because there is hardly anything here that could be called comedy.I would recommend you don't waste your time with ""That's my boy"".

But finally, this movie comes along and takes us for a hell of a ride and such a fun show. I think it's the best film that Adam Sandler and his crew have put together since Grandma's boy. A lot of people harp on the Boston accent that Sandler puts on in this movie but trust me it's not that bad and his character is so funny and careless about anything that you stop noticing it anyway.

Yes, its based on some perverted stuff, but heck, Back in 84 what do you think Hot for teacher was about? Comedy has gotten much raunchier than the classic funny movie of my youth like Animal House and Caddyshack. Soundtrack is great. Having gone to High School in the mid 80's I can relate to all the classic songs from the soundtrack. I don't recall this even being in the theater and its never on cable.

I had my doubts about it but I was still going to watch and it actually is a plus movie.It's nowhere near a perfect movie but it's one of the funniest Adam Sandler movies I have seen (and I have seen all Sandler movies).The bachelor party scene was exactly as I pictured before watching it. Filled with strippers, alcohol, nudity, and there is a sex scene at the party, but it's not that graphic or prolonged.Donny Berger (Adam Sandler) hit on his seventh grade teacher so many times that Ms. McGarricle (Eva Amurri Martino) finally had enough of the flirting. First day in detention Ms. McGarricle starts flirting back and eventually she takes him to her ""teacher room"" to....teach him things. They start having a fling and they're eventually caught and she goes to jail for thirty years while knocked up.Thirty years pass and Donny has been famous for knocking up his teacher and has been too distracted to not pay taxes since '94. He's told if he doesn't pay 43,000 dollars at the end of the weekend then he must serve jail time.He is forced to join up with his son, Todd Peterson AKA Han Solo Berger (Andy Samberg). Donny doesn't want to just get the money out of Todd, he wants to hang out with his son one last time.That's My Boy is one big raunchy perverted joke....that I would listen to again and again.

When he turns 18, he leaves Donny's life and starts his own.Let me say that this film released about 3 months in Ireland, where I live, after America. And so I was waiting for this film for months. I was dying with anticipation. I love all of Adam Sandler's comedies. Even Jack and Jill was decent. And I have to say, Jack and Jill is even better than this. Adam Sandler puts on an annoying voice, even more so than Little Nicky, but at least I could stand Little Nicky as I thought it was a very funny film. This film however, was not funny at all. There was one funny bit, at the very end, and it's by Nick Swardson. The rest.... pfffftttt.... The screenwriter is the person who created Happy Endings, the TV show, and I really enjoy that. I just felt the jokes went-too-far. I didn't find them offensive and I don't care how vulgar and crude they are. I just felt they went to far in an effort to be funny. And the script tended to favor vulgarity and over-the-topness to actually being funny.I don't usually like Andy Samberg, and he wasn't too good in this either. All the supporting cast were alright, and do something which makes me smile sometimes. But overall, meh. There was really no good parts in the film except for the fact that it didn't feel slow and dragged out. That's the only good thing I have to say, which when you think about it is good, as it is 2 hours. Anyway, a HUGE disappointment and Sandler's second worst film, next to Going Overboard.

117,xThe_Fury,"""That's My Boy"" - Review by Brandon Krzysztof",4,15 June 2012,"""That's My Boy"" is a slap stick comedy that uses crude and vulgar humor to make the audience fall out of their seats laughing. Besides ""21 Jump Street,"" the audience hasn't really been presented with many slap stick comedies in 2012. With the lack of these comedies being made, with a name like Adam Sandler attached to the project it can be expected for this movie to relish in the box office. The movie stars Adam Sandler who plays Donny Berger, who at age 14 has sex with one his teachers and ends up fathering a child. Years past and Donny has four himself in trouble and ends up owing money to the IRS; if he doesn't pay the money by the end of the weekend he will be sent to prison. Donny finds out that his son, played by Andy Samberg, is getting married the same weekend and believes that this is his golden ticket to getting the money he needs.The pace of this film is pretty moderate; there is barely any slow parts in the film. The acting was okay, but it's pretty hard to judge Adam Sandler's performance because he is known to act kind of childish in his 90s films. There wasn't any performances in this movie that made me cringe. I will just come out and say that this film made me laugh. I do prefer comedies that don't use cuss words and vulgar jokes to get their laughs, but Adam Sandler movies will feature crudeness and disgusting jokes; even though I thought some were forced, I did think they worked out in this movie. That plot is simple and the end is predictable, but the movie knows it is made to do and that is to make you laugh as much as it can and it did just that. If you are an Adam Sandler or a Saturday Night Live fan, this movie will make you happy. I give this movie 2 1/2 stars out of 4.If you liked this review you can reach me on:twitter @bksta facebook.com/bkrzysztof bkstaReviews.blogspot.com",That's My Boy

Adam Sandler plays an irresponsible man child who is the father of Andy Samberg. Samberg was conceived through a 12 year old student and teacher relationship. Yeah. Sandler has sunk down to the statutory rape level. Sandler is broke and seeks Samberg for help or I don't know because I stopped caring after the first half of the first frame of the opening logo and that has to be a record. The movie is filled with gross out aka lazy humor along with offensive humor and from what I hear child molestation. This movie does not even deserve a one out of ten.

Finally Adam Sandler is back on track with his comedy, and this time he is raunchier then ever. I knew that this film was going to be a lot better then people expected because the trailer was really funny, and I liked the idea for the story. You can probably already tell how this review is going to go.The movie star Adam Sandler (Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison), Andy Samberg (Hot Rod, Saturday Night Live), Leighton Meester (Date Night, Going the Distance), Vanilla Ice (Rapper), James Caan (The Godfather, Las Vegas), Milo Ventimiglia (Rocky Balboa, Heros), Will Forte (Saturday Night Live, MacGruner), and Nick Swardson (Grandma's Boy, Just Go With It).The story goes that when Donny (Adam Sandler) was in Junior High, he had sex with his teacher and ended up getting her pregnant. Through these actions Donny get publicity and becomes somewhat famous of the whole ordeal. He took care of his son Todd (Andy Samberg) until he becomes 18 and leaves Donny and wants nothing to do with him. A long while later Donny owes $43,000 in unpaid taxes and he can't afford them. In an effort to earn the money he tries to reconnect with his son and actually be a better dad.I can honestly say that this is definitely one of Adam Sandler's better films. From start to finish I was laughing my ass off and at even some parts I was crying from how hard I was laughing. Even though at some points the voice Adam Sandler was doing in the film was annoying, I easily got over that. The jokes either consisted of really funny and well thought out jokes or just stupid funny jokes. The situations that they got into in this film also really helped out with the hilarity factor. The film had its stupid parts, but they weren't too bad to where you just roll your eyes.I think that Adam Sandler is still a very funny person and if he continues to make movies like this one, then he will still have a career in making movies. The movie is filled with many cameos that are absolutely hilarious and placed in the film well.

""That's My Boy"" comes after his last flick: the outright horrible ""Jack and Jill"", and it indeed proves to be a comeback of sorts for the struggling actor/comedian.The laughs are big, and the supporting cast is excellent in this funny off-beat Rated-R comedy that benefits largely to the addition of SNL funny-man Andy Samberg who has become surprisingly adept at hanging around with the best of Hollywood and even surpassing them along the way.Sandler and Samberg are a team made in comedy heaven, and you wouldn't expect anything less than a wildly-gross, ridiculous comedy that does things you've never seen before on the big screen. Yes, it pushes the limits of nastiness and if you're in need of a roller-coaster of laughter then you'll love this movie.There's a lot I could say about this movie..

Had I been on my own I would have walked out and called it a night. In the circumstances I simply slid into my seat and cringed.The plot is simply inane, Sandler's acting is atrocious and resorting to incest and granny screwing for humor makes it clear that Sandler is finally scraping the bottom of the comedy barrel.After this debacle, I guess I won't be choosing the movies for some time to come.Folks, don't duplicate my mistake.

127,Chris Brown,Adam Sandler's raunchiest movie,7,17 May 2012,"Fun, funny, and raunchy. This is the dirtiest film Adam Sandler has ever made. And I'm not some idiot who likes every Adam Sandler movie.* This movie has lots of laughs. At the advanced screening, people were laughing so loudly that I sometimes couldn't hear the next line. If you like immature, silly movies (like Sandler's most popular work), then this is a great movie. This is the kind of film that Adam Sandler has always been capable of making even though he chose to take a break so he could work on movies to watch with his wife and kids. Adam Sandler's character Donny Berger is a lovable sleazeball, exactly what you've seen in the trailers. Andy Samberg is the straight man in the routine. This movie has some great casting of young talents (Eva Amurri, Leighton Meester) and veterans (James Caan, Tony Orlando). I hate pointless cameos, and this movie had a couple. Erin Andrews's 8 seconds of screen time were completely pointless. However, I loved every second of Ian Zeiring and Alan Thicke. If I'd have never watched football, I would have completely believed that Rex Ryan was a professional actor. He's a natural, but I could have done without the wink-at-the-camera football references that pander at sports fans. I don't want to spoil the plot, but you can expect lots of sex jokes and surprising moments. Also, because Donny was an 80's kid who basically never grew up, this movie has lots of funny 80's references. But it never felt like rehashed material from the Wedding Singer. Bottom line: If you like crude sexual humor and you go into this movie with an open mind, you're going to have a great time.---------------------------------------------*I like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. I thought Mr. Deeds was mediocre. 50 First Dates was very disappointing (about 2 jokes in that movie). I refused to watch Jack and Jill.",That's My Boy

He was just immature the entire time and it got a bit annoying. I think Donny might be the unfunniest character I have ever seen Adam play and that is saying something after Jack and Jill.

I enjoyed this movie, laughing out loud several times. Sandler does a great job playing the father. The bachelor party scenes are epic, really feel for the characters. Uncle Vanny? Hilarious.

What is the fascination with puke,feces,cum and other bodily fluids Adam Sandler? Again because you put a bit of nudity in the movie your target audience of 5 years old's can't watch it.The whole movie seems to be a collection of the worst SNL actors sketches that got cut.Save your money and your time, this is Adam Sandlers worst movie.Even watching ""Fox News"" is time better spent then this!",That's My Boy

I can't understand the people giving it a bad review and saying that it's worse than Jack and Jill when it actually is much much better. I say well done to the makers of this movie and to Sandler. The movie is about a boy, Donny, who falls in love with his teacher and they have sex, resulting in them getting caught. This also results in a pregnancy and Donny becomes a teenage dad. The mother of his child gets prison for 30 years, charged for child molestation. Sure, it is a really serious case. But it's a comedy! It's a really funny movie. Anyway, many years later Donny needs to pay 45000 dollars, because he hasn't payed taxes since '94. He then finds his son, originally named Han Solo Burger, and find out he is a really successful guy in the financial business, but he has changed his name to Tom Peterson. He figure he might get help from him. So he visits his son, played by Andy Samberg. However, nobody knows that Donny is the father of Tom and that his real name is Han Solo. He doesn't want anyone to know about him being a result of a teenage-teacher bang. This eventually comes with a lot of problems and idiotic moves. I won't tell you too much about this movie though, as you might want to watch it yourself. Later on Donny discovers that his son's girlfriend is cheating on Tom, with her brother. Since she knew Donny needed money, she paid him 50 grand to be silent about that. Later on, Donny knew it wasn't right to do, so he and Vanilla Ice go on a journey to stop the wedding and tell them the truth. Everyone is shocked when hearing the truth,and the wedding is off. Tom then changes his name back to Han Solo Burger and turns into a real d i c k just like his father Donny. I can't believe the people who take this too serious. I mean, it's meant to be stupid, it's meant to be vulgar and idiotic. I like that kind of humor. I hated Jack and Jill. But this is a big improvement. Though, there is a couple of unnecessary scenes in this movie, it still is funny. I say, well done! But one thing i hate about Sandler though, is his accent. I mean, it's freaking stupid! I know he is used to acting stupid like in Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore etc but i think this character didn't need to have that type of voice, and that was one of the things that annoyed me because it reminded me a lot about his acting in Jack and Jill. Overall, it is a really funny movie. If you don't like pointless, stupid/silly, and vulgar movies, don't bother watching this one cause it will end up disappointing you. Overall 8/10.",That's My Boy

Sure she is, is it real? NO!! It was just so they could set up a really young father so they can create a hilarious movie. This movie never was intended to be serious, so all that happens should be looked at with a wink. Was the acting good? No. Did it need to be good? F*ck no! The whole situation and setting is hilarious, now do we need good acting to laugh? Quite frankly, my opinion is that most no brain comedies are funnier when the acting isn't that good (OK it shouldn't be overly bad either, but this was just perfectly in between).And all the weird characters gave this movie a genius boost (like the fat black stripper, the pretty boy jazz dancing incest having brother and such)I would recommend this to anyone who is into movies you don't have to think, to people who like Adam Sandler, who people who smoke weed, to people who aren't stuck up, to people who don't pretend to be some genius critic, to people who just want to laugh.I really don't understand all the haters and moral tree huggers here.

That was literally as much waiting to see anything remotely funny or interesting as I could stand. And which makes me sad since I've liked, and even loved, other Adam Sandler films. When given a decent script with true humor and character development, he's displayed enough goofy charm and heart to overcome far-fetched situations, over-the-top, cartoonish, secondary characters, and a propensity for bad accents. This script wasn't even close to decent. The premise was totally unfunny at best, and probably takes the cake for sadness and sickness. Crudity substituted for freshness and humor, and not only were all the secondary characters cartoonish and undeveloped, but so were most of the leads. Sandler's character was totally devoid of charm, and his accent may have been the worst ever. Since his company produced it, he has no one to blame for a pathetic, crude, boring script but himself.

The more mass market stuff gets a lot of hate, and I'll admit I'm not into them for the most part, although (let's be honest) his romcoms are the best in the biz. But this movie is not a mass market movie. It is crass, its main character is mostly despicable, it threads a tough needle through some very taboo subject matter like statutory rape, incest, and stolen valor. Yet somehow Sandler rises to the challenge of poking fun at this material and makes his character, Donnie Berger, an all around endearing person. Sandberg clearly understands Sandler's sense of humor and plays the perfect straight man to Sandler's over the top Mass hole character. As a person who grew up in the Boston suburbs, Sandler does an amazing job capturing the stereotypical Boston alpha male. He hams it way up, but he's consistent and it works. My only regret is coming late to the party. I wish I had seen this sooner. Like other classic Sandler movies, TmB has high re-watch value.

You guys are too hard on him. How can a guy not make a few flops??? This film wasn't even bad. Other than the over use of crude jokes, it was good. If you edited about 10 or 15 minutes of the crude and sexual jokes out of this, it would've been Sandler gold. The character he played was really original, not one of those family guy characters he just keeps on playing over and over. It was like his mid 90 characters like Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison, the ones that made us love him. Of course, it wasn't as good as a character. Overall, a pretty fair film that could've been great with the edits. I really don't know how you can say you walked out of the theater?!!! Same with Jack and Jill, it was bad, but it didn't deserve the horrible reviews. The guys made about 20 massive hits, how's he not gonna make one or two flops???

Thats My Boy was a pleasant surprise to watch, I was expecting it to be not that great at all, but I was wrong! The film starts off slow, but as it goes along from throughout it gets better & more funner & funnier to watch. This is a role that reminds of his days of playing characters like The Waterboy & Little Nicky but much more perverse with the use of his Wedding Singer wig that he decided to wear for this movie to bring the 80's funk for his character! Andy Samberg was great as the portrayal of his son, they really share a good chemistry together on screen. You could see a resemblance towards their faces as you kept seeing their likeness together on screen. This is by far Sandlers most naughtiest & most inappropriate film hes done in a long time, This film really brings me back to his 90's style era that I absolutely loved & cherished!

This film, on the other hand, starts bad and then it gets worse. The whole premise with 13 year old boy banging his teacher is a great idea for opening of a comedy... for 12 year old, perhaps. Then we go to adult version of our protagonist and we get Redneck Sandler who, possibly to add more humour, speaks with a voice/tone/style/word choice of a kid. Here and there we see him confronted with 'normal' people and see how funny it is when, for example, he's masturbating to a photograph of some old grandma. Situations/jokes that are supposed to be funny are in most cases based on shocking/disgusting the viewer. Don't get me wrong, I know that there are different types of jokes, and I like crude/vulgar humour. But then I expect it to be added without contempt to a viewer's intelligence.

His old movies such as Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, and The Waterboy were hilarious. This movie is just plain stupid and very, very offensive."" The few five star reviews that I have read are usually along the lines of: ""This movie is hilarious. It reminds me of Sandler's older movies and it is way better than his last few films like Jack and Jill or Grown Ups."" I do NOT completely agree with either type of reviewer on this movie, but some people are right when they say it reminds them of Sandler's older movies. For instance, this movie contains a scene which instantly strikes familiarity as a scene you would think came from the script of Happy Gilmore. This movie has also received lots of flaming and bashing because of it's offensive content which is unlike Adam Sandler. For example, incest is involved in the main plot, which strikes one of the biggest issues with this movie. There is also some racially offensive content in this movie as well. Now, with all of that aside, let me begin the review.First off, this movie is typical Sandler-humor. You can't deny it. Yes, it is the dark-side of Adam Sandler, but it's his kind of humor none-the-less, which you see in many of his other movies and you laugh at. I think many people started watching this movie not knowing what they were getting themselves into. I've read several reviews were people stated that Adam's character in the movie, 'Donny Berger', could not stand his voice, his fake accent was very annoying. However, if you look at past Sandler movies, The Waterboy, Billy Madison, Hotel Transylvania, and even some of his songs he wrote during stand-up, Adam seems to be a master of voices, and I thought his voice was hilarious in this movie. It showcased his skills at creating/playing goofy characters such as Donny Berger. As for the offensive content in the movie, I easily blew it off. I think most people take it too seriously when you just need to step back a minute and say: ""Look, it's just a movie. If it bothers you that much, read some reviews beforehand so you know not to watch a movie like this again."" When it comes to the sexual content in this movie, I admit it annoyed me a little because it is unlike Sandler to toil in that kind of comedy, however, I knew that this movie revolved around that kind of comedy, and was expecting it. And no doubt, there were parts where I was cracking up, and I admit, parts where I was disgusted and I had to look away from the T.V. for a minute. All of the little appearances of Adam Sandler's friends were great. The cameo appearances of some characters (I won't say who for spoiler reasons.) and other relatives and friends of him popping up throughout the movie is always a funny trait known to Happy Madison Productions. Basically, there are lots of very stupid parts in this movie, but there are equally just as many funny parts, some parts offering laughs from different kinds of humor which is always great in a comedy. You have to be a big fan of Sandler though, AND you have to be not easily offended or grossed out to enjoy a movie like this, which is not a combination that appears common among the people. I'm not ultimately lifting this movie up in praise, but I'm certainly not bashing it either. I think the main lesson here is, even though it's offensive and gross, it's still Adam Sandler, it's still funny (in parts), and it's definitely underrated. It's obviously not one of Adam Sandlers best movies, but I believe it's his best R rated one. Please read all of my movie and video game reviews at therightreviews.weebly.com",That's My Boy
160,jakhello147,Pretty good,7,17 September 2012,"This film is pretty funny, considering Jack and Jill was completely awful this is great, looks like Adam is turning his career back around cos this film was funny! Its also great to have samberg on the cast as a fan of lonely island i was very happy! It is definitely worth a wotch make sure you see it if you are a sandler fan or lonely island fan its really crude and there's al;so lots of boobs so what more could you want??? I watched with my girlfriend and we both thought it was funny and the rest of the cinema was laughing also so i think maybe the other bad reviews are people still angry with Sandler for making Jack and Jill.",That's My Boy

162,jellytime091384,Hilarious if you have the right attitude,10,30 September 2012,"The reviews for the movie are terrible and I went thinking negatively all ready. To be fair, Adam Sandler does act immature and pretty stupid throughout the movie, but lighten up folks. This is an ""off-the-rails"" type of comedy. Thus, it's R rated for good reason, and there's plenty of cursing without reason, but I laughed hard and often. I actually was doing homework while watching and drooled a little bit on my textbook from laughing so hard. The action in the movie didn't stop.I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie with your parents. Maybe the movie isn't worth $9 at the theaters either, but if you're bored at home or wanting to rent a movie with some friends, definitely check this movie out! Hilarious.",That's My Boy

I get that people were PO'd about Jack and Jill, and I'm no fanboy of Adam Sandler.. it was incredibly bad. The ratings and reviews of this movie seem to me like lingering hate from that, or from people that gave up on him long ago. Maybe I'm wrong, either way I doubt that anyone who liked his earlier stuff or Grandmas Boy, Hall Pass, The Hangover, Horrible Bosses etc.. wont' like this.The cast varied greatly from many well known actors and actresses to current top stars and new faces, they all played their parts really well.Adam Sandler has redeemed himself, That's My Boy is hilarious.",That's My Boy
164,sonofom,Actually quite funny!,7,7 October 2012,"I haven't expected much because adam sandler is not too funny overall, but.. Once you get over his trailer park style to talk, there's pretty much to laugh about here. Andy Samberg is funny as usual, with his face, comments and reactions and the whole cast is totally open minded about sexuality and make fun off it. The plot is yet a typically Hollywood story with misunderstandings, some feelings, forgiveness and a happy end but the main characters and a good choice of music titles keeps it entertaining til the end. I am a huge comedy and adult cartoons fan, watching 30+ shows every week so i know good humor. i understand that many people can't cope with this kind of boundlessly jokes but i am cool with it and had a lot of laughs. there were not much new jokes to me, but the old ones, i've seen before in other productions, where properly executed and it was a pleasure to watch two cool comedians together for this. definitely worth a watch! 6.5 / 10",That's My Boy
165,holograms,Comedy has hit bottom of the barrel,1,2 December 2012,"What has Hollywood been putting out lately for comedy? Well, That was my question heading into this movie that I thought had a chance to provide some hearty laughs. Unfortunately, I hit a roadblock in what I guess is current humor. Not only was this movie not funny if you are not into raunchy quasi-soft porn wannabe humor, it is very inappropriate for not only kids but non-assuming adults, as well. I felt my IQ dropping the more I watched this movie. It's laced with stupidity, and the immoral characters that make up the guts of the film sadly reflect where America is as a social country in this day and age, comedy or not. Why else would the cast and staff create a movie like this for the masses if they didn't think the country liked this stuff? Sad. This movie was an obscene disappointment. I would be highly embarrassed to watch this with any family or at any social gathering. If you are in to vastly raunchy material then you will probably like this unintelligent film. Otherwise, pick a cleaner comedy to watch, even if you have to go back several years in the film library to do so, because- honestly-Adam Sandler & the Hollywood crew have reached the bottom of the barrel in what they think is funny. Two thumbs down, would be more if I had them. This movie sucked.",That's My Boy
166,SDCowgirl1991,it was funny!,8,24 June 2012,"i don't understand all the hate. i laughed for most of the movie. Vanilla Ice was hilarious. Sandler was very good. And the ending had me in tears of hysteria. This was a very very fun movie.do i think it could have been better? yeah, certain aspects weren't done as well as they could have been, but this wasn't as bad as Jack and Jill and it is definitely one of Sandler's best movies in years.I understand Sandler isn't for everyone, and this movie isn't going to win Cannes anytime soon, but c'mon people, not everything needs to be so serious. This movie was fun.Get over it and enjoy it for what it is!",That's My Boy
167,jxfish2,"I really like many of Adam Sandlers films, but this isn't one of them!",1,10 October 2012,"IMHO, this was one of Adams worst films to date! My entire family loved the ""Waterboy"", ""Mr Deeds"", Grownups, ""You don't mess with the Zohan"", Click, ""Big Daddy"", and several others.But, I wouldn't see this one again, if you paid me.My 13 year old son was the one that begged me to see this.Half way through the movie, he'd had enough himself!There's too much foul language, nudity, and sexual ""inuendo"" for most children to watch.I would normally not hesitate to watch an Adam Sandler movie at home, as part of our evening family time.

Like almost all movies of Adam Sandler, the plot is simple and with a lot of forced jokes. It's not to be impressed, considering that the actor is already know for this kind of comedy. The big surprise here, is that the movie deals with controversial issues, as: incest and rape (of a teacher with a student in the case), treating both in a funny and light way, making it a great choice for lovers of slapstick comedy and derivatives.",That's My Boy

170,Kgelderman,Adam Sandler owes me 11 dollars...and my dignity,1,20 June 2012,"I want to begin by saying that I love a dumb, mindless comedy. When it comes to laughter, I am no snob. Fart, belch, make an obscene sex joke, whatever. It'll make me laugh. So I feel like I am justified in what I'm about to say about the disaster that was That's My Boy.I went into this thinking, ""I know Adam Sandler has made some embarrassing mistakes: Jack and Jill, Grown Ups, Just Go With It, but I think this could be it! I think this is the movie that will redeem him and maybe bring him back from the comedic ashes."" (I want to be clear that I didn't see Jack and Jill, but the previews actually made me cringe. I also want to be clear that I know Grown Ups and Just Go With It were technically terrible movies, but I kind of liked them, in spite of myself). Andy Samberg revived SNL for me with Lonely Island's classic tune ""D*ck in Box"" and I will quote Billy Madison all day, everyday. In fact, I'm a teacher, and after many vacations, I have sung ""Back to School"" as I packed up my lunch and headed off for another day. Basically, I like these guys. How could it go wrong? But wrong it went...And people might say, ""Oh you're a teacher...that's why you thought this film was so offensively bad."" And they would only be partially correct. I was genuinely disgusted by the way the teacher/Donny relationship was handled, but I knew the premise of the film. That's just my fault. It was Sandler's ridiculous Boston accent, it was the mindless cameos of random sport stars, it was Vanilla Ice. Why Vanilla, why were you there? It was the incest. I mean, we already knew Leighton Meester's character was a terrible person. Who thought that topping her character's flaws off with sex with her brother was a necessary component to the film? When I tell people I saw this movie, they look at me like I'm crazy. ""Why would you go to that? That looked bad in the previews!"" And I shrug. I really like Adam Sandler. I don't care if he dressed up as his own twin sister in a film starring Katie Holmes. His movies remind me of being a kid and giant penguins and Chris Farley as a bus driver and beating up Bob Barker and Steve Buscemi as a homeless man in a shopping cart. I even think he can pull off some of the more serious roles. Punch Drunk Love and Funny People were good films, in my humble opinion.But Adam Sandler, *this* cannot be the legacy you leave for our youth. You're trying too hard to make us laugh. And in the process, you're losing what we used to love so much about you. What was so great about Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore was their absurd charm. I know you think That's My Boy was of the same genre, but really it was just absurd. If this is the best you can do, honey, I don't want to see the worst.",That's My Boy

It seems Sandler has always had such potential for an adult humors movie but always kids them down for mainstream audiences but not this time, finally an adult humor movie with him! I think he acted very well as the father who realizes he messed up and shouldve been a better dad. The bachelor party scenes were so hilarious, couldn't stop laughing.

To start with his favorite topic of gerontophilia with him again and on multiple occasion f***ing an old lady. I am personally not finding this amusing at all. And this is just a bit of the sick parts of the movie. Last but not least, if you ignore the profanity as such silly jokes, there are couple of episodes, if not the whole movie, when you can laugh your heart out, in particular to the sequence around the bachelor party. as summary: classic, sick but funny movie to watch with friends and beer. not kids friendly",That's My Boy

This is the lowest of the low and the laziest of the lazy.You can make plenty of arguments that Sandler still makes good movies (Uncut Gems a few years later) but this is deplorable and should be seen as a stain for all involved.Once again an adult woman who is the boys teacher seduces and rapes him, he's not old enough to consent or understand.

Jack and Jill yes indeed was not good in the slightest but this movie i was sure was guna Be Adam's come back. It seems some viewers are allowing them selves to be blinded by Adams's last performance. This movie has everything you could ask for I only saw 1 thing i did not like in the ENTIRE movie. I write this review because i would hate people not to give this title a shot. i rate it a full 10 stars as its in fact one of the most entertaining movies i have seen in a long time. The humour is what you would expect from Adam maybe turned up a notch. This movie has Vanilla ice. come on its Vanilla ice!!!! u know ice ice baby ??? Well he can act too. If you can watch Family Guy or South park and LOL and enjoy your self then you will see why other reviews of That's my boy may just be unfair.

This movie is an excellent example of a true comedy. There were not only a few funny scenes, but it contains a term i like to call CONSTANT COMEDY. This film shows a father son connection the only way Adam Sandler and his company Happy Madison films now how. By making you laugh. Compared to other Sandler comedies this one has a great story behind it.

This is how played out Sandler and his production house is for ideas. Grandma's Boy had more creative steam and class. And I'm not sure what exactly is supposed to be funny about a grown woman sexually abusing and manipulating a boy...especially in light of the Sandusky trial.

It was unnecessarily crude and the sex ""jokes"" were more than abundant. Of course, I expected such humour after watching the film's trailer, but it miraculously managed to turn out worse than the already low expectations.The ""jokes"" were very childish and prompted me to smile, at most. The only parts I laughed at were people falling over/into things; the sense of humour really wasn't worth it.The acting does not deserve credit.

196,dazzyfinky,Good for a laugh,6,16 June 2012,"I love most Adam Sandler movies, and i noticed a lot of reviewers say the same thing, Thats my boy, is a really funny movie (at least to me, my friends and all the other younger people in the audience ranging from about 16-30's) It wasn't a movie i went in hoping for some comedy classic, it's a great movie to watch when you just feel like watching a movie that gives some good laughs (depending on your humor) and slight amused disgust..... the concept of the move was very straightforward with the teacher and student having sex and getting caught...etc then trying to reconnect with his son around 20-30 years later to pay off debt, which most of the audience would guess he would find out about and they'd get in a massive fight but i did not expect the major twist near the end of the movie that had the whole cinema i was in going 'gross' 'wtf' 'LOL' and causing a general sense of amusement.This is one of those movies where its crazy, stupid and funny....i loved it so did all my friends and the rest of the audience in the cinema with us - so really if you like his movies watch it with an open mind and see for yourself, it really all depends what you find funny...the other reviewers just say its bad don't watch it, but really you should give it a go",That's My Boy
197,bettyrats,New Adam Sandler Vehicle (sort-of),9,16 June 2012,"I found this movie to be surprisingly refreshing (and hilarious). A return to form for Adam Sandler, it hearkens back to his glory days--Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, The Wedding Singer--and taps into the more deranged strides taken in his comedy albums (something he's never quite done in his films really). For the most part, it feels like a standard Sandler vehicle, but a good one at-least. One that veers into the crazed whimsy and strangely heart-warming sentiments that made Sandler a unique comedic voice to begin with. It features enough new twists (subtle may they be) to keep things interesting and very funny. (Note: the guy who gave this one-star... his user name is Lord Fecal Matter.)",That's My Boy
198,geminimystica,Absolutely Fantastic.....For A Sandler fan!!!,9,22 June 2012,"First of all, one of the largest flaws I see with the user reviews involves 'I took my church group...', and 'was too childish and vulgar'; but I have to say that it is not intended for your church group, and Adam Sandler movies usually fit into the vulgar comedy category. Secondly, if you are familiar with Sandler movies, you should relatively know what to expect. I love Sandler. I found all of his movies to be absolutely hilarious since first viewing Happy Gilmore as a teen. This is classic Sandler; playing a character with a childish personality, and getting involved into situations that feature gross-out/random/vulgar/silly comedy. If you don't like Sandler, don't see this movie. That's just common sense. Like many have stated, there are some plot holes, especially in the beginning. But hey, it's a comedy and many of today's favorites don't have to make perfect sense. The point is to enjoy the film for being funny; so breaking apart the plot to analyse it's logic is pointless. I loved it. It's not intended for kids or the light hearted. If you are a Sandler fan, or even a gross-out/silly comedy fan, I recommend this movie. So 9 outta 10 for me!~Gemi",That's My Boy
199,kenbonilla,Because farts are still funny to me,8,10 July 2012,"Why all the hate? This light-hearted comedy kept me laughing non-stop. It's immature, it's vulgar, it's standard Sandler, and it made me laugh in a way at Adam that I haven't since Billy Madison. Is it a movie for the ages? no. It isn't supposed to be. If you can manage to laugh at the immature, then it's good. If you take yourself too seriously, well, get bent. So, yeah, if you are easily offended, not for you. If you want sophisticated laughs, not for you. If you want to see Sandler being gross and irresponsible, go see it.and now a joke Jim's car is swerving all over the road so a cop pulls him over, ""Step out of the car"" says the cop, ""I am going to need you to take a breathalyzer test."" ""I can't"", Jim responds ""You see I have very bad asthma, that can set off an attack."" ""Alright,"" says the cop, ""then you're going to have to take a blood test."" ""Can't do that either,"" Jim responds, ""I am a hemophiliac, if a wound is opened, I won't stop bleeding, and I could bleed to death."" ""Ok,"" the cop answers ""then I will need a urine sample."" ""Sorry,"" says Jim ""I also have diabetes, that could push my sugar count really low."" ""Fine, so just come on out, and walk a straight line for me."" ""Can't do that either"" responds Jim.

It's a great film! It's daft, funny, far fetched. It's everything you expect from one of his movies. It has an easy humorous plot and predictable ending but you have a laugh along the way. You don't watch an Adam Sandler movie for deep spiritual enlightenment do you?? You watch it as you know what to expect. A good laugh!I'd recommend this film to any Sandler fan. And the great thing about all his films is that he's consistent. If you don't get him, then simple don't watch them and wright crappy reviews. I'm not saying this film is a 10/10 but definitely more deserved than some if the reviews on here.",That's My Boy
201,christian-bennison,Wanted to like it but couldn't it was awful,1,24 May 2013,"First off I will always like Adam Sandler for films such as the 'water boy,happy Gilmore,big daddy,little Nicky,50 first dates and punch drunk love(a brilliant film that proved Mr Sandler really can act). So I had high hopes for this movie that Adam Sandler would redeem himself from his last movie 'Jack & Jill' which was terrible. Unfortunately this never happened and I had to turn the movie off after little over an hour, as it was insulting my intelligence and wasting my time, the movie had no real story and it was unfunny. The target audience for this movie is 13-18 year old's that hear a few rude swear words and start laughing or very immature adults that choose not to get a job and drink all day. I am so glad I never spent money to watch this movie or else I would want my money back. I hope in the future Mr Sandler uses his old formula and puts out something good or at least half decent and not just releases any old film for easy cash.",That's My Boy

So last night I started watching it and yes it was far worse than I thought. I'm only 50 minutes into it and frankly I'm not sure how I made it this far except that it's like watching a train wreck... you are horrified but can't look away. I'm not a big fan of this kind of comedy, but this thing is downright offensive to me. I think there is one kid who is maybe 6 years old and they have him rubbing his crotch in a deliberate sexual way. I think it's criminal to put this kind of language and story line into kids mouths for a movie. I keep thinking there will be some kind of redeeming quality in the end, but seems unlikely.

204,mattrhoades,none,7,31 March 2015,i like this movie because of the main idea and it is pretty funny. my favorite type of movie is comedy because who doesn't like to laugh. in the the movie adam sandler is the main character and he is trying to find his son because his son is rich and he needs money. i just find that adam is a pretty funny character and plays a good role in this movie. i think the funniest scene was when he shows up to the house and nobody knows who he is and he just goes with the flow and he is acting like his son is his best friend not his dad. i also like that adam named his sons name honsolo. the movie is not the best movie but it has some funny parts to it and that just what make the movie a 7 out of 10 to me.,That's My Boy

This isn't even a so-bad-it's-good movie. If you find statutory rape funny, you'll think this is hilarious. The ""humor"" in this movie is so childish and unfunny, a 12-year-old might as well have written the script. From a child having sex with their teacher in a crowded school assembly, to an awkward Vanilla Ice cameo, this movie is pure cinematic abortion. Also, there's incest, so that's cool.

And all we want to see is his OLD movie style but NEW.So this was close to it.It was so funny seeing him as a drunk with Pal Vanilla Ice.

214,alisk14,Sandler needs to reinvent himself....,3,15 October 2012,"These days when you see the name of Adam Sandler on a movie poster or see him on the new trailer for the movie, you know already what to expect. Even his last film Jack and Jill was a real disgrace and maybe rightfully deserved all those Razzies that it received. Unfortunately That's My Boy is in that same league, where there are many vulgar,drunken or just plain annoying jokes that does not make you laugh, and you just feel that you have seen it all before. The story isn't something special either, Donny who becomes a father in his teens,raises his son till he is 18 and then his son disappears from his life.After many years when his father is in some trouble he finds him again,and while his initial purpose to seek him was something else, but he gets caught on in his son's new life and try to sort things out for him. In the meantime his son finds a thing or two about himself as well. Even though you cannot expect much from these types of movies but you still expect to be entertained and have a good time and few laughs. This movie unfortunately fails to deliver the entertainment and laughs, and all you can do it to wait for it to end. After seeing this movie I was forced to ask myself this question that has Adam Sandler really lost it or have we just grown as an audience? That we have seen and heard all these penises and vagina's jokes far too often and we do not find it funny anymore and wants something more and original. Maybe we have because it is Sandler's first movie in recent time that has failed miserably at the box office, only making around 57 million out of 70 million budget.One can just hope that Adam Sandler reinvents himself and I have no doubt in his comedy skills and I believe there is much more to him than this.",That's My Boy

Considering the rampant use of F-bombs, the over the top nudity, the implication of firing tennis balls from a woman's vagina, this should have had an X rating. I'm not sure what was more disgusting - the absolutely disgusting scenes of masturbation, the incestuous scene between brother and sister or the fact that the woman in line ahead of me bought tickets for three pre-teen children to watch the movie.

After reading several reviews, I saw that it might be better for an old Sandler fan, circa Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore. I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, Sandler uses an accent in this movie, which isn't too bad (Boston Southie? Wicked), definitely not the mess that was the voice of Little Nicky or the Waterboy. The movie was pretty funny, with several laugh out loud moments. Samberg and Sandler went together well in this film.

Show watching this movie every one not only get a LOL package but also a descent moral.So eventually to be honest every one should watch that movie .SO Sandler is worth what he is paid for this movie. Hope Sandler will entertain the viewers this way for many years . But besides Sandler Todd's character could find a actor more descent than Andy Samberg then the movie would be more preferable. Other wise the movie has many things to draw attention of the viewers.,That's My Boy

Yeah maybe at first it was but now that 15 different characters in 15 different movies have the exact same stupid voice it does nothing but make me want to punch the TV screen.How can people like this movie.. it just doesn't make sense. Im one to watch till the end of a movie even if its horrible but 2 hours was just out right wrong. I think Adam has lost his touch.And if the boring actors and annoying story line wasn't enough. Did anyone notice Rob Snyder didn't make an appearance like he use to in everyone of Adams movies? Maybe he read the story line and realized, just like I did, that Adams lost his touch.

My wife and I went to an early showing of this one and it was OK at first with the young version of the Adam Sandler character hitting on his teacher who gives him detention only to have sex with him and getting pregnant and going to prison for 30 years. After the opening credits it all crap. Sandler's character was a huge jerk in a very white trash way and nothing coming out of his mouth was funny. Pair that up with the character of his son who is a major wuss who has is very socially awkward person who has to take several prescriptions and carries an extra pair of underwear in his shirt pocket in case of emergency despite becoming a success after moving out of his dad's and you have an unfunny and overall difficult to watch film.

Loved how Rex Ryan was a Boston fan when in reality he is a Jets fan. Sandler was hilarious in thats my boy. vanilla ice, erin andrews, and especially rex ryan were all soooo funny. i was not expecting much but sandler really impressed me. must see if your looking for a nonstop laughter.

Some people have compare this to hangover saying The hangover is a comedy masterpiece but even in The Hangover I didn't laugh as much as in That's my boy. Furthermore, the whole room was laughing as hard as I was so I know I wasn't the only one.In conclusion, if you are expecting a movie like Mr.Deeds you will be surprised or disgusted. After all it depends on your sense of humor and if you like movie like 27 dresses or stuff like that this movie is certainly not for you unless you have an open mind.

This one however for me ranks up with Happy Gilmore & The Waterboy. Stupid funny comedy. Rex Ryans part is just plain hysterical. And Vanilla Ice did a fine job.

This is my FIRST review... probably my last... but I felt it necessary to tip the balance back up... so I gave it a 10! I know it doesn't deserve a FULL 10, but sheesh a 3??? a 4??? You better believe I will tip the scales!!! Word to your Mutha!!! Yeah watch the movie - you'll get it!!! Ha ha",That's My Boy

Can't really explain why it's so great....it just is!For some reason there were kids at the movie theater (guess someone couldn't get a baby sitter). There is nudity, a lot of references that children shouldn't be exposed to, so please don't bring your kids! Not sure why there is such a low rating! An older crowd must have seen it and reviewed it....yes, it's inappropriate, and yes it is still funny as hell! And yes you should see it!I will actually watch this again, and I never do repeats! But next time I will wear a denim vest and/or acid washed jeans.",That's My Boy
236,jmmaller,A bad Adam Sandler movie.,2,2 October 2012,"You know what an Adam Sandler movie is going to be like. With a couple of exceptions, they follow a pretty steady composition formula. They range from good (Happy Gilmore) to mediocre (Waterboy) to awful. Which is this.The basic premise held enough water as a vehicle for him to have some fun, but the writing was just sloppy and self indulgent. His vocal performance as a Bostonian drunkard is so overwhelmingly overdone that it removes any chance of comedic timing. It's just a full on assault from start to finish.This could have been a good movie. Frankly I'm really surprised that putting Sandler and Samburg together didn't result in something better - how did the two of them not see the rushes and realise they were making something this poor?It's just not worth your time. I like a brainless comedy from time to time, but this one is so loose and trite that the smiles you get are outweighed by the winces. Avoid this one. Hopefully they'll do better next time.",That's My Boy
237,IamAdamSandler,One of the best movies of all time ... A must see!!!!!!!!!,10,5 July 2012,"Adam Sandler is starting to show his true acting range with his last two epics, first Jack and Jill and now That's my boy. Beyond the comedic genius that is Adam is the heart-warming and enduring charm that he brings to the screen. It's a wonder why the great directors, like Scorcese and Tarrantino, have not developed roles for such a gifted talent. If he were to spread his wings further and expand to even meatier roles, although one could argue that his recent roles are award worthy, he would certainly be linked with some of the greatest actors of all time. This film may go down as one of the greatest comedies and possibly a top 10 all-time movie, with the likes of the Godfather and so many other enduring classics. Adam creates a character on screen that will go down in the annals of history as one of the most memorable personas on the silver screen. Andy Samberg also provides a witty, comedic partner to Adam's character, but unfortunately cannot match the theatrical genius that is Adam Sandler.",That's My Boy
238,markleinweber,Washed up guy try's to win back his sons affection,10,15 July 2012,"A lot of negative reviews posted here so far, I disagree with most. These people think they are paid movie critics, or at least thats how ignorant they sound. This movie was meant to be dumb, slap-stick, sketch-like, goofy, over the top vulgar. They pushed the limits to make it more like something that Adam hasn't done before, and I commend them on that. It had me thinking sometimes they went overboard, but it was still funny unless you have no sense of humor. The cast was great along with the classic things Adam does in all his films. I will say his accent was pretty bad most of the time, but maybe it was supposed to be. I will give it more credit than most because I couldn't watch more than 5 min of Jack and Jill then I was done. Compare the 2 films and this one was quite a triumph. I think the vulgar scenes are what hurt it in the box office and word of mouth. But you have to admit its a ballsy move during the summertime, with a $70,000,000 budget. Anyway, Ignore the bad reviews from other people and give it a shot if your an old school Adam Sandler fan.",That's My Boy

Did people watch the same movie I saw? That's My Boy is the funniest Adam Sandler movie and in my opinion the funniest movie I've ever seen. I did not go longer than 5 minutes without hysterically laughing at the scenes in this movie. As a fan of movies such as Wedding Crashers, Old School, Step Brothers, 21 Jump Street, Superbad, and Forgetting Sarah Marshall just to name a few, this has to be the funniest movie out of the bunch. If you're looking for more than just laughs, than maybe the movie might not be right for you. And do not go into an R rated comedy expecting no dirty jokes.

In my opinion Sandler is going back to his comedic roots... I mean you cant tell me when he was on SNL and in some of his earlier movies he didn't act stupid, Maybe some of you reviewers are just getting old and don't know comedy anymore when you see it. See people need to stop critiquing a comedy like this based as though it was a movie in another genre. But thats just my opinion, If your looking for something funny I recommend seeing this. But you might need to be a specific age group, 12-36, I guess Sandler is tired of trying to make all you ""old fools"" laugh. Also Andy Samberg was great along with Will Forte and Nick Swardson, even though he only had like 4 lines.",That's My Boy

He doesn't deliver dramatic thrillers up for Oscars but if you wanna laugh, just watch ""Thats my boy"". It was written & directed like any Sandler film! bloody hilarious,great cameo's & a nice finish. Don't walk into a Mcdonalds & complain about how greasy & unhealthy the food is. Any bad review of this film are coming from people who for some reason think Adam Sandler films are are supposed to be intelligently written & masterfully directed. That has never been the case. I watched the film thankfully, even after reading the bad reviews on this site & i laughed & even opened an IMDb account just so i could write how much i enjoyed this film. Watch it if you like Sandler films & don't if you've already decided that you hate his brand of humour. This is in between the water boy & hot rod.

This piece of S***t was though, so terrible; it drove me to create an IMDb account to let you all know to stay away from it. The start is awful and whoever wrote this could have had a little bit more of a moral ground. A 13 year old gets seduced by this teacher i.e. a pedophile. When did we start liking this? It is quite sad frankly when some ""comedian"" writes a film comedy about a child who has been abused by a pedophile teacher. Sad, sad, sad. When you see good actors playing in this such films, I cannot help but wander : how bad it the Wold crisis in the USA??? I am only glad this horrible film will never be shown in Europe.

My mom, wife and I went to see the movie thinking it would be funny because Adam Sandler was in it and we got out after the first 5 minutes. Watching that kid being seduced by a teacher and then being applauded by his classmates and teachers! This movie is so immoral that the director should be forbidden from making more movies. I have no idea how Adam could accept this role. If you go and watch this movie and enjoy it, then you should consider going to therapy with a psychiatrist. This movie made me sick! We walked out and were able to change or tickets to Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.

He's just been recycling movies lately and they've been getting worse with every one thats released. His last few have been almost unwatchable. I've seen all of his movies, with the exception of Jack & Jill, which I could only bear to watch 20 minutes. I only watched this movie to see Rex Ryan as a Pats fan. That's My Boy though, awesome movie! I laughed out loud many times during this movie. It may have not had the greatest script in the world but I didn't expect much because of his last few movies and this was a pleasant surprise. It was a fun movie and if you watch it that way you will love it. I couldn't give it a 10 but I couldn't go less than 9 because of how funny it was. It's about time Adam Sandler made good ""dumb"" comedy again!",That's My Boy
247,bnahum,Great movie,8,4 October 2012,"This movie was pretty damn good. Adam Sandler is heading back in the right direction with this movie. There is some questionable situations in this movie, but stop complaining. Murder is a crime, but nobody cares about movies like Friday the 13th and Halloween. There is statutory rape suggestions and incest situations, but that is what makes this movie so funny. Sure its wrong, but so is everything in Hollywood including political views.I would probably watch this for a second or third time, but not by myself. I would like more movies like this, it does remind me of bid daddy and I liked that movie too. Adam should stick to comedy because I can't take the guy seriously. He is a GREAT comedian and does a fantastic job!",That's My Boy

I absolutely CANNOT stand that freaking growly, yet somehow nasally irritating voice he does in almost every character he plays. I decided to make the hubby happy and rent this movie, and even he was ready to eject it after about 15 minutes. I'm actually surprised he was allowed to release this tragedy of a film, let alone star in it. The movie actually starts out with a middle-school aged boy having a sexual relationship with a teacher, complete with an actual scene of them going at it and numerous references and what I assume were supposed to be jokes. I am nowhere near being a prude, but that was absolutely ridiculous. I hope for parent's sake they don't allow even older kids to watch this crap! If Sandler was going for shock value he missed his mark by about 500 miles. He is well into disgust value as far as we are concerned. I can't even honestly comment on the rest of the movie, as I didn't even WANT to give it a chance after the way it started. My only positive comment is that I am grateful I rented this from Redbox and am only out $1.30. That's a small price to pay to watch someone tank their career. I will never bother to rent an Adam Sandler movie again!!!!!",That's My Boy
249,paniloope,I think we should be more careful about our films content,5,29 October 2012,"In my opinion, Showing the sex between teacher and a 11-12 years old student and being encouraged by the other people, or showing this guy as a hero (!!) and worse, showing the sex between brother and sister even as a disaster, in a comic film, its not good anymore !!I, as a 34 years old woman who agrees with freedom in anything , do think we should not show such behaviors in the films just to make other people laugh !!This film teaches nothing unless bad points like having sexual relation in your school times makes you a hero !! And if a sister and brother have sex together ,it only results a little bad feeling in the others and that is finished !! I afraid where we are going !",That's My Boy
250,kfogelstrom,Vile and Atrocious,1,5 November 2012,"Who lets 9-14 year old child actors be involved in a film like this? We see a 30-yr-old teacher open her blouse and seduce a young boy. We hear them having sex in the back room while another young boy listens in. We hear (and then see!) them having sex on stage in front of a room full of other middle school age kids, who end up applauding the show. Absolutely appalling. Truly disgusting. This is humor? This is what we laugh at today?I've been talking about middle-schoolers, but yes, I did mention 9-year- olds. Later in the film, when a truly abhorrent sexual deviance is mentioned, a very young - I'm guessing around 9 - brother and sister look at each other in horror. Big laugh! Sick. The people who wrote this filth, and then dragged a bunch of young kids into it are true degenerates. Most adults - I hope - would protect their children from moral sewage like this. But these ""adults"" shoved these kids right into it. That's just the tip of this rotten iceberg. Gross and sexual humor can be funny, I'll admit. However, this film has no humor beyond what's generated by shocking the audience's sensibilities. But can we be shocked any more? I hope so, because if this is our new level of cultural jadedness, I hate to see where we're headed next as a society.Do yourself and your family a favor, and avoid this atrocity.

This is a sweet, funny, a bit naughty, heart warming movie filled with crazy fun and lots of laughs. Both my husband and I were laughing constantly throughout the movie. I would highly recommend the movie if you are up for a light hearted giggle. If you like Adam Sandler movies, you will definitely like this one. The jail seen is classic. Bachelor Party is too much.

Its like every actor in this movie have a over-confident sense of stupidness, and its like they'r giggling on the inside and having fun doing it.

We both agreed that we haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time. The cast was great. Then there are all of the little references that either you get or you don't and maybe that is where many people are getting lost. I thought it was funny when Donnie asks Ice if he still has the 5.0. I knew exactly what he was talking about. Then watching them both run to Ice Ice Baby was too funny and you could see Ice laughing also. This is meant to be goofy comedy and not serious drama people. All the different little cameos and everything were great also. The movie I saw was a 9 or a 10.,That's My Boy

Poor quality humor, obvious gags and a story line that was just totally unbelievable. Avoid at all costs as it is a waste of your life. Sandler usually comes up with something a little more decent than this so either he is hard up or has finally lost his ability to make people laugh trading on cheap stereotypes of females etc. If you are a woman you will be put off within the first 10 minutes by the endless stereotyping of women as sex objects.

I now see that I have to write at least 10 lines....You don't need 10 lines to say that something is truly awful! But here goes. Adam Sandler turns in a clique performance. We're supposed to be amused that he says 'fuck' in front of a grandma. We're supposed to be amused that the same grandma catches a baseball tossed at her and falls over in the process.

Adam Sandler's portrayal of Donny Berger is art. He truly captures the essence of what being a dirtbag means.

259,luispedro142,This movie changed my life.,10,21 August 2021,"Hilarious, dumb fun.These are just a few of the words that could be used to describe Adam Sandler's 2012 cinematic effort ""That's My Boy"".Adam Sandler is absolutely flawless in this movie, from the tax evasion to the gerontophilia, to the farts we've all grown to love over the years.Andy Samberg is an extremely welcome addition, with the SNL comedian turned parody musician putting in a performance of the highest caliber as Sandler's embarassed and distant son.The story starts several decades before the present, with a young version Adam Sandler's character being the victim of statutory rape by his female teacher. This is eventually uncovered and the teacher (played by Eva Amurri) gets arrested; However it is revealed that she is pregnant, and the court rules that once the baby is born, full custody will be granted to Donny Berger, Sandler's character.A montage follows, with Donny having become a minor celebrity due to his relationship with teacher.Suddenly the movie cuts to the present; Donny is now washed up and poor, and he is informed by his lawyer that he is 50,000 dollars in debt to the IRS and that if he cannot conjure up this money in the next 3 days, he will likely have to serve jail-time.Here is where the main plot point of the movie resides, Donny tries to seek out his former son in hopes that he will be able to bail his father out of this precarious situation.Donny strikes an agreement with a television producer that involves seeking out his son and filming a reunion show with his imprisoned mother, and in return they shall pay Donny the 50 thousand he needs to avoid jail.Donny eventually tracks his son down but finds that due to his questionable parenting, his son isn't the fondest of his old man and is also about to get married and doesn't want his embarrassing pops sniffing around ruining his big day.The chemistry between these two forms the core of the movie's plot and makes for an extremely interesting and hilarious dynamic.The movie contains a few cameos, most prominently, famous one hit wonder rapper Vanilla Ice. Ice acts well when he is scene with Sandler and interactions between the two make for a lot of laughs.This movie is amazing; It isn't smart, it isn't groundbreaking, the plot isn't well written, the actors aren't great, Sandler's voice will drive you insane; But yet, i watched this drunk in a discord voice call and i would not stop breaking out in laughter every few minutes, this movie is just that funny.",That's My Boy

While I regularly enjoy disgusting remarks in movies, I was often laughing at how bad the jokes in That's My Boy were rather than at their humor. Between Adam Sandler jacking off to an elderly woman, and the uncreative quips made about the statutory rape involving him and his teacher, I felt embarrassed for the actors who had to deliver the ultimately atrocious lines. And just when I thought the movie couldn't get any worse, it threw a horrific curve ball with the incorporation of incest to heighten the conflict between the bride and groom-to-be. The insertion of this was not only distasteful, but a weak attempt to add originality and intrigue to the already ridiculous plot line. That's My Boy is yet another representation of Adam Sandler's downfall as an actor, and modern cinema's desperation to push the limits too far past socially acceptable. An overwhelming disappointment.",That's My Boy

A lot of people are very negative about comedies like these because they are uptight D-Bags who cannot find humor in a highly inappropriate comedy. Adam Sandler Makes a lot of pg-13 rated movies, so I was glad that he decided to make an R-rated comedy and some people just cant handle that kind of what they refer to as ""Filth"".

SHAMEFUL FILM.,1,15 April 2015,"I went into watching this film thinking it would just be another Adam Sandler film, maybe a little bit less quality than The Waterboy but might be good for some cheap laughs. As a big Andy Samberg fan, I was also willing to give the movie a shot. I was wrong. I feel sick for even using my internet to watch this on Netflix. I got about 10 minutes in before I felt too uncomfortable and had to turn it off. Even my boyfriend felt too uncomfortable to continue watching it, and we both generally have a pretty non-PC, dark sense of humour. The premise of this film as described by IMDb is that ""While in his teens, Donny fathered a son, Todd, and raised him as a single parent up until Todd's 18th birthday."" What is not mentioned is that he was TWELVE when he first began engaging in the sexual relations that would eventually lead to this child (as his Bat Mitzvah is shown after the first sexual encounter, thus implying that he is under the age of 13) but that the child he fathered was with his much older TEACHER. A teacher having sexual relations with a 12 year old student is not a funny plot line, it is not something to base a comedy on - it's rape. And what's worse, is that he is then glorified within society for being able to ""bang his hot teacher."" I don't understand how this ever became a film. Don't even give anyone involved in this awful production the satisfaction of watching it. This is film is nothing more than wrong.",That's My Boy

I walked away from this film to go and clean out the cat litter tray, which I can honestly say was much more entertaining and more tasteful that this utter tripe. Adam Sandler must be really getting desperate for work if he is accepting scripts like this. The content was completely cringe worthy and it is clear to see that was the script writer's mainstay in securing the deal for the movie. There is obviously a market for this sort of rubbish (trash) which has been pinpointed with pure accuracy by the financial backers for the movie... ""ah.. where shall we pitch this??.

The plot was original, and supporting roles by other great actors helped push this movie over the edge for me into the ""excellent"" category.All in all, if you're a fan of Sandler's other movies I would recommend checking this one out. It's better than ""The Wedding Singer"" which over-time has become a minor-comedy classic, and on-par with ""Billy Madison"" and ""Happy Gilmore"".In short - don't miss it because of the low ratings on IMDb!",That's My Boy

Probably schmaltzy and predictable but ""nice"".When the classroom scene turns out to be real rather than a dream that the teenager wakes up from, the movie goes downhill as in over the side of a deep deep dark well.There is clever wellthoughtout intelligent humour and there is mindless, bottom of the barrel 'humour' which relies on foul language and all the other low grade traits mentioned in the other reviews.My fault for not establishing that it had a sub_R rating.I cringed until fortunately, the clever TV decided that the video quality was so poor that it went into standby mode and then I cut the movie halfway and replaced it with ""Promised Land"", a thousand times better quality show.Would I touch another Adam Sandler movie? Not a chance! Looks like even Adam Sandler and his backers misread the number of viewers who would make them money on this zero-level performance. (The 1 out of 10 is for the opening 4 minutes when there was still hope)",That's My Boy
268,paynemark-92100,"Yes, He is the Worst",1,9 April 2019,"I was reading the review before this one, and the person commented that if you think this is a bad movie, you haven't seen very many movies.
Really? I don't care if I've never seen another movie in my life, I can tell you this is another awful film by Adam Sandler.
Nobody makes movies that are as bad as this so called actor, comedian. Honestly, anybody who can sit through a movie with Sandler as the star deserves a medal.
He never changes his character. It's always the same lame portrayal of an immature, child like character, with the same personality disorder that borders on mentally ill.
He is the most unfunny comedian to ever appear on the screen. I feel sorry for the person who wrote a positive review for this movie. He obviously has lost touch with what is funny, and what is not funny at all.
Adam Sandler is by far the worst actor working in Hollywood, hands down. Anybody who finds him funny needs to take a long hard look at themselves.",That's My Boy
269,brie_mcconnell,"Beneath the comedy, it's deeply disturbing",1,15 August 2018,"When a movie starts out with a premise of ""amusing"" child abuse, you know it's going to go low. And wow did it go low. Completely degrading to women, this movie shamelessly rolls around in fat jokes, racial slurs, and an utterly horrible script. Andy Samberg's performance is the only saving race, but by 20 minutes you just feel completely sorry for him.",That's My Boy
270,jacksonlord-91795,Hilarious comedy - Sandler is on fire!,10,30 October 2019,"Adam Sandler has once again proven on the big screen that he is in fact an all time acting hall of famer! A riveting tale of an estranged father returning to shepherd his son through a turbulent love feud, only to learn a few things on the journey... And boy doesn't big Adam Sandler just put on an absolute clinic on the acting front, they should be using this movie to teach acting because this is an all time masterclass!",That's My Boy
271,kuzminskivz,"Great movie, very underrated",10,9 April 2019,"This is one of the better movies I've watched in a while, and I laughed my ankle off. I really find it highly underrated, as it can totaly be watched in the 'unironic' way and still make you have a great time doing so. Great acting and storyline.",That's My Boy
272,chris_jcz,An instant classic!! I couldn't stop laughing!!,10,1 October 2012,"Firstly I just have to say, what is going on with all these negative reviews? I cant understand it! I have been a Sandler fan since his early stuff; I even saw his crappy cruise ship movie.. I have always been a true fan and stayed true despite some of the awful stuff he has produced.. That being said, this film is an instant classic!! My girlfriend was getting worried because she has never seen me laughing like I did to this movie and she couldn't tell if I was OK.. Like I said before, many Sandler movies have sucked of resent, but as far as I am concerned this movie completely wipes the slate clean.. Sandler is hear by completely forgiven for all the rubbish after producing this absolute gem! The only possible way this movie can have so many negative reviews is because those who did review it badly went into watching this with a closed mind and had already decided long before they saw it that this was going to be terrible.. Either that or they saw a pirated version and couldn't hear a word they were saying.. Or maybe they are in an intimate relationship with one of their family members and this film cut a little too close to the bone (haha only joking).. Also, as usual this movie has a completely awesome soundtrack! Crammed full of classic tunes that perfectly capture the mood of each scene.. And the casting was absolutely perfect! Please if you are reading this review and considering whether to watch it, I have only one piece of advice; watch this movie with an open mind because it will blow you away :)",That's My Boy
273,cfoster-52167,Hilarious,10,22 January 2018,"Short and sweet, I have no idea how or why this film is rated so lowly it's hilarious and really entertaining. Adam Sandler is hit and miss bit this is awesome, watch it and enjoy.",That's My Boy
274,patso-47726,"Totally hilarious and 100% NOT ""Politically Correct.""",10,4 March 2018,"Well, I guess it flopped at the movie box office, BUT, it was definitely a 10 out 10 Star comedy to me. I laughed at times so hard I cried. To all guys (40 +), if you haven't seen it yet, you've got to see this movie. Without a doubt, the funniest Adam Sandler movie since ""Happy Gilmore."" Hilarious one liners and 100% NOT ""politically correct."" DEFINITELY worth watching ( a true ""guy"" flick). Enjoy!. :0)",That's My Boy
275,byrdmanryan,Cinematic Masterpiece,10,8 July 2018,"Having watched this film many times, it keeps getting better and better. Very rarely do you find a movie that has comedy, drama, action, pop culture and sports references, and amazing Massachusetts accents. This film is a masterpiece through and through, and can be laughed at and enjoyed for decades to come.",That's My Boy
276,bobdigipf,I LOVE this movie!!! One of the funniest movies ever.,10,5 June 2021,"People are crazy... How could you score this movie a 1? It has so many quotable lines, awesome cameos and Adam killed it as Donnie Burger. Don't listen to these weirdos. If you're a sensitive snowflake then don't watch comedies.",That's My Boy
