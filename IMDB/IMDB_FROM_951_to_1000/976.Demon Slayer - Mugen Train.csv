0,CinemaSerf,Western studios could learn a lesson about storytelling from this film.,7,9 June 2021,"From the outset, I knew nothing about the series that preceded this cleverly structured and engaging animated feature from Harpo Sotozaki. The young ""Tanjirô"" has seen his family killed and his young sister possessed by a demon. Determined to avenge himself on these shapeless menaces, he begins to train to become a demon-slayer under the tutelage of ""Kyôjurô"". The demons feast on human beings, so when they are charged with investigating some terrible goings-on on the ""Mugen"" night train, they encounter quite a bit more than they bargained for... Its good fun, this - the story mixes action and character development quite effortlessly, and the standard of animation is consistently high culminating in quite a compelling twenty minutes at the end. I did find it a little too long, but for the most part the interweaving timelines and the sparing but effective use of dialogue made for an enjoyable film to watch. The colourful creativity of the art work works better on a cinema screen; the details of the drawings - light, shade, shadow - especially during the latter part of the film really does lend itself to big screen exposure. The soundtrack isn't bad, either - it compliments rather than dictates the pace of the story leaving us with a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining piece of cinema.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
1,neil-476,Only for people who already know and love the franchise,5,29 May 2021,"Three people (one of whom may have a boar's head or may just be wearing a mask) are junior demon slayers on a train with a demon problem.I like Japanese animation and I like horror-oriented stuff so, without knowing anything about this, I was expecting to enjoy it simply from the title. However, I knew nothing at all about the history of this particular franchise, and the film assumes that the average audience member is very familiar with quite a lot of continuity from manga and TV. The film appears to start during a story which has been going on for some time, with characters who you are already supposed to know. This seems to be borne out by the enormous success of this film in Japan.I found it really, really hard work. There are certainly some amazing visuals, but there are also some of the worst Japanese animation tendencies on display - overlapping still frames, close ups of eyes and tears with gently vibrating outlines and so on. Some of the characters - much loved, no doubt - are bizarre and unsympathetic. The storytelling might be effective, but not if you have no foreknowledge.This was a disappointment.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
2,morrison-dylan-fan,Slaying the demon.,8,29 May 2021,"Months before the Demon Slayer TV series hit Netflix UK,I became aware of the film version,after seeing on Charting with Dan Murrell reports of it breaking box office records in Japan,at a time when think pieces were claiming that the death of cinema was about to take place. Finding just one showing taking place at my local cinema,I got set to at last board the train.View on the film:Revealing that season 2 of the show will follow the aftermath of the movie, the screenplay by the ""Ufotable"" team adapts Koyoharu Gotouge's Manga with a gripping continuation of the hero's journey which Tanjiro Kamado is on, which is tied into nightmare lucid dreams that blur the lines between the demon slaying Horror fighting with Enmu,and the personal demons which haunt Tanjiro's memories.Not limited in this case to the runtime of under 30 minutes that each episode has, series director Haruo Sotozaki makes a dazzling feature film debut,with spectacular,ultra-stylised hand-drawn animation drawing the Gothic Horror demon slaying across the screen,as slick panning shots run across the colourful, detailed battle sequences.Cleverly,using CGI in a limited manner, Sotozaki blends the contrasting formats to paint a depth of field in the spectacular Akaza becoming one with the train,which goes off the rails towards an explosive, emotionally charged final confrontation between Akaza and Rengoku, as Tanjiro wakes from his nightmare to slay a demon.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
3,Mr-Fusion,So pretty,7,4 November 2021,"Had no idea what I was walking into, that's as frank as I can make it. Out of nowhere my kid has a love for Demon Slayer and here I am along for the ride. But she's seen the show and I had no context. Here we have a bunch of people on a train, one of them really excited about his bento box (""Umai! ... Umai!""), another wearing a boar's head, now everyone's asleep and pretty soon the fighting begins . . .That said . . .It is a gorgeous film. The battle scenes are exciting, the animation is superb, and the high quality bears out (Tanjiro's water effects are crazy).Purely on a visual level, I enjoyed this film. I have no doubt that any self-respecting anime fan is scoffing at my ignorance, but it is what it is. Mugen Train is easy on the eyes.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
4,Movi3DO,Breathtaking,8,3 May 2021,"Set Your Heart Ablaze..... Rengoku-sanAh finally back at the theater. It sure felt good. This is the Mugen train arc that was set up at the end of season 1 of Demon Slayer.I expected the same level of animation in the anime, and this movie delivered that aspect the best way it could. It was pleasure for my eyes to see the flame, water, and thunder breathing techniques on display. The action scenes were breathtaking and intense.My problem was that the plot was pretty simple, which made the movie felt too short. I wanted to learn more about the characters, especially Rengoku, and even the demons. The emotion did not hit as high as it could.Overall, the movie was still a blast. 8.5/10.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
5,legobuilderpro,demon slayer,8,28 April 2021,"Having seen the anime I loved this movie. Outstanding animation and likable characters (tanjiro, zenitsu, inosuke).(Saw in japanese with english subtitles)Really funny and emotionally investing scenes with awesome looking fight scenes.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
6,jp_91,Almost perfect!,7,23 May 2021,"""Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen Ressha-Hen"" is a good animated film, the script is cool, the music score is wonderful and the animation is beautiful. The story is gory and funny, the first 90 minutes are really awesome, but the last 30 minutes are weak. Good anime movie but not perfect!",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
7,0w0,Wasted dream sequences and stupid characters,5,9 May 2021,"The movie has about 10minutes of non-essential crap stuffed into it with unnecessary dream sequences. This 10 minutes of dream sequences add NOTHING to the story or the series' plot. It's literally wasting 10 minutes of screen time, for mindless drivel.The other big issue is the fact that Kyojuro Rengoku was portrayed like an idiot in this movie.... like somebody who doesn't take fighting seriously and somebody who when fighting doesn't give 110% from the start. This is purely done by the show's creators to build fake suspense and to create a fictitious ending for the movie. ANY time that a character doesn't give 110% from the very start of the fight when facing a very powerful opponent, it is poor writing by the show's creators and especially when it's as poorly done as it was in the Kyojuro Rengoku fight, then it just spoils the character's legacy and completely spoils the 'twist ending', which I was able to see coming miles away.Overall these two dumb design decisions by the show's creators above, really brings the movie down from what could have been an 8/10, to a 5/10. It's not worth watching in the cinemas either, as it really is just 2 bad episodes from the show that are stitched together. 5/10 as a movie, and considering that you'd normally pay to watch it, i'd even bring that down to 4/10 because it's costing you money. Very poor showing from an otherwise good series.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
8,raybennetthays,Might just be my new favorite film of the year.,10,16 July 2021,"Rengoku is awesome in this film, and you understand why everyone looks up to him.I just have to state the most obvious thing though, this animation is truly breathtaking, if you love the show you're going to love this movie.To be honest I just had a great time watching it, me and my friends all loved it, not to mention the fight scenes are impeccable.Definitely an A+",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
9,garethcrook,Wild,6,26 May 2021,"It probably would've helped if I'd seen the TV series that spawned his film. I've had a little background from my clued up daughter, but really I'm going in cold. We're at the cinema though, this is the first film I've seen on a big screen in nearly two years. It needs to be seen on a big screen really, it's all about the spectacle. This is a shame seeing as it's only screening for one day in the UK. The plot. It's pretty straightforward. There are demons, that are bad and demon slayers, that are good. Some young slayers including Tanjiro, his sister who's in a box with a muzzle because she's a demon (but a good one) and a dude wearing a boar mask (I thought he was a boar for a large part of the film) are boarding a train to meet and learn from a Hashira who's some kind of demon slayer master who doesn't blink. He's there though to protect the passengers from a demon on board, who seems styled on one of Tim Burton's fantasies, with a detachable hand with its own mouth that's reminiscent of Thing from the Addams Family. It's very trippy, our heroes attacked in their dreams as they're put to sleep, the demon taking over the train in a weird flubber meets The Abyss tendrils, with millions of eyes that pop out of nowhere. It looks very cool. There is an odd mix of animation styles though, from quite simple flat comic book stuff to scenes with beautiful depth. The fight scenes though of which there are many are where it excels. The pace is blistering, the screen awash with colour as as techno rock score blasts away. It's pretty frenetic and to be honest the story is very simple at its core. It's fun though, but I'm not sure I'll be getting into the TV show. I've already missed three seasons. So it's good guys killing bad guys, moral codes, fighting with honour. I feel like I've missed a lot of the back story, but it still works as a stand-alone film.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
10,kaefab,Very good movie to follow the series,7,3 May 2021,Graphics are amazing the story is good pretty sure we will have a sequel.But even better the music they chose was amazing.All in all very violent not for kids but a great anime for adults.,Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
11,colewaters,I'm in awe,10,14 May 2021,I am in awe of how beautiful the animation was and how wonderful the movie was. It was by far the best anime movie I have seen.,Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
12,akshatmahajan,Nearly Perfect,9,12 May 2021,"I liked the anime but was not impressed that they are continuing anime with movie. After I finished the movie, i realize that I shouldn't have worried about this thing from the start. Every scene in this movie was really well planed. Action, comedy, drama everything was balanced. Composition of action and conversation in between were also balanced. (This thing is difficult to balance but they did it). Rengoku's character was well written. I started admiring him and felt very sad at what happened at the end.I watched the movie at home but I think it deserves theatre experience. Overall, a great watch.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
13,Darkjak007,Delicious! Delicious! Delicious!,8,8 August 2021,"Tanjiro and the others arrive on the Mugen train to meet with the Fire Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku who's investigating the disappearance of people on this train. None of them knowing that this is all part of a plan orchestrated by one of lower rank Kizuki Enmu. *Disclaimer* it is worth noting that unlike most films that are non-canon to the main story. This film is Canon to the manga and if you haven't watched the first season or read to the rehabilitation arc then this movie is a huge spoiler. The first half of the story is more character driven as we delve into the dreams, the minds of the characters. The most part inosuke and Zenitsu don't really have much to offer until later on. The main focus of the story in kept on Rengoku and Tanjiro. The two of quickly develop a bond between them and Kyojuro offers him wisdom that Tanjiro takes to heart as he still blames himself for his family death. Second-half comes around this is where things start to really get intense. The fighting is so crisp and clean this a feature length that's to be expected. However when you actually look at it you can see just how close the show is to this quality. They're are just so over the top and intense especially near the finale you can get lost in it. The setting is of course on a train which offers a compact secluded environment, but if you're expected to see multiple locations you'll be just a little disappoint the entire film takes place on the train. Overall the movie the first looks like it's gonna be more slow burn her things do escalated rather quickly start it and it offers an interesting story intense action and stunning Visuals. The music is beautiful and the visuals and animation is beautiful, once again offering a perfect mixture between CG and Hand drawn.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
14,coombsstephen,First time at a film like this and was pleasantly surprised,7,15 June 2021,I only went to see this film after seeing is score on imbd but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.There was plenty of action and a good plot. I didn't understand a lot of it but it was good fun.I would go again to see another film like this.,Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
15,fluffset,its good!,9,10 March 2021,"I wont say the best but its really good, full of every anime recipe. This is my first time watching anime movie in cinema its worth it. Feel like gonna watch again!",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
16,jackgdemoss,Potent visual and auditory highs met by a story that leaves too much in the tank,8,26 April 2021,"I so desperately wanted this film to blow my mind and become my new favorite of all time. It has been a long time coming for shonen anime to capitalize on American markets in a big way. I have no doubts that Demon Slayer will find great financial success here, given that it is the top box office of all time in Japan and the market for season 1 of the show was huge here. I just wish it blew the doors open in an even bigger way.Mugen train is a direct continuation of season 1 of the wildly popular anime Demon Slayer. The animation in the show was already impressive, but it was promised that the studio behind the movie is in an entirely different league. This turned out to be true and then some, with some of the most pulse-pounding, breath-taking action animation I have ever seen. What can't be understated is the brilliant score that pushed these animations to new heights.The story is gripping, with few dull moments and no plot holes. It even had some big surprises that turn the story on a dime. The problem I had with it is that I expect more from shonen anime. I expect some sense of doom and gloom when the protagonist realizes that the antagonist is far beyond his/her power, or vice versa. I expect an even greater threat to be introduced upon the conclusion of any victory. Demon Slayer does both of these things, but meekly.Ultimately, this is a great movie to watch in theatres for the spectacle, even if you haven't seen the show. Seeing the show may add some more depth to the jokes or empathy for the characters, but it certainly isn't necessary. I recommend this film to anyone who has the maturity to brush off the stereotypes of who should or shouldn't go to a shonen anime in theatres.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
17,ramisaakter,Amazing,8,4 May 2021,"I started watching Japanese anime after Death note and everytime it surprises me with its unique fantasy story. It was my first anime movie and I must admit, it's worth watching.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
18,coasterdude44,A truly awesome anime feature,10,1 March 2021,"I had so much fun with this movie, it was only playing in a theatre a half an hour drive away from where I live so I drove to the theatre and was blown away by just how good it was.The animation was amazing. It's was fluid, kinetic and very crisp and detailed. I was a bit hesitant on watching it at first, since I knew this movie would hold some major spoilers for the seiries, and I've only watched the first episode of the anime show since I've only known about it for a week since discovering it on Netflix. This movie does have major spoilers though, but I encourage you to see this in a theatre as soon as you can if tv spoilers bother you or not.I was worried that the whole movie being set on a train would get stale fast, but it is always exciting and doesn't drag a bit. If watching Train To Busan taught me anything, it's that movies set in limited spaces such as trains can still be constantly exciting if it stays engaging. This movie just like Train To Busan isn't entirely set on the train, there are flashbacks and an action sequence seperate from the train.Anyway this was an exceptional movie with very good direction and animation. It was thrilling and also very emotional. Don't miss this one",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
19,MK_movie_reviews,So disappointed. I couldn't enjoy it at all.,1,24 August 2021,Is this comedy or serious action-adventure? Is this movie or TV series? I don't understand. I quit watching. Only for kids.,Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
20,umlaziking,I dont care what anyone else says,10,23 May 2021,"This movie is a masterpiece, the story is on point, the characters are amazingly awesome and very well animated. This movie might not be one of the greatest animes or movies of all time...but its definitely the best film of 2021 so far....a movie that focuses on story instead of politics is a movie that should be supported and watched by everyone and this movie is surely part of that rank. Great movie, awesome movie and deserves a 10, definitely deserves to be in the top 250 films of all time in imdb also.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
21,Radu_A,Hard to meet the expectations...,8,28 April 2021,"... as this is now the highest-grossing film in Japan by a very long shot. It made 40 billion Yen followed by ""Spirited Away"" with almost 32 billion (and ""Titanic"" with a measly 26 billion). So it is proof of the strength of the Japanese industry as opposed to most other countries (except India), in that domestic animation totally overrules Disney (as it should everywhere).Its enormous success has a lot to do with a lack of alternatives, with no US features theatrically released in CoVid year. And it's really not as great as ""Spirited Away"", which is a totally unforgettable classic. Still, for a tie-in film it's very good and gives the characters from the series more depth.Lots of the suspicious three-liner reviews here neglect the story, so I'll tell you this much: there are two parts involving two villains, the first of which taking place in the title-giving demon train. This will be pleasing for fans of the series, but those who took issue with the support characters going overboard all the time - brace yourselves. The 2D/3D mix doesn't work so well, and they should have come up with something more original than tentacles, but the action is non-stop and the premise enticing. Still, if it would end after 85 minutes, it would be nothing special.But then the really bad guy shows up. And the really awesome hero must show his marbles. And this is pure joy and the most spectacular 2D animation this side of Heaven. And yes, the resolution is extremely moving, unless your heartstrings snap along the way. It's totally insane and divine. So you have a slow 2/3rds along the lines of what you'd expect and then a glorious third act that elevates it above the ""Fate/Stay Night"" films.I'd still call ""Attack on Titan"" the better franchise but that's not for kids and on a whole other level of awe. This one is OK to take your 12-year-olds to as the violence is sufficiently rooted in fantasy and they're gonna watch it anyway.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
22,timeblank,Not a Fan but Amazing Work of Art,9,6 May 2021,I may be new to this show. However the cinematography and art was amazing. The characters are enjoyable. I Love the music. The ending was unexpectedly tragic. I was hoping for more. A dream powered demon had more screen time than the third rank demon. Who knew that their were two villains in the movie. The fight sequences were top-notch.My only concern is that some characters talk too much. It Gives the movie some drag time. I only wish they could get on with it instead of whining or explaining a lot. Just act on it. Sometimes the characters overreact and it's annoying.Their scenes that have life-changing decisions and this movie gave me a great experience. Even though I am not a fan of the Demon Slayer. This movie inspired me to be a fan. I am happy for that.,Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
23,Morejambo54,Uuuuuhhhh what saddest bruh ever,10,27 May 2021,"This movie isn't even a movie or at least it doesn't use the same formula as any other. It's pretty much action for 3/4 of the movie, and the action is absolutely incredible! It's so fluid and amazingly thought out and it comes together so well! The crazy thing is this movie all takes place in the one area, excellent use of setting throughout. There is quite a bit of cgi aswell but it looks pretty good compared to most anime. The start may be a bit slow and it may not have a real focus but just keep watching it gets reeeaaally great. The main character of the show is in the shade of the side characters as well, it really does an amazing job of create a central focus on this new character while still having other main characters feel a part of the movie. Until the end...the action shuts up and the tears start :( bruh...it so sad. It's so well done I can't put into words how baffling the ending is. If you've seen the show you gotta continue it sooo good and it leaves it for future projects. :D.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
24,isaacsundaralingam,What you think about this movie depends on what you think about the series,7,2 May 2021,"Demon Slayer: Mugen Train is a movie that was looked forward to universally with as much hype as possible. And when it eventually did come out, the reviews were great and so was its box office performance. And ever since, this movie has been a pretty big deal amongst the anime community.I finally was able to watch it, and I guess I'm a little underwhelmed by the whole thing. My reaction to this movie was very similar to how I felt about the series, and I think the same can be said of everyone. The series, in my opinion, is a decently enjoyable B-Tier anime with 1 exceptionally phenomenal episode. But that's just my take on it and I'm aware I'm in the minority here, because the amount of love this series has garnered is almost unbelievably massive and universal. So what Mugen Train caters to is exactly that demographic of fans (as so it should), meaning that for someone like me who found very little to go crazy about in the series, would find very little to go crazy about in this movie. But if you're one of those who loved the series for its goofiness and style, then this movie is in every way a treat.I don't think Mugen Train was a bad movie in any way. It was decently enjoyable and had its little moments. The plot is pretty straight forward but makes very little sense if you even stop to think about it. The progress was lazily convenient and the stakes never felt real until at the very end of the movie. The humor was pretty goofy and the characters were as over-the-top as they were in the series... Enjoyable, still The animation was pretty good and consistent throughout; especially the action scenes that were choreographed as well as they were in the series. The colors, the visuals, the music... they're all pretty great and add to the visually pleasing appeal of the movie.In conclusion, this movie doesn't add anything to the medium in any meaningful way, but it stays true to its style and convention as that is what people love most about the Demon Slayer universe. If you loved the series, you'll love this movie... Go for it!",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
25,jasminn_tan,Incredible,10,15 October 2021,"I read the manga so I knew what would happen but seeing it animated just brought another level of heartbreak to me. With the amazing animation and background music, I was engrossed in this movie. Also, the final fight scene between Rengoku and the Upper Rank Three demon was probably one of the best fight scenes I've watched so far. Granted, I haven't watched many fight scenes. Still, it was such a pleasure to watch.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
26,TreeFiddy53,"Would have given 6, but +1 for the stunning visuals.",7,11 June 2021,"Visually STUNNING but still a let down for me. I liked it better than the anime, though!I had issues with the pacing, misplaced comedy and character building with the anime, same issues with the movie. I didn't get the hype then, don't get it now.Don't get me wrong, I'd have gladly watched 52 episodes instead of the 26 from season 01. Would have liked the movie as a 26 episode show instead of a < 2 hr movie. Why rush it, especially people will pay for more content!? *smh*The movie is a visual treat nevertheless, has some hype music in parts, and shows glimpses of how amazing it could be (for me to enjoy it) but this style of storytelling isn't for me so I'll let you make your own opinion.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
27,TheGreatGreenBadger,I've read the manga. I expected the best. It will definitely deliver.,10,18 October 2020,"Ufotable is honestly on a roll with the hit Demon Slayer series. It's simply bloody fantastic but also has a lot of heart, as a lot of people will see in this movie, which introduces one of the other Hashiras of the Demon Slayer Corps.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
28,Luv2Spooge,"Decent, but nothing spectacular",5,14 June 2021,"Truth is, this is just for the fanboys. Not having seen the original series, this movie didn't resonate with me at all. The animation is good, but so are many animes. I just don't care for this style, a little too Pokemonish. Whole story is simple and cliche, action is mediocre. It's no Macross, but it has its moments.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
29,Jack_C_,Nonstop action,9,14 May 2021,"Demon Slayer. You've seen it, you love it, so you have to watch Mugen Train. The story continues demonic battles with our three newbie heros, but on a train with Rengoku's help.You'll cringe, you'll cheer, and you'll cry. You will walk away wondering why anime movies are not all made at this quality. The battles are intense, but not quite as beautiful as Rui vs Tanjiro. Hence the 9.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
30,hiraishinnojutsu,"Ummmm..... yeah I think it's fine, I guess",8,20 June 2021,"Sorry, not a fan of Demon Slayer, but everyone's been talking about it even before they announced this movie. Then this movie came out, everyone's just crazy about it. Can't really understand the hype about the series, I mean, visually it's good, the animation is fluid as hell, the story? Not so much, just your average shonen series. Then I saw how crazily people rate the movie after its release, so I decided to give it a change. Well, I might say I had a good time, it's worth your time if you're relaxing from some tedious, exhausting work, a great and emotional watch for the series' fans. Even for the non-fans, it's still visually compelling and awe-inducing. Go check it out...",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
31,the-fearless-america,What a vibrant movie,9,16 October 2021,"The newly continuing series of demon slayer: kimetsu no yaiba, with very vibrant art direction and breathtaking action scenes. The producing team also was genius, making the continuing anime series into a movie, that turning into one of the best profitable movie of all time in japan.From all perspective, the storyline, animation or art direction, musics, etc. This movie is flawless.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
32,william-eugensson,A great continuation of the series,7,12 September 2021,I don't think I could tell this apart from the first season of demon slayer...which is not bad just stating that this could as well have been part of a season.The visuals are stunning and the soundtrack phenomenal.,Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
33,jaysshukla,Quite wholesome,9,29 April 2021,"Its tricky to write a review for this one because it is not really an usual movie but it's an anime arc and a very serious and the detailed one indeed. As a movie, it was beautiful I would say. Throughout the movie, you would feel various emotions. Some scenes are cute and wholesome, some are sad, filled with regrets, there is a bit of comic relief as well. You may find yourself having a good laugh initially but the ending is sad and emotional.Now, coming back to reviewing it as an arc, this is how it overall went :Story : Beautifully executed. Even though, Enmu was dealt sooner than we expected, the writing is totally justified. We didn't really get to see how Inosuke managed to wake up and break free of that dream but apart from that it was all no-nonsense stuff. There was a thrill but no unnecessary stretching or no unnecessary badasseries. There are few comic relief and cute moments as well. Also, there are quite few classy quotes and I can't get enough of them.Characters : We cannot say that both the villains were purposeless. They are demons and are brilliantly written. By the end of the movie, their respective mindsets were described pretty well. Rengoku too is brilliantly written but I felt we deserved to know more about his father or Rengoku's viewpoint about his father. I am not really sure if we get to know more about him in the upcoming arc. Regardless, Rengoku seemed closer to his mother. Tanjirou as usual a very wholesome character and keeps giving you various feels. But overall, the show belonged to Inosuke. If you guys were waiting for his character development, this is that moment. The movie doesn't offer much to Zenitsu and Nezuko fans but despite that, they do have their respective moments. And rest assured, you will definitely get to hear ""Kaminari no kokyu, ichi no kata. Hekireki Issen!!!""Art : Outstanding animation. Combined with sound effects, it almost feels like a never-seen-before stuff.Sound : I am yet to browse the titles but one thing is for sure, each of those OSTs are absolute fire. We could not have asked for better. Rengoku fans should not miss the end credits.Overall, I enjoyed every bit of this movie.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
34,sme3,Starts Slow but Finishes Strong,5,15 May 2021,"Fans of the television series on which this film is based likely will be moved by this film. However, it is less-accessible to viewers unfamiliar with the characters, situations, and lore established in the series. The film starts out slow, but it steadily picks up speed. Some of the action scenes are quite spectacular, exciting, and intense. While moving, the ending drags on a bit too long. The visuals are impressive, but the animation lacks the fluidity of movement common in many animated features.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
35,CantileverCaribou,Would Train Slayer Be a More Appropriate Title?,4,27 September 2021,"I actually quite like the series, enough to give it a 7/10, but this movie is boring and lousy. There was a lot of strong potential for the villain's dream manipulation powers, but it leads to mostly non-satisfying emotional claptrap that's just a retread of Tanjiro's obvious feelings towards his dead family--it actually feels a bit like a recap episode. A few of the segments with the children invading their dreams are a bit stronger, more original, and with more emotional weight.The camerawork is typically frantic and more frenetic than the average anime, just like the series, but the CGI is somehow more grating here, probably due to the linear repetition and blandness of the train.The fight with the train baddie is too simple and repetitive, and his backstory is pretty shallow for being the central villain. There's not enough time for character development of anyone, and the fiery-headed swordsman accompanying the main characters is very empty and won't be missed.The final fight is flashy and much better than what precedes it, but it's not like there's much in the way of strategy. It's pretty much just a slug fest.Not really sure why they felt the need to make this into a movie, instead of a 2-3 episode arc in season 2. Here's hoping season 2 is better than this jalopy.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
36,pradeepcindidimple,Must Watch,8,14 June 2021,"#DemonSlayerTheMovieMugenTrain (2020)
One of the best anime films of all-time, filled with comedy mixed with emotional and action filled moments.There aren't any words for how beautiful the scenery and animation were in small moments.Overall, this is one of the greatest films ever to be seen and I hope you all enjoy it!I recommend this movie to every single person who has previously watched the series.#Anime #Otaku.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
37,Brad_G35,MASTERFUL!,10,23 April 2021,"I'm so glad this movie got an American release. If you loved the animation of the first season, this is an absolute must-see. Find the biggest screen you can and enjoy!The animation. The characters. The situations. The music. The action. The demons. It's all great.Also, try to find a theater with a good sound system. The surround sound really was on another level with the fights.What a movie!",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
38,abhibnlcs,"Action, Emotions, Heart-Break - Beautiful!!",10,1 May 2021,Please watch it in Japanese with subtitles. The story and the way they ended it made me shed couple of tears for how beautiful it was. Outstanding voice acting by the Japanese performers.,Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
39,michaelxqh,Finally,6,8 May 2021,"From 2020 to 2021, I've been waiting for too long for this movie. The most profitable movie of Japan, and probably one of the most sensational film of the entire Asia in 2020. ""Magen train"" continues the story of Tanjiro and his adventure as a demon slayer, the mission of investigating the Magen train with Flame Hashira ended in the death of the Lower One and the sacrifice of Kyujuro in exchange of the safety of 200 passengers. Y tambien, the entrance of the Upper Three marks the following story of demons and the developing trio. The skill and level of animation is absolutely unshakable, and the detailing presentation of the new character Kyujuro, a faithful and flame-like leader, are an undeniable success. However, the exquisite recreation of the comic isn't always a positive aspect, the excess (explanatory) conversation and overly emotional expressions creates a crevasse to the storyline. Plus the immature way of narration... I guess if we watch the whole story on a comic, the strangeness wouldn't be so protruding, but they decided to make a movie. At least the last part of the film is both touching and somewhat philosophical. I hope seeing more works of this great anime.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
40,AdityaDev007,(Kharcha OP) Animazing Sequel,9,30 April 2021,"Sequel of an Anime Series in Movie should be made like this that every single watcher can jump off from the seat from the dose of joyfullness and every emotion can be tweaked by the sequence with build up.I am so happy yet so sad that couldn't watch this in theatres it would have be an pleasure to my eyes if I would have able to watch this in Indian theatres all thanks to the mindfu*king virus the lockdown didn't let the theatres open and I have to enjoy this Piece of Art on my Phone but still it was very very eye pleasing if by any chance the theatres release this movie in India I will definitely go and watch after all it's an Ufotable movie.For Demon Slayer Anime it's an amazing continuation with some amazing,stunning,dazzling Animation and Soundtracks which did justice to the Demon Slayer Story beautifully so it is absolutely a must watch just follow the series you'll love it.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
41,spainahmad,"Emotional, deep and Awesome!",10,28 April 2021,"Season 1 of demon slayer was not that serious, it was a bit generic and overrated.But this movie made the series so much more mature and meaningful.This is not about a ""boy who isn't talented and wants to get stronger"" (naruto, black clover, my hero academia etc..).This is a war between Humans and Demons, and War is always tragic. So much lives are lost in wars, which makes both sides suffer even the winner.Those last 30 minutes were a roller coaster of emotions and amazing animation.Thank you ufotable for this gem.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
42,Camerenth,Beautiful Continuation to the anime,9,27 April 2021,Must watch for all fans of the show. This has the emotional depth and the beautiful animation of the show. The climax comes out unexpectedly but still reaches the emotion we have seen in the show.,Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

44,schanzaysohail,Just like Season 1 but Better!,9,26 May 2021,"Yes this Movie was a continuation of the Season 1 of demon Slayer not sure if it is canon or not but it did have the same animators and voice actors. Anyone who liked the first Season of Demon Slayer will absolutely love this, anyone who has watched the first season of the show must watch it. SO worth the time. This time with better Animation and More powerful demons. Just wish it had more of the backstory like why they were boarding there train for people who haven't watched season 1 besides that absolutely I loved it.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
45,ahmxd,Amazing...!,9,3 November 2021,"This movie isn't even a movie or at least it doesn't use the same formula as any other. It's pretty much action for 3/4 of the movie, and the action is absolutely incredible! It's so fluid and amazingly thought out and it comes together so well! The crazy thing is this movie all takes place in the one area, excellent use of setting throughout. There is quite a bit of cgi aswell but it looks pretty good compared to most anime. The start may be a bit slow and it may not have a real focus but just keep watching it gets reeeaaally great. The main character of the show is in the shade of the side characters as well, it really does an amazing job of create a central focus on this new character while still having other main characters feel a part of the movie.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
46,frey_jonny,Amazing,10,26 July 2021,Ufotable has really outdone themselves with this Kimetsu no Yaiba movie. Enjoyed it from start to finish. And really emotional Looking forward to the next season.,Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

48,sinhaabhinav-00498,Made me cry just with simple scenes and no bgm attached,9,14 May 2021,"I just watched this epic anime film and wanna say that it's the best thing happened to me in this year...
I cried, yes I cried, but what's important, that I cried in those scenes which hardly relies on emotions of goosebumps generating bgm but some very simple scenes showing several character arcs of the lead characters
.For example - there is a scene in which one guy is trying to find a way to the spiritual realm of Tanjiro to made him cripple in his own dream alas he couldn't then he is accompanied by some bright minions like characters who helps him to reach his destination and finally when he reaches there he realises , those minions kinda things are nothing but Tanjiro subconscious mind who helps him to find it...
.Man how could someone be so good that he is going to do anything to help others even if it meant to hurt himself...
.Yes I cried, tears stares rolling down my Tess...
.Nothing more to say
Everything about this series is just phenomenal...",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
49,Snownoise,Half of boreness and another harlf of aswesomeness,1,24 August 2021,"I would give 6.5, but I gave 1 as an offset against 10 voted by 40% of people. Nothing can be that perfect, people.I fell asleep twice in the beginning of movie. This is NOT an attempt to degrade the movie. I literally fell asleep a couple of times while I was watching the movie in the beginning. The first half was really that boring, but I decided to finish the movie since I read this was ""big in Japan"". When I passed the half mark of the movie, it was actually getting better and interesting. There were also a couple of awesome moments towards the ending, but that's about it. All I thought was what's a big deal about this? I didn't find anything new. For me, it's just a typical manga and anime that has typical manga and anime moments with different characters which doesn't mean it's bad. It means it's not as new, or progressive as others pointed out. I didn't know about the original series, and I also didn't watch the original series which may be the reason I don't give enough credits to this movie. However, I watched fair share amounts of anime for decades, and I know when it comes to something new.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
50,buddybhupender,This is how a follow up is done !!,10,10 May 2021,If you are not familiar with this Anime then My ADVISE IS that you MUST watch the 1st Season. Then you will appreciate this Survival Horror/Action Anime. The Movie starts off where the 1st season has ended. The movie straight away takes you to the journey and action begins. Though the premise is very simple that our Hero Tanjiro boards the train which has monsters on it. But given the length I was not sure how long the action sequences will be and the story part will be there or not. But the way story telling is done you get loads of actions and emotions and character development. The movie does not let you blink eyes for a second as the story and action happen on a pleasant pace and it keeps your interest going. The ending is not all happy go lucky but it does provides a glimpse of what is yet to come. And I am eagerly waiting for the next season to air. This movie is what keeps surprising me about anime and I recommend it for people who never had seen any anime or any movie based on it. If your mind is bored with this MUC & DC and want to watch stories with great characters and plot twists then this is one of those storytelling masterpiece.,Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
51,jerepepe,A sea of Tears,10,24 May 2021,"From minute zero I had that feeling of crying, it is a very epic and action-packed film, but its best moments stand out (for me) in the sentimental approach.

I'd been waiting so long for it to come out in theater here in the US and now that it finally is, I can genuinely say that it was worth the wait! The action, the comedy, the cute moments from Nezuko are all what you expected it'd be...FREAKING TOP TIER!! It's breathtakingly beautiful all throughout the movie and getting to watch it on the big screen just amplifies the experience by 1,000.

Poor Character Development,5,1 May 2021,"I heard great things about this movie from my friends, and I was very disappointed after watching it.I was struggling to stay awake during the movie.The ""Character Development"" was very poor.I had felt no connection to the characters.There was not enough battles in the movie.The movie was putting too much weight on the ending of the movie.I think they failed to connect me emotionally to the ending.I wish there was more of a character development to the story.More backstory, to help me connect to the characters.In the end, I think this movie failed.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
58,shashwatkadre,Masterpiece,10,29 April 2021,The movie was a high paced action movie where the protagonist (Tanjiro) was carrying the story but in the last 30 mins Flame Hashira emerged as a hero and man I can't stop crying after watching the last 20 mins of the movie...It's just epic how they immortalized a character which wasn't shown for more than 15 minutes in the first season.,Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

My wife who doesn't get into anime even enjoyed it. Of course there's always one flaw, and this one is Too much monologue.

68,RhysMakesMovies,I'm speechless...,9,25 February 2021,"There isn't enough ink or paper in the world to write down everything i loved about this visual spectacle, not that my words could even scratch the surface of fully captivating this level of quality. So I'll just say the things that stopped this masterful work from being a 10/10. There is an large amount of blatant exposition is this film, there are times when it makes sense for a character to be revealing such information but Enmu just stood on top of the train telling his entire plan and more for over 10 minutes for no reason. The music is still top notch but I don't think it was nearly as powerful as the score in the 1st season which stuck to more traditional Japanese instruments. Stop reading this already and go watch it!!!",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

71,undr_taker,Love Me Some Demon Slaying,8,7 July 2021,"First off, this is really a continuation from Season 1 of the anime. I do wonder if this works as a standalone movie. Having already watched Season 1, it wasn't a problem for me. Loved the movie, thoroughly enjoyed it. Plenty of action, and plot moves along at a brisk pace. Not too many draggy moments like some animes tend to have, telling grandfather stories from the moment they were a sperm until now. Definitely the apex fight had me at the edge of my seat. Can't wait for Season 2!",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

75,SaturnCoyote,Loved It.,8,16 May 2021,"I am glad I was able to see this movie. I thought it would just be one 2 hour long episode. I was wrong!Do I recommend watching the movie before Season 2? Yes, and it's worth it. The visuals are beautiful and it was a great watch! I had unfortunately heard the odd spoiler here and there but I still even got a little teary-eyed at the end. I can't wait to see what this series has to offer in the future!My only criticism is that it felt like Zenitsu didn't really do much in the film and he was just 'there'. However, I've heard it stays true to the manga and I love how they portrayed Rengoku! I'm definately watching again!",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
76,vanilla_vintage,Great visual with life lessons but slow pacing.,7,8 May 2021,Great visual with life lessons about dreams and friendship. It was long and a bit dragging. I yawned for a few times. The climax (fighting part) was very exciting.,Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
77,sazzad_h_akm,Best action movie of all time,10,3 October 2021,"The final fight scene between Akaza and Rengoku is the best fight scene I have ever seen (before that the duel between Uma and Lucy in the Kill Bill 1 was my most favorite). Not only the best fight scene, but in the same movie, I found the best villain and a hero a single movie can produce. Akaza is not only powerful but also very smart and cunning. He appears at the last part of the movie and remains only for less than 20 minutes but in that duration what he did is unforgettable. Rengoku was very brave and skillful but luck was not on his side. I feel sorry for him. So far I have seen that fight scene countless times but I enjoy it every time I see it. The background sound during the fights is incredible.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
78,FranklinTV,A movie that continues the excellent Anime series,7,27 June 2021,"This is not the movie you just watch because you have heard about this anime, but as a continuation of the excellent anime series, most enjoyable.

80,dadorableakarsh,Breathtaking!!!,8,1 May 2021,Mugen Train is a movie which won't fail your expectations. I promise. The visuals and the artistic style were top notch as expected from Ufotable. The Story wasn't the most promising point but didn't let down the overall experience. It helps to build up the excitement for the second season. The background score was on point and a treat to ears. Overall a balanced movie as all movies should be.,Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
81,raufmostafazade,It really was worth all the waiting..,10,30 April 2021,"After I watched the first 26 episodes last summer, I was wondering how long should I wait for a sequel. And now I get it. And I really got more than I ever dreamed. This movie is astonishing in every way. The Dreams depict the character's feeling one by one, and I just got drowned in Renguko's and Tanjiro's dream. The first half was so good, That I thought this was actually the movie's peak. I was wrong. After I watched the second half, I was on the verge of tears. I can't really believe what I just watched. If you haven't watched it already, please just do it..",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
82,Deathracer,A bit disappointed...,7,10 May 2021,"First of all what happen to that killer intro song!!! Gurenge by Lisa - This is one of the best sound tracks I have come across which was perfect for this show. Every episode, I never skipped it, even though I didn't understood a word. It just gave an unspeakable feeling to the show. Here, I missed it a lot like I was almost watching something else. When you start to watch something after a long break you need to remind why you loved it and this song was it!! Hope they don't screw the second season by using another intro!!!Other than that it was fine, but for a movie, I expected something more, something grand! That's probably why at the end there was another unexpected battle to compensate, which for me it felt out of place! Good battle for sure, but really didn't make sense at that moment.Tv series was far more superior in every way than the movie hands down and I really, really, really hope that they make the 2nd season soon with the same sound track!!!!!!",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
83,gerardchalaux,"Amazing! Obviously, watch the show first!",10,6 August 2021,"Truly a masterpiece of animation, every scene is polished to the extreme, the combination of 3D and 2D is so exquisite you can't even tell where the one begins and the other ends.The ending is great, but painful as expected, it's amazing how they managed to make you feel so much for a character that has just been introduced.If I had to complain about something it'd be how little involvement Zenitsu had on the whole thing; to be fair it's usual for him to do his special move a couple times and fall on a second plane, but I feel like this time they could've approached it a bit different, specially considering how crucial Inosuke was for the plot.Can't wait for the 2nd season to start, it's going to be incredible!",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
84,naifkhulaifi,Amazing!,10,17 October 2021,Truly a masterpiece the fight scenes are incredible and the animation mixed with the voice acting truly took this to another level I hope we see more of this in the future.,Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

Definitely a film I would recommend to any anime fan!!",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
87,mannansuper,It surprised me,10,16 December 2020,"To start with I actually thought at one point that demon slayer was overhyped but no I was wrong. This movie lived up to the hype and i was shocked to see how ufotable delievered it. Rengoku by far is my favourite character in the movie. He was original and amzing. As for people who think he is weak please!!! A upper moon is = to 3 hashiras at minimum and this fight actually proved that he was a hashira among hashiras. Please dont judge the guy badly. He saved 200 people, 3 rookies and even gave a big threat to upper moon 3 and by the way the top 3 upper moons are stronger then all the pillars newsflash. As for the lower moon 1 part. Imgine cutting hundreds of tentacles in 5 carts all while keeping the damage to a minimum. That aside movie was stunning with alot of visuals and rengoku vs akaza was the best fight this year. Fast paced and I had goosebumps of the year when I viewed the battle. The best part was that there was no victor or loser and that last million dollar smile....Man I almost cried. Rengoku looked like a baby tbh he died in a dignified manner. I loved the guy",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

91,arablooali,A pretty good demon slayer movie,8,3 January 2021,"So first this is a wonderfull ""demon slayer""movie
Full of action and some scenes were so emotional
But well the plot wasn't that good most of the time a demon apear and they fight to death
It lacks a deep plot.a plot like spider family or something about tanjiro father
But almost no story even about 2 main demon we see
And zenitso was almost forgotteandIt was like tge creator was busy making breath taking scenes that they almost forgot about zenitso",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
92,sirinow,If you like season 1 then you will like this movie,9,27 April 2021,The movie was in dub so maybe the translation was a little off and some of the lines might have been direct translation so it was a bit awkward at times but that didn't take away from the movie. This movie has all the elements that made the series so great except in a movie form factor. The pacing was great! The Comedic relief was awesome especially the Boar. The flashbacks were meaningful and deep and offered great messages. The best part of all were the fights. The animation was bonkers just like season 1 and I like how they really focused in on the Hashira Rengoku. He's such a badass and served as a great mentor to Tanjiro in the movie.The first fight between Tanjiro and the Lower 1 demon was epic and the fight between Rangoku and the higher 3 level demon was amazing. The sad part is that rengoku dies at the end of the movie and passes the torch to Tanjiro to eventually one day take his place as a hashira.The movie doesn't delve much into the main villain Muzan. It basically just features the battle against two of the higher ranked demons and ends. Overall a great movie that is well worth watching. The movie is going to be Dub in the USA so keep that in mind if you do not like dub. Otherwise I can't wait for season 2.,Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

94,Nifune,Blockbuster unintentionally produced by covid,8,5 November 2020,"These days it's not easy for us to go out to leisure facilities, needless to say, due to covid-19. Movie theaters are a few exceptions even in Japan where the infection hasn't been relatively severe. That most foreign films don't play this year helps only domestic films such as ""Demon Slayer"" play unusually many times a day.Covid also brought a serious blow to Japanese businesses which had already been in an economic slump for many years. Particularly in the pandemic era, people are likely to lose their ways and not have an idea of what they should do.Demons originally symbolize unknown terrors to humans like earthquakes, eruptions, floods, or plague. The very classic storyline, ""a brave boy who has a sense of justice beats demons"", gives people hope for salvation and brings about catharsis. The old-fashioned and creepy ambiance depicted by a lavish, high-quality animation exactly fits with the current time.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

99,byzantineiconoclast,"Descent anime with a formulaic story, but not a masterpiece by any means.",7,9 May 2021,"It was a descent, direct continuation of the 1st season, but it could have been better. Besides the well executed action sequences, the core story is just not that good. Before watching it, based on the ratings and reviews, I was foolishly expecting the Anime equivalent to ""Train to Busan"" in terms of story/suspense, just with demons instead of zombies, but I was sorely disappointed. The animation was top notch, as expected, as was the voice acting, but the story was nothing we haven't seen done better in a million other anime. Also, it relied a little too much on sentimentality for my tastes. The series did it as well, but it was well spaced in 26 episodes, while here it is condensed in 2 hours and it gets a bit much. It's well worth two hours of your time, especially if you are a fan of the series like me, but you shouldn't go expecting a masterpiece. I think that the pandemic helped this movie becoming so popular, in a normal season it definitely wouldn't have surpassed ""Spirited Away"" in ticket sales. Now, that WAS a real masterpiece.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
100,alexthegreatish,Extremely entertaining,10,5 August 2021,"Very very fast-paced, satisfying, and awesome, especially for fans of Demon Slayer.

102,mvmsupreme05,It's amazing.,10,21 May 2021,"The Animation is still amazing (as it was in Season 1),Characters are great,Rengoku especially since he was introduced in the show as a sort of side character and the film gave him more screen time which i liked. The Concept of the demons taking control of a train and putting the characters into a trance was very interesting, the concept of the demon Emmu having to send someone into the dream world in order to destroy the Dreamer's spiritual core was very interesting. And overall I think this is a very good Movie/Film that you all should watch (See season 1 of the show first though)",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

108,thisisgere,Predictable but pretty,7,29 August 2021,"Anime almost always follows a very specific formula and this movie is no different. It isn't as in-depth as the series and would require viewers to have seen it in order to understand the movie.But as a stand-alone, its alright.You can tell from the get-go who's gonna make it through so you may as well just sit back and enjoy the ride, the Mugen train ride. Its well animated but not as creative as some of the episodes of the series. The finale does drag on for a good 10 minutes longer than it needed. As soon as I saw the climactic scene, I knew the movie was not over yet and will have to drone on about life and yada-yada-yada (typical anime tropes)

113,daniel-65836,Terrible movie,3,1 June 2021,"Coming from someone who watched and loved the season 1 anime, Mugen Train did not live up to the hype or expectations. Season 1 was emotional, spectacular, magnetizing. Mugen Train is just a milking attempt. It's shocking this movie won awards. I guess they had no other movie to give in the covid year. Some of the prominently bad stuff:First antagonist can basically be summed up as this. Supposedly powerful Lower One demon hires sick children who fail completely on all four of their assassination attempts, spams the same useless technique during the later battle, then turns into an giant, immobile entity with a huge, vulnerable weakspot and gets killed predictably. Even the lower 5's underlings gave a better fight than himSecond antagonist is basically a mindless Regen bot. Doesn't dodge, doesn't outsmart, just brute forces and insta heals any cuts he takes. Sure, he meets the bill of being an upper rank demon but if you are going to write a character as unimaginative as this, you need to be flatout replaced with someone who can do your job better.Zero personality from any of the characters. One magic of the anime was that every character, big or small, good or bad, was memorable af. Each had their own personality, unique traits, distinct appearance. In the movie, that formula was gone. They don't carry the same personality their anime counterparts had. This is my biggest criticism for my 3/10 score. That magic was just not there.Fight scenes had nice art style but didn't measure up to what the anime set.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
114,siddhantpandit,"Chills , emotions were flowing through my veins",10,4 June 2021,"I was already expecting a masterpiece but It still surpassed my expectations .

115,carolsilva-25426,sexy animation but questionable writing..,7,10 May 2021,"So the first hour and twenty minutes is AMAZING, felt like I fused with the film and just had 3 orgasms somehow at once I felt like the characters in Food Wars whenever they have amazing food.However the last 40 minutes were kinda stupid... let me explain why..1) Why did a random upper rank 3 demon come out of literally no where with no explanation and essentially kill the flame guy.2) The most annoying thing I see happen is films or shows is when they set up a promising character just to die or further help with the character development of the MC. And that's what this film did.3) Half way through the fight I was able to notice that flame guy was gonna die just because he wasn't making any progress in the fight. Not because he was getting hurt but because its generic and cliché. It would have been a LOT more interesting to see him train the group LIKE THEY SAID HE WOULD.4) I've come to notice a lot of animes make films for the sake of money or getting more hype for the show and don't progress the story or really affect it. And why I think they did this in this case is because, not a lot actually happens.-A character that you get introduced dies anyway so its not like you'll be seeing any of him in the future.-The thing that is actually interesting is that you get to see one of the upper ranked demons but you don't get much from it except he killed one of the Hirashi - so his very strong.. too strong for Tanjiro.... okay? And to prove that you had to kill an interesting character?-How it basically ends is that the flame guy says go to my house to talk to my family, read some stuff and this could have happened in one episodes.-I know that technically you did also get an introduction to the demon that killed flame guy but it was so random you could have done that with him randomly appearing and his saying some stuff like ""So lower one didn't make it"" as if he was observing but he didn't - there was no explanation of him being there-Like I said the introduction to the demon and flame guy saying go to my house could have been done in 20 minutes not an hour and 50What im trying to say with my fourth point is that it doesn't move the plot along as much as you'd think....HOWEVER I will recognise the absolute AMAZING MAGNIFICANT animation honestly half the time I excited for just that.But the writing wasn't worth the waitThe movie is still good its just that last 40 minutes that honestly makes it a little bit worse.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
116,kevinlau-69809,Amazing animation and decent storyline however.....,8,29 April 2021,"My problems with the movie:
Zenitsu was very under-utilised here compared to the rest of the characters, he was nowhere to be seen during the final fight and decided not to help Rengoku with his lightning speed. Instead, we see him fitting Nezuko in the box by the train. This really irritated me because Zenitsu is one of my favourite characters and barley got any screentime as a ""main character"" in the movie.My second problem was with the ending of the final fight with Inousuke cutting the demons arms off and letting him escape instead of having Rengoku keeping him restrained until the sun came up so that at least he would have died knowing that the demon would not go on to survive another day. So basically they should not have intervened as Rengoku had said.But overall, a very good animation, these two problems for me brings the rating down to an 8 but still a very enjoyable watch.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

Just wish it stuck with a consistent pace the whole 2 hour runtime.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

131,ncl-66015,Overhyped tv show got an overhyped movie,7,26 May 2021,"The movie Demon Slayer: Mugen Train followed directly where the first season of the tv show ended. It shows the group around the main protagonist Tanjiro going on a train as a next mission for the demon slayer corps. I'll not go further into detail about the story, but I think it is necessary for the movie to watch the tv show, or at least a summary. There is no introduction into the world of demon slayer. The story, the animation and the music are basically the same like the tv show. That means the story is still pretty generic, with characters, which are mostly flat and some still annoying.(Some of my major critic points with the movie (contains spoiler!): At the end something tragical happened, but the audience didn't get to know the person fully to feel much about it. Therefore the pain and the tears from the protagonist, were not really understanable. They just got introduced to the person like 3 hours ago maybe. The other point was why was there a rank 3 demon so suddenly? And why is the protagonist not longer interested in taking blood samples? Why are the only talking about the highest rank in the corps, what about all the other ranks?)The animation is still amazing and beautiful! Just sometimes the cgi was a little bit too much for me, but overall it is really top. Same goes for the music. Really nice and well fitting.The tv show is overhyped, same goes for the movie. Yes, the animation is beautiful and the music and style are okay. But is it a masterpiece ? No, not for me. It has a quite childish humour, the characters have only one personal trait, everything can be categorized in good or bad. The standard pattern as you can see.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

My son got really good grades so I agreed on taking him and and my girlfriends son to see Mugen Train and I ain't gonna lie I was a bit skeptical about it. I heard little bits hear and there about the series but wasn't ever enough to draw me in. We live an hour away from the cinema and on our way to see it knowing there was a series about it I asked the boys to fill me in. Just on listening to them explain the twists and plot of the series was enough to get me interested in it.. After watching the movie tho I was hooked, glued and tied to idea that I needed more! I since then have seen the first season and have become an instant fan! The effects and awesome story line is great! Heart felt feelings that I love to feel and see when watching movies!

134,yurayarrow,Predictable and mediocre,6,18 July 2021,"This movie seems to be packed with everything that makes a successful movie and I can understand why so many people love it. But the whole plot is just predictable from the start and the dialogues are at times funny but overall childish and one layered. The same goes for the characters, we already know the main characters aside from the Hashira in this movie, but he wasn't exactly an interesting character and his side stories are just plain and boring, so it's not very easy to resonate with his unfortunate but predictable death.

The movie, on the other hand, spent way too much time trying to exposit things that we haven't seen so it seemingly didn't have to spend the time showing us in the future. It was still good but it often took me out of the moment. It also really didn't move the story forward for the main characters.

(It's already the highest grossing anime film of all-time!) I binge watched all 26 episodes of Season 1 this week and I saw the movie today.Let me tell you, it is absolutely sensational. Season 1 itself was already just so good, so this movie was a fantastic addition to the series. The animation is flawless and done so well. The raw emotions pack a huge punch, similar to Season 1's sentimental aspects. The characters are continued and developed through a clever, exciting, and action-packed ride aboard the Mugen Train! The soundtrack fit perfectly, as it added just the right touch at the exact right time. Even though I just watched Season 1 this last week, I'm already a huge fan!

Just, it needs a ""unique"" touch to it. Rather than it just being a episode stretched out into a movie, I want it to feel like a movie.Some of the duologue is kinda weird, not in a bad way. But its kind of funny.Overall really good movie, do recommend.TL;DR: feels like watching another episode of the series, and thats bad. But the movie is good though.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
157,sethgsturgeon,Some great! Some not so great...,6,16 May 2021,"I liked this movie overall and would probably go see it again, just because the art was so beautiful and the score and sound design really hyped up all the good moments! However, and I know this is marketed for kids, the characters were not great. I'm not familiar with the anime, so I went into this movie blind, and I think it accommodates this kind of audience in a good way! But, there is way too much unnecessary crying and one dimensional characters. There's basically just single quality stereotypes being made into main characters, and it really detracts for me.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
158,teamenergyagent,A masterpiece,10,27 July 2021,"WOW! After watching season one of demon slayer, I came to watch this movie with high hopes. It starts right after EP25, so no worries on reading manga or missing anything up to this event. The animation was amazing, the music fit so well, and the storyline, as usual was great. This had me rooting for everyone as well as shedding tears. YOU MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU WATCHED S1 OF THE ANIME! A TRUE MASTERPIECE, ROLLERCOASTER OF EMOTIONS!",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
159,gmcodejp,Must Watch,10,28 July 2021,"The movie didn't felt quite as good as the anime in the beginning but as soon as Akaza came, it was a complete turn of events. The fight between Akaza and Rengoku was just insane probably the best fight in the anime. I didn't quite liked Rengoku's character when he was introduced, but this movie completely changed my view. This guy is absolute legend. His death at the end literally broke my heart :(",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

161,anatanagara,Worthy of the Hype,10,1 May 2021,"(Reviewing subbed version) As a fan of the manga and anime, I had high expectations. They were met. Then they were blown away.Visually, Mugen Train is a unique work of art. CGI and cel animation are not mixed seamlessly, but thrown together-sometimes in a dance, sometimes in a battle. Then a chibi pops up to mix things up some more.The fight scenes are beautiful splashes and slashes of fire, water, and lightning. There's not as much blood as I thought there'd be, but that just made it so when it DID flow, the sympathetic pain was greater.Like the series, though, Mugen Train has a trainload of humor, and the writers, seiyuus, and animators deftly incorporate it into the narrative. Inosuke flying off the handle, Zenitsu drooling over Nezuko, Rengoku's eating habits, smol Nezuko... is funny.The Seiyuus did an excellent job, taking their performances over the top, perfectly matching the visuals.There are a few spots here and there where inconsistent animation messes with the pacing, and only true fans of anime-those who are not only forgiving of extreme melodrama-won't think the ending dragged a bit. But little things can't take away from the awesomeness of Mugen Train.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
162,sandervanderheide,Just 2 episodes as one,5,10 June 2021,"This movie takes of where season one of the series stops and it is just that, 2 episodes stitched together. So if you didn't see the series, you need at least watch a recap before watching this. Although I've seen a lot of anime movies and I know Japanese animation has a different approach than western animation, I was very underwhelmed by this one and not moved at all.when characters start crying in this kind of anime, they open the flood gates, visually and auditory. But that doesn't mean you will understand or feel their pain. So you're watching just some crazy emotional stuff and it doesn't move you at all. It almost made me burst in laughter when someone fell down to earth and started crying like crazy.most characters are very superficial, although the storyline pretends they have a lot of emotional bagage to deal with.the storyline doesn't hold much: a train has been taken over by a demon who needs to be killed80% of the movie is just fighting with no build up. So after a while, this gets boring and when you think it's done, there is another 20 min fight. It looks stunning thoughOnly watch this movie when you love the series.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

The red flames if Rengoku San are so amazing, I've never seen this type of animation in other anime so far. It's wonderful.I would like to thank the original manga creator Koyoharu Gotouge for giving us this master piece.Demon slayer was my 2nd anime and I loved it so much as a normie.

I would've preferred the movie condensed to one episode. The Mugen train part was ok but not executed in a good way. The ending fight scene was great but it didn't have any point and it was kind of like a forced death for Rengoku. I don't mind characters dying in the series because it should be part of the plot but this was different. However, the ending made me give the movie one more star because it was the only scene where there was any tension or excitement.I still liked the movie and I don't think I wasted my time at all.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

The animation was beautiful and pacing of the movie made it fly by. I really believe this movie will raise the bar for anime movies as most are just cash grabs but this one is actually canon fitting in between seasons 1 and 2.

If you are expecting the movie to tell you one great story, its really not for you.The movie, however does not let you blink. Its just too damn beautiful. Soundtracks, are spot- on and worth listening to over and over again. The animation is... the best out there is any anime. A lot of cliche, more than a few unfunny gags, but the animation makes up for it. The studio really has done their job well to keep me glued to seat.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

It was just perfect.,Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

After I finished the movie, i realize that I shouldn't worried about this thing from the start. Every scene in this movie is really well planed, if the action scene start getting too long they will change it into another scene so we will not get bored with the action (I mean the composition of action and te conversation is balance.)And then the effects, both 3D and 2D. It's P E R F E C T. Even though we only have 2 hours to know Rengoku character, but the feeling, the emotion still really hit me. Like I cry a river in the cinema😬It's really recommended!

201,ichirob30,A little overrated,7,26 April 2021,"If you have seen other shounen anime or simply other live-action films like the MCU, it's going to be hard to top those. This film delivers amazing visuals, but it is one of those stories that is more about the emotion than the logic of the plotline, which doesn't sit well with people like me. There were various scenes in the film where beneficial things happen to the protagonist and I reacted with ""No, that's a little bs.""In short, the film seems more like an extended series episode than a theatrical standalone title, which I believe is the intention.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
202,samvii,Episode 27 & 28 & 29?,7,29 May 2021,"I watched the series before seeing this today and these felt like two or three additional episodes with higher production values in the visuals at least.Cutting straight to the point I don't know if they made us care enough for or about the flame hashira enough to draw out their death for so long at the end. Yeah they looked cool fighting but it felt like we and the main three characters had know them barely a few days and spent barely more than a train ride with him, mostly asleep to be crying for 20 minutes when they died.Would've rather they spent way more time setting up and giving motivations for the lower one demon / train.There's some really funny moments and writing in the series but the things in the movie they thought they'd go for were really basic, saying umai repeatedly? Ok.Surprised there was no banger track at any point, the only reason it still gets a 7 is because it looked great and has decent performances even if the writing is pretty meh.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
203,Linkc96,What a ride,8,20 May 2021,"Went to the cinema to watch this, without knowing anything about it, and without having watched the series.

Many people who are not into anime much (to be honest, anime movies often don't do well in my country box office) still really like it after watching.
----------------
My reviews:
_Visual and sound: no need to talk more. 10/10.
_Content: Good meanings and messages which can resonate well with the audience. Reasonable framed. Handle sittuations properly. No random asspull power-up. There is time to focus on each character to develop and emphasize their role, leave the impression on audience. The producer team knows how to choose the starting point and end point so that audience in general can enjoy the movie. Through out the movie, there are good meanings and messages that can resonate well with audience (especially for Japanese people due to culture and lifestyle I think). 8.5/10
Overall: 9.25/10",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
214,MCCHEESE365,One of the most impactful anime movies i've ever watched,10,16 March 2021,"Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen Ressha-sen, otherwise known as demon slayer: mugen train arc, is a pretty good movie. it is the sequel of the serial anime, Kimetsu no Yaiba, or Demon slayer. I suggest you very strongly to watch the anime serial first, since the start of the movie is connected with the ending of the anime serial. the genre of this movie is animation, anime, adventure, action, fantasy, and drama.It may seems boring since the whole movie takes place on a train. But, this arc impacts the whole story. I'm going to try to minimalize as much spoiler as possible. The story is about 4 member of the kisatsutai (demon slayer corps), tanjiro, nezuko, zenitsu, and inosuke, (yes, nezuko is considered as a member of demon slayer corps even though she's a demon), boarding a train to meet the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku, to help him on a mission to hunt an upper moon demon. I can only go so far, (I think) the rest of the story is considered as spoiler. The production team, Aniplex did a great job on both the 2D and 3D the animation. The song ""Homura"" by LiSA really fits to the movie credit, and literally cried when I listened to it. This song is one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard.I would definitely watch this movie over and over again. You can watch this movie right now. But, I think there is no streaming services that has this movie in high quality. I mean, you can watch it right now if quality doesn't bother you that much. This is a must watch for the fan of the series.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
215,svetoslavaveselinova,"Masterpiece by gods (some spoilers included for non-manga readers, chapter 52-66)",10,7 December 2020,"I cried so much even until now when I remeber Rengoku's smile at the end I immediately start to cry. Demon slayer is god's work for me. I have never read something so good and so unfortunate. The movie and entire manga take a very very special place in my heart as I've never felt such connection and pain to something. The movie- oh the movie, the animators did a great job and all the expressions and voice acting were on top tier level, Tanjiro and Inosuke's cry are so touching and realisticly painful. The movie is beautiful, sad and totally something you should experience watching. Such small details give you feels from the movie. From the moment Tanjiro saw his siblings...it was such a heart breaking scene, expect my tears the moment he sees them. Overall the scene that I think is the most precious to all of us is Rengoku seeing his mother, I replayed that over 40 times.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

219,kshcherbino,Passable at best,3,30 June 2021,"Passable at best. Very wonky and predictable plot, graphics are OK. Characters are quite two-dimensional, no deep character work.

I would have never watched it if not for the racing reviews, and now that I did, I'm both disappointed and surprised at all the fuss. It's definitely not worth it.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

The characters are amazing, great voice given by voice actors. If you start watching this it would feel like Action packed anime but when you go further, you would see other things except action. The anime adaption by ufotable is great. The anime which shown in Muzan's Palace the main antagonist of Demon Slayer is beautiful and incredible anime adaption.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
221,miastulac,A wonderful continuation of the anime!,10,25 April 2021,"This movie was incredibly well done in many ways.First, the animated fight scenes blew my away. The quality of the animation was spectacular, and I would see it again just to see the fight scenes.But aside from the fighting, the storyline was awesome! It continues right off of where the first season of the anime left off, so if you want to understand everything, WATCH THAT FIRST!!! But on the other hand, people who haven't watched the anime have enjoyed the movie as well. But if you want to save yourself from confusion, watch the first season first.With some inception-like themes, incredible action scenes, and a plot that will have you go through a roller coaster of emotions, this is definitely an animated movie to watch out for!(Note: the only thing I would change is give zenitsu more screen time.)(Another note: this movie got robbed from best animated series nomination for the Oscars.

Story:
The movie is the sequel of the anime series. The movie starts with the scene on the train where the main characters show up. In the entire film we will stick around with this train as a background which is pretty interesting to me. Using the train as background gives me the feeling about the long journey. The film-makers put the conversation that allows us to learn more about the detail and background story of the character from the series season one. This makes us more connected to the character. Moreover, there are some scenes that have meaningful speech which the audience can understand easily. However, there are some scenes that went too far from my expectations.
Character:
There are improvements in the characters that appear in this movie. Characteristics and identities are more visible than the previous series installment.Animation + Sound effects:
I could say this is one of the best animated films in terms of animation that I've ever watched. Sound effect, scores, voice acting, everything fits in this movie at the top..Verdict: Overall, it is a movie that is worth watching as a Friday night's movie. The storyline is decent, the graphics are well-animated and other things that I haven't mentioned can make you enjoy this movie. If you are free from anything else, I highly recommend this movie for you. :D",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

Unlike some anime movies that simply recaps the TV series, this movie continues on from Season 1, and acts as a perfect segue into Season 2.There is a mix of everything in this movie, from exhilarating battle scenes to melancholy and poignant reflection, and not to forget the comedy we have come to expect from the protagonist trio.I normally would not watch a movie twice, but this movie will be the exception.

Tanjiro is bland as hell and spouts generic hero lines every few minutes. Zenitsu is absolutely annoying and Nezuko is just there to look cute.

266,kerplunk-50653,It was fine.,3,29 April 2021,"Let me begin by saying that the animation was excellent, the music was great, and the voice acting was top-notch. Sound design was also really great!Now, with the good out of the way, the rest.... The story was cliché, to say the least. What's more, all of the action in the movie was the equivalent of slamming action figures into one another and declaring one of them the victor by screaming exposition at you as to how you should feel about what just happened.Example: Person A slams into Demon-thing B. Flash! Bang! Excitement! A and B separate, breathing heavily. Character C, not involved, says something to the effect of, ""Wow, A really took a beating there, he can't take much more of that."" Then they go back at it and it repeats.When there are no rules and normal physics don't apply, it's impossible to care about the outcome of any given conflict. It's just at the mercy of the writers deciding which action figure gets to win this conflict.To further emphasize this, during one scene, a character is hit by a giant Demon-Tentacle, and wham, he's slammed into the wall, you'd be done for if it were you. He's fine though. Okay, so this character is strong.Then, literally 1 scene later, this same character is stabbed by something the size of a pencil, and it's practically a death-sentence. He's out of the fight for the rest of the movie.Another character is literally impaled on something's arm, and manages to almost cut its head off anyway, but then the character dies.Why? Give me rules!!!! If character's can be literally impaled and bleeding but summon the strength to scream some nonsense and then burst into flames, what are the limits?!? What am I meant to be impressed by? Has he done something amazing or is he a terrible swordsman? It's impossible for me to tell because there aren't any rules. Soon enough though, character C comes on screen to scream how I should feel, so that I can continue.All-in-all, if you've seen the anime, and you enjoyed that, give it a watch. Otherwise, if you're coming in without any interest in anime prior, leave it be, it'll be a waste of time for you.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

This movie took all of that and multiplied it. The animation at times looked life-like, yet not out of place, and the characters fit in perfectly.

289,rxrfggtj,Great movie that was on point,10,23 May 2021,"This movie was sad. I think it's on point when the topic involves dealing with demons. There is never a happy ending when dealing with demons so theme of the movie was accurate af. There is also religious aspects in the film. For example, Tanjiro treated the person trying to destroy his subconscious in his dream with love and open arms. He didn't fight the person trying to do him dirty. He just treated the person trying to hurt him in his dream with love and kindness. Like, go ahead, do it. In the end, the person changed and didn't hurt Tanjiro by seeing that lively spirit within him. I mean anime are not supposed to get deep like that but I guess that's why this film did so well globally. This anime isn't your typical flashy Goku fireball attack type of thing or Pokémon I choose you stuff.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

294,butterpencil,Really is as good as everyone says,10,10 June 2021,"This movie was amazing. I must admit that I had just watched Demon Slayer Season 1 before seeing this with my friend. I really enjoyed demon slayer season 1 but this movie does everything the show set out to de even better. Let's start out with the intro. Immediately after the movie is introduced with the master getting old you knew this had to be a movie as they set this movie up in a way where you know it had to be a movie which was a concern if mine. I was concerned that the movie would feel like 6 episodes smashed together but that's not what it felt like at all. It truely did feel like one story being told in an hour and fifty seven minutes. Anyways, the movie gets straight into the action without spending any time on a recap and we are immediately introduced to Rengoku. I say introduced because although we have seen him in the first season we didn't truely get a feel for his entire personality but this scene perfectly establishes how over the top Rengoku really is. Then, we get right into the action with Rengoku having to fight a demon. Immediately something that you'll notice if you do see this in a theater or if you have surround sound or a sound bar is that the sound design of this movie is amazing. I don't know if it's just because it was my first time going back to a theater but I definitely think that the sound design on this movie is far above average. Anyways, the demon ends up putting all of the main characters to sleep and we get to see their dream sequences. I like Zenitsu's dream sequences a lot and Rengoku'd gives a lot of insight into his childhood. Tanjiro's dream was great as well and definitely focused on just the lengths he would go to to get back with his family. Eventually though he realizes he has to kill himself to get out of the dream so two he does and he wakes up then he gets the others to wake up and he goes in top of the train to fight the demon. I absolutely loved the sequence where the screen was covered in blood and the demon was putting words into the mouths of Tanjiro's family. It was truely a very powerful scene. The train turning into a demon was probably the worst part of the movie but great nonetheless. The CG on the demon is a little jarring though I must admit. But the best part of this sequence is the fact that the train really was a demon as I Inosuke had presumed in the beginning. Let's move on to the section off of the train which is far and away the best part of the movie. At first, when they got off the train I thought it was the end of the movie and I was kind of underwhelmed but boy was I wrong. Upper Moon 3 shows up and Rebgoku has to fight him. This makes for what is, in my opinion, better than the fight in episode 19. In fact I would call this the series' new best fight. The music they used for Upper Moon 3 was just great It was heartwrenching to see Rengoku die as by the end of the movie they really do make you care about Rengokuat and the action was great too. Every shot was animated absolutely beytaigully and I loved what Rengoku'd final blow looked like and when Rengoku asks his mother right before dying if he did a goodjob it's heart-breaking. We end the movie off how it started with the master and I forgot to mention that all of the Hashira finding out is sad as well and done perfectly. So, overall, I have no complaints with this movie. This is the first movie I've ever seen where I wanted to see it again immediately after I saw it the first time. I would definitely reccomended this if you watched the series to anyone and if you haven't watched the series watch it and then watch this movie.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
295,spoling-27105,"Good, but only for younger fans",6,11 June 2021,"Its okay. I would say a third of the movie is pretty good to great, and two thirds were bad, overdone, or just too childish. I think younger fans will enjoy it a lot, though.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
296,elangovanprashanth,A Movie True to it's core!!! A Masterpiece,9,13 June 2021,"Have you ever wondered why most of the anime movies are not connected to the actual story arc. Well this movie is not a ""just a movie"" kinda one. It's tailored with great care to make it one as one of the best anime movies to watch n fall in love with. From the start the movie continues from where it was left in the first season and continues the infinite train journey of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke & Nezuko as they embark on this journey to fight the demon in the train. While u find this portion of the movie itself to be meaty,the movie jumps into an express concoction of action, dialogues, philosophy, master animation effects & BGM in the last 30 minutes to drill you down to the core of your emotions and make you think of it for the whole day. A must watch for all anime lovers...

303,abhishekvpai-16508,Feel good and emotional.,9,1 August 2021,I watched demon slayer season 1 and started mugen train. But the movie is something else. Made me very happy and especially the last part. That's what made all the demon slayer fans cry. I cried for more than 20 minutes. I didn't expect that kind of heartbreaking moment. The flame hashira rengoku dies while fighting the 3rd upper class demon. What to say. Really.....A very good movie. Must watch.,Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

309,khushalpandya,Must read this ...if,10,5 November 2021,U should know this if u really a warm hearted person.ANYTHING we should watch must not needed to be judged. This should not be judged for knowledgeable or for style or making great actions ....sometimes things should be seen as how u feel upon watching and getting into it.So how I personally feel in this is actually this made me cry 😢😭 just like the main character get because....i realize that how I would react when the main character was me.So I think if u r reading this review then u should probably watch it and u should never judged things based on others thought.....may be he/she like something that u doesn't.,Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

321,mty20ktgn,"10 is not enough, from Japan",10,25 October 2020,"I want to set the score 100, not 10. The story, characters, visual, actions and moves, professional voice actors, sounds, Lisa's main song are so completely mixed at supreme level.
(By the way, the meaning of ""Mugen Ressha-Hen"" is ""Infinite Train Arc"". The name of the train in the film is ""Mugen (Infinite)"".)I love movies, seeing it in theaters. Net-streaming is OK as a supplement, but I think it cannot be the mainstream of this industry, and I do hope this movie will be released in USA, Europe, China soon, pull the people back to their nearest theaters, save the industry.I saw this movie on the 1st Saturday, the 1st show (8AM) in a theater near me. 400 seats were 100% full, the audience must wear a mask, drinking was allowed, but no eating (usually in Japan, no shouting, no chanting even without COVID19).Just before the start, I felt ""total concentration breathing"" of the all audience in the theater, complete silence & 100% focus on the screen, that explained how we all were long waiting for this movie's release.The movie itself is really great, so ""breathtaking"". This is the ultimate Anime of a popular Manga/comic series, and I want to give big big big applause to Ufotable who have created this masterpiece.For those who have seen the anime series only (26 episodes), not known the full story of this film, you must go and see Rengoku-san's several ""Flame-breathing"" forms, which give you goose-bumps. His scenes are so super and great that make all people understand Hashira's power & strength.For those who have seen the anime and read the manga series (known full story), you also must go and see how each panel of the manga moves (it really moves!!), and enjoy comparing the scene and the panel after watching the movie (like me). You can also feel the characters' feelings more vividly than the manga series.In the end of the movie, you would be thankful and grateful for the mask, not only for anti-COVID19, but also for hiding your tears and runny noses. (this happened to me, I was so moved and emotional...) In the end, during the last song, the theater was filled with many sobbings.---- Spoilers ----
I try to minimize my spoilers here.Before the last battle, I felt that the all audience again did into ""total concentration"" one level deeper, and I guessed that most of them must have already read the manga series.The last battle was so so great, I have never seen such a great battle in my life that I cannot describe it with my poor English vocabulary. I can only say that it surpassed the episode 19's battle in Demon slayer anime series, and Ufotable has realized/materialized the manga 100% or more with visual, sounds, voices, backgrounds, etc.I also praise the power of Japanese professional voice actors/actress. They express the characters' feelings completely and you will be easily captured by their voice-performance. I really feel great and am proud that Japan has such great voice actors. I recommend all people in the world to see this movie with Japanese original voices with your own language subtitles, so you can listen/hear/feel their great performance.Ufotable/Aniplex did very good job to make it secret about the last battle. It was not revealed until the opening day. They also even hid the voice actor's name of the key character in the last battle. When I heard the voice in the theater, I felt like and shouted in my mind, ""Wow, it's him! Yes!"" Some of them in the theater must have been same like me. The voice was 100% fit and so convincing that I was like persuaded to become a de....Anyway, please enjoy (with tears)! I am looking forward to seeing/reading your reactions/reviews about this film from all over the world.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
322,datg-02725,A piece of art,10,19 December 2020,"The story is amazing. You can feel the pain in every fight and get involved into every character story. The animation is amazing, what a great job from UFOTABLE.Kyojuro's death will be something that will have a big effect over Tanjiro and the rest of the demon slayer corp. I'm pretty sure that next season will offer us an amazing battle between Muzan, upper moons, the ""hashiras"" and a cotinue growing Tanjiro.I highly recommend to watch this anime and movie.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

The action was jaw dropping. One specific fight scene was probably the best of the anime. THE HYPE IS REAL. The ending was EPIC. It's a film beloved by many including myself.,Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

326,mohotfuzz,Breathtakingly Beautiful and Emotionally Moving,10,14 May 2021,"With Demon Slayer already being a phenomenal series, I have to say that this movie was somehow still more than I could have hoped for, even going in with high expectations. It really fires on all cylinders: the animation is out of this world, the musical score was wonderful, the story itself was gripping and emotional. Go see it in theaters if there's still time! You won't regret it.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
327,omarabdalazeez,Nothing More Than Perfect,10,13 June 2021,"A touching piece of art, full of emotions and motivations. In my opinion, they managed to make one of the best plots to introduce a powerful and cool new character and leave its impact on us and the series.👌",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

329,lassediercks,"So great, it made me create an IMDB account to post this review",10,18 May 2021,"I'm an anime-nerd having watched anime for 20 years plus.This movie is hands-down the best piece of anime I have ever seen.I had big expectations being a big Kimetsu no Yaiba fan to begin with. For anyone serious about anime, it's mandatory to watch the first season before touching this movie.The first part of the movie was a great appetizer, but the second part beginning with Akaza's arrival is to me the best piece of cinema I ever watched.It's great Shounen at it's core - so great that it transgresses the genre. It's touching - for anyone - exactly because the story, especially Rengoku's story is so relatable.Everyone goes through hardships in their life. This movie manages to touch these difficult deeply psychological subjects in such a serious and consequential, yet playful way through multiple lenses/characters.It encapsulates a way to look at life; struggles are inevitable, it is about how you overcome them. On that note, all that is left to say;""Set your heart ablaze and go beyond your limits.""",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
330,domonator-05779,A masterclass in mixed-media art.,10,23 April 2021,"I didn't think they would top the sakuga seen in s1:e19. In fact I wasn't sure they could. Boy was I wrong. There were a few fights that had the hair on my arms sticking up and a few second in each that made me make an audible, involuntary sound, while I was barely still in my seat. The art direction? Impeccable. The characters? Immaculate. My main issue with the first season of the show was that Inosuke and Zenitsu were beyond infuriating and were on 100% with their personalities 100% of the time. It was still like this in the first third of the movie, but the characters show some other aspects of their personalities as well, and are slightly more tame during the latter half, which I think the majority of the American audience will greatly appreciate. Another issue I had with the first season was that the audience was never able to properly grieve with Tanjiro over his family's death, as they were given less than five minutes of screen time during the original. I'm not going to spoil anything but that has been addressed now, and I've shed tears for them now, or at least for how much their loss impacted Tanjiro. Oh and back to the art direction. You can tell that every single person on akira matsusima's team gave it their all, and loved every minute of it. Every frame bleeds passion, and some left my jaw hanging. The dedication and attention to detail is evident and I cannot give it high enough praise. I am left very curious as to how the show will go on with Tanjiro as the main character without it feeling underwhelming though, now that we see how much his powers pale in comparison to the high ranking slayers and demons. I'm worried it may have went too crazy too soon but we'll have to find out when season two releases. The sound design was astounding as well. I'm obviously no professional movie reviewer, and I may be a little biased because I love Shonen and am a sucker for art, but I honestly found nothing wrong with this movie and really hope I'm not overhyping it when I say- even if you're not a fan of anime as a genre you're doing yourself a great disservice by not seeing this film. And see it in theaters! IMAX if you can. I know we have COVID out here so be safe and weigh the risk, but it's definitely worth ticket price for IMAX.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train

333,hpsadiq,It is not even close to becoming a masterpiece.,7,8 May 2021,"As a movie that starts after the events of the anime I expected more, because you don't need to identify the characters or build them, You have a lot of time And the movie didn't use this time properly, It could better by showing up more characters and deeper villainess.I loved the drama in this movie and touched me at some points.But at some point the comedy in this movie wasn't at the right time and exaggerating, and I fell they trying to say whether you like it or not you should laugh.Production wasn't the best they used cgi wasn't very bad, but it's cgi anyway, actually the animation In episode 19 of the anime was better.",Demon Slayer - Mugen Train
