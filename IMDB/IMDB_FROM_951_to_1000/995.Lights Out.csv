0,Leofwine_draca,Big screen adaptation of a Youtube short,6,16 April 2017,"LIGHTS OUT is the big screen, mainstream version of a famous Youtube short about a female apparition that only appears in the dark. It's a small scale production that attempts to induce intense fear in the viewer, but as somebody with a long history of horror viewing I must admit that I didn't find it particularly nerve-wracking despite the proliferation of jump scares.The film this one most resembles is DARKNESS FALLS, a movie I really enjoyed despite the negative reviews. LIGHTS OUT benefits from some pretty good performances from the lead actors in their attempts to sell the story to the viewer; Billy Burke and Maria Bello are fine in small roles, but it's Teresa Palmer who handles the brunt of the work. At least the film focuses on the horror content, and that consistency works in its favour, although it's inferior in comparison to something like the excellent IT FOLLOWS. That doesn't prevent it from being worth a watch for genre aficionados, however.",Lights Out
1,SnoopyStyle,great visual concept,7,16 December 2017,Martin is a little boy hounded by a monster in the dark. His dad (Billy Burke) is killed by a woman in the dark. His mother (Maria Bello) seems to be talking to that mysterious being called Diana. Children's Services calls in his step-sister Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) who has commitment issues unwilling to even let Bret keep one sock at her place. Rebecca takes Martin to her home upon seeing her mother in dire mental state.The visual concept of a lurker in the dark is quite compelling. The movie could have done more with a slower burn. It does a big kill right at the beginning which leaves the shock of discovery less overwhelming. It becomes the same move over and over again. It's a great move but it would work so much better with a gradual ramp up. The mother's madness is intriguing. A little more thought could be used to maximize the story.,Lights Out
2,claudio_carvalho,"Flawed, but Startles the Viewer",7,6 October 2016,"A man called Paul (Billy Burke) is working after hours and is murdered by a supernatural entity in the shadow. When his son, the boy Martin (Gabriel Bateman), is frightened by the same creature, he sees his mother Sophie (Maria Bello) talking to an imaginary friend called Diana (Alicia Vela-Bailey) in the shadow of her room. Martin does not sleep anymore during the night but in classroom and his older stepsister Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) that lives alone is summoned by the social assistant. She brings Martin home and recalls he own experience with Diana years ago when she was young. Sophie and her boyfriend Bret (Alexander DiPersia) investigate the connection of Sophie with Diana and come up to a scary revelation about their past.""Lights Out"" is a flawed horror film that startles the viewer. The high-quality production has top-notch cinematography, associated to a great cast highlighting the wonderful Teresa Palmer and Maria Bello. Unfortunately the story has many flaws and it is not well explained. For example, why the light burns Diana in the end (could it be because it was directed to her?) and not along the film?; or why Sophie's suicide destroys Diana (was she creating the entity? Why?). Was Sophie having problems with her first and second husband? Or is just Diana's jealousy. Or how it was explained to the police how Paul, two police officers and a housewife were mysteriously murdered. The writers could have been more careful with viewers that are not brainless. At least, in ""Der Fluch von Darkness Falls"" (a.k.a. ""Darkness Fall""), the entity is better explained. But anyway it is worthwhile watching this film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Quando as Luzes se Apagam"" (""When the Lights Are Out"")",Lights Out

A pretty wife Sophie (Maria Bello) who talks to herself, a great kid Martin (Gabriel Bateman), and a killer ghost Diana (Alicia Vela-Bailey) haunting him when the lights go out. Unfortunately for Paul, it's lights out in the first scene. Diana can't survive in the light. Diana and Sophie have an old relationship...a thrill on Mulberry Hill mental institute. Grown daughter Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) comes to help out and solve the plot.The film is short jump scares with a creepy dark figure, over and over again.Guide: No swearing sex, or nudity.

4,kosmasp,In the shadows,6,18 December 2016,"Some things play out inside your head. Those things can get very scary, especially when they move in the shadows ... wait, move in the shadows? But can they also teleport? You better not start using you head with this because it will confuse you, not to mention that it will spoil the movie for you too.But that's not all that is wrong here. Characters seem to change their conviction and beliefs during the running time. At one moment it's like ""I don't care"", at the next it's like ""save that person now!"". Not to mention that the intentions of the evil individual is somehow foggy at best (no pun intended). Kind of decent, if you like the genre",Lights Out
5,Sleepin_Dragon,Best horror I've seen in ages.,9,31 August 2016,"I have to admit I really did enjoy Lights Out, I've been so disappointed with the recent horror flicks I've seen, so having felt a little disillusioned with the genre, Lights Out has given me regained hope. For starters the acting was really good from the entire cast, so many horrors of late have felt like school projects in the acting stakes, but this was excellent, Teresa Palmer was fantastic in the lead role of Rebecca, and very well supported, Alexander DiPersia was very good as boyfriend Bret, but get a hair cut! The scares were constant and instant, no boring introduction or time for the first scare, it kicked off as it continued through to the end, some of the scenes had the entire audience jumping, it was brilliantly made. What I'd class as the perfect movie to go to the Cinema with friends.Loved it, 9/10",Lights Out
6,jboothmillard,Lights Out,5,2 September 2016,"Based on the 3-minute short horror film of the same name, it is a very simple premise, only seeing something evil when it's dark, the trailer for this certainly looked worthwhile. Basically in a mannequin warehouse, co-worker Esther (Lotta Losten, star of the original short) sees the silhouette of a monstrous woman when she turns the lights off, but sees nothing when the lights are on, she warns owner Paul (Twilight's Billy Burke) about what she saw before leaving, Paul encounters it in the darkness and is killed by it. Rebecca (Warm Bodies' Teresa Palmer), Paul's stepdaughter, lives alone in an apartment, away from her younger brother Martin (Gabriel Bateman), and her mother Sophie (Coyote Ugly's Maria Bello), who suffers mental illness and depression that has resurfaced. Sophie is apparently communicating with an imaginary ""friend"", Martin starts to suffer insomnia from fear seeing the apparition with his mother, his teacher Emma (comedian Andi Osho) calls Rebecca and tells that Martin has been falling asleep in class. Rebecca takes Martin home, but following a fight with their mother, for his protection she takes him to her apartment, but that night she suffers an attack herself, the silhouetted woman appears in the darkness, but Rebecca makes it disappear turning the lights on. Rebecca finds a scratching on the floor, the name ""Diana"", she recalls her experiences from her childhood of an apparition frightening her. Martin is with his mother for a movie night, but she frightens him talking about her imaginary friend, she tells him a story about Diana (Alicia Vela- Bailey), who she met in the mental institution she was in, Diana had an unusual condition that made her skin light-sensitive. Martin is attacked by Diana, who throws Sophie out of her way to get him, but he escapes to Rebecca's, she meanwhile finds documents in Paul's office with information about Sophie, and finds Diana was a mental institute patient experimented on by doctors, she was killed by overexposure to light, Diana has manifested as a vengeful ghost and manipulated Sophie that they are friends. Rebecca confronts Sophie about Diana, but she denies the accusation, so Rebecca, her lover Bret (Alexander DiPersia) and Martin decide to stay overnight to protect Sophie. During the night Sophie secretly passes a note saying ""I need help"" to Rebecca through her bedroom door, before being tugged back, Rebecca realises her mother is being controlled, and turns all the house lights on to keep Diana away. Diana knows the intentions of Rebecca, and lures her and Martin to be trapped in the basement, Bret is attacked and goes to get the police, while Rebecca finds that while Diana is invisible in light, she can be seen with a black light. With the black light Rebecca also finds scrawled writing across the walls, explaining how Diana will not let Sophie be taken by anyone, and Diana reveals that Rebecca's father did not abandon them, she killed him. Bret returns with two police officers, but they are swiftly killed by Diana, Rebecca sends Martin out to Bret, while she goes back in to rescue her mother, Diana grabs Rebecca and is about to kill her, but Sophie arrives holding a pistol to her head, exclaiming that she would not exist in the human world without her, to save her children Sophie shoots herself in the head, causing Diana to burn and disappear. Sophie's body is carried away by the police, while Rebecca, Martin and Bret reunite at the ambulance, as they calm down and vow to stay together the ambulance lights momentarily flicker, but it is all over. Also starring Rolando Boyce as Officer Brian Andrews, Maria Russell as Officer Gomez, Elizabeth Pan as Nurse, Ariel Dupin as Young Diana, Amiah Miller as Young Rebecca, Ava Cantrell as Teen Diana and Emily Alyn Lind as Teen Sophie. Palmer is alright as the concerned teen, and Bello is fairly convincing as the mental unstable mother, it is essentially a ""now you see it, now you don't"" formula, the story of why the ghost exists just about stays interesting, there are good amount of sudden loud noises and the terrifying ghoul suddenly appearing that get jumps, a divisive and effective enough supernatural horror. Worth watching!",Lights Out
7,BA_Harrison,Based on the short film of the same name.,6,1 December 2017,"A malevolent supernatural entity called Diana (Alicia Vela-Bailey), who can only attack when the lights are out, terrorises a young boy, Martin (Gabriel Bateman). With his mentally ill mother (Maria Bello) unable to protect him, it is up to Martin's older sister Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) and her boyfriend Bret (Alexander DiPersia) to try and battle the creature.The original 3 minute short of Lights Out was a well-executed and extremely efficient exercise in creepiness, a one-trick terror trip, light on story but heavy on atmosphere and scares. When I heard that creator David F. Sandberg was going to turn it into a full-length feature, I was intrigued: what kind of storyline would he come up with in order to substantiate the spookiness?It didn't come as too much of a surprise to discover that Sandberg's plot for this movie is a little on the flimsy side, and just a tad confusing, but thankfully the film's novelty—a supernatural being that only exists in the shadows—is well handled and still proves very effective, providing enough thrills to make the movie a reasonably satisfying chiller. I might still be in the dark about exactly who or what Diana was, and I could have done with Sandberg shedding more light on her motivation, but I know for sure that I wouldn't like to bump into her in the middle of the night.",Lights Out
8,paul_haakonsen,"Whatever you do, stay in the light...",7,15 October 2016,"I had no prior knowledge about ""Lights Out"" before sitting down to watch it, so I had no expectations to it. However, I did hope that it was not going to be just another generic horror movie without any scary elements, as oh-so-many horror movies have turned out to be in the last decade.And I am pleased to say that ""Lights Out"" didn't fail to deliver, because this was indeed a very entertaining and enjoyable horror movie. It had a really good and captivating story, which did keep the audience at the edge of their seats. And it also had enough of scary elements to keep even a hardened horror veteran, such as myself, interested all the way to the end of the movie.The storyline in ""Lights Out"" is about a dysfunctional family troubled by a dark entity that follows the mentally unstable mother Sophie (played by Maria Bello). The oldest daughter Rebecca (played by Teresa Palmer) living on her own, but is soon drawn into the terror that plagues the family as her younger brother Martin (played by Gabriel Bateman) pleads his sister for help.One of the really good aspects to the movie was the way that the visual effects crew made the dark, shadowy entity Diana (played by Alicia Vela-Bailey) to life on the screen in the darkness and made her disappear when light was present. And it really helped that the design of Diana was sort of creepy and disturbing.""Lights Out"" had me captivated from the very start, from there mere way that they brought Diana on the screen and made her seem so freakishly scary.This was definitely one of the better horror movies that have been released in the last couple of years. And it is well worth a place in the collection of any horror fan.I am rating ""Lights Out"" a solid seven out of ten stars rating, and make sure you keep the lights on...",Lights Out
9,Quinoa1984,very good B-level horror,7,10 August 2016,"Lights Out benefits from being two things primarily: a) it's a streamlined narrative focusing on only a small group of characters (a little boy, his sister, their depressed/crazed mother, and the sister's boyfriend, and at the start of the film the boy's father is there but dispatched pretty quickly), and so the filmmakers have as their task to get us to care about these characters only, and they do that through some tight writing that doesn't waste time and Maria Bello in a strong performance as the mother (Theresa Palmer is also quite good as the sister, showing some surprising range, and Gabriel Bateman as Martin the little boy shows some restraint - refreshing after seeing something like The Darkness earlier this summer). And b) the scares, while occasionally of the 'Jump' variety, are well parsed out and there's a conceit here that has a whiff of Nightmare on Elm Street in a good way: you see the characters, mostly the boy, being worn down psychologically and physically (i.e. lack of sleep from not being able to close ones eyes when it goes dark since that's where the ghost-demon whatever resides). This comes from a short film of the same name and I'm pretty sure the filmmakers just translated that to a larger canvas. And they take their time with their set pieces despite a short run-time (it's right under 80 minutes, if anything it could've used a couple extra scenes).Along with the Elm Street comparison (the older generation brings its demonic BS to the younger generation, though at least here the adult has to reckon with this being, I won't get into plot details here but it suffices for a set-up for this ""Diana"" ghost being), if anything at its strongest this could serve as a B-side to The Babadook. It's never as impactful as that as far as the psychology of the characters goes and it starts to rush into certain things that are revealed that can combat the ghost in the last act, but there is that feeling of it being more personally related, that because it boils down to how terrifying a parent being a menace to their child is you can feel the dread whenever the children step into the house that is constantly in darkness (when they walk in during the day I mean, part of the subtle cinematography that builds to the last act).So among the crop of mainstream horror this year it's in terms of craft and intention a cut above some of the others (Darkness, The Forest) and has some work put in to the script. Where it lets down a bit is that it sets up something key in the final minutes about how the characters can combat the ghost and then it ends in a... surprisingly dour and melodramatic fashion. Perhaps it makes sense far as a character arc goes (or maybe not, I may need to process it more later on), but it feels as though the filmmakers are just leaving things open for a sequel, and not in a subtle way - it's like, 'well, that happened, and the ghost of Diana is gone... for now... wooo'. So it's not satisfying entirely as an ending, but thankfully what precedes it is chilling and exciting as a modern horror with very minor Dumb Character Moments (in capital letters).",Lights Out
10,Coventry,You *might* be sleeping with the lights on tonight...,7,7 November 2019,"If you want to make it in Hollywood's horror industry nowadays, you have to make a scarily good short movie with one terrific idea and a handful of spooky images, and then simply hope that it'll go viral on the internet. If it works, influential producers will undoubtedly offer you a big sum of money to turn the short into a full-feature film and, with a bit of luck, your career is launched. It worked for Andy Muschietti with ""Mama"", and now he's helming the massively popular ""It"" remakes. It even worked for James Wan in 2003 already, with ""Saw"", and he's now so successful that he can act as influential producer to launch the careers of new arrivals, like he did for David F. Sandberg and his splendid ""Lights Out"".I'm honestly happy to state that ""Lights Out"" is - at least in my own personal and humble opinion - the first mainstream horror movie in a very long time that is truly good and genuinely frightening. As cliched as it might sound, ""Lights Out"" is the type of fresh new film that restores hope and faith in in the horror genre for old and narrowly cynical fans like myself. The story is simple but highly effective, the lead characters are sympathetic and identifiable for a change, and the special effects (or even the lack thereof) definitely rank the most unnerving ones of the decade. Yes, it's another tale of an eerie ghost terrorizing a poor family, and admittedly several of the jump-scare moments are foreseeable, but the Diana character is authentically nightmarish and for me it was quite exceptional that I hoped for all these likable lead characters to survive instead of to die a quick & painfully.",Lights Out

His older sister Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) finds out what's happening and remembers that she went through the same thing as a child. She tries to discover what her mom is talking to and where it comes from.The story is kind of vague but it works while you're watching it. It's well-directed and has OK acting by the small cast.

14,oscaralbert,Fulfilling its namesake role as America's Early Warning System . . .,7,25 July 2016,". . Warner Bros. has released an easily deciphered warning concerning America's 2016 Election Cycle. LIGHTS OUT tells us that we have ""nothing to fear but fear itself,"" as the Good U.S. Political Party has been telling us for nearly a century. But the Rich People Party has succeeded in ruling through intimidation, fear-mongering, and tall-tale telling. This has caused nearly all of their weak-minded dupes to be driven beyond the Edge of Madness, becoming pill-popping, gun-toting Crazies, just like ""Sophie"" (Maria Bello) in LIGHTS OUT. (Boot camp graduates are particularly susceptible to this, as the two Real Life mass-shooting cop killers so far this summer were both decorated U.S. ""war heroes."") Sophie proves her Evil--which also kills a couple cops--was all in her head, as every threat is neutralized when she blows her brains out. Warner clearly is urging America to lock up ALL the fear-driven, gun-toting, Crazy Trumpsters BEFORE Election Day--and, Heaven Forbid, DON'T LET THEM VOTE! Otherwise, we're all doomed.",Lights Out

16,neil-476,Good horror,8,23 May 2018,"Young Martin lives with mum Sophie. Dad was recently brutally murdered, and adult half-sister Rebecca moved out ages ago. Mum (who has struggled with depression since childhood) appears to talk regularly with someone who isn't actually there. But we have seen some sort of creature which dwells only in darkness - put on the light and it is gone.This horror film gives us a new and intriguing monster. Reminiscent of Doctor Who's Weeping Angels, this entity appears to exist only in darkness: flood it with light, and it is gone. Gradually we uncover the backstory between Sophie and childhood friend Diana, and how it impinges on the horror the family is going through.The story is fun, though not wholly convincing (the effect of light is inconsistent: sometimes the entity appears to disappear, sometime it appears to become invisible but it's still there, and sometimes it is visible and the light blisters it. And what exactly happened to Diana to create this entity, and how does the link with Sophie work?). More to the point, I thought the relationships between Sophie (Maria Bello), Martin (Gabriel Bateman), Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) and Rebecca's boyfriend Bret (Alexander DiPersia) were credible, well-written, and very well performed. We were given characters who were real people: we cared, and hoped they could survive their ordeal. It is unusual to find such well-realised characters in a horror film.The film was visually effective, with the lights on/lights off moments being particularly well done. There was an over-reliance on mad-you-jump sound hits - these weren't necessary because the basic set-up was scary enough on its own.I saw the resolution coming slightly ahead of time, but it worked well nevertheless. And I was particularly pleased that the movie didn't have a contrived shock additional ending tacked on at the very end.This is one of the better horror movies of recent years.",Lights Out
17,anaconda-40658,Lights Out. Enjoy!,9,28 July 2016,"Lights Out (2016): Dir: David F. Sandberg / Cast: Teresa Palmer, Gabriel Bateman, Alexander DiPersia, Maria Bello, Billy Burke: Like The Conjuring and its sequel we are given another triumphant horror film where good vanquishes evil. This one regards facing fears and stars Gabriel Bateman as a young boy startled at night by demonic images as well as his mother talking to her unseen friend Diana. Teresa Palmer plays his grown half sister who arrives to pick him up when another episode occurs. Before long she to is faced with blackened images of Diana who seems to haunt wherever and whomever comes between her and their mother. Palmer believes Bateman because she saw the images when she was young and it resulted in the death of her father. The film opens effectively with Billy Burke playing step-dad who is mangled by Diana at work. Diana's secret is that she needs the dark and fears the light and can apparently make lights turn off. Maria Bello plays their mother who has a past of mental illness and depression. She is affected by Diana after they initially hooked up at a hospital. She is estrange from her daughter but wants desperately to connect with her son but Diana does not like to share. Alexander DiPersia as Palmer's boyfriend is a surprise in the sense that he is written totally opposite then what our first impressions might be. Director David F. Sandberg makes creepy use of lighting while the bizarre image of Diana add to the tone. In the end it is silly but fun leaving viewers with their lights on and eyes open before that dark shadow looms any closer. Score: 9 / 10",Lights Out
18,kannibalcorpsegrinder,An enjoyable if slightly flawed effort,7,8 October 2017,"After returning to her childhood home, a young woman with a fear of the dark finds her younger brother being troubled by the release of the same spirit her mother befriended years ago and must find a way to stop the spirit from tormenting her and her family.This here was a rather fun and engaging effort. One of the bright spots involved with this one is the fact that there's a lot of great work done to accomplish the threat of the spirit upon the family. The scenes of the ghost in the store hallway where it appears in the blackness with some rather stellar jump-scares give this a strong start, while the apartment confrontations where it appears to be stalking him during their appointment together or coming at him in the bedroom all conspire to make this somewhat thrilling during those moments. Even better is the later confrontation in the house where they confront the ghost in the basement or the attack outside which sets up the celebrated sequence in the storage room lit with black-light where they manage to stumble upon the real manner of keeping her away from them which gets this setup for the finale brawl in which the police involvement helps out the action nicely. That these play together so well is a huge testament to the effectiveness of how they feed into the fear of darkness as there are constant mentions of keeping the light on, trying to power up flashlights or frantically waving candles in front of them to stay out of danger. This all goes hand in hand with the spirit's look, which is rather freaky and genuinely makes for a dynamic, dark look overall. These here all make for a good time here over the film's few minor flaws. One of the main issues here is the fact that the film's condensed running time doesn't really mean it should've included several extraneous plot lines. This one manages to feature several story lines that don't really need to be there, from the troubled relationship with the mother to the personal background with the spirit herself as a young girl which really manages to make this all seem stretched out far longer than it needs to be. These are simply issues that spark the concept of the film being adapted from its source material into the longer format as they scream as filler made out to be included merely for the use of stretching the film out. There's also no real reason why the spirit targets the family, as the fact that the spirit comes after the friend yet targets the others makes no sense and could've been explored more. Coupled with the overall tameness of the film due to the rating, these here are what hold this one back.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and children-in-danger.",Lights Out

A frightening entity with a mysterious attachment to their mother, has returned. But this time, as Rebecca gets closer to uncovering the truth about the entity, known as Diana, it gets closer and closer, and then the lights go out.........Modern horror films of late have a tendency to have titles that sound like your mother is telling you off. First we had You're Next, then Don't Blink, Don't Breathe, and now this.I felt like apologising to the person who served me my tickets this morning when asking for this film.And the film really works partly because it doesn't get bogged down into a lengthy back story (that is done via the good old Dictaphone and photo scenario, which is very effective).No, what we get is an opener which is reminiscent of Scream (a biggish star gets Drew Barrymored), and then it's right into the action, when we find Maria Bello talking to the dark, and Martin getting hassled by this quite chilling creation.It's not trying to be anything other than your obligatory PG-13 horror, with jump scares aplenty, and a silly boyfriend who has to be the most needy character on screen this year.Palmer is a good lead, proving that after Wolf Creek, she has the lungs to be a decent scream queen, and the little boy who plays Martin, isn't irritating in the slightest.The ending is a bit of a let down, but it's refreshing to see a B-grade horror film not trying to be clever and just do its job.Giving the audience a decent eighty minutes away from reality.",Lights Out
20,zetes,Wish it were better,5,24 July 2016,"Mediocre horror flick. It has some decent chills - all of which were shown in the trailer - but it's kind of maddeningly straightforward, like it was a student's first draft in a screen writing class taught by a hack, and he only got a C+ with a note on the last page that said ""Good skeleton but needs some flesh."" The dialogue in particular is clunky and overly expositional. None of the actors sound very good reading it. To add to that, the whole shadow ghost (but a metaphor) thing has been done plenty, and the film comes off as the dufus little brother of Mama and The Babadook. It is only 81 minutes, though, and it would probably look decent enough compared to a lot of the horror films I'll watch in October.",Lights Out

It's over with torture porn definitely it's all about the James Wan stories like The Conjuring and Insidious franchise but this one do gave me the goosebumps. The reason is very simple, you don't see an actual body like in the Wan's flicks, you only see silhouettes.And that's why this flick do works. When the lights go out some kind of silhouette appears and do hunt people. When the lights go on, it disappear but the problem is when the lights go out again, it's still there, in other words, it is only seen in the dark.The story itself isn't that strong after all, you've seen it a thousand times before but it's the dark that drags you into the story. A nice entry into the new horror genre and much more creepier then the Wan's flicks. If you did like the Babadook (2014) which is a bit of the same you will certainly love this feature.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",Lights Out

Okay it's a new concept but that's not a guarantee for success. The cast is okay though, nothing bad to say about them. They tried but at the end the story just failed. It just doesn't make any sense at all at some points. How can that body burn in the lights if it disappears every time there is light?

25,KineticSeoul,"Besides the lights out scenes, the plot however just seemed so tacked on",3,3 November 2016,"What started the development of this movie was because of a youtube video with the same title that went viral. I will admit it was a frightening short youtube clip. But as a movie as a whole it was overly drawn out even for it being around an hour and 20 minutes long. It's mainly because the lights out aspect of it all came first before the story. Because the plot just seemed like it was just tacked on to pull off the lights out scenes. The story is very generic and has been done before so many times, and not just in horror movies. So when it comes to the plot it is worse than some straight to DVD horror or slasher movies. So overall, this is a horror flick that isn't really worth a watch in my opinion. But if you have the patience to sit through the boring drama for the lights out scenes, it might not be so bad for you.3.5/10",Lights Out
26,sddavis63,"Some Good Chills, But A Confusing Story",6,15 March 2017,"Just on the basis of the ""creep factor"" alone, anyone would have to say that ""Lights Out"" was a pretty effective horror movie. At its best, it has the ability to make you jump and to send chills up and down your spine. Since, basically, that's the goal of any horror movie, this has to be rated as a success. Right from the beginning, it's creepy and even scary. With no background at all into what's happening or why it's happening those opening scenes are disorienting and certainly capture your attention and make you want to keep watching. The basic premise - of some sort of monster who appears only in the dark - lends itself to a wonderful atmosphere that's used to very good effect. A lot of this movie is shot in the dark or with very dim light that adds to the tension. I also appreciated the fact that unlike a lot of today's horror movies, there's very little blood or gore in this. It really does depend on the atmosphere - something that we see too little of. Every now and then there's even a little bit of humour thrown in (whether it was intentional or whether it was just something that struck me I'm not sure of, but I did chuckle at Bret's escape from the house.) So there was a lot to like in this - including a pretty decent performance from Maria Bello as the mentally ill and tormented mom Sophie.What didn't work so well for me, though, was the basic story. I just really didn't understand Diana. I understand the backstory - but where did she come from? And how? It seems as if she existed in Sophie's mind - and yet she was able to do a lot of physical things to a lot of people, even sometimes when Sophie wasn't around (such as in those opening scenes, or in Rebecca's apartment.) I can be forgiving of horror movies that have outlandish plots. These are horror movies, after all, and outlandish plots are just a part of the genre. But somehow and in some way you have to be able to suspend your disbelief enough to make the story work. I had trouble doing that with Diana. I just couldn't make her ""work."" I couldn't find a way to make her make sense to me. Sure - maybe I'm thinking too hard about it, but that really took away from the movie for me. I needed something a little more coherent to make this a truly great horror movie.But it does have chills, and it can make you jump a little bit from time to time. Lots of horror movies don't manage to do that. So it does deserve some credit for that. (6/10)",Lights Out
27,Hellmant,"If you're looking for good scares, that's probably what you'll get.",8,27 July 2016,"'LIGHTS OUT': Four Stars (Out of Five)Supernatural horror flick; about a violent spirit, which can't survive in the light, that's stalking a young woman and her brother. The film was produced by horror master James Wan, and it was directed by first time feature filmmaker David F. Sandberg. It was written by Eric Heisserer, and it's based on Sandberg's 2013 short film (of the same name). The movie stars Teresa Palmer, Gabriel Bateman, Maria Bello, Alexander DiPersia and Billy Burke. It's surprisingly received (mostly) good reviews from the critics, and it's also performed admirably well at the Box Office (so far). I enjoyed it.The movie tells the story of a young woman, named Rebecca (Palmer). Rebecca learns that her unstable mother (Bello) is off her medication again. Her brother, Martin (Bateman), is struggling at school because of it; due to the fact that he's getting very little sleep. Rebecca brings Martin home to her house, and she soon learns that he's being haunted by an evil spirit; which can only survive in the dark.The film is a little clichéd, and routine (in story); but it's also really well made, and filled with great haunting imagery. The concept (of a ghost that can't survive in the light) plays out really well, in frightening imagery. The film is scary, and the performances are all decent (except for maybe the young boy). The fact that the script, and characters, might be a little poorly written, doesn't effect the suspense quality of the movie. If you're looking for good scares, that's probably what you'll get.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/176638264",Lights Out
28,thesar-2,Bright light! Bright light!,8,7 October 2016,"Last call, the final song, closing timeis always when the dreaded lights came on in the club. We all hated it like we vampires, or some crazy person's best friend.What a darling, little and highly effective thriller. I'm not one for ghost stories, especially when they retread the same haunted house/family just moved in story. But, Lights Out, a quick, tight, 81 minute tale impressed me on many levels.For starters, the story was pretty original: an anti-light shadow figure is mysteriously a mother's ""imaginary friend,"" but is definitely not friends with people attached to said mother. When anyone, including the kids, tries to separate the two, well, keep the lights on. Also, the acting and characters were pretty good. Believable, deep and with the perfect runtime, they didn't go too far or too little. Additionally, it was well shot, clever and always kept new and fresh ideas to this family's journey.I only had two main gripes. One: the SUPER convenient movie exposition when our heroine daughter discovers the past in mere seconds when it was always under her fingertips her entire life. Additionally, and again, I'm no ghost-movie lover, but why do all the demon/ghosts always look the same, move the same and always go for the same obvious jump-scares? I guess it works on people who've never seen one Grudge, one Conjuring, one Sinister, one Insidious, etc, etc. They're the new oval-shaped- headed aliens you used to see in all the 1990-2000s alien invasion films like Signs.But, aside from those, I had a good time. I always love me some Maria Bello, liked the future son-in-law's (?) character a lot, the boy did a very good job and Not-Kristen Stewart, Teresa Palmer, also did pretty well. Well, maybe because she was, in fact, not Kristen Stewart. Horror/thriller/ghost fans unite, and see this moviebut only give it so much money so they DON'T make a sequel. I do NOT want one; this movie does NOT need one.***Final thoughts: Day 7 Movie in the Can! I'm watching a NEW-2-ME horror movie every day of October 2016 and this one comes highly recommended by so many people. Luckily, as much as I don't favor supernatural story lines, thanks to some really quality ones I've seen the last year or so, like It Follows, The Conjuring 2 and Oculus, I'm not shying away from them as much. If ghost movies continue to take up 85% of the horror market, like they've done for the past decade, I'm pleased, at very least, filmmakers are finally, FINALLY, getting creative with them.",Lights Out

30,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"While it suffers from some glaring narrative issues and it isn't all that scary, 'Lights Out' is still an enjoyable film that is visually interesting and well acted.",7,24 August 2016,"'Lights Out (2016)' is a horror film directed by David F. Sandberg, based upon his original short film of the same name. The central premise is that there's a creature which can only manifest itself in darkness, so - as the title suggests - it is only visible when the lights are out. This is a really cool and creepy idea, one which taps into a fear which almost everyone will have had at some point in their lives - a fear of the dark. The concept is by far the strongest point of this picture. It's a bit of a shame that it isn't utilised to its full potential. There are a number of contrivances and plot holes which dampen the overall impact of the piece, and the final product isn't really all that scary. However, it is well-made, entertaining and has some unique imagery as well as some interesting set-pieces.The primary issue with the film derives from the script, with a large number of inconsistencies and absurdities that feel especially prominent upon retrospection. True, in the moment a lot of these issues aren't all that obvious or intrusive, but there are a few that stick out immediately and all of them are prevalent when given more than a second's thought. There are several moments which completely betray the concept, moments in which the film breaks its own rules. There is confusion created about what happens to the creature when it is in the light, whether it is merely rendered invisible or completely disappears, and also confusion as to whether it is constantly a grounded presence or if it can hop impossibly between sections of shadow. It's these inconsistencies that dampen the effect of both the premise and the villain; it seems as though Sandberg couldn't maintain a persistent concept for a feature-length outing. It's a shame, as the film suffers greatly for this apparent lack of attention. The other trouble with the creature is that it is given a thorough backstory relatively early on, which eliminates any mystery and is actually rather disappointing. It's honestly quite unbelievable and, again, lessens the impact of the antagonistic being. This isn't helped by the fact that its actual design is fairly generic and not really frightening; the creature in the original short is much creepier and much more affecting. The villain is also tied directly to the main characters and is thus not presented as a possible threat to the audience; it doesn't have the impact of something like the 'It' from 'It Follows (2015)', a creature which is passed on by sex and therefore could be easily passed onto you, or even the staying power of the concept behind 'A Nightmare On Elmstreet (1984)', one which is sure to haunt your dreams, though it should have as darkness is all around us.The creature is visually interesting in terms of its silhouette, movement and the shots it is contained in. It always feels tangible and like a palpable presence within the scene, meaning that the director's choice to do as much in camera as possible clearly pays off. The actress portraying the entity, Alicia Vela-Bailey, does a good job of selling the creepiness and unhinged nature of her character. The cinematography is also great, coming across as crisp and not too dull. The lighting is a huge part of what sells the effect of the creature, and it works perfectly. The overall effect is believable and interesting to watch; even when specific scenes clash with the general premise, they are always engaging and distinct. There's some great direction, with minimal shaky-cam, consistently clean framing, a healthy variety of shot types and some engaging blocking. On top of that, there are some really neat scenes featuring the creature, focusing on the interplay between shadow and light, and some clever moments that are genuinely inspired. My main issue with the direction is that there are several jump-scares that are only even remotely effective due to an increase in volume and intrusive music; the sound becomes insanely loud to try to trick you into being scared, but the visuals end up being marred by this as the audio is very distracting.The script in general is good, aside from its narrative issues, and has a decent family drama at its heart. The focus is always on character and luckily the majority are good. Teresa Palmer is great, portraying fear convincingly and creating a rounded character with some interesting issues. The young Gabriel Bateman is also fantastic, managing to not only keep up with the other actors but sometimes even surpass them. He hits all of his emotional cues well, and is very naturalistic. The boyfriend character, played by Alexander DiPersia, was more competent and useful than usual and isn't annoying at all. Maria Bello does a good job in her role, too, but she is oddly sidelined at times.Overall, 'Lights Out (2016)' is a generally good movie that unfortunately suffers from some narrative and conceptual issues, as well as not being particularly scary. It is well directed and visually interesting, though. Plus, the acting is top-notch and it's enjoyable throughout: 7/10.",Lights Out

34,Reno-Rangan,Don't let the lights go off.,7,24 October 2016,"Kind of impressed with this, because horror films usually overly rely on the twist at the end, but this film was simple and edgy. It was based on the short film of the same name, directed by the same director which is his feature film debut and he did an awesome job. Looking forward for his next flick 'Annabelle' sequel, but as per the latest news, the sequel for this is on and he's going to direct it as well.Just a five million dollar film, but a top notch flick from all the aspect. It was not about the evil force versus the humans, just a series of events that connects with the psychological trauma. But there's a little flashback, where the source of all the trouble revealed and that was the twist actually this film relied which was so casually rendered yet very effective.Some people might get scared for those supernatural scenes, but it was not scary at all. It was the story that I liked the most. Particularly, not drawing too much attention to prove and obviously drag the plot for a longer runtime was the key to its success. An 80 minute film with a good pace and performances, this is one of the best horror of the recent. I think it is worth a watch.7/10",Lights Out

36,TheMovieDiorama,You may want to keep the lights on...,7,31 August 2016,"A horror movie that is not actually a sequel (surprisingly), Lights Out is about a family who are experiencing a supernatural presence that can only stay in the dark as they go through a difficult time in their lives. I remember when the initial trailer came out and everyone's minds were blown, a horror movie that looks refreshing and scary. Is it both of those things? For the most part yes. Lights Out was actually legitimately unnerving mostly due to the refreshing gimmick it uses: keep the lights on. It was a clever move to use the fear of darkness and turn it up to the maximum level of ""good luck getting any sleep for the next 2 weeks!"". But even more clever and surprising was that it was a horror movie with great acting and a good story. Teresa Palmer and Maria Bello are probably the more famous actresses in the movie, and they were convincing (especially Palmer, finally a film she can actually show some emotion). Heck, even the on-screen boyfriend had depth and was likable...that never happens in horror movies. The story between mother and daughter and the sorrow and anger they both feel due to past incidents was conveyed excellently, makes the characters much more investing and relatable. Sure, the creepy ghost girl is creepy and the darkness is dark and the jump scares were jumpy...but the movie was so much better due to the acting. The lighting in this movie was consistently appropriate, not too dark you cannot see anything and not too bright that it loses the atmosphere. The only flaws with this film were that it was ridiculously short, at 1 hour 21 minutes this was close to being straight to home media. They could easily have prolonged the chemistry of the family or added in some more fresh gimmicks and the film would've actually benefited from it. Some key plot points of the film were predictable, but it's very rare to see horror film that is unpredictable so this was to be expected. Overall, Lights Out was a refreshing horror movie with a fresh gimmick and quality acting even if the runtime is ridiculously short.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",Lights Out

38,subxerogravity,"Liked it's fresh take on the horror genre as a whole, but I don't think it made me even think about keeping the lights on as I sleep.",8,24 July 2016,"If you seen the trailer, then you get the tone of the movie. It's a ghost story about a ghost who can only appear when the lights are off.The film preys on that fear of the dark too. Very little it's around the corner, it's moving objects or it's making all sorts of noise to frighten you. When the lights are off, the ghost appears, and is there in your face until you find a source of light.I don't know if this genre of movie is called a Ghost story, but this movie does have the basic outline of movies such as the Conjuring 2 or Insidious that really focus on what can get human beings jumping out of there seats.Although, this did not work as well as it should in Lights Out. The ghost was creepy and it's aggressiveness was disturbing, but they may have showed too much of the ghost this time. It was literally there when ever the lights were off no matter what and after a while, it lost a little bit of it's haunting and the natural fear it has on it's prey (Us as the viewers). Plus the visual effect of the ghost was a one trick pony. What you see in the trailer does not evolve from there in the movie.But where the ghost is weak, the movie makes up for in who it's haunting. Maria Bello was great in this film as a psychotic mother of two who technically is the one the ghost seems to be bothering the most. I was very convince from out of the park that this woman was driven crazy by this experience. Great acting job.The two kids in the movie, Rebecca, a rebellious, not easily scared women who moved out cause she got tired of her wacked out mom, and Martian a tween who can't sleep at night cause of what turned out to be a genuine fear of the dark, made for great satire of the horror genre. When Martian realized that the person his mother would talk to at night was real enough to hurt him, he did not hesitate to the pack a bag and to go and stay with his sister.It was bits like that and others where the main characters did not easily fall into the cliché traps of every horror film (especially good and very fresh to portray smart blonde females in a horror movie). In fact the dumb bimbo role actually went to Bret, Rebecca's plaything desperately trying to get promoted to boyfriend.So the movie was fresh and amusing and perfect to watch on the big screen or with others ready to be scared, but as it turns out, their attempts to be more smart and less cliché makes for a monster not so good at making you jump out of your seat and spill your popcorn.http://cinemagardens.com/?p=49",Lights Out
39,jtindahouse,Short and sweet,7,31 October 2016,"At only 81 minutes, 'Lights Out' is short, even for a horror movie. It's also very well made. David F. Sandberg found such success with his 3 minute short film, that he decided to make a feature length film out of it, and it seems that was a good idea. The film has been met with a very warm reception (both critically and at the Box Office), something very rare in the horror film genre today. Producer James Wan (seemingly the only person in Hollywood who has figured out the horror genre and seems to be associated with success time and again) is behind this, and with a sequel having been green lit one day after this films release due to it immediately making its budget back, it looks like he might have another successful franchise on his hands.The film is simple in its concept, but admittedly very effective. It deals almost exclusively in jump scares, but they are of a high quality and likely to give even the most seasoned horror viewers a startle. The ghost/ghoul/spirit (whatever you want to call it) is well designed and very creepy. The characters aren't completely unlikable and are well-acted for the most part.

The storyline is about an older sister who went through a dramatic childhood who was haunted when the lights went outside. She overcame that fear but notices her younger brother seems to have the same problem; but this time the issue is more serious than ever as his observations are tied to a spirit and their mother. Can the siblings work together before the spirit kills them? This movie is directed by David Sandberg who also did Shazam and Annabelle: The Creation. This movie also has Maria Bello in the cast who I'm always a fan of (History of Violence). The special effects and scare sequences are fairly well done and the storyline is believable and worth following. This reminded me of Darkness Falls a little bit (2003).

FYI: James Wan has just been announced as the director on the upcoming Aquaman movie. Back to this movie, Billy and Maria are a married couple with problems; Maria's first husband left home under mysterious circumstances-Just up & left with no explanation. Billy is husband number 2. Teresa is the daughter from the first marriage and she left home too, because of abandonment issues from her daddy. Gabriel is the son from Billy and Maria and he gets to see Billy leave the picture and Maria go to pieces-Hey, Maria has now lost a total of 2 husbands. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Maria spent time in a mental hospital-as a young girl-where she met Alicia, a girl with a rare skin condition that makes her sensitive to light. The doctors tried to cure her condition but..well, let's just say that things didn't work out like they thought they would and Alicia is now an apparition. As an adult, Alicia has grown overly jealous of anyone getting close to Maria, and when they try to, Alicia gets mad. One thing good is that Alicia only comes out in the dark so any kind of light is a good deterrent and the film makers do come up with some inventive ways of using light sources. Another thing I liked was that they also used more real, practical effects instead of a lot of CGI-in real life, besides being a stuntwoman, Alicia is also a gymnast and can move her body in weird positions. After seeing it, you just might find a new reason to be afraid of the dark.

44,parry_na,Jump-scare-tastic!,8,8 April 2019,"This exceptional, unpretentious chiller wastes no time in putting the wind up the audience. Here are creatures that exist in shadow, but disappear in the light - a terrific concept for jump scares, and is an idea that has been used in various guises over the years (not least in the form of The Weeping Angels in Doctor Who). Wayward goth Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) is taking care of her little step brother Martin (Gabriel Bateman) , whose father has been killed (in an effective opening scene); his mother Sophie (Maria Bello) has seemingly gone mad, talking to a shadowy entity called Diana. Between them, and boyfriend Bret (Alicia Vela-Bailey), they aim to get to the bottom of this shady business.The use of jump-scares has reached epidemic proportions in horror films recently, coupled with a crescendo screeching of soundtrack violins, and is in danger of wringing itself dry through over-use. But here, the whole concept is a series of such scares - you know they're coming but you don't know when; and they are the fabric of the story. And they are very effective.Director David F. Sandberg has based this on his own 2013 short of the same name. I have not seen this, but it has been critically acclaimed. This expanded version doesn't feel padded in any way, the extra time possibly being given over to brief explanations of Diana's original story, and fleshing out of the characters, all of which are extremely well played (and cast). Also, for a film which *might* uncharitably be dismissed as a succession of 'boo!' moments, the tension builds throughout with no real feeling of repetition. There is emotion here, too, without ever becoming syrupy. Deservedly, 'Lights Out' proved to be a commercial and critical success upon its release.",Lights Out

It suffers slightly in its early stages when it seems to rely on cheap jump scares and another problem that it has is that it does take its time in developing its story (despite the fact that it only clocks in with a running time of around 80 minutes or so).Having said that when it does get going and once you've had the necessary exposition to get an inkling of what is going on then it isn't half bad; as I've already said the film is pretty creepy and the narrative has just about enough steam to be able to keep driving things forward (in spite of the familiarity). Aside from being fairly creepy, director David F Sandberg also deserves praise for his 'claustrophobic' style direction - there are lots of shots that are framed in tight spaces and even when the camera is in open spaces it rarely sits still which gives the film plenty of adrenalin which helps to keep it enjoyable.The cast are all good and help to draw us in to their terror; Maria Bello is probably the only recognisable face to many people and despite her giving rather mixed performances in the past she is actually really good here. Palmer and Bateman are both strong natural actors and both give excellent performances.In order to try and give some balance I feel that I have to address some of the negatives with this film; whilst it is a creepy film, some of the scares are cheap jump scares and sadly they are a tad repetitive at times. On a minor note, I was also puzzled by how a 13 year old dead girl somehow morphed into a 6 foot tall undead presence??? I mean I'm all for artistic licence when it comes to the occult/supernatural, but surely when you're dead and if you were to return as a ghost then you'd surely be the same size as when you died so unless Diana was a giant when she died this makes no sense at all????Despite the above, Lights Out is still a very good horror film that manages to be creepy, but never to the point where it feels as though it is trying too hard resulting in it being a detriment to the film. It has its share of flaws here and there, but it has enough selling points to make it worth watching.",Lights Out
48,sauravjoshi85,Please do not go by the negative reviews and watch before judging it,8,24 December 2020,"Lights out is a Horror mystery movie directed by David F. Sandberg and stars Teresa Palmer, Gabriel Bateman, Maria Bello and Billy Burke.After seeing the movie i was not able to understand such a low rating of this movie on IMDB as this is one of the best horror movie i have seen in recent times. I also started watching the movie with least exception but the movie had proved me wrong.The plot of the movie is good and the execution is superb, the screenplay is tight and will keep you holding throughout the scenes. The best part of the movie is that it doesn't wastes much time in reveling the plot and starts very early. Mostly jump scares is used to terrify and to scare and is used perfectly. Acting is also great and every character were very well written and enacted.The cinematography is good and the climax is strong with a great ending. If you loves jump scares movies, this movie is for you. A Must watch.",Lights Out
49,davispittman,Very scary and well done,8,26 July 2016,"Lights out really is a great modern horror film. It offers great thrills and also offers wonderful acting. Every actor did their job beautifully and the characters they portray are well constructed, they are not just surface level, cardboard cut out characters. The visuals are good, the darkness and the creepy eeriness effect of a lot of scenes work very well. There are some scenes that may even be somewhat hard to watch because of the utter creepiness. Diana and the visuals that make her up are done very well and the horror is real here, it's not cheap or cheesily boring. The opening of the film is also very effective in its attempt to be truly scary. This movie isn't very gory or overly grotesque either, it has a minimal amount of blood/gore, and some violent images, but not a whole whole lot, which it good and a wise decision by the filmmakers, because if a scary movie is too gory or overly disturbing, then it can be distracting from the plot. You want people focused on the plot of the movie and on what's going on, not on the ridiculous amount of gore. Lights out receives an 8/10 on my scale.",Lights Out

The guy ends up killed.Then we meet the typical young female Hollywood character and her typical sorry Hollywood character male counterpart. She's in charge, super-independent, and isn't interested in a relationship; the poor looser she's been sleeping with for months is desperate to move in with her, or at least be allowed to leave a pair of jeans at her ugly place, or just a single sock--all of which gets denied.Her little half-brother has been having trouble at school, he falls asleep. His mother is the wife of the guy who died. So it turns out the kid sees the shadow creature too and knows he's safe in the light. The mother is wacky and sort of tries to convince the kid that the creature, called Diana, is nothing to worry about. The kid then moves in with the girl. But Diana now starts showing up at her place. The girl then grabs some boxes of papers from the mom's place and discovers something about the identity of Diana and her relationship to the mother, who for some reason has all sorts of records and recordings relating to Diana's past.Eventually all will have to confront Diana and the resolution is pretty interesting. In the process there are lots of scares and jump-out-of-your seat moments. The creature of Diana is well-done inspired by Japanese horror always accompanied with the crackling sounds and the twitching limbs. But this is your typical American abbreviated but effective horror that creates no tension nor scary atmosphere. The despicable girl is smartly assigned to the beautiful Teresa Palmer, so while you can't stand her she's still easy on the eyes. Aside from this pathetic political nonsense, Lights Out is one of the few good horror movies of 2016.",Lights Out
53,aharmas,Jump!,9,8 August 2016,"""Lights Out"" goes back to the simple pleasures of a scary movie, the way they made them long ago. You put people in a ""haunted house"" where inexplicable events are happening, but instead of being all scattered and having all kinds of things flying around the place, trashing the furniture, and killing everyone off, leaving a big bloody mess behind, this film focuses on one evil entity and a family in distress.A family has falling into emotional turmoil, with a mother experiencing psychological stress and causing plenty of anxiety to her two children. The younger sibling, a boy, refuses to stay with his mother. She's unstable and weird things are happening in the house, especially when the lights go out.Most of us can identify with his troubles.. When we were young children, one of the scariest situations was going to sleep in a place that was dark, with the worst ones being the areas in the closets or the space under the beds. Most interestingly, the film is relatively quiet, using good use of creaking sounds, doors slamming, thumping noises. There is no unnecessary rain storms, crazy animals or anything of the kind. The camera follows the kids as they try to escape the attacks of Diana, the mysterious entity.There's a connection to their mother, and it is explained during the mid section of the film. It really becomes secondary to the development of events in the house, as more truths come out, and evil keeps intensifying her attacks.The resolution might not please all of us, but it has a definite end, and the film is short, movies quickly, always hitting the right notes for a good, frightful time at the movies.",Lights Out
54,peterp-450-298716,Not as frightening as I thought it would be. I'm sure some will leave the light on at night after seeing it.,5,12 January 2017,"""You should let me stay at your place, just for a night. Good luck with that one, buddy.""In the vinyl era (Indeed, I experienced those days as well) you could purchase an extended version of a single. The so-called maxi-single. Sometimes you were surprised by the extended version of the single because not so bad sounding variations were added in an artistic way. However, in most cases it was just a miserable elongated version with unnecessary repetitions and tedious long intros and outros. The final feeling was more like a slight disappointment and a sudden realization that the music industry tricked you again and took away your laboriously saved money in a shrewd way. A maxi-single wasn't a guarantee that a sublime sounding music tune would sound even more impressive. I have the same feeling about ""Lights out"". The short film (this movie is based on) went viral on You Tube and reached a very high level in terms of originality and entertainment. This version is nothing more than a stretched version with the same phenomenon repeating itself over and over again. And that's an entity which is only visible when the lights go out. And believe me, there are a lot of non-functioning lights or incidents in which the lights suddenly stop functioning. An irritating number of times.People don't feel at ease in the dark instinctively. Children and even adults are afraid in the dark sometimes. That's a form of self-protection. Protection against the unknown and against taking any risks. And that uneasy feeling is exploited in ""Lights out"" thoroughly. And the fact that the threat can be eliminated again and again by making use of a light source, is a unique feature that can be used in an interesting way. Sadly enough, the mystery and the origin of the creature is being revealed already early. No surprise anymore and less excitement. The only thing remaining in this typical horror are the acting and the use of jump scares. And fortunately this wasn't so bad. Most horrors fail in this area as well. They try to scare you by showing scary or terrible, gory incidents. ""Lights out"" tries to instill fear by using that what you can't see.You don't need to wait long in this movie before the scary events start. Before you know it, you're witnessing how this scary-looking creature wanders in the darkness and makes its first victim. A warning for heart patients. This first confrontation could result in a heart failure. And believe me, such frightening moments will occur frequently. This thing that dwells in the dark, looks extremely creepy and made me think of the phenomenon that could be admired in ""Mama"". The next victims could be the young boy Martin (Gabriel Bateman), who still lives with his mentally unstable mother Sophie (Maria Bello), and his older sister Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) who apparently faced the same appearance in the past and therefore left home. In some way, there is a connection between the entity and Rebecca. A kind of materialized delusion that exists solely because of the depressive moods and the delusional state of the insane mother. That's why it acts so aggressively towards persons that could disturb that relationship. Well, maybe I'm wrong but I thought this was the explanation of it all.As mentioned earlier, at times it's really exciting and the movie will scare the wits out of you. The story as a whole is a bit of a setback and far-fetched. As I read somewhere on the Internet: ""The script can basically be summed up as The babadook but dumb"". No complains about the acting though. The three main characters deliver a brilliant performance. Unfortunately, despite the original concept, they still used some predictable and weak options (such as a filing cabinet located in the basement with all the answers to hard questions being found). Sadly this feature film lacks the finesse of the short film. So, it isn't really innovative. But it's still entertaining enough.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",Lights Out
55,aidanratesmovies,A Breathtaking Horror Film that isn't without its weaker moments,9,24 September 2020,"A truly horrifying and well acted little horror flick, Lights Out's somwhat simple premise may stretch itself a bit at times, but it proves to be just unique enough to hold itself together with scares to spare. I am quite dumbfounded at the fact at how scary this film is for being just PG-13. I am not a huge fan of PG-13 horror flicks, and it truly surprised me at how ruthless this film was in comparison to so many other flicks of the same rating, easily being the scariest of the bunch since The Ring back in 2002. The film is made with a somewhat small budget, just under 5 million, and it certainly looks that way if you pay close enough attention- although nothing really feels cheap about it. The visual horror is without a doubt striking whenever you catch it on screen, and due to Sandberg's use of primarily practical effects instead of CGI, it is without a doubt a very impressive collection of frightful moments that I can't help but admire. As for the script, for the most part, the characters do prove to be quite basic, but the premise does luckily shine through. There are certainly moments throughout, notably more so towards the beginning, that seem to stretch the plot as much as possible in order to make a theatrical length. That being said, I wasn't ever bored watching it, there are just clearer moments where the film is more dull than others. Though the characters aren't anything too speical, there are several smart twists throughout, and the actors due truly give the film the most of their ability. In the end, Lights Out is a fun and rather scary horror flick that is certainly a good watch for horror fans- and a rather decent one for film buffs alike.

56,AudioFileZ,Simple Horror Show,5,17 October 2016,"This is what used to be made for drive-ins. A ""C"" movie horror flick that relies heavily on the jump factor. If you look at it in that way, without too much introspection it mostly works.A family torn by the mental illness of the mother sets up a co-dependency with a dark specter that returns with the mother's illness to finish breaking up the remaining members of the family. It's almost like a play, with scenes in, mainly, the family home only using a few others as a setup for the house where it builds to a climax. Lights Out has a rather simple plot and works it by using constant ominous fear of an evil and angry spirit's attempts to fully possess a host by removing anyone who stands in the way. The youngest child and his step-sister are standing in the way of the demonic entity completely breaking down the mother who, at times, seems to be complicit. Finally, with them all together over a night in the house things come to a grisly head. Taking nods from countless stories of possession and distilling down without third parties, such as paranormal investigators, Lights Out delivers some scares in a modest way. In it's limited scope it's watchable if not great.",Lights Out

59,rgkarim,What Creepy Things Lurk when the Lights Go Out,7,21 July 2016,"When things go bump in the night and the amount of light is limited at best, your imagination plays tricks on you. Often we perceive the worst thing lurking in the shadows, waiting to wrap its tendrils, claws, or whatever appendage around your body and finish you off. Well a short film project by David Sandberg laid the groundwork for a major motion picture that plays off of that fear. Welcome to another Robbie's movie reviews and today we focus on the latest horror film to grace the theaters entitled Lights out. Lets get started!The GOOD:  The story  Teresa Palmer  The creepinessSurprise, surprise, we actually have a horror movie with a plot this weekend. Lights out writers were able to craft a tale that had a little more depth than some of its fellow scare thrillers. One part digging into the past and another part progressing forward, Lights out does a nice job of balancing both sides of the coin during its short ninety minutes. The pace of the story is set nicely for most of the movie, though it does skip on the details sometimes that added the corny edge to it. For once, I wish the movie was a little longer so that we could explore a little more into the past (primarily Rebecca's story). Those details could have added a little more depth and uniqueness to the tale and perhaps robbed the cheesiness we saw. Fortunately, the lovely Teresa Palmer's acting enriches the story. She hasn't had the greatest roles, but this movie worked with her. Her edginess, sincerity, and attitude all mixed well to craft a character that was easy to latch onto and root for. Yeah some of the writing was a little corny at times, and her tough girl attitude was cute to see as she took on the spirit. Regardless, she played the mature, older sister very well and carried the movie. Her supporting cast only further supported her talent with Gabriel Bateman and Alexander Dipersia making an excellent pair to bring the tale to life. In regards to the scare factor though, Lights Out's strongest aspects is the creepy level. The trailers speak the truth when it says it makes your nightmares come to life. For me the shadows and feeling abandoned in the dark were the biggest thing to freak me out, especially in the realistic environments this movie takes place in. Seeing Diana (the ghoul in this movie) emerge from the shadows in her misshapen form only further sending a chill across my skin. All these factors build an epic suspense and heighten your fear of what lurks in the dark. ButThe BAD  Lackluster Scares  The endingDespite all the build up and being stuck in the shadows, the actual jump scares were lacking for my friends and me. Most things involved the abrupt start of music and became very predictable in what tactic they would use. Perhaps it was due to Diana not doing much, or maybe they just couldn't keep things fresh enough, but the scares were missing in some sense for me. Therefore, those looking to have themselves frightened to the point of peeing their pants are out of luck. Oh well, the creepiness will linger in your mind longer to tell the truth. And despite all the good of the story, there were still some things that needed a little tightening up to get the full effect. As mentioned the pace is a little rushed, the background stories are lacking, and the lines are cornier than a maze in the fall. However, it is the ending that made me sigh in disappointment. After a prolonged, semi-exciting battle against Diana, the ending occurs rather bluntly. Yes it had some emotional fervor behind it, and it will make my more dark hearted audience members reel in delight. I just wish it had more kick behind it instead of the compromise we got. My guess is the fast pace led to the abrupt ending, either that or they couldn't think of anything to finish out the fight in that epic manner (a.k.a Star Wars Episode III). Whatever the reason, the ending wraps things up and could be vague enough to allow for another sequel to grace the screen. The Verdict:Lights out is certainly not the most original ghost story we've received. However, it still has the edge, presentation, and story to put this movie on an upper shelf of horror quality. In terms of scare factor, again the creepiness will leave you afraid to venture into the dark, but its not going to leave your hair white anytime soon. However, in terms of intriguing tale it definitely gets points in this category for me. Is it worth a trip to the theater? In my opinionnot really, and your money would be better spent on say Star Trek this weekend. My scores are: Horror: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0",Lights Out
60,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Lights Out,7,14 August 2016,"While attending a screening for 2016's Lights Out (my latest review), it felt like I was watching a student horror film or should I say, one of the greatest student horror films ever made. With a tiny budget of $5 million, only a handful of characters, and some efficacious jump scares (despite the fact that they were a bit familiar), ""Lights"" director David F. Sandberg makes this cinematic debut stylish and rather unsettling. He makes it his own.For what's it worth, Lights Out is old school, nuts and buts movie-making. Its eerie, first 45 minutes reminded me of the fright fandom of yesteryear. Containing a simple concept in which a disturbing, Medusa-like apparition only appears in darkness, ""Lights"" is for the most part, effective until its novelty loses steam in the final, underwhelming act. This nifty little scare-fest is invariably small scale, a one-trick pony, a ghostly canard. I'm going to recommend it and also praise the raw performance of Maria Bello (a Chicago Film Critics Award winner) which elevates the acting cred of ""Lights"" to an even higher level.Containing a twist ending I didn't see coming (it all made sense though) and produced by Saw man James Wan, Lights Out introduces us to a new breed of spectral villainy named Diana (she's played by Alicia Vela- Bailey). Diana is a back from the dead mental patient, a unpleasant imaginary friend, and when the lights are off and it's nighttime, she kills people by throwing them around like a sack of potatoes. Throughout the film's short running time (an hour and twenty-one minutes plus credits), Diana terrorizes a small family (Maria Bello as depressed mother Sophie, Teresa Palmer as her daughter Rebecca, and Gabriel Bateman as her son Martin) until they can find a way to stop her.Director Sandberg taking cues from 2013's The Conjuring, plays with his audience by not letting them know when to flinch in their seats or not. My favorite scene overall (spoiler), is when Diana takes out two L.A. cops with loud gunfire blazing. It's something else. Also, I liked the way the actors/actresses reacted with fear in ""Lights"". I don't wholly agree but most troupers say reacting is even harder than actual acting.Now if I had to pick one flaw in Lights Out, it would be the notion that ""dirty"" Diana can turn any house light off with her supernatural powers but can't blow out a candle or suck the life out of batteries in a flashlight. Huh? I expected more from a ghoul who speaks like she's smoked four packs of Lucky Strikes, moves from one dark room to another with lightning speed, and hasn't had a manicure in decades. Ha-ha. Anyway, ""Lights"" isn't the scariest movie ever made but if you're game, it may do for incandescent lighting what Jaws did for not wanting to go in the water. I wasn't entirely affected after I left the theater but as a ten-year old, it would've given me massive nightmares. Rating: 3 stars.",Lights Out
61,eric262003,The Dark Really Can Be a Scary Place,7,13 February 2018,"When we were young, it was normal that we were afraid of things that go bump in the night, or that monsters were hiding under the bed or in the closet and that going to bed at night seemed labourious not to mention frightful. As we get older we adult up and try to overcome our fears and manifestations and expunge all that nonsense. But in reality, the dark isn't the scary things, but the things that come when only it is dark. The slightest house settling noise can send chills down your spine. And if that doesn't make one hide under the covers, how about a freaky, wiry-haired silhouette gazing down at you from a nearby doorway? And once you turn the lights on, it disappears. This aforementioned spook is the terror is the topic from the directing debut of David F. Sandberg 2016 horror film ""Lights Out"". The creepy figure fueling nightmares galore is an evil demonic spirit of Diana who was a longtime friend of a mentally unstable mother named Sophie (Maria Bello) who was killed when a medical experiment went awry and that the exposure to the light took her life away. Thirty years later, Sophie has been in contact with her and seems to materialize when it's dark, but once you turn on the lights, the vanishes. Diana was the only childhood friend of Sophie's and Diana will likely attack if her personal existence feels threatened and will dish out destruction with no mercy or remorse. Although she is a powerful force to be reckoned with, she still has a sensitivity towards light and the only way to avoid her vengeance is to stay out of the shadows.Sophie was once wed to someone who left her several years ago and has two off-springs. She has an adult daughter named Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) who has left her troubled way and has moved into a one bedroom apartment with her boyfriend Bret (Alexander DiPersia) and a preteen son named Martin (Gabriel Bateman) who unfortunately has to face the wrath of his mother's insanity. Everything that Rebecca encountered when she was young, Martin is now facing the the same consequences. When Martin tells Rebecca that Sophie is conversing to a spirit, Rebecca send Martin to move into their place to keep him safe from any possible evil lurking in that house. But then social-services chimes in and disapproves of the idea, so then Rebecca returns back to their home and confront this evil presence that's terrorized her when she was small. Originally based off of Sandberg's short film, the material has successfully been expanded to the 81 minute mark. Though considered short by movie standards, it's actually the contrast that leads to the archaic philosophical statement of ""less means more"" and that saying never comes truer than this movie. It goes straight on with the story and doesn't go back on its delivery and doesn't cut corners in any way possible to expose out all its fear to leave even strong people emotionally scarred. The first scenes are chilling and stays its way throughout and no cliche is padded on, even the flashback of Sophie's childhood memory with Diana has an effective moment where you can feel a bit of sympathy and remorse for both Sophie and Diane. It is also a breath of fresh air to make our leading heroine like Rebecca as a strong, independent character, which happens quite frequently, but Palmer does a serviceable job of indicating what it means to be when dealing with being raised in a broken family. Although a film of this genre and situations has been done to death, ""Lights Out"" is also guarded with a PG-13 banter which means there will be jump-scares a plenty, but the movie is still a cut above the other horror films with its effective use of lighting and the dankness keeps the story alive while you're heart is palpitating while the scenarios succeeds to make things all the more unsettling.",Lights Out
62,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,What the hell?,3,21 July 2016,"Here is another film, similar to this year's earlier, The Forest, where I'm not sure that I can write a review of it, because I'm not entirely sure I watched anything.The movie wasn't scary in the least, to the point where it could have been given a PG-rating, as we wade through a dozen jump scares of this demon chick jumping at the small cast. Is this supposed to be a haunted house flick, or a possession story, or a story about madness and insanity, where the ghostly images are only in the lead character's (the mother's) mind? If the ghost is only after the mother, why does it kill the two other characters in the first scene? Even with a scant 80-minutes-long run time, the film still feels padded and stretched out, despite barely being feature length. It's almost like they took the full story's second act and stretched that out to eighty minutes.The cast did well, as well as anybody could have done with this material, but there is just so little to work with here. I liked the two leads, I thought they worked well together, and they got a few chuckles from me in the opening scenes, but after that, an overwhelming feeling of ""What the hell am I watching?"" entered my mind, and stayed throughout.",Lights Out

I even remember a 3 minute version back in 2013 under the same name, but never knew they were going to make a feature length version until earlier this year which is by far epic!The film is basically about a family who are tormented by a demon who lurks in the darkness & attacks those when there's absence of light, but there's more to the story as the mum knows who this demon is & why her previous 2 husbands (including her first) who died under mysterious circumstances! The film was edge-of-you-seat scary! I knew it was going to be a great horror flick as it was on my Must-Watch List of Horrors this year! The jump scares added to the film's nerve shredding terror & dread! This film also had some pretty creepy & terrifying visuals too! Along with a bit of blood & gore which I was also surprised to see in this film!The story was great & the back story was really good! It really had a good chunk of explanation to the demon & why it targeted them etc, etc. I won't give too much away as you must see this for yourself, it was truly an epic film & just really well put together! The actors were good & believable! I was pleased to see Alicia, the stunt woman who was in The Purge (2013) as the axe wielding purger! That was great too as she was scary in The Purge also!The only slight downer on this film was the ending which I felt was somewhat bitter sweet & could've been executed a bit better than it was, but hey it wasn't a bad ending!I'm also pleased to see that this film is getting a sequel, let's hope that it gets made as this film was bloody great!

64,begob,Tiny wild man,6,9 September 2017,"An estranged daughter rescues her little brother from her mother's home, but once they get to her apartment things start going bump in the night ...Solid horror, with good pace and structure, and the characters are damaged so there's room for them to develop. The use of light is intrinsic to the story and, while it's fairly original, it didn't feel all that stylish. For example, in one of the Insidious films there's a scene where the psychic goes into the otherworld holding a lamp aloft in the suffocating darkness and the effect is gorgeous and spooky - but nothing in this compares. The ghost is menacing, but nothing we haven't already seen in vintage J-horror.The screenplay delivers a literal manifestation of mental illness, and a pointed dilemma at the climax, which for me is much more effective than metaphorical horror like The Babadook. Maybe the story would have benefited from more emphasis on the mother's anguish, instead of clunky exposition on a long gone loony bin. And one good line: There is no you without me.The acting is good, especially the terrified close-ups of the lead actress. Several so-so jump scares. Don't remember much about the music.Overall: Effective, no complaints",Lights Out
65,bkrauser-81-311064,Cliché But it Gets the Job Done,7,19 July 2016,"Lights Out is a horror film based on a video short written and directed by David F. Sandberg. In the film a family is stalked by a ghostly entity seemingly made real and deadly by the deteriorating state of mind of the family's matriarch (Bello). In desperation, the young son, Martin (Bateman) recruits the help of his long absent half-sister in order to simultaneously save their mother from madness and put an end to the specter dubbed Diana.The film is a compendium of clichés all sprouting out of the haunted house genre complete with jump scares and a bad case of BDS (Bad- Decision Syndrome). What makes Lights Out a cut above some of this year's lesser horror flicks is it's ghost or rather the rules in which it functions and operates. Unlike other specters that creep into the dark recesses turning over candles and books, this little nasty can come out and grab you though only under the cover of shadow and darkness.Under such restraints (or excess depending on your disposition) the film succeeds in snatching a few choice scares from its audience. Gabriel Bateman does a commendable job as the scared but sincere pre-teen whose nights have been haunted by her mothers ""friend"". Maria Bello is equally solid performing the thankless, uphill bromide that is the over-broad psychotic who is just barely keeping together. I feel like it's become a sadly common trope to have talented actresses no longer ""in their prime"" make appearances in horror movies as the plucky haunting victim or the brittle waif turned bloodthirsty doppelganger. One need only go back to the recent The Babadook (2014) to see what I mean.Teresa Palmer and Alexander DiPersia fair poorly however as the main protagonist and permanently sidelined boyfriend. DiPersia, while proving at various times to be resourceful as a character, can't help but feel like an out-of-place amateur among actual actors. Palmer has the opposite problem; she can act but the story gives her little to do but change the curvature of her brow from one of fright or one of indignation. We get very little in the story to get us into the character's head space. There's animus between mother and daughter but we never really know why; there's a reluctance to closeness but we never know why; there's an Avenge Sevenfold poster in her apartment, but we never know dear God, why!Yet the million dollar question at the end o the day is, does this film work as a horror film? In other words, does it scare? Yes it does. Sure it's not as intellectually stimulating as The Witch (2015) and sure it's littered with clichés. There are a few indulgences of modern horror that can be irksome: unearned jump scares, a stentorian score and a third act that paints itself in such a corner that it literally writes plot reveals on the wall. Yet Lights Out ultimately works. It slides by on its creativity, its economy and moments that are not just spooky but heart-in-your-chest level scary.",Lights Out
66,elliotjeory,Nice little horror,7,4 November 2018,A great story and well made horror. It's creepy and enjoyable and at less than 90 minutes it's not too long and doesn't drag. It's not a classic horror but it you like the genre You will enjoy it.,Lights Out
67,Abdulxoxo,Pretty good,7,13 February 2021,"The idea of the film is that there is a creature that has some kind of longstanding connection to Rebecca and Martin's mother Sophie. This horrifying entity only becomes visible when there is darkness. If there is light upon it then it suddenly disappears. Undoubtedly the creature is creepy and is actually quite an interesting character. It provides us with a few jump scares and has a fairly intriguing back story. Unfortunately the film (at 81m) was perhaps at least 15-20 mins too short. It left me with unanswered questions about where the entity originally came from and also the background of Sophie, which I'd really liked to have known more about. I think if we did have that extra back story then it would have made for a much clearer movie. Maria Bello obviously being the biggest name in the film lived up to that with a pretty good performance. I just wish there was more of her character and her relationship with the entity. A minor issue is the editing. There were a few other moments where things were jumping randomly from scene to scene. I was also never sure what the movie wanted to be. On the whole, Lights Out had the potential to be pretty scary, and to some extent it was. The original idea was good, unfortunately it was all let down by being a bit too short.",Lights Out
68,blumdeluxe,A Journey into the Paranormal,5,10 August 2017,"""Lights out"" is the story of a young woman, who overthrew with her mother some years ago and now has to save her brother from the ghost that haunts her family in the form of an old friend of her mother who fears the light and only appears in the dark.The production is carried out carefully and you get the standard you can expect from a horror movie with some production value behind it. The movie clearly has its moments and you do feel uneasy when confronted with the happenings but I'm just generally not a huge fan of paranormal horror. In my eyes it would have been even scarier if the plot evolved around a real woman, left in the dark and now so psychically damaged that she holds on to the only friend she ever had for every price. But that's not really the fault of the film, rather personal taste and thus I can't say too much negative about it, apart from some plot details that seem to be rather hard to believe and vague to create a story-line.All in all this is your usual paranormal horror film and what you see is pretty much also what you get. If you are a fan of the genre in general, you'll have your fun with this and even if not you'll have some entertainment. Just don't expect a genre-changer or anything alike.",Lights Out

Rebecca finds out that, Martin experiences the same terrifying occurrences that used to haunt her, when she was a child. She is determined to uncover the truth. Rebecca finds out that, there is an extremely dangerous entity that has a connection to her mother, Sophie(Maria Bello). Lights Out is a brilliant film. I am glad director David F. Sandberg made a feature film, based on his excellent short horror movie of the same name. There are quite a few superbly executed jump scares in the film. This movie is engaging right from the word go. The script by Eric Heisserer is very unique, in this age of horror sequels, spin-offs, reboots & remakes. The last half an hour of the film is its highlight. The climax of the movie, will blow you away. The crisp run-time of the film, ensures that the viewer never gets bored. One flaw in this movie is that, there is no suspense element in it. Performance-wise, everyone has done a good job. Teresa Palmer is outstanding as Rebecca. Gabriel Bateman is spectacular as Martin. Alexander DiPersia is great as Bret. Billy Burke is impressive as Paul. Maria Bello is fantastic as Sophie. The supporting cast is awesome. Lights Out is a must watch for all horror movie buffs.

73,dave-mcclain,"""Lights Out"" features old-school scares and a deceptively simple plot.",8,23 July 2016,"The 2001 horror film ""The Others"" starred Nicole Kidman as the mother of two children who have an unnamed disease characterized by a dangerous hyper-sensitivity to light. The horror flick ""Lights Out"" (PG-13, 1:21) has a similar issue at its core, but takes its story in a very different direction. ""The Others"" is basically a ghost story about a war widow and her children dealing with a mysterious household staff in an isolated mansion in Great Britain during World War II. That film was a combination of a Gothic supernatural horror film and a psychological thriller. ""Lights Out"" is simpler in its approach to horror, appealing to fears that most people have at some point in their lives – or even throughout their lives. Based on his 2013 short film of the same name, David F. Sandberg, in his feature film directorial debut (with a new script by Eric Heisserer) gives us a deceptively simple, surprisingly entertaining shreikfest.The main characters in ""Lights Out"" are haunted by a barely-seen but frightening specter named Diana who can only exist in shadows. Whether Diana is real or imaginary and on what plane she might exist is an open question throughout the movie (and a matter for debate after the closing credits) but she manages to terrify and harm the living regardless. Diana can be seen by the story's characters but their personal relationships to Diana vary widely, and the film gradually reveals her identity and background.Diana ""lives"" in the home of Sophie (Maria Bello), an unstable widowed mother of two, only the younger of which still lives with her. Pre-teen Martin (Gabriel Bateman) is increasingly upset at his mother's odd behaviors – and increasingly frightened by Diana's appearances – to the point that he can't get any rest at home and is falling asleep in class. Martin's older sister Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) has an apartment in town and is more-or-less estranged from her family, but responds to a call from Martin's school nurse.What starts as a struggle for Martin's well-being soon goes much deeper. Rebecca is at first reluctant to get involved (referring to her mother as ""crazy"" and accusing her of being off her medication) but soon takes action to safeguard her brother from whatever is going on at home. With the guidance of a social worker (Andi Osho) from Child Protective Services and Rebecca's kind-of-boyfriend (it's complicated), she's forced to deal with her mother directly – and confront haunting memories from her childhood.Bret (Alexander DiPersia) tries to be supportive, but doesn't understand what's going on. As the situation becomes clearer to all involved, Sophie, Rebecca, Martin and Bret (and anyone else who's unfortunate enough to become involved with this unusually dysfunctional family) find themselves in a fight for survival and a struggle to protect each other from someone/something that they can barely see and who is scarier, faster and more powerful than anything/anyone any of them have dealt with before.Horror movies are most effective when they play upon common fears and ""Lights Out"" does just that. In its plot and overarching themes, it deals with fear of abandonment, fear of mental illness and, especially, fear of the dark. In doing so, the movie doesn't get fancy, but keeps its plot simple and earns its scares the old-fashioned way – by startling us and goosing us out of our seats. Some might call these cheap thrills, but they are thrills nonetheless – and ""Lights Out"" delivers them very effectively. Sandberg employs very little CGI and makes great use of music, sound effects and different lighting situations. The layering of deeper psychological and emotional fears with the even more common occurrences of being spooked by what we cannot see and our discomfort over what might be lurking in the dark makes for a relatable story – and a fun hour and a quarter in front of a screen – with all the other lights out. ""A-""",Lights Out
74,swilliky,"Jump scare, decent story but cliché",6,22 July 2016,"Summer horror is scarce, and James Wan dominates it, producing this jump-scare flick directed by David F. Sandberg. The story strays away from the issue of mental health though it skirts around it, and pushes more towards the gimmick scare of the dark. The issue with a film that relies on darkness is that viewers still have to see it, so the screen can never go pitch black leading to some confusing. Martin (Gabriel Bateman) is a young boy stuck with his mother Sophie (Maria Bello) as she copes with her manic moods. Bateman delivers the best performance as a young actor, he's the smartest character and shares his terror with the audience. The older sister Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) is dragged into the family's traumas and she starts to investigate her mother's strange behavior with the help of her boyfriend Bret (Alexander DiPersia).Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Lights Out
75,bryank-04844,Don't turn the 'Lights Out'!,6,23 January 2017,"So far there have been several good horror movies for the year 2016. Next up on the list is 'Lights Out' from first time feature film director David F. Sandberg. This is one of those movies that was actually a short film that was then made into a feature film, which is always fun to see the differences. 'Lights Out' conjures up some decent scares and even made me sleep with the light on.The ghost/creature in the film is haunting and should cause you to think twice when you walk down the dark hallway, however, the film just relies on one single genre trope throughout the whole film, which is walking slowly in dark rooms, inspecting the surroundings only to have a hand or something jump out and scare you. It's effective, but gets old fairly fast. Still, for this first time filmmaker, he uses his camera well to notch up the suspense and tension throughout with the use of lighting or lack thereof, and keeping the shots tight and quick.The film centers on a dysfunctional family where a recently widowed mother named Sophie (Maria Bello) is starting to lose her mind again and manifests an evil spirit named Diana, who can only be seen in the dark. Sophie's kids try to talk some sense into her, but nothing seems to work out and things just spiral downwards quickly as the movie goes on. There is a decent backstory to everything, but the best moments of this story are never followed through on. Instead, it's just replaced with more scenes of opening creaky doors in the dark and walking slowly through hallways looking for Diana.I wish the filmmakers explored more of the backstory and had more than just one trick up their sleeve here, because that would have made this horror film one of the best in recent memory. Unfortunately, that's not the case here. Don't get me wrong, there are a bunch of good moments throughout the film, as well as some smart characters, and decent scares that you'll think of later while in the dark, but it never crosses over that horror hump into something memorable.WORTH A LOOK!",Lights Out

82,johannes2000-1,Good solid horror with a very creepy creature.,8,3 July 2017,"I liked it. It's not very original of course, we've seen it all before like a million times (evil creature haunting a disturbed family) and the explanation of the why and how of this creature is way too elaborate and far-fetched for my taste (the painting of such background-information always takes lots of screen-time with the risk of the tension sagging-in), but this having said, this movie sure makes great and very effective use of the clichés. For one, the acting by the female lead Teresa Palmer and by little Gabriel Bateman is great. The latter deserves special mention, he is not just cute but totally convincing as the terrified yet firm and in-spite-of-himself brave son and little brother. Two: the CGI of the creature is very well done. The concept of seeing only its extremely creepy silhouette in the dark and nothing when the lights are on, but when the lights are turned off again it turns out to have leapt several yards forward gives a hair-raising effect. The final showdown is fast paced and exciting and the solution as to how the creature is destroyed is quite harsh and unexpected. I also liked the ending after all the turmoils of the showdown, at last a horror-movie without the usual ultimate 5 seconds shock-image to proof that the monster is not dead after-all or that there's another one or a whole nest, suggesting that the the horror will continue for ever and ever. Here the survivors are allowed to just cuddle up into each-others arms and heave a well-deserved sigh of relieve. Oh, and watch the closing credits roll by for a change, they're beautiful and very ingeniously designed, totally in style with the movie.",Lights Out
83,dilipbts,Lights out,8,10 June 2020,"It wasn't until I checked the credits that I realized this was based off of the short film by David F. Sandberg. I knew the lights off/lights on shadow figure thing seemed familiar. While I really loved the short film, I don't necessarily agree that it needed the full length treatment. I feel like we see this a lot - capitalize off some popular internet thing that, when extended, loses some of what made it special in the first place. The short film was unsettling and creepy as it was; giving it a back story and more detail made it feel cheapened. I'm not a huge fan of ""BOO!"" gotcha horror movies, though; I come from a generation that was raised on the original Halloween and, for me, that is the apex of subtle, creepy, slow burn etc - everything that makes one get enveloped in a movie. When there are two many jump-atchas, it is jarring and does not make for high replay value (for me, anyway). I thought the mental asylum backstory was so played out; I feel like maybe that trope should be burned alive. We get it. Although that's kind of how I also feel about kids being creepy (or ""troubled""), too. There's just so little variation in horror these days. Not all bad, though - I feel like the choice of Teresa Palmer as Maria Bello (Sophie)'s character's daughter was a fantastic choice.

The writing is pretty poor--the ""ghost"" is explained in several talky scenes in a row--making for a dull section of it right when it should take off. One scene involving a recorded audio flashback is unintentionally funny.The whole idea of a ghost that can exist only in the dark you'd think would lead to unexpected scenes or the lights going out or the ghost finding ways to put the humans in the dark, as in DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK--for instance. But instead these scenes just randomly happen and, in a real horror movie cliché, characters are constantly wandering off on their own to put themselves in trouble and then not much real trouble ensues anyway. Once you've seen one such scene in this movie you've pretty much seen all the rest of them, and there are a number of them. None of it builds in pace of suspense of horror.Sure it could have fallen in for a cliché ending, but they fall into too many traps from other films and it's not well enough directed or acted to overcome predictable stumbling around in the dark sequences--of which there are many more of then there are scary pay offs. No one scene in this film is as good as the cheap short from which it was expanded.It's relatively bloodless on all levels. If you think this is a great horror movie you really need to spend some time tracking down the truly great ones, cause this ain't in any of those league.",Lights Out
86,nitzanhavoc,"Original take on fear of the dark, and some fine acting. That's it.",6,14 October 2016,"When it comes to Horror, I enjoy sub-genres dealing with ghosts, haunting and such supernatural beings the most. It makes my inner child tremble in fear, and that's just the feeling I look for in a scary film. So obviously, I simply had to try Lights Out, both because of James Wan (only a producer here, but still his touch can add magic to any and every Horror story) and because of the theme (monsters in the dark? Good night, inner child, enjoy wetting the bed!)The best feature of the film is presented right at the start (it also appeared in trailers, so if you haven't watched any because you'd rather approach the film without any prior knowledge - stop reading now). Something evil lurks in the dark. The lights go on - it disappears; the lights go out - it reappears with a vengeance. A very original take on ""monsters in the dark"", presented beautifully. Not to mention the creature itself has been designed with all the makings of a horrific nightmare.Unfortunately - this concludes the part discussing the film's strengths. Don't get me wrong, the story is nice and the characters are relateable and authentic, but the overall film is mediocre at best, lacking a a proper plot twist, and ending anticlimactically. Also, the acting is quite impressive, especially from Maria Bello as Sophie (that's the way to play a manic neurotic single parent!) and young Gabriel Bateman as Martin (too many children in Horror films are far too courageous, intelligent and perceptive to be convincing. Bateman shows us how a terrified, confused and distressed child behaves in the real world, and does so as professionally as they come!)In summary, the lovely antagonist and the fine acting compensate for the lack of anything special, and the viewing experience is fun and terrifying at times (though mostly on account of jump scares). I can't in good conscience rate it over 6, but it's important to understand that it doesn't mean you should refrain from watching it. I always advise people to be judge things themselves and never rely on others' opinions, and that's especially true for Lights Out. Most chances are you'll enjoy a lot more than I did, and as mentioned before - I'd enjoyed quite a bit.",Lights Out

Cram in information through dialogue (TELL) rather than SHOWING us.Sometimes you don't need to give us that much exposition.

The mom doesn't want this to happen but she just stands there helpless and et's her ""daughter"" take her son away. Not even an attempt to resist. Nothing.

92,Mike_Devine,Doesn't make the dark seem any scarier,5,15 October 2017,"After a long stretch of misfires, the supernatural horror/thriller genre finally struck gold in the mid 2010s thanks to a few well-received low-budget films. 2016's 'Lights Out' fits this mold, as the $4.5M costing fright-fest spooked up $60M+ in the US and found a pretty big audience worldwide.At its core, 'Lights' explores one of man's oldest fears - the dark, and what may or may not lurk in it. We follow the lives of a young boy named Martin (Gabriel Bateman) and his older sister Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) as they try to support their troubled mother, Sophie (Maria Bello), who is mentally ill. But it's the focus on a spirit named ""Diana"" that ratchets up the creep factor, as it attaches itself to Sophie and makes everyone's lives a living hell. While this premise sets up 'Lights' to be at the level of classics like the 'Paranormal Activity' series or 'The Blair Witch Project,' it falls face-first in execution with a bark much worse than its bite.For one, the special effects/CGI look plain bad. ""Diana"" comes off looking like a silhouette of the Predator (like, the Arnold Schwarzenegger one) albeit one that is much smaller and less threatening. Also not helping matters is Rebecca's dimwit boyfriend Bret (Alexander DiPersia), as he seems to dumb down every scene he's in. There are only a few scenes that could be considered traditionally ""scary,"" but even those are ruined by bad acting or poor camera-work. Perhaps the only real highlight in 'Lights' is Bello, as she is believable in her role and comes off as being pretty sympathetic, all things considered. Perhaps if James Wan had been at the helm of this, things would have been a little different (and by ""different"" I mean ""better"").If you're expecting some sort of super scary experience, you'll be disappointed by 'Lights Out.' But if you're just looking for cheap thrills, no harm done.",Lights Out
93,James_De_Bello,7.5/10,7,7 August 2016,"""Light's Out"" tells the story of a family coping with their mother's mental problems and a creature that might be responsible for them. When Martin (Gabriel Bateman) starts experiencing fear out of his mother behavior he calls for help from his sister (Teresa Palmer) who has to step up for her family with her little brother and fight the demons of both past and present.This is one of the best horror films to be released in recent years, it is horror done correctly, it is a film that treats audiences with respect and scares them deeply with unsettling and intelligent imagery, whilst maintaining a high sense of narrative drive and dramatic pathos that ultimately overpower what are the film's minor flaws.What struck me deeply about ""Light's Out"" is its thematic core. There seems to be a resurgence of motherly fear as a theme in horror movies recently after ""The Babdook"" brought it back so brilliantly and for now it has worked very well with interesting and original insights in all the movies I've seen touching the subject, this one being one of the very best, with Maria Bello bringing to life some harrowing moments of despair for a mother's call for love from her siblings.But even more than motherly fear, this film is about depression and might I add how genius it treats the theme. The symbolism and metaphoric nature of many elements of the film might be even too explicit, but they never are heavy handed or dull. The filmmakers craft a narrative with deep implications in the theme and what comes out of it is a film that touches the viewer deeply not because of the scares, but because of how truly you feel devastated by what the characters have to go through. It is a deep study of depression and mental illness, it is a fantastic look at how people cope with such things in family and society, but most importantly is is a surprising and brave take on the subject matter, which takes twists and turns without ever loosing you and always maintaining a thematic undercurrent that is riveting and worthy of much reflection.Naturally this is also made possible by the very good characterizations the film has, none resulting banal and someone resulting even surprisingly good: Bret played by Alexander DiPersia isn't your classic dumb boyfriend character, he is injected with an honesty and rawness that isn't unfortunately found too much in horror films which makes it even more pleasant when seen unfolded on the screen. Moreover, all of these people aren't dumb and act like real human beings in the face of such a tragedy. Palmer and Bateman play off each other very well and result really genuine as a brother and sister trying to reconnect.The film could be accused of having a little bit too much to do with jump scares, but one that gives it this critique should first understand how jump scares work and how they can be inserted into a film. David F. Sandberg clearly knows this and he uses the scares not as a gimmick, yet as an intelligent tool to build suspense, scare the characters and so the audience and get under your skin.Where this film has flaws is in its mythology, whilst a lot of it is saved by the thematic undercurrent that explains it, a lot more is simply out of place and the creature haunting the family doesn't end up having any kind of coherent way of being and whilst it remains scary for its psychological effect, the film did cheat the audience multiple times and didn't get away with it.Overall this is a very scary film that had already left deep seeds in my brain, if you want to see a true horror movie I strongly suggest this one over the very underwhelming ""Conjuring"" franchise.",Lights Out

But there are instants herein that stop it from reaching petrifying levels of a great riveting horror flick. It doesn't retain the flair of a slow paced scare. However, within its nimble charisma lies its true heart throbbing dread.PLOT OF LIGHTS OUT The video project of the same name that had gone viral three years ago, has been finally moulded into an artistic piece. Augmenting it further is a thrilling story to tell an imaginative tale that walks on a thin edge of palpability. Still the magic works! After making a series of shorts, David F. Sandberg finally gets a fully-fledged project under the aegis of James Wan. What's reassuring is that he delivers too. He includes Lotta Losten to the tale giving her a cameo of sorts, trying to revive the lost lights out video and then furthers the tale with new elements.DIRECTION OF LIGHTS OUT MOVIE David F. Sandberg's inexperience transpires at a lot of junctions, wherein you could point, ""He didn't think this through!"" It is like you can almost taste the lack of percipience in his work. There is passion in his job alright, the love for horror so loud and clear, that you can find it lurking at weird corners. But there is always a sense of thoughtful trepidation missing from his cinema that seemed to have primped down his work into a mere 1 hour 21 minute affair.You can feel as if he was on a constant canter to reach the end. Maybe the short in him will take some time to wear off. Even though his direction barely reached the levels of horror veterans, he still manages to weave out something above mediocrity, and that is what counts.CHARACTERS AND SPOILERS IN THE DARK AHEAD Sandberg's entry into the horror world receives three cheers from people all across the globe, owing to his unpredictability. He breaks horror clichés in many ways.The first coming straight from a character like Bret. Alexander DiPersia who plays boyfriend to Rebecca, cannot be simply ignored. Breaking banality profusely the character fits like a rare gem in the movie. He isn't a hero exactly, and yet he survives Diana's attack on three occasions with sheer presence of mind. We generally tend to think boyfriends die first, because they are not important to the tale, but Sandberg decides to break the chains of platitude by keeping Bret alive and breathing.The second most important character is that of Rebecca played by Teresa Palmer. She has this constant confident mien that she wears like a pro at odd hours. The only problem is that she condescends and patronizes Bret beyond limit, so much that you begin to wonder why Bret's with her in the first place. Yet she packs in an uncommon poise that seems to fill you up with pluck too.Martin, played by Gabriel Bateman, her brother isn't a wuss either. He is scared, terrified, but he always comes around. He has peerless tricks in his pockets that he comes up with to stay safe.Billy Burke has a small cameo too in the prologue of Lights Out Movie.SHORTCOMINGS Apart from the directorial issues Lights Out had, there were other things that don't go ignored either. Screenplay of the movie was terrible. At one point Martin drops a truism as if it was jostled out with originality. It seemed kind of stupid and forced needless to say.When Rebecca is engaged in a face-off with Diana, she asks Bret to take Martin away. But when there's a gunshot you see Bret still holding onto Martin unperturbed by what's going on in the house. There was a gunshot for crying out loud. Why didn't he come up with dozens of searchlights, or even better if he was short on time, light up the car lights and point it towards the house so there was at least some light that could save the inmates.Another question that miffs you is how come Diana plays with lights sometimes moulding them to her will, and then sometimes forgets to switch them off. The constant disconnect in the plot like that makes Lights Out like a sieve of implausibility.Also, you cannot completely overlook the fact that despite knowing that Diana is in the house, characters give in to sleeping in the house with Sophie. They were all so unprepared even though they knew the truth. That was a tad too much.THE FINAL VERDICT Darkness has forever intrigued us. There is something about its still aura that has us questioning us our sanity. A topic that will forever haunt us, just by its sheer fancy. David F. Sandberg milks the fact enough. I am afraid, not properly but he still manages to fabricate us a good horror flick.If we don't look in the direction of the downside-darkness of the Lights Out movie we still have something that is way above thousands of pointless horror movies. To that we nod him welcome.A must-watch horror fans.Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com",Lights Out
95,coreyjdenford,Keep the lights on,8,19 August 2016,"This is my review of Lights Out (spoiler free)4* Cast: Teresa Palmer, Gabriel Bateman, Maria Bello, Alexander DiPersiaPlot: Rebecca (Palmer) a woman who left her home because of sick mother is stalked by a dark entity so she tries to save the day and her mother Sophie (Bello); however things aren't what they seem as this being only appears with the lights off. As she tries to discover what this being is her family is in constant danger but what will she do? Will she save the day or run out again?Everyone's done it. Every director has done a horror which will make you scream then turn the lamp on with fear of something appearing in the shadows. Essentially that's what this horror is inspired by, David F. Sandberg's, feature length horror started its life as a viral Youtube short which had the same type of creature and the same terrifying aspect, so it's easy to say this is based on a short. The initial idea of this film is Lights out ghost appears, lights on its gone but it's done on such on such a gigantic scale much like the Babadook that is a little of the same as what this is, a terrifying creature from God knows nowhere and terrorizes a family just trying to get on with life. However this movie not only has a pretty good story to it but also delivers a plethora of scares for 80 memorable minutes. It's impressive that an original horror this short can be done so well. There is a lot that can be said for the shadow-dwelling creature calling itself Diana a lurking silhouette with glowing white eyes and Nosferatu claws with a punishing back-story to justify the malevolence.Although influenced by J-horror and the slow-creep style of producer Australian horror maestro James Wan, Lights Out could be this years Babadook: there's a memorable monster, peek-a-boo scares, but, crucially, a spiky emotional turmoil that feeds the fear. However Sandberg's human touch also shows with the characters, they are flawed but they are lovable Teresa Palmer plays Rebecca a woman who abandoned her family home after her mother Sophie, (Bello) went crazy, that had a huge effect on Rebecca. The movie conveniently is very blasé when it comes to its theme it promotes mental illness and it shows that when you see something lurking around in the shadows you would go crazy. Not only does Sophie go crazy but the rest of her family are borderline insane, even Rebecca's, brother who spends his time with Sophie so he sees the terrifying that resides in their home with them. But this dysfunctional family copes with their problems however Diana makes them worse. Another good thing that this film adopts is that the story never falls flat as the story goes and it will never fail to scare either. David Sandberg's debut feature is deeply impressive and delivers full blooded frights without even a pipette of gore. So this is a horror not for gore goers, not necessarily a bad thing because frights are the full blown mechanic of this directorial debut. Relying deeply on practical FX and ominous lighting design, Sandberg has a fiendish gift for ambushing audiences with jump scares out of the whazoo (there are at least nine jolts within the first 40 minutes) – as she stripes from dark to light, Diana's attacks are like being subjected to a slow-motion strobe. All of his characters are battling internal demons but they're too: the fact you're rooting for them rather than cheering on the malevolent Diana makes the ordeal cut all the harder. But a good horror that will damage you internally you don't need hollow jump scares it also needs a terrifying demon and that is exactly what this fear-of-the-dark horror has done, it's added a creepy new demon that could be added to the ongoing list of horror demons that have scared audiences in the past. Granted, some of the dread leaks out when things get silly in a frantic third act, when those jolts turn into full blown frights guaranteed to scare the living daylights out of you. And it does begin to turn a little bit predictable but also not a bad thing, besides the frantic third is nothing compared to the ending which is a little weird but you go with it because it has a sense that the ghost is just in Sophie's, head so she does something to shock you but it all adds to this well made horror that could even be counted as one the best ever horrors, and also one of the best films this year. In conclusion this terrifying horror will give you all your money's worth and then some you may even want to keep the light on when you sleep, because it will probably make you scared of the dark again. Definitely worth a watch. VERDICT: A lean, mean scare-machine, and a surprise contender for horror of the year. A memorable monster and a plethora of scares what's not to like about Lights out, but if something does appear in the shadows then, for God's sake, buy a bedside lamp.8/10 One of the best ever horrors.",Lights Out
96,eagandersongil,More of the same,5,3 September 2016,"A film that brings more of the same, with virtually all the clichés of middling horror movies that take over the cinema lately, ""Lights Out"" does not stand out, the concept is different, but it is not new, the soundtrack (essence a horror film) is weak, all reasonable performances, the script is linear, tries to deepen but do not know how, and the film tries to scare all the time, but can not, and in some scenes starts laughing viewer to about shooting and narrative elements are reasonable, do not get to be bad not. If you are a cliché horror lover, go see this movie, otherwise pass away from the cinema.It's another cliché that will fill theaters, but it has nothing to add.",Lights Out
97,akshatmahajan,Loved it,8,19 October 2020,"Lights Out was great. I started watching movie with least expectations (mainly after seeing mixed reviews) but it was much more than my expectations. I totally enjoyed it.This movie will get your pulse up fast, revealing the ""horror"" very early on. Interestingly enough, it keeps that pulse up throughout the movie despite of this. The concept of something that can only appear and be seen if it's dark is bound to lead to a jump scare whenever it appears. Towards the end you've almost gotten so used to it that the scare effect wears off a bit, and is one of two reason I don't rank this a 10. But thanks to a good story and good actors, the movie still holds its ground to the very end.The characters are really good, well written and performed. The plot has some weight and emotion to it, and with a solid ending that wraps things up in a much more satisfying way.All in all you get everything you want from a jump scare movie with Lights Out, with a good plot and good actors that deliver, and a scare factor we all can relate to.",Lights Out
98,Ramascreen,This film is a joke,2,2 July 2016,"I think any horror fan who thinks LIGHTS OUT is a great horror movie, should have their fandom questioned. This is one of those movies that's just so bad, in every aspect, you end up laughing the entire time, hell you might watch it again because it's funny, you treat it like a comedy now.I think the only thing that LIGHTS OUT has going for it is that it's produced by James Wan. Wan has become a big brand name in horror, and rightfully so, I think he's a skilled storyteller, and so his name is what the producers and filmmaker hope would drive audiences to see LIGHTS OUT and they're going to use Wan on every poster and trailer, they're going to market his name, but if you think that the film going to be close to being as decent as anything Wan has actually made, you might want to lower your expectations.LIGHTS OUT marks the feature film directorial debut of David F. Sandberg, who directed the film from a screenplay by Eric Heisserer (""Final Destination 5""), based on Sandberg's own short film. Teresa Palmer plays Rebecca who left home and her childhood behind, but now her little brother, Martin, is experiencing the same thing she went through as a child which are unexplained terrifying events that seem to happen whenever the lights go out. Turns out, a mysterious entity has been attaching herself to their mother all those years, but as Rebecca gets closer to unlocking the truth, the more resistant and dangerous this entity becomes.It has an interesting core concept, I give them that, the concept that the demon can only attack you in the dark; that any type of light (doesn't have to be UV, this is not a vampire story) would scare her and ultimately harm her. So yes the concept is interesting but perhaps Sandberg should've left it alone as a short film. LIGHTS OUT is just so poorly executed, and it insults our intelligence, not to mention how the demon originated, old photos of her when she was a little girl, the way she looks, the way the backstory is told, it just doesn't get more generic than that, the whole thing feels like a parody or as if you're watching another installment of that ""Scary Movie"" franchise. Let's just put it this way, if you're easily scared and you enjoy watching low-rate dreadful films like ""The Grudge"" and ""The Eye,"" then you wouldn't mind LIGHTS OUT.-- Rama's Screen --",Lights Out
99,gavinp9,Well-made horror fun,7,2 January 2018,"'Lights Out' is a semi-conventional haunted house film, with one person being haunted, but the rest of the family able to see the spirit/demon/ghost/whatever, rather than one of those movies where it's only visible to the kid. Good start, with the shadowy apparition offing Paul (Burke), who is Rebecca (Palmer)'s step-dad, Martin (Bateman)'s dad, and Sophie (Bello)'s husband. Turns out the thing can't appear or been seen in the light and lurks in the shadows...The film does a good job of introducing the characters, including Rebecca's boyfriend Brett (DiPersia), but also doesn't let too long go without any scares or tension. The beauty of the evil being in the shadows means that you're always looking behind characters or in the corners of every shot! The backstory of how Diana was Sophie's childhood friend emerges and goes some (but certainly not all) of the way to explaining the haunting.There's a decent body count, scares, tension and shocks throughout, a good score, and it doesn't overstay it's welcome. The ending is good and logical. All the actors, including the kid, are above average. One of the better horror films I've seen in a while - scary, without being too stupid or gory.",Lights Out
100,fil-nik09,Not bad,7,31 August 2016,"I saw the billboard for this movie in Paris metros...The title is Dans Le Noir ( In the Dark) in French and they mentioned some of other horror movies I have loved beside the title, so I was impatient to see it. After 2 weeks of waiting I gave up and watched a cam version. I did not understand or hear 30% of what they were talking, but I got the whole picture.The film is not bad. But it is not brilliant either. For me, it was not really scary and somehow the 'evil shadow' was kinda familiar. I mean, I know that there can not be many variations when it comes to evil things/people in horror films, but ... I do liked the background of the evil creature but I believe it should have been much more exploited. The film is very short so they could have add several minutes of that story somewhere. I think it would be more exciting.The actors were good. The film is entertaining. Maybe if I watched better version, my opinion would have been better. All in all, seven from me.",Lights Out
101,jackmeat,A quality reason to keep the lights on,7,8 October 2016,"My quick rating - 6,8/10. Behold the fear of the dark. Many people have it and will identify with that. I assume not so many have had to deal with this level of the phobia. The setup is introduced quickly so me telling you a spirit that only appears in the dark and vanishes in the light is no spoiler. Just that this particular ghost kills anyone that threatens her. With that being said, the stage is set to scare the crap out of the viewer at any given moment making an 81 minute movie fly by. The director (if you saw the short film on ""The Fear"" TV show from England) took his 5 minute idea and blew it up into a full length scarefest. To take that simple idea and incorporate the actual anxiety of psychological issues people have into horror was done quite well. Kinda reminded me of ""The Babbadook"" in that aspect. The eerie looking ghost of ""Diana"" was creepy looking throughout even in the dark. The lighting, of course, is critical in this movie. Each flicker of light, or dark space is a key part of the film and if it wasn't done properly, would ruin scene after scene. The good news is this did not happen. Every bit of attention was given to this detail as good directors will do. Such was the case with ""Crawl or Die"" and countless other well crafted films like this one. Suggesting to turn off the lights and watch this next to your loved one goes without saying but I would shoe the kids out of the room unless you want to be awoken when they have nightmares. A very good film with a powerful ending that may leave you a bit surprised. Enjoy",Lights Out
102,kermitkid,Recommended for Whovians,10,18 September 2016,"This movie is crazy! From the first minute there are scared and action that doesn't slow down until the credits roll. The great thing about this movie is everyone can relate to it. We've all had (or still have) a fear of the dark. It takes the psychological element of that and plays with it terrifically. Not only are the characters toyed with, but the audience is as well. You can tell the director had tons of fun with this. Being a ""Doctor Who"" fan, the ghost in the movie to me felt like a combination of Weeping Angels, Vashta Nerada, and the Silence. The movie is more psychological horror than straight horror. I could never tell what was coming next. And there isn't a single character in the movie I hated. I cared what happened to every character and was t rooting for specific ones to be picked off. This movie is an intense thrill ride from beginning to end and I highly recommend it. Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars",Lights Out
103,Rendanlovell,"Poorly executed, gimmicky horror movie.",3,25 July 2016,"016 seems like the year of gimmicky horror movies. We had 'Hush' where the main character was completely deaf. Than this one, where the antagonist can only move in the darkness. And later this year we'll get 'Don't Breathe'. Which has the villain be completely blind. I'm not calling out the concepts of these movies because I think these ideas are pretty cool. But so far both 'Hush' and this film were very poorly executed movies. But lets talk about this movie. It follows one family that seems to be haunted. A women that lurks in the shadows is antagonizing this family but, again, only the shadows. She can't go into the light for some reason.The film tries to explain her behaviors in a way that would make sense and not be overly confusing yet it ends up being just the opposite. It's an easy concept to get behind for sure. A lady that can't movie in light. Okay, that makes sense. But then the movie breaks those rules. Over and over again.There's a scene where we hear a knock at a door and when it's answered, of course, there's no one there. But the hallway was totally lit, so how did she do that? Than in less than ten seconds we hear scratching in the closet inside our main characters apartment. But the apartment was completely lit, so how did she get there?How was she able to get all the way through the well lit apartment and into the closet? We see that she is basically omnipotent and can manipulate her surrounds to her will. So why didn't she just turn the lights in the apartment off and then go into the closet? After seeing the film it still doesn't make any sense as to why she is there in the first place, but this would at least play along with the rules set up by the universe.I mean there's literally a scene where she shuts the lights in an entire house off all at once. I wouldn't be focusing on this so hard if it weren't a major factor in the movie, but it is. Aside from this overly confusing and needlessly convoluted monster there is virtually nothing else in the movie. We learn a little about this families back story through a few mindless exposition scenes but thats not character development.The only thing we know about our main character is that she is a metal head and has a boyfriend. And she's our main character. If the person taking up nearly all the run time is this two dimensional and uninspired how can the side characters get any decent treatment? But the real shining moments of this movie are in the third act. When the crap hits the fan.That is where we realize that the films gimmick is not actually scary at all, it's hilarious. Not only does it makes no sense but the villains back story and motive is completely ludicrous. No spoilers but I guess the way she became the way she is, is by her exploding or something and being really really clingy. That's pretty much it for our central antagonist. Considering the short that this film was based on and that the same director did both, this should have been far better. The short was unique, original, and pretty effective for only being three minutes long. Aside from the gimmick, this movie is so sub standard and cliché that it was impossible to get invested in. Not one single moment landed for me at all. Not one single jump scare in this jump scare heavy movie landed for me at all.It may have a couple great performances and a few cool moments, but this is one of the most tired horror movies to release this year. It's overly cliché, two dimensional, totally incomprehensible, and uninvolving. If you want to see a good horror flick just forget about seeing this movie. Rewatch 'The Shining' for the hundredth time, just steer clear of this pile of garbage.",Lights Out

105,eshwarmail,"By leveraging the best from all its departments, Lights Out delivers a simple yet entertaining horror movie full of thrills",7,1 January 2017,"There is no doubt the horror movies have improved for the best in recent times at least for the quality of their thrills. Lights Out fall in this category where the premise is of the simplest nature with no complexity whatsoever and also doesn't have a big revelation to look forward to. The strengths and limitations of the antagonist are clearly defined right from the start and hints on how it is going to end were given away miles ahead in the journey. Having all these going against it, Lights Out still delivers a successful horror movie primarily because of its well conceived and executed thrills. Sophie (Maria Bello) is a twice widowed mother of an estranged daughter Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) and Martin (Gabriel Bateman) and lost both her husbands in a violent and mysterious ways. When Martin starts to see a horrific figure Diana in their house frightening him to sleepless nights, he confides in this to his sister who had similar experiences in the past. Rebecca with the help of her prospective boyfriend Bret (Alexander DiPersia) uncovers some disturbing truth and about this supernatural entity and comes up with a plan to destroy it forever.Best part about this movie is its no nonsense approach about not having any characters or subplots that aren't necessary to the central plot, no manipulative baiters for hooking audience for that big revelation in the climax. Its all linear, simple and the money is right on the objective - scare the hell out of its viewers which it succeeds quite well. The supernatural entity screen time is minimal and mostly shadowy owing to script requirement which complements the thrill factor too. It is also apt to commend some good performances by the actors donning the central characters who doesn't go overboard to keep the premise as realistic as possible. Though it doesn't come anywhere close to being a classic of sorts in this genre, a good combination of direction, production values, acting, screenplay and runtime (editing) keeps this movie afloat in an overcrowded genre. By leveraging the best from all its departments, Lights Out delivers a simple yet entertaining horror movie full of thrills.",Lights Out
106,shobanchittuprolu,Lights Out has brilliant jump scares and thrills throughout but they became repetitive at the end.,7,11 December 2016,"Lights Out (2016): David F Sandberg have huge fan following with his several 3 minute short horror films which are more scarier than most of the full length feature films.Lights Out is one of his most viral 2 and half minute which was my favorite of all.When James Wan and David announced a full length feature film based on it,I was excited and even had a doubt about its perfect adaptation.So how is Lights Out?Plot: A man (Billy Bruke) working after hours is murdered by a supernatural entity in the shadow. When his son, the boy Martin (Gabriel Bateman), is frightened by the same creature, he sees his mother Sophie (Maria Bello) talking to an imaginary friend called Diana in the shadow of her room. Martin does not sleep anymore during the night. His older step sister Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) who lives alone is summoned by the social assistant. She brings Martin home and recalls her own experience with Diana years ago when she was young. Rebecca and her boyfriend Bret (Alexander DiPersia) investigate the connection of Sophie with Diana and come up to a scary revelation about their past. Who is Diana?What is her link with mysterious shadow??Plus Points:1)Scary Scenes: This movie has brilliant jump scares which are one of the best in this year after The Conjuring 2.From the first scene in this movie,we get genuine scares because of sudden apparitions mysterious shadow with gleaming eyes.David F Sandberg successfully brought great chills even in this adaptation.2)Screenplay and Direction: Lights Out is engaging at best with frequent scares and mystery solving.Even though the story seems regular still it had a great thrill and emotional connection to the premise.Diana's story is creepy.David F Sandberg's direction is brilliant for his debut feature.3)Music: Lights Out has typical James Wan style background score and it always sounds creepy.It perfectly added more chills to the scares.4)Performances: Teresa Palmer is beautiful and gave terrific performance.Others gave decent performances.5)Duration: Movie is just 1hr 25min.No lag any scenes.Minus Points:1)Repetitive scares in Climax: Lights Out is scary until its climax because all those scares became repetitive at the end which does not scare much.Even the plot do not have any surprises which leaves us unsatisfied at the end.So,Lights Out has brilliant jump scares and thrills throughout but they became repetitive at the end.My rating 7.25/10",Lights Out

109,SyoKennex,"Turn the Lights Out, settle back, grab some popcorn, and be prepared to be terrified of shadows for a while.",8,25 March 2017,"There are those horror films that only pop up once in a while; the ones that are genuinely scary, have strong characters, have a good plot and premises, and actually leave you with a buzz. Lights Out is definitely one of these films.Lights Out is based off of a short film, made by David Sandberg and released in 2013. It went viral on YouTube, and was quickly given a large amount of publicity worldwide. It rakes in views, and Sandberg decided to do a feature length film on the same premises. The story of both is a shadowy figure that cannot be seen in light, haunting the main character. This is extended in the feature length film to become a source of malevolent terror, ruining the life of the main family we see, and breaking down the links between a family to get it's own way.There are very strong characters in this film, and it was absolutely wonderful to see. Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) plays a character that we see as weak at the start of the film. She ran away when things got hard and doesn't look back, not because it hurts to, but because she does not want to. She refuses to. Over the course of the film, we get the pleasure of seeing her adapt and become stronger and stronger. We see her develop as a character and she becomes relatable. Someone who wants to protect her little brother, and be there for him as danger becomes more apparent in his home. The young actor Gabriel Bateman, who plays Michael, did an absolutely stunning job within Lights Out. Never before have I been so taken back by a child actor, and Bateman comes only second to Asa Butterfield in The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. Bateman's acting was breathtaking. At every moment, my parental instincts flared up as he acted out his character's terror. The use of the camera when creating this was shabby at the start. It was hard to focus properly as the camera twisted and turned in the first few scenes, but this levelled out eventually. The tonal range of the camera in this film is not that bright. It's between light and dark, brightness and shadows. It represents well what the film is about and is a wonderful touch to see on the screen.There wasn't much of a soundtrack in this film, and it played it well. The most sound that was used was the background noise of horror, such as the shadow figure scratching away and the sounds it makes when it stands up. The dramatic beats of tones to make the audience jump when something happened was well administered to the film, and the bold decision to make this a film without a solid soundtrack really paid off. Overall, this was a stunning film that has left me with a slight fear of the shadows around my dark bedroom. Lights Off? I'll be sleeping with the lights on for a few days.",Lights Out
110,FallenEye,"Needed a Light Switch, in Story.",5,24 March 2018,"Being bloated is never a good thing, however, also being too short while not really delivering the full story, and/or the full story in a compelling way, is also not a good thing. Lights Out lost me with its weak story development, its pacing as well as its short running time.Nobody ever explains the full situation to Bret. Diana's story comes to light in a very dim fashion. Rebecca is busy calling here mother a ""nutjob"", while she knows exactly what she is going through, and what makes it especially worse, is how that was shown literally in the scene before that comment. Sure, perhaps she is in denial, however the film doesn't portray that very well about her. All she seems like is distant, walls up, closed in and impersonal.Also, Martin knew at his age that Diana was the cause of his father's death, yet Rebecca spent all her life, under the impression that her father just ran out on them, when she went through the very same ordeal Martin did. Okay sure, maybe she didn't click for whatever reason, but for her to inform her mother, as if she didn't know either, just raises some concerns.The movie cutting to post Paul's death without some kind of reference or anchor, was jarring. For a short while you find yourself asking, how long has he been dead? It feels like its been a day, but the film gives the impression that it has been much longer, maybe even years, but is it? Can it?Then there's Rebecca still opting to stay in the house, to try and save her mother, when she already knows that Diana cannot harm her, which renders the entire endeavour moot.Lights Out has issues, that aren't necessarily plot holes, but rather more disregarded and dismissed expositions, and at 1 hour 15 minutes, I guess something was always going to suffer.From there, as gorgeous as Teresa Palmer is, and my oh my she is a stunner, her performance in this film was subpar, while everybody else was somewhat forgettable.

113,rlaine,"Has potential and is quite good, but not a classic nor ""re-birth of horror""",7,5 June 2017,"The current 6,4 is a great score for a horror movie. I went into it thinking it would indeed be ""re- birth of horror genre"" as some of the other reviews say. Well, I wouldn't go quite that far, but it was rather good.This movie relies on the lights off / lights on, now you see it / now you don't trick where a figure appears when you turn off the lights, but disappears when you turn them on. It's an effective trick and actually very simple to do, which makes one wonder how it wasn't invented earlier. You could've done it as soon as they could cut film stock. Maybe they did, but lately it's been quite fashionable in horror movies.We have Diana, a ""person/ghost/entity"" who only exists in darkness, and a family who she disturbs. The mother - who is not quite mentally stable - has a special connection to Diana. The story is rather good, but IMO would've needed a lot of beefing up. I could've seen at least 30 extra minutes of this movie, at 80 min total it's way too short. There's so much good in this movie that it actually makes me quite disappointed that it's so short.Acting is good. Would've liked to see much more of Bello. Theresa Palmer makes a great horror lead. The short cast list and lack of ""bigger scenes"" gives this movie a bit of a small budget feel.I would've liked to see this movie take place somewhere else than LA, which just lacks any style and proper mood IMO. The timber framed ""mansion"" (!) where the mother lives was nice, but the other apartment where the movie takes places was just Melrose Place tacky all the way to colorful walls and Avenged Sevenfold posters. LA just makes me think of big cars, tattoo shops, eternal sunshine, bodybuilders, beaches etc, not really the location for horror like this. I'm sure it was a budget decision.The cinematography was OK at best, although lighting and the Diana character was very well made.As for horror, there are jump scares and it's generally well made. The atmosphere lacks IMO, which comes a lot from the locations etc and shortage of material. There are some very clichéd ""why in the hell do you go to a dark basement"" kind of scenes, but I guess they are a part of this genre.Recommended yes, but not really a classic by any means.",Lights Out
114,FelipeCarrillo,"Warner Bros. Is The Modern 'Hammer Productions', Temporarily",7,23 August 2016,"""Lights Out"", the second horror film most anticipated of the year (undoubtedly, the first was ""The Conjuring 2"") lands in midsummer with an unimaginable reception at the box office, but with unequals from specialized critics. It's not perfect, and despite it being favored with the production of the horror master of the 21st century, James Wan, it is distant from the works of the producer; nevertheless, gives some well made scares and a few drifts of the conventional decisions in the genre, although, as it is recurrent in the summer, all that promise disappears when they turned on the lights.As happened with the selfsame Wan at the beginning of the decade with ""Saw"" and Andrés Muschietti with his short film ""Mama"", talented Swedish director David F. Sandberg managed the support of New Line and Warner Bros. to adapt his short film from 2013, in a lucrative film of 81 minutes runtime. There have been several cases in which Hollywood accepts the original ideas from shorts (especially, relating to the horror genre) to take them to the big screen; nevertheless, it is complex and expectant the process to extend a simple plot of three-minute into a solid story line for more than one hour. Sandberg knew to create an gloomy atmosphere and in constant movement, but he neglects worthy treatment to a promising premise complicating the solidification of a real modern classic, even so, it is a delight enjoy of the darkness of his invention.Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) is a young woman who is determined to move away from her home to leave behind inexplicable events that happened in her childhood on account of the psychological disorders of her mother with her imaginary friend, Diana (Alicia Vela-Bailey). However, Martin (Gabriel Bateman) replaces the role of his elder sister in house of his mother, experiencing the apparition of a woman with creepy appearance as soon as lights switch off . Rebecca decides to confront her atavistic fears from childhood and save her family, inquiring into the origin of the mental problems of her mother, Sophie (Maria Bello), uncovering the tragic roots of the supernatural manifestations that haunts them, Diana was a marginalized girl with psychiatric problems due to a skin disease with contact of the light, now, she is an aggressive supernatural appearance in search of a weak mind, unfortunately, she has found a home inside a family that was nuclear.In addition to each one of the aspects that adorn films of Wan, one of the essential elements is to create strong characters that worry us, characters with credulous foundations; one simple plot, but with heart, with expectation and above all with intense shocks. This lack is present within the film, Palmer and Bello are not light the spark in screen with their performances. The story takes reminiscences of the genre and it is unable to establish the limits of Diana, nevertheless, some of the sequences more stressful are based purely on these.With multitude of resources such as the setting ( interesting fact: I'm pretty sure that the interiors of the house of Sophie where they filmed ""Lights Out"" are the same used in Universal's ""Ouija"" in 2014, with minor modifications; pay attention to details inside the house), lighting and the soundscape manage to hook the audience in a dark spiral to their deepest fears, the cupboard, the blackness under the bed, a bleak basement and of course the universal fear of the darkness.We are exhausted of diffuse plots that does not lead nowhere, the argument is elementary and simply effective. A narrative that combines with the haunting soundtrack and the admirable cinematography, obtaining sequences makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end during all runtime. With appropriate 81 minutes, it is slips gradually giving clues and delivering cheap jump-scares with an ending belonging to a family drama, nothing suitable for the purpose of the film, but at least, it was decent.""The Ring"", ""Dark Water"" and even ""The Conjuring"" are rough references in the movie of Sandberg and even though in occasions he become stagnant to project scares that we already have seen, he provides certain scenes that explore the places more recondite of your mind and they will overwhelm you, until you are under your bed sheets at the midnight. The intermittent light red in the apartment of Rebecca, the confrontation between Diana and Bret and the last thirty-minute take advantage of the resource to the maximum; the film is more than keep you on the edge of the seat, the film stays with you until the darkness of your bedroom and oblige you to remember Diana, unavoidably.""Lights Out"" is the dreamy debut of any director and fulfills with generate excitement about what will deliver David F. Sandberg with Annabelle 2. In a period in where horror films are having a boom spontaneous, the last project of New Line does not exceed the level reached by previous films of the movie producer, nevertheless, it entertains, frightens and even paralyzes. The only function of ""Lights Out"" is to nurture even more the universal fear to darkness and, Yes, I always switch on light more than three times to assure me that I'm completely alone, however, the silhouette of Diana always is there.",Lights Out

Sandberg Review Must not turn off lights, must not turn off lights, must not turn off lights! Well then sleep, screw it! Three years ago David F. Sandberg made a short called lights out, it got really popular on the internet(which is odd considering I didn't see it) and New Line Cinema partnered with him to make it into a feature film. The only two reasons I wanted to see Lights Out because well James Wan produced it and so did Eric Heisserer who also did the screenplay(the other reason I was anticipating this). When Rebecca left home, she thought she left her childhood fears behind. Growing up, she was never really sure of what was and wasn't real when the lights went outand now her little brother, Martin, is experiencing the same unexplained and terrifying events that had once tested her sanity and threatened her safety. A frightening entity with a mysterious attachment to their mother, Sophie, has reemerged. This feels like my Poltergeist, everyone says about that film that its mostly like a coexisting horror film and family drama. Lights Out is the same way which is what really makes it stand out. You don't get a lot of horror films that revolve a family, I mean there may be movies with a family like The Conjuring but we mostly follow Ed and Lorraine Warren in that film. But no in this film it's just the family Rebecca, her mother, Martin and Bret(Rebecca's boyfriend) who surprisingly isn't a throw away character but he wasn't memorable much. The atmosphere is oozing with dark dread and makes the film quite intense. The actors in the movie are all great and they work well off each other they had good chemistry. Although it has like one scene where Martin makes a stupid decision, You want the door opened or closed? Open, your like no kid wrong move. It also has like some continuity errors like theirs a bit of light but the door moves just a little bit and opens but it is dark on the other side of that door so I shrugged it off but it seemed odd the door opened. Lights Out has a creepy dark atmosphere with a great cast with genuine scares and a little bit of jump scares, It's one of the best horror films of this year I'm giving Lights Out a five out of five.",Lights Out

119,Jared_Andrews,"It's OK, We're all a little afraid of the dark",7,8 October 2017,"Its brilliance lies in its simplicity. Lights out doesn't attempt to confuse anyone, nor does it look to introduce a totally original idea. Instead, it boldly and unambiguously taunts the audience with the message, ""you were all afraid of the dark as kids and most of you still are."" Never has a scary movie villain had such an easy foil—light. Literally any kind of light—sun, fluorescent, bright. They each work perfectly well. Shine any sort of light in the direction of this movie's monster and she disappears. Poof. She's gone and everyone is safe. Writing this, I recognize that this doesn't sound even the tiniest bit scary. Yet somehow, as I sat in my well-lit house after watching the movie, I felt afraid. A brief telling of the plot: there's a monster-demon-ghost-girl named Diana that lives only in darkness because light hurts her, and sometimes she kills people. She haunts other people in the movie who try to not be killed by her and also they try to defeat her. That's really all there is to know. Yes, it's a very simple plot, but still an enjoyable one, at least in this instance.Something about the beautiful simplicity of the scare tactics just worked. Nothing confusing, nothing shocking. There weren't even very many classic hanging suspense moments interrupted by loud, jolt scares. These we textbook jump scares. A seemingly safe moment with normal amounts of sound that slowly drifts to silence then POW! A jump scare. You may be thinking, ""this sounds lame. How does this brutally basic approach yields effective scares?"" Great question, my astute and thoughtful reader. I've thought about this question and come up with a few explanations. First, we owe a tremendous credit to the actress who played Diana (Alicia Vela-Baley). Her intimidating posture and sickly contorting and Freddy Kruegerish flailing arms bring to life a terrifying character, whose mere presence on screen is enough to leave viewers unsettled. There's something about crouching, and Vela-Baley is great at it. Seeing a person crouch in a well-lit area is comical. But looking at a crouching figure in the shadows, that will make your skin crawl. The other explanation that I will offer is the visceral nature of the scares. Much of the movie takes place in the dark and the dark is scary. We are evolutionarily predispositioned to fear the dark. It's a survival instinct. Don't argue with me on this. I'm right. Anyway, the dimly-lit, shadowy settings are the perfect playground for visceral and pure jump scares. Director David F. Sandberg hits all the right beats in framing and lurking camera movement to maximize this simple and smart approach. So, that's it. If you can't stand jump scares or scary movies, don't see Lights Out. Honestly, I'm not sure why you're even reading this review if you don't like scary movies. If you do like jump scares and scary movies, watch Lights Out. And maybe buy a couple extra lightbulbs or a nightlight before you do.",Lights Out

That hopeless fat lady who finds herself observed by a strange and traumatizing creature in her flat that appears every time the lights are turned out. The funny thing is that for most people I have talked to, the short movie was a lot better than the long version. I have to say I could not agree more. While lights out is definitely watchable, the explaining of where that creature comes from makes the movie that little bit more completely than needed to be. In the end, the whole thing becomes a succession of almost intense moments, almost gripping moments, that leave you a little deflated. I guess not every movie needs to be of the highest standard. You have got to accept that in the creative world there's good, there's bad, and there's also mediocre. I guess Lights out fits into the last bracket.",Lights Out

Still, the concept is interesting and while not necessarily unique from afar, it's handled in a really cool way and the story, although very vague in some parts, was executed entertainingly enough.

Though I think it's execution is a bit simple and somewhat inconsistent.So first off this movie is well shot, directed and acted. It's pretty good overall. Though some of the dialog is a bit iffy here and there.The scares come quick and 99% of it is dependent on jump scares, though they are well done, hard to predict but still just kind of cheap. I think the sound design was a bit of a letdown here though, it has its moments but generally isn't very creepy.I liked the characters a lot, especially how it ends up going. It's kind of a weird feel good movie in one way and a sad movie in another. And my biggest issue lies within the ending. It felt very out of place? It just kind of happened and whilst the viewer could think of this solution as a easy way out. There was also another solution that they just ''forgot'' about. I just felt like the buildup towards that moment simply wasn't there.As far as the monster goes in this, its pretty good, but generic visually. Annoyingly though the monster is not very consistent in its actions, seeming more or less powerful in moments where it needs to be.The whole dark/light mechanic I thought was great, and the scenes that show it work really well. But the mechanic also a bit too much ''freedom''.So yeah. For young horror fans this will be a trip to watch. All in all 5/10.",Lights Out
124,S_Soma,"A few holes, but definitely worth a watch for horror fans.",8,4 October 2016,"""LIGHTS OUT"" In most respects, a supernatural horror movie is neither more nor less difficult to create than any other kind of movie. Certainly today's advanced special-effects technology makes the creation of any sort of horrifying image you can imagine easily possible given enough money in the budget. If you can think of it, you can create that image on film. Or whatever the recording medium du jour may be.But a supernatural horror story line has intrinsic dimensions of difficulty associated with it far beyond those of any other genre. The story lines of movies about adventure, comedy, romance, history and so on are much simpler to write than supernatural horror. Most story genres allow you to focus merely upon the elements of the story itself because most story genres presume the same basic laws of physics and natural context with which we are all familiar in our daily lives. Both the author and the audience are intrinsically familiar with reality and most genres of stories occur in essentially the same reality in which our own lives occur. In writing the story the author more or less automatically knows the reality rulebook and knows where the boundaries lie. If the author of a spy story has James Bond fly away in a helicopter that sprang from his lapel flower, nobody's going to buy it and generally everybody knows why.But with a supernatural horror story the author is forced to fabricate an entire collection of new laws of physics ALONG WITH all of the rest of the story activity and then try to remain consistent with their own new reality rulebook. It's almost impossible to do well and predictably it's where most supernatural horror stories tend to fall apart most completely.And so it is with ""Lights Out"".Given the fact that ""Lights Out"" hails from Warner Bros., a major movie studio if ever there was one, the general quality of the movie is far above average. All of the elements whose quality is simply a matter of spending an appropriate amount of money are adequately high. The acting isn't to die for but it's more than tolerable for the picture, the special-effects and CGI do everything they need to do, and so on.But no amount of money can guarantee you a great storyline, or even a passable one, and with supernatural horror, it also can't guarantee you that the plot won't have more holes than Swiss cheese or be anything other than a festering mess.As examples:The entire premise of the bogeyman excuse me bogeyWOMAN... is that her fatal weakness is any sort of visible light (other than black light). So, clearly, in fending off ""Diane"" (our supernatural villain), one must absolutely make certain of being in possession of lots and lots of reliable visible lighting. So...Do our protagonists disco on down to the local Home Depot for all the lighting and batteries they can carry? Of course not. They face it all with a couple of iffy flashlights (with more accent on ""iffy"" then ANYONE could possibly justify) and some candles. Uh huh... Candles. And the moron boyfriend, after first carefully demonstrating to himself the critical necessity of having a very bright flashlight in one's hand at all times immediately precedes to use the only flashlight he has as a hammer on a doorknob. Big surprise when soon thereafter he no longer is in possession of a working flashlight.The entire city has a power outage at precisely the worst possible moment.The origin story of the bogeywoman is vague at best.Sometimes Diane the bogeywoman simply vanishes with the application of light, and sometimes she burns as if the light disintegrates her.While there is clearly a deep relationship between the mentally defective mother character and Diane the bogeywoman, the fact that Diane can be destroyed by killing the mother character is a complete surprise. This just pops out of nowhere at the end of the picture when needed.Trust me, this is just a Whitman sampler of frailties of the movie. There are many more unlisted.All of this having been said, it's a rather sad commentary on supernatural horror pictures that, this somewhat clunky storyline notwithstanding, this is definitely one of the better supernatural horror pictures in recent times. Generally, EVERY supernatural horror picture really struggles with self-consistency that tends to pick away at the ""willing suspension of disbelief"", it's always just a question of how much and how badly it flaps into your face, often effectively obscuring your enjoyment of the movie. All in all, ""Lights Out"" is definitely one of the better examples of the genre.SOME of the scenes are actually quite stellar. There's one scene where the primary heroin is sound asleep in her room, conveniently almost fully dressed, and a flashing red neon sign is flooding the room with intermittent red light. A scratching noise wakes her up. She has not yet fully tuned into the fact that there is a Thing That Goes Bump in the Night that has returned to refocus its attentions on her and her family, and so she sleepily assumes the vague dark figure making the scratching noise on the floor in the middle of the doorway is her little brother.The intensely focused, slow burn in her face as the realization of what's happening in the scene begins to dawn on her is a superb job of acting and a thoroughly terrifying visual experience. Perhaps I'm forgiving, but that one scene would be worth the price of admission for most supernatural horror pictures.",Lights Out

126,SpoilerAlertReviews,Sleeping with the lights on...,8,1 September 2016,"I remember seeing this short horror, viral video a couple of years ago as it was scaring people, including myself, across the web. Coming from Swedish no-budget horror short-filmmaker David F. Sandberg, otherwise known as Ponysmasher on YouTube and other social media platforms. I'm assuming Horror director/producer James Wan (Saw, Conjuring, Insidious) watched the original video and had to back Sandberg's work and develop it into a full feature length film. It always pleases me to see something like this happen, like Kung Fury and Hardcore Henry. It's shares a few story elements from other existing horror films like The Ring, The Grudge and Insidious and whilst not entirely unique, it is superbly done and quite unpredictable. The trailer doesn't give too much away as it might suggest. They've kept it simple and it works, trying not to stray from a working formula. Aussie model and actress Teresa Palmer, who looks like a younger Naomi Watts, takes the lead as she tries to consul her younger half-brother Gabriel Bateman, who incidentally already has a list of horror film credited to his name, even for his age. Credits such as Annabelle, Outcast and American Gothic. He's having issues at home with their mother, Maria Bello who seems to be having a some sinister kind of relapse, something Palmer is familiar with. But it's this Diana that the story is all about, who can only get at you in the shadows. Diana herself (played by stunt double extraordinaire, Alicia Vela-Bailey) is a great creation even if not solely original. Her hands, her stance and her voice work perfectly well and actually preferred the silhouette and glinting eyes over seeing her in the flesh. The rest of the cast does just as good as the leads, especially devoted, needy, boyfriend Alexander DePersia who I at first look, mistaken him for GoT's Daario, Michiel Huisman. Good to see Brit comedienne Andi Osho and it's a nice touch to see the original victim from the short, Lotta Losten who also happens to be Sandberg's wife. Only downside is that it's not that scary, though that doesn't mean it's a write-off, it's tense in parts with a good modern spooky score from Benjamin Wallfisch, but there's no great shocks, in fact, there's some comical bits which gladly, doesn't ruin the film. It's a great all-rounder horror film and fans of the short should enjoy. It certainly reminds of when you were once afraid of the dark and might have you sleeping with the light on!

It has all the trademarks of a modern day horror film. It's ""horror"" comes strictly from sudden loud noises which are all expected since the music cuts out right before, and it ends up being a dud when it comes to actually scaring you. It also often treats it's antagonist as a typical supernatural villain towards the end scenes, even showing the monster outright. When I saw the trailer and I saw the cliché jump scare involving turning the lights on and off and seeing whatever boogeyman the horror movie is against this time, I felt this would turn out as ""just another modern horror film"".

After getting a quick rundown of what's going on in the house, Palmer suspects that the entity that haunted her as a child — an entity she believed was a figment of her imagination — could be real, and is now coming after little Bateman.With a bit of research into her mother's past and her own, first-hand experience, Palmer realizes that her family is up against a powerful spirit that has killed beforea spirit that gains strength in the dark and is weakened in the light. For Palmer and Bateman to have any hope of stopping the entity, they must conquer their fears and work together, and convince their frightened mother to help them.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Lights Out"" is the scene when we first see the evil spirit. It wasvery frightening. I think if that happened to me, I'd crumple up into a ball and start crying. Not Denzel Washington crying, but Matt Damon crying.Although this movie is several levels above the typical, horror movie out there, it does suffer from a few shenanigans, such as the main characters voluntarily separating from each other during crisis mode.

Teresa Palmer played her role brilliantly. How could we forget the one and only Diana? She was terrifying. The whole theater was spooked whenever she appeared on screen! All in all...it is worth seeing. We(The Autistic Reviewers) wanted more. It does end fairly quickly. But, at the end of the day I guess there's not much more you could with the film.

135,nashw82,An Interesting Adaptation from the Short Film,7,7 March 2021,They have stretched the horror short into a feature length film here and done it well enough to keep you interested. The characters are solid and the relationship between the mother and daughter and the younger brother is well developed enough to keep you involved in the story. The concept of a creature that can only be see in the dark is original enough to make this worth a watch. While its not as satisfying as some horror films it is definitely an interesting addition to the genre and worth a watch at least once.,Lights Out
136,vasco_cid,Out; not only the lights.,3,19 January 2017,"Lights. Scares. Originality. Enthusiasm. All out. Another tiresome, clichéd and by the numbers horror outing to check the box of the annual horror quota, Lights Out's embarrassingly repetitive premise, breaks no new grounds in the genre, in any aspect whatsoever. The setup, introduction, so called development and conclusion are all awkwardly unoriginal to a clinical degree as the plot has the characters move on autopilot from A-B at the exact time and using the same dull devices the audience foresaw far in advance. The exasperating predictability is not compensated by any effective notion of atmosphere or mise-en-scène, rendering the lack of plot and pedestrian acting all the more evident.",Lights Out

138,nick121235,Good but not great,7,30 April 2017,"Lights Out started out on a strong note. In fact, this was probably the only movie I've watched this year that managed to scare me other than Sinister. Like Sinister however, it failed to maintain the horror factor throughout the entirety of the movie and began to become repetitive and tiresome somewhere around the middle of the film. Unlike Sinister, it ended on a higher note. Lights Out is probably one of the better horror releases this year with strong performances from most of the cast, especially the young Gabriel Bateman. It did seem to rehash horror standards with some of the plot devices and also relied heavily on jump scares- which worked surprisingly well in this case. Unfortunately, although it does make a stab at substance, it tends to come off a little cliché. In summation, Lights Out is a very enjoyable horror movie, but probably not one you're gonna find yourself watching more than once.",Lights Out
139,stonedraim,Lights out... a work fumbling in the dark?,5,15 October 2016,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Bad and overacting in the first five minutes. A lady stands in the corridor and the lights go out. She reacts too fast as she knew that there would be darkness. Maybe also bad directing. Sets the tone for this movie so this will be a ""typical horror movie"" of the 21st century.Bad acting and over acting nr. 2. The boy runs into his room, scared. He jumps into bed and takes the bed cloth to his face, and then the acting stops. He just sits there with open mouth and empty face. Bad acting and over acting nr. 3. A social care worker talks to the sister and the sister says that the stepfather is murdered and her real father were gone as she was 10 years old. After one sentence, the social care worker says; ""If we could focus on Martin now..."" After one sentence...?! Forced and odd emotion pattern, as in bad script and bad dialogue.Bad acting nr. 4. As in almost every almost approved movie, the emotional statements and developments and the behaviours is too forced and too fast. The sister is angry and upset on the situation the brother. Just a minute after, all of a sudden, the sister is all calm and at ease and smiling about the little brother and treating him as he was her child. The emotional development is way too fast if it should reflect the reality with touch of authentic sense, which movies in some way should, to be taken seriously (yes, even so in monster horror movies). If she is acting that emotion as Rebecca in front of her brother, she is conveying that very bad as an actress as the viewer is getting the sense of a true feeling... and again, is that were a true feeling, that would have been forced and odd and strange to grasp, speaking of the emotional and the behaviour development.Bad acting nr. 5. 1 hour and 50 seconds into the movie. Extremely light (the first pun in here, yes) hitting on the door, especially since the sister and the brother is trapped and in definitive panic. If you're in panic, you're probably screaming your lungs out and ""puts your fists through the door"". Underacting.When Rebecca is listening to the tape recorded in the asylum, the psychiatrists dialogue is plain and simple bad. A professional psychiatrist in an asylum speaking to a patient in that way? Giving statements to the patient in a negative way, instead of asking questions? No... even if it were in 1984.Lights out is full of clichés. A mother is raising her child on her own. the sister is revolting to his mother. The sister is taking the child away from the mother, and the mother says; ""Do you know what is like raising a child on your own without the father?"" Oh, well.... blah, blah, blah....Strange script: the social care worker starts to ask questions... in the hallway amongst other people? And is taking notes... in the hallway?! That is a hole in the social and the behaviour pattern when compared to reality.These things above point this motion picture in a direction of an almost approved movie.The production team tried to blend in some innovative and authentic horror moments. One example is when the brother is suddenly dragged under the bed in all silence and the sister is helping him out... and that is that. And, as the production team have made those moments quite bad in the perspective of emotions, those good intentions falls down in a failure.Kind of nice touch 21 minutes into the movie. On the wall behind the boy and behind Bret on the wall, the word ""Släckt"" is written. ""Släckt"" in the Swedish language is similar to... yes, that is correct; ""Lights out"". A little cool thing, there.In the end, as for 15 minutes. I was just waiting for it to end as I was curious how it would end, that was all.There is some comparison to ""The Babadook"" here on IMDb. The Babadook has a more psychological, threatening and deeper sense of horror in it. First time I watched ""The Babadook"" I was scared almost beyond my own belief in that particular moment. ""Lights out"" is just an flat attempt of a horror movie. The winner is ""The Babadook"", by far. Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Just about approved. - The actors : Maybe with a better director, they could go through the screen. Watching Maria Bello go from lets say ""The end of violence"" and that greatness on to this movie, I just felt sad 'cause Maria Bello is an so much better actress. - Entertainment : I may be one of few that says ""no"". And I stand my grounds... ""No"". Could be that I were mentally somewhere else or in another mood... this movie just passed...it just passed me by. - Age : 15. Blood and some scary horror moments.4,6 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 5 Approved. 4 Failed. Lacking in character.)",Lights Out

It's a simple premise that is pulled off with such brilliance it will be a classic horror that I keep going back to. It's one that I missed at the cinema but I found it just as effective watching it at home.

143,HorrorOverEverything,Better Than I Expected But Still Just Another Jump Scare Movie At It's Core,6,2 August 2016,"When it comes to horror movies I personally prefer more psychological scares/thrills rather than movies that just constantly try to get a cheap jump scare out of you. I thought ""The Ring"" was pretty OK but after that came a string of poorly done (mostly remakes of Asian films) PG-13 Horror films that all had similar stories and similar clichés. For a while we saw a decrease in these types of movies, but recently they have made a comeback and ""Lights Out"" is one of the newest releases in the ""Jump Scare-athon"" Genre. Surprisingly though this film actually does do some things very well and managed to exceed my expectations (they weren't really all that high though).I was a big fan of the opening scene, it is spoiled a bit by the trailer but it still did a good job of packing a pretty brutal punch for a PG-13 movie and getting me immediately interested in the movie. From there the pace continues to move very quickly, they do not hold back from showing the Shadow'd baddie multiple times in the first fifteen minutes. The fact that they showed her so often early on did make her less scary but it also made the movie much more entertaining in my opinion. As the story began to unfold I was actually fairly pleased with it, it's not a extremely original story but it does have more depth than stories in these kinds of movies usually do. Then we are introduced to the movie's first big problem, the main character Rebecca (played by Teresa Palmer), she is just so bland and mono toned through out the whole film. Just about every other character in the film is more interesting than her yet she gets the majority of the screen time/lines. Usually in these kinds of movies it's the young child actors who ruin it but honestly I thought the character Martin (played by Gabriel Bateman) was actually done pretty well and succeeded in not being too obnoxious or annoying. The kooky mom (Maria Bello) and the picture perfect boyfriend (Alexander Dipersia) were so-so characters, didn't really add much to the film but also didn't really take anything away from it. Aside from a super bland main character another big problem that the film had was it's pacing. As I mentioned above it does pace itself very well in the beginning, unfortunately from there we are treated to some very long, drawn out, uninteresting scenes that felt unnecessary. The first fifteen minutes are good and the last fifteen minutes are great, however in the in-between was a bit lackluster. The movie is at it's best when Danielle (Shadow'd baddie) is going after people and wreaking havoc, however instead of making those scenes the key points of the film we instead have to sit through a lot of meh jump scares and shotty attempts at character development. Had there been more victims for Danielle to go after I think the film would have been much better, an R rating wouldn't have hurt either. All in all it's really not a bad film for what it is, it does stand out from the other jump scare movies by having some very well done scenes, a pretty OK story, and a few brutal moments for a PG-13 film. But was definitely held back by it's rating, the lackluster small cast, and too many boring scenes.",Lights Out
144,AnthonyMeg,"When the ligh out, you better scram.",7,2 February 2019,"This scary movie's goal of being frightening film worked out, but it wasn't good enough to be a flawless masterpiece, or a haunting film, and that's mostly because filmmakers (especially the directors)trivialize the power of people's notice, or they care less about the specifics, all that matters to them is pulling off the overall story, and whether the graphics look sharp or not, and that upsets horror enthusiasts.
Well-chosen actors and actresses;I believe some actors play major role in movies' commercial success. The sound effects were on point, however, there are lots of abrupt startles which are found in most of the horror films. I think the sequence of the events come off as a predictable one, and the plot line lacked the surprising unforeseen events, because honestly, they weren't impressive. The uniqueness of the film is manifested in the way spiritual horror and physical (kind of gory) conjointly been put together. Altogether this is a legitimate horror movie, as long as you don't get your hopes up you will be satisfied.",Lights Out

147,anupapu8,Nothing New but Didn't bore.,7,22 July 2016,"LIGHTS OUT - I knew the fact that if i want to review more and more movies , i have to start watching movies alone. Because i will not be getting company from someone every Friday. But i was ignoring this fact and skipping movies. Yesterday lastly the LAZY PERSON inside me get defeated by THE MOVIE LOVER inside me. so i decided to watch movie alone. Then i thought if there is nobody to say that he can not watch two movies one after another them m free for it . So i decided to watch two movies one after another i.e., LIGHTS OUT & MADAARI (which i will be reviewing next) as per the schedule. Two other movies which i had to left for today due to conflicting Showtimes are KABALI and STAR TREK BEYOND. I Haven't said this before but its true that m not a very good person to review HORROR movies. There exist a different group of viewers who eagerly waits for Horror movies. I personally don't know how their mind works. I mean what they want in their Horror movies. Because Horror movies are constantly rated low but always become blockbuster. So i think i would like to start it with comparison to CONJURING 2 , which i liked a lot but many have complained that they don't like it because they didn't get scared (i want those persons to list the movies which made them getting scared not in their childhood but in their adulthood. Because i really want to know what are the benchmarks for them to decide whether a horror movie is good or not) . So for a start both Conjuring 2 and Lights out are WARNER BROS product , but they both are different in many sense . First Lights Out is a really less expensive movie , i.e., 4.9million$ which is 9 times lesser then the budget of conjuring 2 which costs 40million$. That doesn't mean that Lights Out looked cheap. Its a well made movie as long as production design goes. But the biggest difference between both the movie is that , Conjuring 2 was a wholesome movie(which i prefer) , it has a lot going on with the sub plot apart from the ghosts and because of that it was more entertaining for me in its 2hr and 14mins running time. In comparison LIGHTS OUT is a very direct movie with no subplots , concentrating just on single plot , very tightly edited (1hr and 22mins only) and made solely for Horror movie fans. That can be a reason for Horror movie fans liking this movie more then me. But i cant say about their point of view. But i can definitely say that there is nothing in this movie for the persons who are not Hardcore horror movie fans. Story is very simple , ghost is haunting a family which consists Mother , Son , Daughter and Daughter's Boyfriend. All the actors have done a really good Job. Teresa Palmar as the Daughter was nice . The newcomer playing the Son was great child actor given a strong character. The concept of Ghost scared of Light and can only appear when lights are out was nice actually. And the concept really kicks in the last 30mins when the ghost tried to kill everybody and everybody tries to save himself with the help of light. The movie is very dark , its hard to believe that how can be any person can live in a home with so much dime yellow light in Los Angeles. It was an ideal how for a ghost. Production design has definitely save a lot of money from not using enough lighting. But yes for its short length , the movie never bores. Actually it finished with the blink of your eyes. With the tight budget in which it has been made , i think it would be a blockbuster too. But at least its a good movie to become a blockbuster , so i am happy for WARNER BROS.. 6.7/10.

The idea that the evil ""thing"" can only exist in the dark is simple, easy to understand - and actually pretty nicely done. However - it is kind of funny how insufficient every lightsource suddenly becomes. Lamps that would usually light up a large room with ease hardly illuminate things a meter away. Then there is the question about how the evil spirit thing gets from A to B. Sure - it appears in the shadows - But how did it get there when there is light between A and B. Those questions are like nitpicking - but for me ... it makes the entire premise of the movie questionable (questionable in regards of it being a suspense, horror, fantasy movie that is)What i really, really did not like - and what ruined the main protagonist for me was her behaviour in regards of her brother. Her persona simply did not fit the overly caring type. This irrational behaviour made her very unsympathetic to me ... which in turn caused me to actually hope for the bad guys to get her.Speaking of getting someone ... i was quite happy to see that - although the movie followed standard procedure for the most part... the boyfriend did not die ... something i was quite CERTAIN would happen - especially after she gave in to officially ""be together with him"".All in all - it was a bit above average - and worth the time.",Lights Out

Where it goes downhill is at the climax: there's no reason for the mother to delay her suicide just to confirm to the ghost that she can't exist without her. We're watching the movie so we already know that. Realistically, she would just shut up and pull the trigger. What is the reiteration going to do? It's unnecessary. Then, the movie gives one last suspension with the flickering light in the ambulance.

151,tjgoalie13,"Dark, Clever, and Unnerving",8,23 July 2016,"Lights Out, is quite possibly one of the most visually and mentally scary films in the last two years. The film is yet another in a string of horror movies that uses diseases as allegories for its premise, and this premise alone is genius. Lights Out is often unnerving and sometimes terrifying, dark in look and tone, without feeling recycled or derivative. The biggest strength of the film is that the story is constructed in a way that the audience is always wondering if something will happen.The most genius element of the film is the look of the creature that haunts this movie ""Diana."" Diana is an all-black figure that lurks in the dark, and kills whoever threatens it. That being said throughout this film the audience has to fear that this character could pop out of any dark space at any given time. At 81 minutes, not a single second is calm or peaceful, because the mere sight of sight of this creature is unnerving. However, the writers and crew deserve credit for conceiving the idea of the film having a lot of darkness in it.We often say lighting is a storytelling device, but in today's films it's become less true the more formulaic films get. In this film lighting is very much a storytelling device, and it is used perfectly. Every scene in this film contains, just the right amount of darkness and light, almost as if there are safe areas, and areas that characters should stay away from, and they're often changing. The dark look and tone of this film, create a very unnerving atmosphere, because one of the most common fears is a fear of the dark, and more notably a fear of the unknown, which exists in the dark.The film really hit a note with me personally, because I have had nightmares in the past about all dark figures living in the dark, so the film felt that much more personal to me. That being said, the film really doesn't feel all that derivative of other recent horror films. A few moments, and scenes did feel familiar (Diana as a child), but those were few and far between. Even those moments that are a little familiar, are constructed in a way that they are still very scary. The film does what The Babadook did a couple of years ago, and uses depression as an allegory for the creature in the film, which is turning into a very cool concept. The film is one of the few films within the system that uses lighting to tell the story, and does so in a way that is clever and terrifying at the same time. The film is admittedly dark, and relatively humorless, and not really for children, but that kinda goes without saying. For those horror buffs looking for a good scary movie, this may be your movie.",Lights Out

No. Lights Out has too little of the monster, so we have to look at bad actors badly acting for much longer than we should. Additionally, the monster's origin story is dumb.

154,Oberrated,Not bad for a PG-13 horror,7,23 July 2016,"I was pleasantly satisfied with this flick. 'Lights Out' is possibly one of the best (and I use ""best"" lightly, do not get up in arms) PG-13 films I have seen in awhile. Normally, you see some spooky jump scare trailers and the PG-13 tag and would immediately (at least I would) slate this off with the high chance of failure. Two things kept me from doing that; 1. Tagging James Wan as the producer and 2. Making it about something people are genuinely afraid of. Let me explain that one a bit. How many of you ever had that fear of running up your steps from your basement because the creepy monster was coming up behind you? How many of you closed your closet doors at night because of the spooky ghosty that would come out if you did not? 'Lights Out' brings that popular fear of when you turn the lights out, a being is there, but when you turn them back on? It is gone. Truly terrifying for some, genius in regards to the creators. Concept aside, 'Lights Out' did jump scares impressively well, and that is me saying that. For an hour and twenty-one minute long movie, the plot creates detailed characters with deep stories and also throws in a solid plot-twist that some may not see coming. My own major gripe though? The classic horror-stupid decisions. It is common knowledge that the IQ of the typical human drops ten-fold in horror movies, well this film proves it. All in all, 'Lights Out' is a satisfying horror film, and quite possibly one of the best PG-13 ones I have seen in a long time. Highly recommended and good luck sleeping at night!",Lights Out

It started off with a pace and managed to maintain that which was impressive but it was not a very fast one to start with. The climax was funny! Yes, everyone in the theatre was laughing hard. It is not that there were many scenes where they put funny scenes in a horror movie to lighten up the mood, the backdrop was pretty tense, but we were laughing. This is not a good sign for a horror movie because nowadays, people are not scared by ugly scary faces, they are actually scared when the movie has a scary tone throughout. Teresa Palmer and Maria Bello were okay. The ghost, have to say is something I have never seen before.

157,daniele-iannarelli,Certainly was 'lights out' for me,3,12 April 2019,"Certainly was 'lights out' for meI read the reviews in advance of watching, but I never get a really, truly, honest critical appraisal. This is simply because - let's face it - there are too many people lacking in good taste.High ratings should be strictly be reserved for such classics as Citizen Kane, The Third Man, Ben Hur etc etc etc). How people can give ridiculously high ratings for what amounts to nothing more than 'bubble-gum-head' trash... is beyond me.Ok, I wouldn't say this film was completely trash, but it's along those lines. I suppose (for those easily pleased) it's ok as a shocker if there's nothing better to do or to watch. However, as a cinematic 'work of art' (which, ok ok, it doesn't set itself up as) it's way short of the mark.The film started off quite well with a good idea for a plot. Therefore, I started thinking (well, hoping really) that this was not going to disappoint.It disappointed!Underpinned by mediocre, insubstantial acting, it wasn't long before this film descended into the usual clichéd repetitive boredom. Hands coming out of walls and doors, the entity (""Diana"") appearing randomly etc.How this has managed to attain an average 6.3 rating on IMDB... I fail to understand.In making half-decent shocker/thriller/'horror' movies, there are (in my opinion) certain things that should be avoided, the main one being:Don't give too much (ie. 'less is more').
We don't *need* to see the demon, the creature, the ghost all the time (perhaps not even at all! Its implied presence is what's important... THiS is what's truly scary.Anyway, bottom line is that I feel this film deserved about a 4.5 rating. However, as there are no half-points available, I'll (in my usual policy) err lower and give a 4.

It's way too short and messy, predictable-unnecessary melodrama, forced pacing with plot holes.

As it sits under 80 minutes in length I think it's painfully obvious they didn't have enough story to make it feature length. Any time there's no action it's just characters talking and it's always exposition.It decently shot but for a movie that's supposed to be about someone that can only get you in the dark it was always pretty well-lit. Rather than use actual darkness to create tension it was 'movie' darkness where everything seemed to be lit by a full moon or something.As for the acting, it's tough to gauge since they're almost exclusively talking about the plot so it's clunky and dull. There's another movie that came out around this called Don't Breathe that creates a lot more suspense using darkness and sound design. Don't bother with this one.",Lights Out

When I heard that they were going to turn this into a full length movie, I was skeptical. When I saw the first trailer for Lights Out, I thought it was absolutely garbage.I was never excited for this movie's release, the trailer would make me laugh every time I watched it. I was going to avoid this movie at all cost because I had a sinking feeling that it would suck.I saw this movie with completely low expectations, I walked out thoroughly enjoying it.The acting and characters are believable. Teresa Palmer, Gabriel Bateman, Maria Bello, and Alexander DiPerisa all deliver good performances.The story-line is sharp and clever; This movie could easily be a physiological drama if you take out all the ghost stuff. I found myself emotionally invested in each character's journey as the story progressed.The directing is exceptional, there are quite a few shots that are considerably outstanding for a low budget horror movie, and I don't think I've seen horror directing this good since the first Conjuring movie.The scares are fine, I feel that I'm becoming tired of ghost stories, and I'd rather I've something that is more reality based. There are jump scares present, the scares have a Grudge movie feel to them, and I believe that they're pretty effective, but they ultimately fall short because all it is is jump scares.The ghost or whatever it is has a backstory, but there's no real overall purpose for it to exist because I believe that it's never explained.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie for its psychological aspects, but this ghost story sh*t is becoming lame in my opinion, and this movie would've truly been better if it were purely a psychological horror drama, which it is, but you've got to take out that ghost sh*t.Finale Grade: B",Lights Out
164,BillSims28,Five-Word Review: Impressive; Genuine Scares; Sometimes Uninspired,7,4 September 2016,"Expanding the 2013 short film into an 80 minute cinematic piece, Lights Out depicts a malicious entity that can only be seen in the dark haunting a dysfunctional family of a depressed mother and her children. Teresa Palmer leads a stellar cast which also features Maria Bello and Billy Burke, as the mystery of this creature slowly unravels.Although it sometimes falls into the trap of conforming to horror genre customs and clichés, Lights Out is for the most part an original, compelling, and often genuinely scary work. This is helped in part by the talented cast and well-written characters, which aids the film in making you root for them to succeed. Instead of some generic teen horror, with characters who you'd honestly prefer to die, Lights Out has some nail-biting and genuinely tense sequences where you are keen for the character to survive. It also boasts some solid acting skills from the older actors, helped by a passable turn from the main child in the film, Gabriel Bateman. Though he is no Jacob Tremblay (Room) or Noah Wiseman (The Babadook), he is more bearable than some.The best thing in the film is the horror, though. The central premise of a terrifying spectre waiting for you in the dark is scary enough, but the execution in the film boosts it, with sequences rendering the viewer apprehensive and afraid to go into the dark themselves. The ghostly phantom herself is a chilling enough image, with dark lank hair, eyes that are pinpricks of light in a void of black, and long nails. The lighting, and visual effects, make for a terrifying sight. Where the film does fall is when it turns to more regressive, boring techniques of horror such as noisy jump scares and dumb character decisions, but these are rare enough to keep the film at a high enough rating. Overall, one of the strongest horror films I've ever seen and at the better end of the scale of mediocrity that has been 2016's cinema so far. 75/100",Lights Out
165,ironcraftleague,A kinda mediocre horror movie,6,13 March 2019,"I decently enjoyed this movie because of the premise and the creature attached to the mother. The creature has a cool past that I found interesting. Other things that I really enjoyed was the opening and the first time we see the mom talking to the creature, it was legitimately creepy. Everything else kinda sucked. The acting kinda sucked, the lead was pretty bad in my opinion and was mainly emotionless. The cinematography kinda sucked, and the special effects REALLY were bad. The sequence of events is passable I guess, however it felt really boring. Not much else to say, the short film this was based off of is probably better. 7/10.",Lights Out

The premise regarding the entity that haunts the characters is rather weak and unforgiveable. Unfortunately this drags the movie down a lot. However, the acting is great all around and peoples reactions seemed realistic with an unnerving feeling throughout. The scares were great and for the most part very creative. Teresa Palmer is a decent actress that doesn't get a lot of quality roles that exploit her potential but she does well here. Maria Bello feels authentic as the disturbed parent and the son carries his scenes with dignity.

I was skeptical about watching this movie, but once I started I fell in love with it. The cast was amazing, the origin story about Diana and how the dots connected, the reason she was doing that and the end was a fantastic way of bringing this amazing movie a dignified ending.In these days, every horror story has already been told, since it's hard and almost impossible create an original script and movie without being compared with others, and that's why I love this movie and it was created in a way I think it's the best way of dealing with told stories. Like I said, originality is almost impossible today, so you must play with the unpredictable card, I mean, used the cliché we all know so well, like the spirit that haunts a family, and change the course a cliché would follow, and in this movie it paid of. Everyone could say, oh another haunted family movie, it's just like the others that came before, but no, the writers and director did an excellent job changing the typical line that every other movie of it's genre follow.I really loved this movie, to me everything made sense, the dots were all connected, with a bit of supernatural in it that justifies how Diana was there. My only wish is that they don't make a sequel for this movie, it did so well as a stand alone, that no one can do justice for a Lights Out 2, I mean, the ending was a good closure, there's no need for a second installment.",Lights Out

I would love to discuss the whole film here including but its worth watching before knowing anything.It's A Good Horror Movie which does what a Horror Movie should does, it makes you fear something more and in this case darkness so Naturally It is audience favorite.The Creativity of the director is nice and polished but still it cannot be a classic of anything like that.Still it will talked about whole lot this year.Few more details looked upon and it may become a Top film in this genre Finally It's a great effort and brought back horror to its original lines.Worth Every Penny",Lights Out

They lack the essence of a good horror movie which is to entice the audience in a psychological thriller to a point where you believe that what is going on the big screen could potentially happen when you go back to your house. Especially if you are American and live in one of those nice big houses. Ghosts usually do not pick Latin America houses. That's because they will probably have to haunt a studio place, where the living room is also the bedroom and there is one bathroom which in a standard American house would be a cat or do; g area. Anyway, my point is, this movie is a 5 or 6, it will scare you in a couple of scenes but that's it. As soon as you leave the theater, you will turn on your cell, check some e-mails, FB, and think of what you will see next time.

It ended up being better than I thought it would be, but it could have gone deeper. It borrowed the janky-legged female shape from The Grudge and The Ring and the main points of the story were presented via exposition rather than having the viewer experience them. The mother's relationship with the children was executed quite well and led to one of the creepier moments of the film. It does have jump scares, but it has the necessary creepiness to make that work well. It was smart to use the dark as the driving force of the movie because we all still have a little of that fear left in us.",Lights Out
174,leosmith-11166,One of the best Horror Films of recent years!,8,13 August 2016,"Alright. A Comedy film intends to make you laugh, as an action does to make you feel thrilled. And a horror film intends to scare you. And that's exactly what this film achieves. It is scary. It's not Psychologically scary like Silence of the Lambs or Psycho. And it isn't a scar-you-for-life scary film like The Exorcist. Its simple, classic jump-scare scary. The Kind that Shaylman dreamt of bringing back to the silver screen for years. If there is one thing you can be sure of, it it is that you will get your money's worth of entertainment after sitting through this.Last year, our horror film and film debutee Robert Eggers made a surprise in Hollywood with his hit ""The Witch"". This time another first time feature film director makes his mark. David Sandberg adapted his own short film into this feature length thrill. And he delivers. The reason why this film succeeds as a horror film isn't the jump scares- any old hack can make jump scares. The reason why it works so well lies in the pacing-Sandberg knows how to relax the audience before scaring them, before building a Hitchcock like suspense, only to be broken, then rebuilt back into a scare. The monster effects are like a leaf out of Guillermo Del Toro's book. I was genuinely convinced that no one else in Hollywood or the Film World could make a scary creature like Del Toro. I was deeply mistaken.Rather than Steal(although according to Tarantino, stealing from other films makes a better artist...)Sandberg borrows techniques and ideas from many a horror filmmaker. There is Hitchcock in their, with the long takes of suspense and the build up, there is the M.Night Shaylaman Jump Scare and The Del Toro Monsters. There are also undertones of the Poltergeist and The Babadook in there, with the latter obviously being a key to adapting this into a feature film. Sandberg then takes a little bit of everything and puts all the well known techniques into play, except this time the concept is completely original(Not counting the short film) and the style is adapted into modern standards. All in All, this film is a must see for horror film geeks. Its great entertainment and you definitely get what you payed for. Now its time to turn the lights out on this revue.....",Lights Out

Character development was great, actually get to care about them and want to see them make it out. Acting was pretty good. F/X were good. The only part that I didn't like was they did the explanation of the backstory by one character explaining it to another. I always hate when they do that, just seems lazy.The audience really got into it with a lot of people jumping and then a lot of giggles at themselves and others for jumping. Oh and in our screening the comedic relief of the big guy down front yelling ""oh s**t"" every time Diana jumps out. It reminded me of when I was a young teen and we'd get a whole group to go see the newest horror (F13,Halloween etc)You can't take it too seriously, just sit back and enjoy it.Overall I'd give it a 8/10 which is pretty good for a horror flick.",Lights Out

She disappears when there's light out and reappears in dark places. She can hide under your bed, in between doorways, inside your closet. Even if you turn the light on in the closet that doesn't mean she can't reappear right behind you. Oh and if you shoot at her the bullet goes through her. Not to mention the flash of the gun makes her briefly go invisible.Rebecca is the main character played by Teresa Palmer, who you might remember her from Warm Bodies, but I like to think of her as a more attractive and expressive Kristen Stewart. She gets a call from CPS that brings her back in touch with her estranged family. Tossing her into the mess.Sophie is Rebecca's mom and from the trailer you know that she's the reason that all of this is happening. She's played by Maria Bello who also played Anna Del Amico in ER. She does a convincing job and I haven't had many complaints with the films I've seen her in.David F. Sandberg wrote the short film that this is based off of and with James Wan producing him and coaching him on direction you can easily see him becoming a bigger named director. He'll probably get picked up by a major company at some point.Verdict: The ending can leave some speculation as to the likelihood or not of a sequel. I'm voting for a sequel.

186,lev-nemkin,Very enjoyable...,7,5 October 2016,"So I watched Lights Out this morning and I gotta say it was exactly what I expected after I saw the trailer I thought this movie was really good just awesome I mean it's not perfect no horror movie is but it's what one should be. It has a really creepy feel at first when you see the lights go out you're confused when you see this weird girl standing there you don't know who she is,where she came from or why she only appears when the lights go out the beginning of this was alright but then it got better it got really creepy. So this basically focuses on the character of Martin he's a little boy who sees this girl every night when the lights go out he can't sleep because of it there's a scene in this where he falls asleep in school because of that and they have to call his sister Rebecca to come get him and she's played by Teresa Palmer now I don't know who she is really don't think I've seen her in much but I'm sure I've seen her before. She basically takes him from their mother Sophie and brings him to stay with her so he can get some sleep and he does but during that night when the lights are out and Rebecca is in bed she sees the same girl and wonders who it is at that point she gets really scared. This is just interesting because you don't know who the mysterious,dangerous girl is yes she is obviously dangerous so later on Rebecca and her boyfriend go to her mother's house to try find out who the girl is and it turns out she's a mental patient called Diana who was a girl with some sort of skin disorder the doctors there did an experiment on her and she died now she only appears when the lights go out or maybe it was even when she was alive I wasn't really clear on that and obviously Diana is obsessed with the mother Sophie. Anyways I don't want to spoil too much more if I've spoiled anything at all but I'd highly recommend seeing this if you haven't yet really good horror movie.",Lights Out

188,HorrorFreak1997,very over-hyped. i left the theatre unimpressed.,2,14 August 2016,"lights out was a film I was looking forward to. described as being one of the best and most well rounded horror films to come out in recent years I was definitely intrigued. so I went to the theatre with high expectations.so lights out is a film with a very cool concept that if done right could end up being something very scary and chilling. but, instead we get something much much less that that. this film from beginning to end was so anticlimactic, boring and generic. I will try and keep this review as spoiler free as possible..the beginning scene is extremely anticlimactic. the director does a great job of building some solid tension and some genuine sense of unease with this first sequence but the pay off was such a major let down. a character is pulled laughably into the darkness. unfortunately this is the only scene that built any tension at all. for the entire duration of the rest of the movie there is no tension what so ever. every ""scare"" is predictable and laughable. characters who know and have known for a long time that you have to stay in the light to escape this ghost foolishly hold their lights in front of them. pointing the light away from them rather than holding the light above their heads. so many scenes involved characters surrounded by darkness, holding a light in front of them and backing into the darkness. so anticlimactic and boring to watch. this ghost has the power to rip someone into the darkness and do away with them immediately.. so why does it not do this to these characters that it wants out of the picture. instead it chooses to show up and grab their shoulders, or stand in the doorway or something equally as ridiculous. for one half of the movie the ghost instantly disappears when the light hits it. but in the third act suddenly for no apparent reason at all the light burns her? there was no explaining this is just suddenly happened. the characters have the opportunity to delve into their past and really develop and maybe even have an arc. instead we get generic characters with minimal motivation and a very very vague and uninteresting back story. the exposition in the film is also ridiculous. there is a scene where Rebecca walks in and just meets this lady for the first time in her life and within seconds she says something along the lines of ""stepfather not my father. my father abandoned me."" who says that? who says that within seconds of meeting someone? it's like the director has such difficulty introducing us to these characters and their back stories that he writes them with out any thought or any heart. I will not reveal much about the story but I will just say it is the most generic story-line possible. the potential was there to write an interesting mystery but instead the ball was dropped. we get a generic, mom met a girl. the girl died because of some unjust cause and now the girl is back in ghost form. nothing interesting and you see it coming from a mile away. the acting is awful. I couldn't take anybody In the movie seriously. the interactions between characters all seem so forced and unnatural.there really isn't anything about the movie that was redeemable. I went into it hoping i'd like it. but no. the only thing I could give it as a positive would be the fact that it's well made. but the budget was obviously the reason for that. if somebody gave me millions of dollars to make a movie i'm sure it would look and sound just as good.it had a pretty good concept but unfortunately the ball was dropped. nothing interesting or even slightly different was done and the film ended up being a stale and boring one.2/10",Lights Out

What is more shocking is all the reviews here giving this mediocre horror movie a gazillion stars. It's disturbing that this is what the horror film genre has come to with an almost complete disregard for building an engaging story that makes sense and involves the viewer emotionally. Even the music, strings shrieking every time the monster shows up, is the same music found in a hundred other movies. I agree with those who said that a clever visual idea first presented in the Lights Out short has been developed into an insipid mush.

192,CSHaviland,Creepy and satisfying,8,13 July 2016,"Lights Out takes some queues from Japanese-styled ghost stories, so it will be attractive to that audience. It has a strong chill-factor but a somewhat average formula, and it could have used fewer back-story explanations to make it more mysterious, especially since those elements did not feel original. Based on chill factor alone, it ranks higher than Dark Water, The Forest, Paranormal Activity, The Others, The Babadook, and The Boy, and lower than The Ring, Ju-On / The Grudge, and other Japanese-styled ghost stories, as well as any horror James Wan himself directs. Comparing it to masterpieces like The Exorcist and Poltergeist has no value. I would say its chills rank somewhat evenly with The Woman in Black and It Follows, without being as original as the latter.The ghost itself is creepy enough, but the overall movie didn't have the creative twists that we enjoyed from movies like The Boy, The Others, The Sixth Sense, and 10 Cloverfield Lane. It also didn't have the storytelling chemistry of James Wan's own Insideous or The Conjuring movies.I am a fairly difficult person to frighten. I have been seeing horror movies at the theater since the 70's, and I am usually only interested in the ones that have a supernatural or fantastical element to them. So I am very critical of them, and the only ones I collect on disc are either fun (Tremors), scary (the Grudge), or both (An American Werewolf in London). I will collect this one.Ghost stories are done to death. It is very difficult to come out with anything scary that is original. I think Lights Out could have used the guided hand of a third-party master horror writer, mostly revising the back-story revelations and using the character relationships to build suspense and mystery surrounding what is going on. Then, perhaps working up to a punch line at the end so that suddenly the back- story rushes in on the audience in one moment, with one simple revelation. It is very difficult to think of how that can be done, but other movies have done it, and the payoff is huge. I think Lights Out tried to do that a little but got confusing in the attempt.

193,xristoff93,The creepy factor was present......but nothing else,6,26 October 2016,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie and I must say it kinda let me down.The rumors had it to be one of the scariest movies of the year.The concept is original and quite catchy.The beginning leaves you no room to sit around and chatter.It throws at you right off the bat,what you will realize to be,the main event.Creepy figures in the dark,hollow eyes starring at the core of your soul and great visual effects that allows you no time to think if you like what you see or not.You immediately feel the threat and the cold shivers running down your spine.Unfortunately,the atmosphere that is so easily established- something very hard with most movies-dies out and gets replaced by many chitchat moments and what was supposed to be jump scares,I guess.The villain of the film,this evil spirit is thrown at you again and again and again and after some point you just get used to it's creepiness.And what could have been great for jump scares or spooky atmosphere of anxiety,nervousness and horror is taken apart by blatantly put hasty scenes of forced to feel fear.No time and story between the parts,just family stuff.It really disappointed me when I found out about the villain.They had so many options....A curse,an evil spirit with a grudge,a haunting,a spell by a deranged mother but no....It turns out it was the spirit of an overly attached crazy girlfriend who died during treatment in the mental hospital that the mother was submitted when she was a kid.After that,for no apparent reason,the crazed girlfriend formed a bond with the mother and returned from the grave,to forever claim her company by killing husbands and leading away the children....Yep,that is what they came up with!The saddest part is the end.After many efforts to survive the spirit's senseless carnage,the mother realized she had to kill herself in order for the spirit to lose all connection to our world,so she smiled and killed herself in front of her daughter in a very unconvincing act.To be fair,the idea was very original,the acting of some of the cast was good,the visual effects were excellent and the creature was as creepy as it could be!On the downhill,it lacked emotion in some places that to me it seemed essential,the rest of the cast was mostly ""ew"" and the story was also lacking.There was no depth in the background story,no explanations of the paranormal,no real ending.It was a bit rushed and superficial.All in all,we have a very nice start with a lot of creepiness and a lot of mystery,but instead of answers and suspense we got more creepiness and some more of the same,resulting in a kind of predictable,boring and simpleminded film.Gets a 6/10 cause it was a decent effort,but had a lot of room-and need-for improvement.Even though I expected more from this movie,it made me stay and watch until the end,if that matters for something.",Lights Out

But I have to say, while I made it through till the end, and was mildly entertained, it was just nothing special.This movie is fairly formulated...and I felt like I had seen it before. I had, but in parts of many other horror movies. From the kid being drug under the bed by his ankles, to the basement door slamming shut and locking the people in the basement, to the cops getting killed because they ignored the pleas of the people who knew about the monster, to the discovered box of files linking the monster to a dead mental institution patient, I just felt like I'd seen this all a hundred times.Marie Bello was good, as always, but the rest of the acting was just OK.

Not that it is a bad movie but i had to mobilize all my lenience to give it six. The film starts very promising but ends up with an awkward, frustrating and very much predictable ending which is enough to spoil all the good time you might have had before. To put it straight the film is not a thriller, it's a pure horror movie. And up to a certain point it manages not only to give you some good shocks of horror, but also to intrigue you watch it further in order to find out how this horror occurs, where i comes from, and how will its challenge be met. As the plot goes on it gets more and more apparent that the scriptwriter is running out of any ideas that would give you an ending as interesting as the rest of the film. The thing is that in this kind of movies it's the ending that counts! Writing down a story with great suspense, horrific happenings and an expanding mystery is the easiest of things IF you don't have to provide it with an eloquent and -given a fantasy story - realistically explainable, sense making ending. Well, that's what ""lights out"" lacks. Arbitrary and unreal endings in movies of this genre is the confess of the scriptwriter that all he cared about is to stimulate interest in his film and make you wonder with questions which he can actually not answer. Well this makes me feel fooled!",Lights Out

That's how they should have gone into this. A ghost effectively jumping out and saying 'boo' will only take you so far.The 'boos' are very effective, don't get me wrong. But they start big and right away. I thought that was strange. And there were lots of things that didn't make sense - having seen the ghost, they all seemed quite happy to, you know, go back to bed. I couldn't understand how the ghost could find Teresa Palmer at her flat. Lots of set ups not paid off - the boyfriend being kind of a douche, but then okay. Probably the most unsatisfying was the back story of the mother and the ghost, nothing was fully explained.Teresa Palmer is incredible in this - there are moments when she looks absolutely petrified and puts you right in the scene. A lovely understated performance from Maria Bello and the kid was great.Well worth it if you like well executed jumps and bumps.",Lights Out
200,weemonk,Excellent horror debut from a new director,8,25 August 2016,"I do like the horror genre and whilst plenty of horror films are made it is slim pickings when it comes to ones that are good. There's only a handful (if that) each year that stand out. 'Lights Out' thankfully is one of these.The film is as generic as a horror movie can be - Family in peril, check. Ghost/Monster/Creature terrorising, check. Jump scares/Death. Obligatory backstory reveal to said Ghost/Monster/Creature, check. End fight/battle, check - which is not a bad thing at all because most horrors work from this formula. It is how this formula is presented and what new ideas are brought which makes or breaks whether a film is good or bad and new to feature film director David F. Sandberg shows that not only has he a couple of new ideas to bring to the table but he knows how to work the formula to keep things tense and scary.Running at a short length of 81 minutes the film throws you straight in for a scare ride, introducing Diana straight away as the malevolent character which can only be seen when the lights are out. The use of this idea is simple but very effective especially in scenes where characters are turning the lights on and off. There were people sat in the cinema who were genuinely hiding away from the screen because they knew something was going to happen when the lights went out. The acting was believable and the kid who played Martin did really well at actually looking scared and run down. The story went by at just the right pace and some of the transition shots between scenes by the director were really refreshing to see as it stood out (well at least to me) rather than a traditional editing between scenes.Overall this was good film, well scripted and shot and fun for a few scares. I'll be keeping an eye out for anything else by David F. Sandberg",Lights Out
201,arsenico71,"Your typical dumb, clichéd ""horror"" film",3,13 July 2017,"Let's start with the good things: this film is short. Only 80 minutes. That is good. And that is it.Now on with what doesn't work: does it suffice to say ""everything""? No? OK, let's go into detail. The concept: another film, the umpteenth, where there is a family whose children are haunted by some evil presence that lurks in the dark and disappears when there is light. How many, just HOW many more movies based on this concept are we doomed to watch? HOW many have we already seen? Enough please!Realization of the concept: there is one aspect I just can't stress enough (apply suspension of disbelief here): supernatural phenomena are supposed not to be seen or touched. Evil spirits, ghosts, entities are supposed to be immaterial, invisible. You can ""feel"" them, see the effects or their presence, but you just cannot see THEM. Let alone touch them. Every time a movie features some evil spirit which takes shape and substance, like this one, two things happen: in the first place, they all look the same: some shadowy human figure with long messy hair, long fingers and a zombie face - enough of that, I beg you. In the second place, and that's the most relevant problem, all the tension, the mystery, the eerie feeling, the fear of the unknown instantly disappear, and it all turns into a clumsy and ridiculous puppet show.The story: thin as a sheet of paper, no character development, an unstable and slapdash backstory, and the course of events that unendlessly repeats itself: the three main characters move from a house to another back and forth, and every night lights out, creepy woman drags somebody across the room, lights on, creepy woman disappears, lights out, lights in, lights out, lights in, a lot of screaming, and finally we get to the ending.The ending: I could have placed it among the good things, barely because it exists and finally puts away all the suffering from watching this mess. But it is so utterly dumb and totally unexplained that it just stamps the letters BS on the sealing wax that closes this joke of a movie. Please spare me from mentioning the final dialogue among the three characters, the worthy conclusion of a totally pointless script.The acting: I watched this movie dubbed in Italian, so I can only judge a 50% of it, but apparently the only good acting comes from the very beautiful Teresa Palmer. The kid looks stiff and awkward, the mother is rather good, but somewhat overacted, the boyfriend, oh man... a boiled fish would have been more expressive and dynamic.So, what else to say?

There were jump scares and it was creepy. Isn't that what horror offers as drama? I'm not entirely certain which films are scarier than this one, but if you can suggest some, please let me know. I think that after horror fans see enough horror films, that some of the unnerving effect wears off. I'm not sure how The Conjuring got such high ratings and The Exorcist original only got 8 stars, but perhaps horror fans that expect more could clue the rest of in as to which films are better. Billy Burke looked younger in this film than in the Twilight films. Teresa Palmer carried the film well as the lead. I've seen plenty of horror films that were worse. So if you've seen so many horror films that the fear factor has worn off, I don't know if this film will impress you.

So if your in the light, your safe. But when the lights go out, Thats when you better hide. First the good. So i really liked the performances in the movie. They each played their role very well, whether they're a crazy mom, or a scared kid. And the parts that were supposed to be scary, were actually scary. Thats very rare for today's time cause there are not a lot of horror films that play off scary scenes. The monster was actually pretty cool to. The person playing the creature did a really good job. I just recently found out that this film is based on a short story, and i am very glad they turned that into a full feature length film. Sometimes movies that were adapted from short story's leave you saying ""that should've stayed a short story"" but not this one. But now for the flaws. Like every horror film, they have those annoying clichés and so does this one at times. The characters make stupid decisions, but i also understand that it gives the movie tension.

So each parameter can have at-most 2 points, making it a total of 10 points. Higher the number, the better the movie. Hope this makes sense, let me know your views. Appreciate it.First reviewed on broth of blogs.Lights Out ReviewMost of us know that Lights Out is based on a short film of the same name directed by David F. Sandberg. The short came out a few years back and became one of the most watched short horror films. The premise of the short was that this creature was visible only when the lights were out – in the dark. Lights Out is now a full feature (well, a little shorter than most full-features) with a complete story to who the creature/spirit/ghost/evil entity is.This review does contain spoilers.Plot and Script (P&S)The story is that this creature, Diana, was extremely light sensitive when alive and not a very good person. Apparently she could get into the heads of people and make them think whatever she wanted. She meets Sophie (played by Maria Bellow) in a mental hospital and makes her think she is her friend. There are some oldish scenes about how an experiment on Diana went wrong and she turned to poof (well that's what the images showed) like literally and died.Years later she reappears but now Sophie has a husband and a girl called Rebecca (Teresa Palmer). She is jealous, scares Rebecca and the husband leaves or so what everyone believes. Even more years later, Sophie now has a son from another marriage and is back to seeing Diana, who is scaring the living daylights out of the kid, played by Gabriel Bateman.Out of the 80 minutes, about 50 minutes of the movie is all about the story of all the characters and how it all comes together. The last 30 minutes is about killing Diana for good so the initial long bit does take some time to build.The story does have some loopholes like Diana's motives and how she moved around. If her aim was to stick on to Sophie then she was doing that, why was she harming the family? But if her objective was to have Sophie all to herself then why didn't she kill the kids – trust me she had multiple occasions. Even her moving in the darkness didn't make sense sometimes because there was light and one wonders how she got there.The first ten minutes or so are like a homage to the original, which I thought was fun. But then the killing of the second husband is totally unrelated to what happens after that and somehow disconnected the whole movie for me.Characterization and Acting (C&A)The characterization and the acting is good in most parts, especially the kid, Gabriel Bateman. He really pulled it off. Teresa Palmer was good too, though sometimes she looked like she was lost, like Kirsten Stwart who has that look all the time.One thing I really liked was the resourcefulness of the characters. They were no throwaway characters who die because they were dumb. These characters had a plan and improvised when the plan didn't work. Teresa Palmer's boyfriend character, played by Alexander DiPersia was not the throwaway love interest like in other horror movies, he actually helped and did useful things in the movie.The creature itself was a letdown for me. The original was so much spookier and unnerving. This Diana was more James Wan kind of ghost – old and moved with a crackle.Sounds and Effects (S&E)Sounds and effects were just OK, nothing spectacular.Cinematography and Visuals (C&V)The visuals were good, the light and the darkness were used well to explain the story and worked in most parts.Direction and Overall (D&O)I think David Sandberg did a decent job considering the popularity of the short and the direction was good. I think the letdown was the script and the plot-holes itself which doesn't make it a 'great' horror flick.So here are my scores:Plot and Script (P&S)- 1Characterization and Acting (C&A) – 1.5Sounds and Effects (S&E) – 1Cinematography and Visuals (C&V) – 1.5Direction and Overall (D &O) – 1.5Overall score – 6.5Considering the junk that is out there in the horror genre, I suggest watching it once at-least🙂Let me know what you think of the scoring and the review.

206,alexanderstephencraig,Basic horror film with some added fire,7,31 July 2016,"I don't think this really has spoilers exactly but I'm putting up the warning just in case. So I can't hold my opinion down too much as I constantly kept yelling at some ten year-olds who distracted me from this film quite a bit. However from what I took it wasn't bad. Keeping this short and simple. The acting; I loved, absolutely. When characters actually gasp or jump at things that characters in normal movies don't, just shows that the actors and writers wanted the characters to feel real which made the film feel more real. The film editing, color, transitioning, just everything was good. The one thing I wasn't crazy about was the story. Truthfully most horror films have so many of the same clichés. This film had the scratching on wood, door handle being shaken violently, fear of the dark, fear of under the bed, slitting up, walking backwards into an unseen darkness, and so forth. I've just seen too many horror movies to find this one scary personally.Along with the story I did try and figure out who would die and things of that nature and I was wrong which I liked. Also that people did die considering it's a trend for pg-13 films recently. It's not that people need to die for a film to be good but it adds that intensity and nervousness that the characters on screen are actually in some amount of danger. But again the film was good. For most people I would imagine it's scary. My wife is the biggest chicken I know and she was certainly scared. The story was kind of basic in my opinion but good acting glues a film together. I would say this is worth the ticket price. DON'T watch the trailer first if you haven't already. Always makes the movie better.",Lights Out
207,regexfan,"Hey, Diana, I slept with the lights OFF",2,18 May 2017,"Bad acting, especially the child actor. Man, that kid really can't act. And then the grown adult main character who acts like a 16 year old angsty teenager. The silly plot. Everything that is good in the movie is already in the trailer. So watching the trailer is enough. Lights on, lights off, and then lights on again and off again. That's about all there is to this movie. If you know the bad supernatural entity whatsoever can easily turn off your power source as it likes, the logical thing to do is to have all kinds of lights (batteries and whatnot) ready at all times. Any normal person would think of that. But no, you keep relying on the house's electricity and act surprised when the main power source is cut off. Sorry, this didn't work for me.

209,snarkyphilo,"Lights Out, Fun but Not Great.",5,24 July 2016,"This is an American Horror film written by Eric Heisserer about a family haunted by a supernatural being. The film was based on the original 2013 short film of the same name created by the director and pretty much took the same premise from the short and applied it to a feature length running time.So how does Sandberg's debut stack up? The cinematography was decent, with some great little transitions between shots and scenes here and there, and the lighting, with some particularly clever attention to detail with shadows to highlight the tension and sinisterisim of the darkness (even if it wasn't the big baddie) was particularly clever.The acting gets a bit of a nod for a few, such as Gabriel Bateman as Martin who pulled off what he could for his character with his child stoicism and terrified out of his little gourd combo without being annoying. And there was also Maria Bello as Sophie, who did a decent job of coming across as pitiable and mildly creepy at the same time.Then of course there is the strongest element of the film, the scare.Practically every 5 minutes there was a jump-scare (escalating in the end), and unlike many other movies or television shows out there, they weren't all predominantly fake-outs. In fact, there was perhaps only one fake-out out in the entire film.Each scare fulfilled on its promise of something outright scary or occasionally mildly creepy. It was its complete and utter focus on jump scare and lighting combination that carried the film, and made it surprisingly fun to watch.This movie does unfortunately have a bushel of weak points that stick out regardless of the fun experience, weak points that popular sites like Rotten Tomatoes dubs as strong attributes: The Characters and the Story.First are the characters: This is not exactly a strong pool of dynamic personalities. Most of the small pool of characters isn't given enough of an identity, interaction or development in this film that you actually forget the name of most of them from time to time.They rely on a few handful of moments in the film that could be attributed to the action or mood of a particular scene as needed, such as the boyfriend's entertaining confrontation with the creature, the opening scene with minor characters Ester (Lotta Losten, who was from the original short) flicking the light switch, and Paul (Billy Burke) trying (and failing) to not be killed, and Martin's apropos responses to Diane.Speaking of Diane, she was creepy (when not under a blue light) and her movements were just the right amount tension building, but the antagonist suffers as a weak point as well as her backstory was half-arsed, a little implausible in parts even for a horror film, and the connection between her and Sophie was not given enough development. The story itself was of course the other major weak point.There was no overarching mystery or any other narrative hook to keep you gripped, with everything about the creature was summed up early on and floating undeveloped relationships such as the mother and daughter falling out never being expanded upon, and there was hardly enough chances for breath in the film for the necessary character developments.When there were attempts at the actual story it read like the amateur writing found in the dollar digital bin at your local Amazon site.What could have helped the story was a better written history between Sophie and Diane. In fact, it might have gone stronger if Diane was actually a mental projection of Sophie's depression, or perhaps something she created to deal with the death of her friend, or a combination of both. The possibility to utilize this example was there in the vaguely explained connection between them.You can tell the film's origins from its short counterpart, as the elements that worked here were what made the short strong, and pretty much was the entirety of the short. But unfortunately, the attempt to translate the short into a feature, you do need a decent combination of story and characters outside of the scare element.Though this could be read as utilizing the formula of the slasher film, which in the case of those films was very much about the present experience of the audience, appealing to the squirm, blood thirst, and gross-out with a lack of much story and purposeful blank slate characters to better facilitate the audience overlaying themselves into the experience.In this case, if you replace the element of ""Slasher"" with jump scare, you would have something very similar, though whether this was the purpose of the film's construction it's hard to say.Overall this was a movie that you watch in the dark with your friends once or twice and enjoy it for the scare and not much else.",Lights Out
210,JackCowart34,"If you're a horror fan, Lights Out is a must watch.",8,13 October 2020,"In terms of acting, Teresa Palmer was the standout in this movie acting as the older sister to a young boy (Gabriel Bateman, who was equally great) plagued by his mother's demons. The fact that the entity had to avoid light added another layer of complexity, as the constant darkness created continuing paranoia throughout the movie. It was nice they were able to pack plenty of good, quality scares into such a short runtime. Another aspect of the movie that stood out to me was the fantastic sound design. Everything from Diana's voice, to the scratching on the floor sounded as creepy as possible. I'm not always a fan of backstories for villains, but in this case the backstory helped elevate Diana's character by giving her more depth. David Sandberg also did a great job of creating tension between family members to isolate them during some of the most chilling points of the movie. To me he's proved to be one of the best horror directors in the business after coming out with two stellar horror films within the span of a few years. What really made this movie stand above most other horror movies was the family dynamic. It was one of the more accurate depictions of mental illness and a family struggling to cope with it that I've seen in a while.",Lights Out
211,CraigsCritique,Shining a Positive Light on Horror,8,7 September 2016,"Horror is at it's best when it's kept simple and the premise of Lights Out that when the lights are on you are safe and when the lights are off you are in serious trouble is as simple as it gets.We are principally introduced to a family that have in the past been troubled by some sort of 'presence' that makes itself known when darkness falls or as was just mentioned when the lights are off. Maria Bello and Teresa Palmer play the two main characters who are the mother and daughter of the family in question with this apparent apparition having some sort of historical link...wait I'll stop there.In terms of the actual performance of the cast Teresa Palmer is pretty good in what is really the lead role and Maria Bello is generally satisfactory as the lead support, I do however have a bit of a problem with the younger brother of Teresa Palmer's character in the film played here by Gabriel Bateman, I do hate to criticize young actors performances but having seen some truly fantastic and wonderful performances by young actors/actresses this year in the likes of Room and The BFG in my opinion you suddenly do notice a performance that is lacking and to be harsh feels like a performance of a kid who is straight out of acting school, it is hard for a child actor in a horror film I will say that as an added caveat, there's also interesting support by Alexander DiPersia who plays the boyfriend of Teresa Palmer's character and given what this role usually ends up being in a horror film his role and performance was actually very refreshing to see.There's absolutely no doubt that Lights Out suffers from a few predictable horror film tropes particularly in the first act of the film, but there is certainly a playful feeling about it, almost as though this is intended for the viewer to get them comfortable to a certain degree, I mean there's a couple of scenes from the opening sequence in the film where the location is a mannequin factory, yes that's right a mannequin factory, hello cliché city, also there is a scene where a character who works there flicks a light off sees a figure, flicks the light on and the figure disappears and then continues at least six or seven times in doing this act therefore teasing the audience to the edge of the seats and almost their limits, fun but frightening one could say so therefore it is always going to conjure up the feeling that Scream gave us twenty years ago...wow twenty years ago, having said that about the first act the final act of the film is one hell of a damn pulsating and adrenaline pumping experience and therefore I would quite confidently say one of the best I've seen not just in a recent horror film but maybe in horror films in general.A horror film can live or die by for lack of a better phrase 'how it sounds' and on that level Lights Out sounds bloody fantastic.So Lights Out sounds great, looks great, moves along at a swift pace, features one hell of an frighteningly entertaining final act and is tinged with some rather 'fun' frights to make it overall a rather satisfying cinematic watch for the horror film fan.",Lights Out
212,nickijjohnson,impressive fx make for freaky film,8,26 July 2016,"Finally a supernatural film worth watching and worth making it to theaters. For starters I'll say I am a horror fan even though Supernatural films typically bore me with their usual dark spirit trapped in our world cause of unfinished business crap. Anyway having said that, this is another ghost unwilling to cross over tale. I'll assume you know the summary so I will say I did think the backstory behind Diana was a little lame. The condition she had was known as porphyria or the ""vampire disease"" where those who suffer from it receive skin blisters from UV light. Which begs the question why would doctors want to expose her to more light to ""cure"" her? It's not like in Darkness Falls where the kid was afraid of the dark so the therapist said let's put him in the dark so he'll get over it. Her condition was physical not mental. Though I did think it was a nice touch as to why she doesn't like the light. It's never explained why Diana becomes obsessed with their mother or why for that matter if she was a child when she died why does she appear as a woman now? Also why does their mother need to be off her meds for Diana to be there it makes her seem schizophrenic which she is not since her kids see Diana too so that was a bit off. But really you can't deny the impressive effects of this film. I've never seen anything like it and I have to admit when I got home the first thing I did was turn on the lights. I think it's the best horror movie I've seen in quite some time especially out of the ones actually making it to theaters like The boy and The Forest to name a couple which were both incredibly boring with crap story lines so although lights out had some story flaws it had some undeniably scary moments that I very much so appreciated. I don't scare easy but this creeped me out. Also obviously if you've seen Darkness Falls and liked it you'll like this.",Lights Out

When they start walking backwards you just know that someone is going to suddenly appear behind them. Ho-hum.What sets Lights Out apart is that you know things like these are going to happen, and it still scares the life out of you. And scare you way more than anything else you've seen lately. You might not think a movie built around a concept as simple as our natural fear of the dark could be so frightening, but this one is. (How frightening, you ask? Normally when I sit at my desk and write on my Mac I like to have the lights off. Not tonight - all the lights in this room are burning bright!)That said, it isn't just mirrors and lights that make this film such an intense experience - it's the characters. Anyone who has sat through a slasher film learns quickly that if you don't care about the characters, you don't really care if they get cut to pieces. In fact more than once you've probably rooted for them to die – the stupid jock, the cheating girlfriend, the snooty preppie. They're cardboard characters and there's no love lost when they finally bite the dust; there's no investment.That is definitely not the case in Lights Out. These characters are genuine, flesh-and-blood people; people you've probably met at some point in your life. At its core, this is the story of a troubled family that is one step away from coming apart at the seams. In that regard it reminds me of Stephen King's The Shining (i.e. the novel, not the Kubrick film.) Both works center on families plagued by the all-too-real problems that touch all of us in one way or another during our lives. In King's novel it was alcoholism, while in Lights Out it's mental illness.That's another thing that elevates this film above the rest. Thematically, there's a lot going on underneath the surface: guilt, unresolved trauma, selfishness, alienation, using people to hurt others, poor communication, the stigma of mental illness. This is what really gets under your skin, and all the elements come together in a hurricane of fear in the final act. To be sure, the film is not perfect. After a promising first reel, the story struggles a bit to find its footing. The editing seems a bit jerky; I got the feeling there were scenes left on the cutting room floor that would've made the narrative flow better. That's why, as much as I enjoyed the movie, I settled on a 7/10 rating. Even so, these flaws are forgotten once the film really gets moving.Put another way, Lights Out is like a freight train. It starts off a bit slow, gradually picks up momentum, and then suddenly it's barreling away at full speed. Before you know it, you're holding on for dear life; you know what's up ahead at that next bend in the tracks, but you're powerless to stop it. And worst of all, it's coming at you so darn FAST.This was the first time in a long time that I have been genuinely scared by a horror film. Last year's It Follows was a creepy good time, but its scares were, well, more of a creeping terror. If that film was a firecracker, Lights Out is an M80, just waiting for you to light the fuse. Even if you think you've seen it all when it comes to horror, you'll want to see this one.",Lights Out
214,Fiurilli,"Interesting concept, terrible execution.",4,8 August 2016,"'Lights Out' is the feature length adaptation of a similar short film created by David F. Sandberg starring Maria Bello, Alexander DiPersia, Teresa Palmer and child-actor Gabriel Bateman. In this film we follow a disjointed family that is being haunted by an evil being. At it's core 'Lights Out' is not a very unique movie as more often than not the recent horror movies feature a monster haunting a family. The movie does however use an interesting concept for the implementation of the monster. When the lights are on the being is powerless, however in the dark it can move around and do whatever is necessary to torment the family. This concept is certainly put to good use as it does feature some interesting scenes, sometimes though it seemed as if the creators forget about it as often times certain events happen that could not have happened since all the lights were on. The concept could've have provided for a very good psychological horror movie, though sadly almost all of the scares are nothing but jump-scares. These jump- scares are for the most part fairly well executed however, though when you've seen a few they all kind of look alike.What the movie does not do well however is the dialogue as almost all conversations feel unnatural. Sometimes characters will make weird decisions that are only there to setup a scare later in the movie. The different subplots and the main story itself is not all that interesting and when the movie reaches it's ending point it is very predictable what is going to happen. I must commend the movie for at least trying though as most horror movies recently tend to forget an accompanying story altogether.Another aspect of the movie that is not that great is the acting. Not one actor portrayed their character in a convincing manner. Maria Bello's performance as the crazy mother was downright laughable, Teresa Palmer's character often spoke as if she was developing a sore throat and the child actor Gabriel Batemen never really seemed honestly scared. Had the acting and dialogue been a little bit better 'Lights Out' would've been a pretty decent horror movie. As of right now however it is a sub-par horror movie and a downright terrible movie on it's own.My rating: 4/10",Lights Out
215,Brandon_Walker_Robinson,Short and sweet,6,21 July 2016,"By horror movie's standards, I think that's the best way to sum up my experience with this film.They really shaved any corners that were needed to beef up the time. Keep in mind that doesn't just make it an extended version of the short; there was an actual story in this, and I think that's what made this movie good. Compared to my favorite PG-13 horror film The Ring, they try to establish a connection between the main characters and the mystery at bay, and for the most part it works very well to mold a relationship that we have with the characters and they have with each other. Though if I were to compare it to The Ring, it doesn't touch it for one big reason, but I won't get into it for spoiler reasons.It's funny though that most horror movies have their scary parts happen when it's at night or darker... and obviously this movie is the closest to not being an exception that you can get. As you know the one- trick pony that this movie relies on for scare tactics. It is not always jump scares, but they are pretty effective nonetheless. They almost become a bit redundant up until one seemingly very long and drawn out scene where ""build-up"" is the scare name. This is by far the best scene of the film, as it is about 25 minutes of pure intensity. Before you know it, just when you might feel the movie is only halfway over, it finds a way toward a conclusion, and gets you out of that theater. I think in this case less was more, and it ended at the right time. If they want to do more with it, they can save it for a sequel (though I wouldn't really advocate for one).I don't normally think we have to qualify actors in horror movies for Oscar awards, but I didn't think the child actor was very good... I don't mean with being scared, I mean when speaking in general. It looked like he was acting, basically. I liked the main actress though (Teresa Palmer). Looks like a pretty version of Kristen Stewart, but seems to limit her range to that stoic kind of low. It seemed to work for this flick. I'll have to see her in more films. At the very least, I cared about them. They all seemed like ""smart"" characters too, not doing too many stupid things where you have to talk to the screen (outside of the occasional ""Why are you going TOWARD the creepy noise??"" instances).This movie is swimming pretty around 80% on RT for a reason: the critics liked it more than they didn't. It was a fun concept, and as I said it took the original short and maintained the brevity for the feature film as well. It's by no means of the scariest movies I have seen, nor will it make me be afraid to turn off my lights at night either. Also, if anything this movie's evil spirit really wanted to spread a message about going green! :p Anyway, probably more of a rental than shelling out your hard-earned money for, because you're not missing out on anything that you haven't seen from a horror film before, other than doing it right and often during its own run time. Don't expect anything after the credits either. Last thing to mention: for a PG-13 movie, it was able to get away with a couple of graphic moments. Nothing too unsettling, but I was surprised all the same.",Lights Out
216,austinkunkle,Definitely a great reason to keep the lights on,10,14 November 2016,"Lights out is possibly the scariest movie of 2016. This movie was given everything new to scare people,and for a person who enjoys horror movies actually got pretty jumped. Lights out is simply about a girl who doesn't like to be in the light. She shows up in the dark,but vanishes in the light. So simple,yet it's really creative the way the filmmakers made this movie. I thought it was going to be just one of those horror movies of where it would take them a long time to get to the main point,but it turns out that it does get to the main point. Even though it was a short horror film,it was still worth my time,and any movie that is made by James Wan is quite possibly a horrifying masterpiece. This is possibly James Wan's best horror film,and I actually hope they don't make a sequel. If they do,however,then the filmmakers will know not to make something overused and cheesy.

Still, nobody will call it the best horror movie of the year, and that's OK.This movie starts off quickly and I liked that very much. You immediately know what is the premise, but solid directing and believable performances keep the suspense and fear is indeed lurking around every corner.Stand out performance is definitely Maria Bello, who plays mother with mental issues. While I have to say that Gabriel Bateman is solid as a main child actor in the movie, script sometimes gives him too much to handle for a kid that age and he is a little bleak if you compare him with Madison Wolfe from this years The Conjuring 2. Still, not bad. Yes, as it often happens, characters do make some stupid decisions along the way which is just irritating, but not enough to ruin the ride. I like how the movie ended, nothing too cliché and short run time (1h 20min) is something that definitely works.Overall, I would recommend it to anyone that appreciates horrors.",Lights Out

He calls in for his stepsister to help regain their mother's sanity.

The creators realized that the premise would run out of ideas very quickly, so they decided to shoehorn every jumpscare they can. Luckily, it worked well.However, there are so many negative aspects to pick off. The common horror trope characters, the weak script, the actors' measly performances, and weird pacing makes the movie seems a bit stiff.If you're looking for jumpscares and general creepiness, this might be a good movie for you.

225,ozyhmandias792,Almost Total Darkness,4,13 December 2016,"The adequate adjective to describe ""Lights Out"" is ""incomplete"". The plot totally lacks continuity and coherence : my first point is that there is no background regarding the main characters; the viewers are not clearly told about the occupation or the past of the female protagonist, which is surely odd. Then, more importantly, the actors are not actually convincing in any of the scenes; in spite of the countless moments of fake tension, there are no scenes which can be truly considered dramatic or thrilling. But I'll be honest : there are two little bright spots. One : I appreciated the technique involving the ultraviolet light (some horror directors might use it more proficiently in the future; it really manages to create remarkable effects). Two : the ""evil presence"" is never fully showed. I generally consider this to be a positive point in the horror genre because this expedient arises the tension and meanwhile leaves an open space for an eventual sequel (which I hope, in this case, does not come).",Lights Out

229,IMDbUser1002,"Very creepy, really good movie",7,20 December 2016,"Lights Out is a movie that I was very urged to watch, due to all the glowing reviews, and since it looked very scary. I was interested since James Wan (the producer) directed/produced lots of other scary movies that I REALLY liked. I was expecting a jumpy, creepy & intense movie, and that is what Lights Out is. Diana (the antagonist) is definitely a unique and good idea, and sort of hard to explain. The movie revolves around a few people who all start noticing Diana in their lives, although she isn't always aggressive, her presence is terrifying. Diana is a figure who cannot physically exist in the presence of light, her physical form ceases to be present as soon as it is exposed to light. We learn that she has a long backstory related to a skin disorder that caused hyper-sensitivity to light exposure. Although it's hard to say whether Diana is a ghost, a demon, or something different, she is not friendly. This movie was definitely scary, Diana can exist anywhere where there is darkness, so every shadow could pose a fatal threat. This presence of danger leaves the movie very intense throughout. There are a lot of jump scares, and many of them really do make you jump. As well as Diana's appearance is very creepy, since she is almost always merely a silhouette in the darkness. I really did like this movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes horror movies, or likes to be scared in general. This is definitely worth watching. I rate 8/10.",Lights Out

233,JustALittleBitRandom,Too many scenes not spent with the threat makes it even less scary than it already is!,4,22 August 2016,"A family is haunted by a ""terrifying"" figure that only appears when all the light's go out.Notice the word terrifying in the plot summary for this review. Notice how it is in speech marks. Notice how it gives a sense that once again not even I of all people found this horror movie scary. And I didn't, and I don't think anybody in the screening room did either. In total I think there are about two jump scares which are only just effective are barely successful and the reason none of the intended scares are scary is because they are all so predictable and you can see them coming from a mile off. The main threat in the film doesn't actually seem to be very scary and all I could think of when it came on screen was that it looked like a female version of Gollum just with a less extreme hunchback... It's not scary and the same can be said for the film itself. The acting in the film is good and adds a bit of realism to what is a very unrealistic/ dodgy film. One reason that the film isn't majorly scary is the fact that the majority of it is spent away from the scenes of horror and in other places trying to figure out what the actual threat is, where it came from and how to get rid of it, yes some of these scenes are slightly interesting but they go on for too long and just make the creature that is haunting even less scary than it already was. So in the 20 minutes spent in the dark with this threat there are only about two jump scares which are slightly scary despite still being predictable. It just makes it more of a Godsend that it's a short film at 81 minutes. At least it's not as bad ,to the point where it's almost not even laughably bad, and over two hours like this years earlier horror release The Conjuring 2.It's not scary and the threat is like a female version of Gollum with less of a hunchback and the majority of the film is spent in a non-threatening/ safe environment.

There is no plot whatsoever, I was just waiting to see the whole film for some action to actually start rolling, but all I got was some lame jump scares every 15 minutes or so. Good thrillers, and even good movies in general, are supposed to follow a certain protocol; beginning is supposed to introduce us to the characters, build up the tension, get them in the setting. Around 25 minutes or so, the action is supposed to start rolling and not end until the final 15 minutes or so of the film. This films follows no structure whatsoever.

Problem is the entire film premise is shown and told in the first 5 minutes. Then it just goes on in the same way.That could have worked out anyway, but the problem is the unsympathetic characters. 2016 apparently was the year of the feminist casting. Like Ouija Board 2, this is also a film with 2 women as headliners.Nothing wrong with that except when you make the younger female cast a shrieking b*tch who speaks with the worst rendition of vocal fry I've ever heard. The tone is set when she kicks her ""boyfriend"" of 8 months out after sex, even if he wants to stay the night. Apparently she does that every night. Throughout the movie she is condescending, rude and arrogant, but hey, You Go Girl! I am a single woman who don't need no man! Or something.The other female lead is a crazy woman who takes psychiatric drugs and is treated for juvenile depression. How common are children with depression, outside mistreatment or abuse? Not very, perhaps the script was co-written by the American pediatric psychiatrists association.2016 will remain in my memory as the year of aggressive, negative feminism in films.

In the interest of almost full disclosure - I am a big fan of Teresa Palmer. I think she is a beauty and has the chops to flesh out most roles (including I am Number 4). Having said that, there is not very much for her to do in this film because the script is SO useless. Not only that, the story has humongous holes - the size that you could fall through whole! The kid brother came off stiff and poorly directed and soon, the only things holding the movie together were the strong Teresa P and Maria Bello. The cast was like a bunch of silly teenagers who didn't pack the tents for a camping trip. The bright spots, apart from the two women, includes the boyfriend. Not because he is an amazing actor, but because he brought the much needed humour into the stupidity of the scenes. Apart from the poor script and plot, the story also doesn't stand up to scrutiny. They have tried to give it a rings-esque back story but failed miserably.

I think it did a decent job of accomplishing what it went after. My complaints were that it was too short, barely an hour and 15 min. They did a good job that they did not stretch it out too think but at the same time they could have invested more time in the script and made it even better and added more to it coz it seemed to end abruptly.

After watching Conjuring 2, I had a lot of expectations with his new flick Lights Out. Despite the fact, he was just a producer of this movie I was expecting it scary and creepy. But all my expectations were flushed into the gutter after watching this 1 Hour 11 mins bogus drama. The film was completely predictable from the beginning to its end. There are no other extra horror material in the movie than we saw in its trailers. Watching this movie is same as watching an hour long horror drama series on TV. The plot was incomplete in many ways and there were no relations between the sequences in the film. The only good part in the movie was out-standing acting of the cast and the background score. This film could be better if it had any flashback sequence of the story. Nevertheless I would rate it 5 because of excellent performance of the cast and background music.",Lights Out

But it's increasingly obvious it's jsut agendas. Sometimes they get it right, but sometimes they give high scores to films that are just mediocre or flat-out crap while they make promising or even solid films out to me low-quality. If this were a feminist propaganda film, it would've been a 9 or a ten.Regardless, let's not go there.
I came in with low expectations but I've been left pleasantly surprised. This is a good,solid horror film. In many ways it feels like of the great supernatural episodes back in the day when Supernatural used to be good and hadn't jumped the shark. As there aren't a whole lot of good horror movies, I could safely say this could work its way into my top 10, offhand.",Lights Out

250,productionslykos,A simple yet moderately weighty story that's concept demonstrates the continuous creativity the horror genre contributes,8,8 June 2020,"A simple yet moderately weighty story that's concept demonstrates the continuous creativity the horror genre contributes. The cinematography is nothing special, however David Sandberg's clever use of lighting sprinkles scenes with an allurement that appetizes shots. Despite various jump scares feeling cheap in their execution, several were reasonably creative, adapting the already unique concept into a fresh fright for the viewer. Although the placement of characters such as Sophie was clumsily juggled from scene to scene, most characters were considerately fleshed out and gave valid justifications to serve not just the plot but their own and others story archs. And I appreciated the plots focus wasn't purely of the 'monster' needing to be defeated but on character's quarrels, interactions based on these quarrels and growth learnt from these quarrels which in all expanded the movie beyond a typical horror flick. Bret however, felt substantially shoehorned in at times and although provided support for Rebecca, possibly could of been written out. Acting on all parts wasn't horrible nor was the dialogue thrown from character to character but rarely did this thieve from the experience. Diana, along with her backstory, was interesting yet confusing at times as beyond light being her biggest weakness, her abilities were hardly discussed, therefore giving her an almost limitless use of her powers. As well as this, throughout the movie it felt as though there was a constant need to amplify minuscule happenings and although being a horror, it was overused and fatigued further important moments. The finale was unexpected which granted a more enjoyable ending to what could of been a typical bland horror finish. Overall, both an amazing movie for Sandberg's first flick and an appealing watch for horror fans looking for a unique new concept to immerse themselves in.",Lights Out

The monster has a set of rules, but never follows them.The movie is also riddled with derivative stuff that will make you cringe. It has zero originality and copied everything that came before but in a worst way.I give it 3 stars because the editing is good and the movie was able to screen in the projector at the theater.

252,robert-b-norby,Worth the watch!,8,30 July 2016,"This movie will get your pulse up fast, revealing the ""horror"" very early on. Interestingly enough, it keeps that pulse up throughout the movie despite of this. The concept of something that can only appear and be seen if it's dark (and with a somewhat supernatural ability to destroy light bulbs) is bound to lead to a jump scare or ten whenever it appears. Towards the end you've almost gotten so used to it that the scare effect wears off a bit, and is one of two reason I don't rank this a 10. But thanks to a good story and good actors, the movie still holds its ground to the very end.The characters are really good, well written and performed, and with a young boy that if not before, totally kick started his future acting career with this movie. Who doesn't love a young prodigy? The plot has some weight and emotion to it, and with a solid ending that wraps things up in a much more satisfying way than most similar movies.The other small drawback with this movie for me was mostly because of slightly unrealistic behavior from our main characters, occasionally. Like when miss heels from Jurrasic World is worried that when she releases T-Rex it won't be able to follow her if she runs. So, she waits for it to come close, walks for a bit, then runs. Those kinds of unrealistic behaviors. But I've seen much worse, and this movie doesn't take the ""unrealistic"" very far, or often, so I suggest you just put this on and roll with it!All in all you get everything you want from a jump scare movie with Lights Out, with a good plot and good actors that deliver, and a scare factor we all can relate to.

Nothing remarkable, but the I could say a bit above average. The idea and concept is good and interesting, a demon that can come out only in the dark. Sadly they didn't do that great job with it.The problem is, that it's just 80 minutes of jump-scares: the plot is shallow and predictable - explaining the backstory by a character in a dialog to another character is lame (why not make some cool flashback? Hospitals can be creepy).Overall it's okay, but maybe a bit boring - there was no tension and excitement in-between, just jump-scares to jump-scares, like so many movies before this, which I got tired of after the first twenty minutes. The constant squeaking and scratching got actually quite annoying too at some point.In short: it isn't creepy and scary, it's got few scenes that will make you boggle, but that's it.

Maria Bello as the ""unwell"" mother is also solid. The casting is particularly good because Palmer and Bello look like they could be related, which adds another layer of realism to the film.Like all good horror movies, it doesn't take itself too seriously - there's some light relief in there at the right moments.I find horror films much scarier if the characters do what I would do, and in Lights Out, they do exactly that. At the beginning Paul (Billy Burke) gets into trouble. What would I do? Run for the light and some kind of weapon. That's exactly what he does! Yeah, it doesn't help him in the end, but the fact that he acted believably makes the film so much more immersive.In terms of jump scares, the filmmakers use them but don't abuse them.

257,kk-carrie,Fast and furious horror.,6,12 September 2016,"I jumped and screamed throughout the movies even though I know what to expect at every turn. James Wan didn't waste a lot of time introducing the sweet family to create moods. Right into the first 15 minutes, someone died because he refused to listen to his staff's warning. It is from James Wan so I expect something better, like The Conjuring 1. I shouldn't compare both of the movies so I will try to stick my mind on the straight rational of looking to Lights Out.Lights Out itself is like Mcdonald chicken, it gives you exactly what you want on the plate in express; you want horror, boom give you darkness, you want to scream, boom give you long skinny messy hair depressed chicken; you want scarier, no explanation of the scary chick's background and no showing of her face. If you prefer express horror, then this should be for you. But if you like some mysteries that build the mood then this is too rough for your sensitive taste. Since everything is presented in express way, superficiality is inevitable. The boyfriend, the siblings binding moments, the mother- kids moments and the pathetic police officers are few things which have the potential to be develop into something meaningful, but they were brushed off on the surface, resulting in blandness which depends on jumpscares to earn points. James Wan, please don't fall into the Hollywood typical scary movies production, where gory scenes and bloody actions are the center attraction of the movies. There are some plot holes that I am lazy to analyse and sure others won't let it go. I would really like to give 7 for Lights Out but James Wan, you are better than this.

262,Alex-Siddhi,"A chilling short film, extended to a chilling feature.",7,15 October 2016,"A truly terrifying concept, so simple yet original and chilling, Lights Out takes us on a ride that confronts one of our most basic fears; fear of the dark, and isolation in the dark is even more scary.I watched the original short and simple horror film of Lights Out directed by David F. Sandberg in the cinema at The Phoenix Cinema's 2015 Frightarama film festival, it was opening for one of the features and the response from the crowd was ground breaking. And now deservedly so, the director has gone on to make this short film into a feature under the wing of Film Director & Producer James Wan and many more.I really enjoyed this film because like the concept, the film itself was simple, it did not over complicate things, the short film had no background, just a spooky creature that emerges in the darkness, and in the feature, to extend the plot and our curiosity some light is shown on to the background of 'Diana' so to speak but it doesn't over complicate things and it is dealt with and wrapped up quite quickly.I liked the characters in this film, they had layers and were not shallow or generic, they were interesting and not loathable. Rebecca was a young fierce woman with her own style, caring after her brother Martin who is also quite fierce for his age, although rightfully scared by the creature learns to stick with his sister and help. The boyfriend Bret was a nice character, who did not breach, invade or overstep as we have usually seen time and time before, and the conflicted mother Sophie was not a generic recluse that movies often tend to make out traumatised individuals to be, she was a sincere woman confused yet caring caught up in chaos.The methods used in the movie were true to the original concept of the fear of the dark and they were exposed plenty in a great way, like with the UV to counteract the ability of the creature and neon signs flashing outside changing the positions and situations going on in the interior of Rebecca's home.The one thing I would have done differently in this film was not have Diana talking throughout the film, not showing emotion and certainly not aggressively slamming doors around the house, this makes her existence much more compatible and human and therefore less scary and mysterious, it takes away the effect of her unsettling presence.But the thing that truly makes this film and its idea great will always be the concept, in order for a horror film to be scary, we need to be convinced by what we should be afraid of and why we are afraid, it could be clowns, large never-ending mazes, demons, or just simply the dark, but the fear of the dark is because of what is in it, and in the film, you are led to believe you are not safe in it because of the creature that lurks there too and its inevitable arrival. But the intentions of such a thing I do believe should never be illuminated, at any time of day or night.I give this bone chilling dark horror a 7 out of 10",Lights Out

Usually I go into PG-13 horror films with low expectations, which allowed me to enjoy the movie for what it is: a bunch of jump scares. The short film this movie was based off was simple, and effectively scary. By adding so much to the concept, it threw off the pacing. This film tried to be more than what is was. It tried to explore a deeper meaning, touching on mental illness and family problems (think The Babadook but not nearly as good), but it only managed to scratch the surface in a pretty shallow and uninteresting way. This was only accentuated by sub-par acting from quite a bit of the cast.However, the film succeeded in making Diana frightening. By not ever showing her real form for much time outside of the shadows, she managed to be pretty horrifying. Definitely a creature to inspire nightmares when you turn out the lights.Overall it was fun to go see in a theater filled with jumpy teenagers, but not really worth a second watch.",Lights Out

The opening scene was excellent, and about a quarter of the way through I thought this was going to be an excellent movie with well placed drama elements. However, once I reached the halfway point the premise started to become gimmicky, and failed to deliver scares.That being said, the film does have a pretty neat premise that is thoroughly explained through backstory, which is quite rare for a horror film. Usually, horror backstories are under elaborated on, which makes me feel unsatisfied, even if more perplexed. However, this did not make the movie scary, but it did make the movie feel more high quality.I blame the camera work for the reason why the film fell flat. There aren't many creative shots at all, it's pretty bland. There's even one super cheap jumpscare that just annoyed me.

267,filmicsite,Light Out Review: Scarefest of Mental Illness,7,22 July 2016,"Lights out Directed by David Sandberg is a feature length adaption (or extended version) of a short movie directed by the same man in 2013. Produced by the the one who is the big name in horror industry right now, James Wan. It is easy to identify his influence over the movie, with the use of lighting and slow tension done just like Wan would have done Himself. But The Director cannot reach the boundaries pushed by James Wan with Conjuring and its even better sequel released earlier .That in no way means that the movie is bad. The movie has a couple of brilliant moments when the movie scratches that line of greatness that every horror movie aspires to cross. But if you want to be blown away by the movie, you will be underwhelmed. As the movie is like every other psychological horror movie and gives out nothing new and groundbreaking like The Witch did earlier this year.Lights Out Follows a family in turmoil, they are going through difficult phase, with the mother having continuous bout of depression and after the death of the father, Martin (Younger Son played by Gabriel Bateman) soon finds out that his Mother-Sophie- is not good mentally and she is talking with someone in the shadows. Meanwhile Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) the elder daughter of Sophie (Played by Maria Bello) from his first husband (Who left them) finds out about Sophie's extent of illness and unearths some dark past of his mother. OH and yeah, the father was killed by a monster who lurks in he dark, who cannot enter areas which are lighted and who is also the one responsible for many things.The interesting thing about the movie thus is what i proved above, the monster or the women is a part of the movie, but if you remove the monster you will still have a decent Drama, tackling family issues, Mental Illness and Medical Depression. In an Interview with Screen Junkies last night the cast of Lights out was asked, which movie would 'lights out' would come close to, each cast member answered the same thing- The Babadook. Yes it is blatantly obvious that the Director has tried to make another Babadook, but could not even touch the mark.The direction is to the point and in some scenes quite remarkable, using flickering lights to increase the tense atmosphere and in one scene using flashing neon light to illuminate the dark. The movie is well shot with some beautifully lighted scenes that take you inside the screen. But the movie could not skip from the clichés of horror flicks like the dumb characters, who even after knowing that darkness is where the monster is, will walk into dark corners without doubts. The point that the ghost is affected by a particular frequency light elaborates the nonsensical points in the movie. In some unimportant scenes we can hear sounds coming from brightly lit places, how would she do that if the place is lit like Christmas. The actors has done a decent job, Teresa Palmer and Bateman giving marvelous performance.In the end Lights out is a scary movie that will give you shudders in moments but you would not get feeling of closure. For a horror fan, it is worth it, to watch it with lights out, because it will amaze you . Whether you look at the movie as a metaphor to depression or just a straight forward horror movie, it scratches the mark of greatness, but rests in the 'good' range of horror movies.at www.filmicsite.com",Lights Out

Life threatening stakes and a constant fear, that is established by a Unique premise.For a movie spanning only 80 minutes, it does a pretty awesome job of having the characters introduced, as wells as their backgrounds and enough Chemistry between all of them, to work dynamically.It's a shame that we got so little of the Background of the story and the logic behind it. More work would have been preferred for the death of the Creature and how it all connected.The cast and their acting is what keeps the Dread alive.

273,donuts_69,A great premise ruined by pathetic scripting/writing,3,31 August 2016,"When I saw David F. Sandberg's original short ""Lights Out"" I was, like many others, impressed by the simple yet entirely effective and atmospheric take on the short horror film. The idea that something horrible and terrifying could be lurking in front of your eyes only to become visible as a shadowy figure when the light was switched off brings the viewers imagination into play, prompting childhood memories of hiding from shadows under the safety of blankets and sheets. That terror manifests in the mind as well as on the screen makes even a three minute film feel personal and enveloping.Unfortunately for the feature studio film of the same name, and by the same director, that personal and enveloping feeling of terror is washed away by shonky writing, laughable dialogue, wooden delivery and confusing plot building.It's a real shame, if not totally unsurprising, that something which so many of us could relate to was buried with as many Hollywood horror clichés as could be squeezed into 80mins.For a movie to be truly scary, the audience needs to feel some kind of connection to the characters portrayed within it, so that when they are threatened or conveying emotion, we feel or relate to them. The movie starts off with young boy (Martin) chatting to his late working Dad about coming home to stop Mummy (Sophie) from talking to herself. The fact that Daddy never makes it home due to a horrifying and tragic demise seems to make no impact on this little family and serve only to introduce us to the entity known as ""Diana"". Not only are Martin/Sophie shown to be more or less unaffected by the loss, but there is no relevance to having the father in the movie at all(the assistant could have just been killed off and had the same impact). Estranged early 20s daughter, Rebecca and bf, Bret, are then introduced and due to the fact she wont let Bret stay over or even keep any of his personal items in her apartment, there's a feeling that she may have more to hide than it first appears. But it never eventuates. The opening exchange between them is awkward and lacking any real chemistry and never really grows from there.He remains the unquestioning, supportive figure throughout and may or may not only exist as body fodder for later. Either way, we don't care.Rebecca barely cracks a smile, furrows a brow or even blinks during her entire screen time and delivers her dialogue in a flat unaffected way that never translates the horror/terror/insert adj here that should stem from the events surrounding her.Martin is the standard borderline mistreated kid. He's shown no affection during what would be, for any other 8yo, the most emotional part of his life. Nor does he seek it.Sophie is Crazy/Not crazy Mum in denial. Perhaps shes emotionally suffocated by Diana but we never really know for sure. Her final part in the film makes sure there's no chance at reconciliation for either of her kids.The main part of the story is so unfocused that I can't even put it down into a couple of sentences. I wanted to say that Martin and Rebecca are trying to figure out how to stop their inattentive Mum from descending into madness, driven by her conversations with the shadowy Diana. But, to help her they really don't do anything. There's some half arsed detective work by the wooden Rebecca, who is as unaffected by the events surrounding her and Martin as Martin was over the death of his Father. Piece by piece she uncovers tidbits of info that point to ""mental health care"" ""experimental treatments gone wrong"", ""rare skin condition accounting for light aversion"" and an entity that exists because ""she gets in your head"". It's all a bit pointless in its delivery because it's never expanded on any further than that. At 80 mins it's not like we couldn't squeeze it in somewhere and build the back story a little more.What there is a dearth of is gimmicky, uninspired jump scares at almost every scene commencement. The house is squeakier than an alvin and the chipmunks movie marathon. The repetitive nature of the scares is tiresome after the first three times, while the decisions of each and every character to ""investigate that noise"" or ""Check basement/upstairs/any darkened room"" is just plain lazy writing. There's so many cliché moments here that it almost becomes an in game movie to see which ones you can notice. Call it Cliché Bingo.How many ""it's behind you!"" moments can you seriously write into 1hr 20m?? The movie doesn't even follow it's own rules! For most of the film, Diana is unaffected when the lights come on. She cant enter the light and simply disappears when a light comes on. Fine. But In the final scenes, when Diana suddenly becomes susceptible to light (gets burnt) and no longer vanishes in its presence we are left scratching our heads.It's never even clear what Diana is. If she's dead then why isn't she a ghost or specter linked to some kind of trauma relating to the asylum? If she's not a ghost then why can Sophie project her as a physical entity who she can impact on the ones she loves most? For a premise that held so much potential as an original movie idea, this feature debut is left flailing and faltering all the way to its merciful end, which, by the way, flickers (literally) at showing that there may still be more to come (is Diana really gone?) before answering with a flat ""yeh, that's it"".",Lights Out

I mean how many times have we seen awesome trailers that turned out to be Major let downs. ""Lights Out"", however, is one of those revolutionary pieces of film that should have inspired other film makers to force the boundaries of conventional horror films. One of the most innovative and outstanding pieces of work in this film is the character, Diana. Formless, and only visible in the dark, Diana is what we as children feared. However, her suffering as a child with a severe skin condition also allows you to have pity for this strange creature. But besides the pity and fear there is something about this character, and this movie as a whole, that will convince you to be afraid of the dark.",Lights Out

280,knight_ca,Novel idea but needs more,6,20 August 2016,"Lights Out is an interesting stab at a horror movie based on a 2013 short film of the same name. The movie's novel concept is a creature that can only be seen and manifest in the dark. Turn a torch on, and it disappears. Naturally, this means that a lot of the movie is spent in the dark but this works well.The use of lighting is one of the movie's strong points and allows for some creative, and occasionally funny, uses of torches, candles and even car headlights. This technique generates a lot of the scares and atmosphere and given the movie's title, this is a must. Definitely top marks for the director on this part.Teresa Palmer and Gabriel Bateman do well in the lead roles as the unfortunate kids with a crazy mother, played by Maria Bello. The problem with the movie is that apart from its main concept, it doesn't add much else. Clichés abound and yes, there is the mandatory dark basement (groan). Most of the scares are jump-out-at- you shocks and it's all been done before. Hollywood seems to have forgotten how to use psychological horror and churns out movies that are just twists on the same theme. This is probably a bit harsh as the movie is enjoyable enough and it's well-written, but I long for something new that isn't so long in the tooth.The supernatural horror is effective and does elicit a genuine threat to the characters. Maria Bello, in particular, does well to ramp up the threat levels and makes you wonder who is going to make it out alive. As already mentioned, this was based on a short film and it really still is, coming in at around 80 minutes. Perhaps there wasn't enough material to make a longer movie but there's a feeling that it ends just as it gets going.Lights Out is a decent film if you feel the need for a dash of supernatural horror but don't expect anything stand-out; it just doesn't deliver enough of a impact to make it memorable. It's good for what it does but don't buy too much popcorn as you may not have time to finish it.",Lights Out

I love the fact that it just got on with it, there was no dragging it out and the story was explained and really well thought out.

Generally, horror films are rated a bit low on IMDb. I've found anything rated over 5.9 to be a pretty decent. Not the case here. There was no suspense, palpable or otherwise. In fact the entire movie was anticlimactic. The dialogue was dreary. The direction was sub-par in my opinion. Very predictable, which is disappointing because the premise of the story was a promising one. Instead of getting some good genuine suspense and scares dished out to me, I ended up sitting on the couch with one eye on the TV and the other downloading apps on my new phone.

287,Kevin_C1,"Creative and entertaining, but not without a few downfalls",6,27 July 2016,"Lights out is a refreshing, and imaginative new take on horror that I would recommend to any fan of the genre.Part of what makes this movie scary is how it is all based around a very primal fear – the dark. The dark is the basis for every scare of the movie, and I would be lying if I said I didn't feel uneasy during my midnight run after the film.Something that this movie does different than many other horror flicks, is that for most of the scares, there is not a lot of build up. A lot of the time, a scene will drag up for so long, building tension, that the scare becomes too predictable. This movie often skipped building up high- tension situations and went straight for the punch. The origin story for Diana doesn't really make to much sense, but it is a horror story, what do you expect? It is not focused on heavily and isn't essential to enjoying the movie.My biggest complaint about the movie is the dialogue. Often a great scare, or a dramatic moment would be ruined by really cheesy, straight forward dialogue, especially coming from the mother, or boyfriend. Sadly this rings true during the peak of movie, with some silly lines coming from the mother ruining what would have otherwise been a clever ending to the story.What I loved most about this movie was how they took from their original short film and built on it so well. The hallway sequence from the short film is used within the first ninety seconds of the feature length film. They expand on this concept creatively using a plethora of devices to ward off Diana throughout the film. One particularly creative moment happens as Diana is approach someone firing a weapon at her.Despite some cheesy dialogue, and weird dramatic moments, Lights out is still a creative and fun new take on horror. I would recommend it to any horror fan.",Lights Out

The malevolent persona later kills her husband and anyone who tries to make her go away.Sophie's daughter Rebecca is the principle character in the movie and must return home to face her demons risking her own mental health to save her brother and her mother from this evil using its Achilles heal, its fear of light, as her only weapon.",Lights Out

297,GoDzReaper93,An excellent little horror film with heart and a solid message!,7,21 July 2016,"2016 has been a great year for first time directors. Earlier this year, Dan Trachtenberg brought us the brilliant, suspenseful thriller 10 Cloverfield Lane (whilst the ending of the film is debatable, the rest of it was an amazing, character driven piece), Tim Miller delivered the goods with a certain potty-mouthed anti-hero which grossed north of $700 million worldwide and Ilya Naishuller directed the superb Hardcore Henry which was vastly underseen (go out and buy the Blu-Ray, seriously. You've never seen Sharlto Copley quite like this and it was the most fun I've had in at the movies since Mad Max: Fury Road). I'm pleased to say that Lights Out director, David F. Sandberg joins this mob of directors and has brought us an excellent, tense and thriller film with Lights Out.The film follows Rebecca (played the beautiful Australian actress Teresa Palmer) and Martin (played by the excellent Gabriel Bateman) attempting to understand why a demon keeps pursuing them and to get to the bottom of their mother, Sophie's (Maria Bello) depression. The film does a great job of delving into the dangers of depression whilst also delivering some genuinely creepy scares. I've seen quite a few horror films and can confidently say this this film features one of the most frightening ghosts in a long time. To be fair, the trailers made the film look like your everyday, generic ghost story, but Lights Out uses the ghost as a metaphor showing the audience the type of darkness that can manifest within the mind of someone dealing with depression. The cast are all excellent, with Teresa Palmer and Gabriel Batman getting the lion's share of screen time. Bateman in particular is an excellent child actor - after last years ""Room"", it's tough to beat Jacob Tremblay but Bateman comes close. Sandberg frames the film pretty well, utilising the genre tropes to maximum effect. That being said, it is obvious that James Wan has had quite an influence with this film. Being the Producer of the film, there are signature Wan techniques such as creating a tension filled atmosphere and the excellent use of lighting.However, the premise of the film is confusing at times. The rules created within the film are that the ghost, known as Diana, cannot appear in light (it is revealed later during the film that when she was alive she suffered from a rare skin condition which made her extremely sensitive to light). During some moments, there are scenes where she appears within barely lit rooms or lights are illuminating her. It begs the question, at what point is it too dark for her to appear? This might be a minor gripe, but the film plays a little too fast and loose with the premise. Another downside is one of the genre tropes - where horror film characters continually make illogical decisions. As I said before, Sandberg uses the tropes well, but this is a negative trope which is hated in most horror films. For example, characters are constantly wandering into dark rooms without turning lights on, knowing full well that there is a spectre out to get them or, as another example, when a character gets trapped in a room and her only source of light is out, she doesn't attempt to open the curtains (it is established that it is daytime). Little things like these are minor annoyances in an otherwise excellent film.Lights Out is a brilliant little horror film which may be overshadowed by the bigger horror film on the block this year (The Conjuring 2). However, this is a horror film with a message and some genuine scares with terrific performances. I give Lights Out a 7/10.",Lights Out

I will admit that I haven't seen the short that's mentioned, but I'm going to make a point to hint for it now. I will also say that this movie met my expectations/I wasn't expecting a total masterpiece. Most of this movie's issue is the concept. I will give cast and production credit where credit is due: David F. Sanberg and James Wan made the best that they possibly could out of the mud puddle of a plot.

You can read the movie and predict what parts will scare you but this movie will keep you guessing how you will be scared. This is one of the best scary moves I have seen and is probably the second best horror movie since The Conjuring. James Wan, who directed the Conjuring, is a producer on this film.

The effects really got to me, while it wasn't the scariest ghost I've ever seen on the screen I couldn't help but loved the way she appeared and disappeared. She wasn't overpowered or too weak, I felt there was enough back and forth with the different characters gaining the upper hand in a believable way.

It's rare that horror movies really stick with me like that, but this one got me. Still gives me the creeps thinking about her in that doorway.

306,atclubsilencio,A solid scare machine with an excellent finale.,5,19 July 2016,"84%Despite my enjoyment of the original short, I was not impressed with the trailers for LIGHTS OUT, which made it look like just another jump-scare laden, run-of-the- mill, exercise in mediocrity. To my surprise the pre-release buzz was overwhelmingly positive, and since I got chance to see it for free thanks to a screening pass, I had nothing to lose, and as it turns out Lights Out is one of the biggest surprises of the year. Is it still filled with jump scares? Absolutely, but these types of scares are not of the cheap variety. And what's most impressive is how debuting writer/director David F. Sandberg is able to repeat essentially the same scare over and over, but keeping each one fresh, exciting, and inventive. Save for many that have been spoiled in the advertising, it's the many more that haven't been shown that are the cream of the crop. Lights Out got me to scream out loud on more than one occasion, something The Conjuring 2 was unable to do. Ironically, Lights Out is produced by James Wan (director of The Conjuring franchise) and Sanberg outdoes him again and again, both in legit scares and intensity, a perfect amount of humor sprinkled throughout that isn't cringe inducing, and a visual style all his own that is at times flat out dazzling. Even if the film hadn't been as successful as it is, the technical aspects are faultless.Still, there are some flaws to be found. It's increasingly apparent that the frightening set pieces were at the forefront of importance when the script was being written, with the character and story depth taking a back seat. Though we do end up caring for these characters, it's mostly through their convincing performances rather than the writing itself. The origin story to the antagonist Diana feels rushed and a bit confused. We understand that something 'very bad happened' to her, and that there was some kind of accident. But unless I was zoning out, we don't get enough explanation as to what exactly happened and who she was, or why she turned out the way she did beyond the bare-minimum. The attempt at strained familial bonds and mental illness reminds one of The Babadook lite at times, but unfortunately Lights Out never reaches the level of that film's' thematic weight (save for a rather unforeseen turn at at end).Essentially, the story is nothing more than a clothesline to hang upon what the audience came for, the horror and thrills. These aspects certainly could have been a lot worse, and they don't necessarily drag the film too far down, but a second draft and more fleshing out would have been welcome.With that being said, Lights Out plays for a while as a solidly executed, entertaining, if not quite extraordinary horror for its first two thirds. Entertaining enough, but aside from the opening and a few scenes here and there, I was wondering why the film was being so hyped up (as of this writing it still holds a 100% score on RottenTomatoes with 13 reviews and counting). But the best is certainly saved for last. The final sequence is where the goods come and where the film raises itself up on onto another level. I'm telling you, it is absolutely RELENTLESS in it's escalating insanity, genuine suspense, thrills upon thrills upon thrills, and some great moments that had me both laughing and jolting in my chair. It's nothing short of exhilarating, and seeing it in a packed theater only adds to the fun.This finale is where the director finally goes full throttle and doesn't let up until the final shot. It makes a good film into a damned near-great one, especially for horror fans. The use of lighting is also tops, as the vicious monster can never appear in light, the different sources of light- from a lit candle, a fluorescent black light, head lights, flashlights, even gun shots- are all used ingeniously. The same goes for the darkness, as every time a light bulb flickers, or we are suddenly thrown into pitch black darkness, all one can do is hold their breath and grip their chair. As you know some bad news is about to go down. It really dives into that primal, childhood fear of the dark and may conjure up a few bad memories or two. I can't express it enough, the finale is worth the price of admission alone.Ultimately, while it may not be on the same level of my favorite horror films of the year (The Neon Demon, The Wailing, The Witch, to name a few.) Lights Out is pure popcorn munching horror fun. Ridiculously entertaining, gorgeously executed, and just a great time at the theater. Time will tell if it holds up on repeated viewings, but for now I definitely recommend every horror fan to give this one a watch opening weekend, preferably at night, in the most packed theater one can find. I eagerly await whatever David F. Sandberg does next.",Lights Out

308,joshuaprentice,"Surprisingly Good, but I will still be turning my lights off tonight.",7,25 August 2016,"Watching the trailer for this movie, I almost didn't wanna watch it, as it just seemed to be another jump scare heavy movie. Granted, it does have those moments, but aside from a group of four girls in the cinema ruining some of the tension and a big moment later on through constant chatter, this film was good. I like James Wan, who if thoroughly believe is this generations Wes Craven, but he only had a producer role in this movie. It is directed by David Sandberg, who also directed the short film, that inspired this film, and I have to say it is very well directed. This film is about a family haunted by a girl called Diana, who surprisingly had an interesting backstory. The trailer does spoil a few plot elements, but far from spoils the tone of the movie. In the early stages, there are obvious jump scares coming and you just have to groan, plus a slight poke at the stereotype of rock and metal fans, was a little annoying. But, this movie turned those predictable jump scares and stereotypes on there heads, as not only are the characters well developed and not shoe horned in just to be there for killing, but the jump scares, while they do happen, do allow you to see whats there to scare you before the loud noise happens, and half of those noises are just amplified screams of someone being attacked, so they are far from the cheep jump scares we have come to hate in horror. When there is a jump scare, it's because there is something to be scared of. There was several times in this film where I was thinking 'oh here comes a cheep jump scare, but alas they don't. So, kudos to this movie for building tension naturally, and making me care for every single character. The ending did become predictable when a certain thing becomes established, but that doesn't take away from the performances. Maria Bello, who plays the mum, is fantastic in this movie. The lead Rebecca, played by Teresa Palmer does a solid job, and while she does have a couple of far away looks and acts a bit off character for the situation at times, for the most part does great. Alexander DiPersia who plays the boyfriend, is a likable character, and has stuff to do, and act's like a boyfriend should, which is rare for horror movies where usually the main characters other half is just there to be an idiot and/or die. Also the kid actor, Gabriel Bateman, is great. Kid actors get a lot of flack but this kid acts superbly, carrying scene's when its just him and Diana, and while maybe a little to mature as a character, does match up to the fellow actors around him. Diana has a good back story, and its a very intelligent plot as horror's go. The design is a little clique, and brings nothing new to the table, but her presence is felt even when she isn't there, and the reveal of her, when she's not just a shadow, is very well done, if only the group sat in front of me hadn't talked about the big reveal scare for five minutes after, I may have appreciated it more. Yes the characters do have their 'dumb character' moments, but it isn't on a frustrating level. I was surprised by 'Lights out' and I hope to see the actors and director got on to bigger and better things. This is a good horror movie. 2016 seems to be the year Hollywood is getting it's s*it together, and treating horrors seriously. However, we still have 'Don't Breath', 'Rings', and the new 'Blair Witch' to come so we shall see. All in all 'Light's Out' is decent, with a few cliques, predictable jump scares and ending, but has a good plot, great character development, and does build the tension well. All in all a solid 3.5/5 from me.",Lights Out
309,NickyDee07938,The horror genre is so tired and laboured right now !,3,7 October 2019,"I could go on at length about how the horror genre is so genuinely over-saturated with movies that are retreading, retreating, rehashing, and repeating the same tired and cliche-riddled narratives, and that Lights Out delivers nothing new to the landscape, but we all kind of know that already. And still we perpetuate with wasting time watching the same old storytelling, and the same old scares. The Babadook visited this uninspiring sub-genre but delivered in a much more satisfying way. Somehow filmmakers need to find the universal fears of the dark, the unseen, and the unknown, in a different setting, an unusual location, or in a story that shows us an unfamiliar hero, world, or a set of unusual circumstances. Maybe then we'll have something to really rave about. Or maybe this film just says more about the level of movie smarts in people who enjoyed it as filmmakers are always trying to adjust content and theme to the lowest common denominator. There was nothing poor about this film technically, in the performances, the direction or the set design. It was just.......narratively boring. Creature features that rely on a mystical, or other worldly antagonist really need to follow the ""Alien"" strategy. In that masterpiece of horror storytelling suspense was generated through NOT revealing the fullness of the creature. Once that cat is out of the bag (sorry, an Alien pun) it is very difficult to maintain any tension. Especially in a supernatural tale that relies so heavily on audiences being fearful of the ghost / entity / demon / spirit. A good backstory can really add depth to character interactions, to setting, to motivations and decision making, but it must be full, easy to understand, meaningful thematically so that it resonates, and most importantly, impactful. When films don't articulate this, a backstory's inclusion feels forced, manipulated, and contrived. I've seen many short horror films on Shudder, and Alter, and many more with better, more deserving (of feature film treatment) stories than Lights Out. I guess it's a luck thing - I just don't get how something so filmically basic as a short went viral. It wasn't even THAT good. I've seen way more impressive offerings. Anyway, all that aside, Lights Out was competently put together, well shot, well acted, and decently directed. I've no doubt that James Wan's involvement took it to a level it otherwise might not have achieved based on the story alone.",Lights Out
310,fernando-saravi,A good horror movie,8,21 June 2017,"My wife and I watched this flick without any particular expectation. The plot was relatively simple and straightforward. The acting was good by all the crew - particularly Gabriel Bateman and Maria Bello. The special effects were appropriate without exaggeration, which is good for me. It causes fear without lots of blood or dead bodies and without low blows. Another good point for this kind of movie is that they kept it short, and thus avoided being overly repetitive and boring. If you enjoy horror movies, this one is for you.",Lights Out
311,gsmith513,A few bad elements spoiled an otherwise decent horror film,6,24 July 2016,"***SPOILERS***I hardly ever write reviews, but when a movie has promise but is largely spoiled by a few avoidable details, then I hope that the feedback is somehow noted by the screenwriter and director. The film has a fair premise that an evil entity can only be seen and harm others when the lights are out. The acting is primarily good and characters such as Martin (the little brother) and Bret (his sister's boyfriend) are quite likable. There are suspenseful moments, but for me the scary tone of the movie was spoiled by silly elements such as the voice recording of ""Diana"" in the mental institution as a young girl. During this recording Diana has a masculine, guttural, demonic voice, which just seemed ridiculous, given that she was supposed to have been a young girl with some type of porphyria and severe behavior problems. I guess the implication is that she was already possessed, but this same over-done voice is used in later parts of the film and always seemed to ruin the tension for me. The ""treatment"" attempted at the mental hospital apparently electrocutes and kills Diana, and now she can only live through mentally ill Sophie (the mother played a touch over-dramatically by Maria Bello) with whom she formed a connection when Sophie was also placed at the institution as child. Adult Sophie continues to experience bouts of depression, delusions and hallucinations, during which Diana is able to manifest in areas of darkness. The movie lost more credibility during the scene in which big sister Rebecca has a flashback to her childhood and remembers Diana stealing a picture she had been coloring of her family. The fact that Diana took a black crayon (or charcoal), scratched out members of the family, drew herself in as a stick figure and wrote her name in, just seemed absurd. Anyway, it appears that Sophie's mental state must have improved for a while, because Diana disappears for a prolonged stretch of time until Sophie's next extended episode of psychotic symptoms. In the last portion of the film, Rebecca is exploring the dark basement of the family home with a black light and discovers tormented messages that Diana has written on the walls in what I am assuming is some sort of other-worldly ectoplasm. This seemed to be a poorly executed and unnecessary attempt to explain Diana's emotional state to the audience, just in case we hadn't picked up on it already. OK- we got it. Diana is angry that she is trapped in darkness and wants to get rid of Sophie's family so she can be with Sophie all the time. I will give props to the Director for the gutsy ending, instead of neatly allowing everyone to survive unscathed.",Lights Out

It was a better version of Twilight and Teresa Palmer's loose rendition of what Bella Swan should really have been like was much appreciated by yours truly. This is a rendition of yet another Kristen Stewart role. This time it's The Messengers -- check out the little brother (again with the little brother and the brave older sister) being protected by the sister from a demonic presence in their home. Not that there's anything wrong with Stewart's role in the Messengers but it's eerie that this is the second time Palmer's following in Stewart's footsteps. In and of itself, Lights out is a spooky, atmospheric vehicle with quite a few jump-out-of-skin scares. I liked how sold the ""boyfriend"" was on Teresa's character. He was stuck to her like glue (yet another Twilight nod... ugh) and very protective of her and her family. Maria Bello was wasted in this role and the little brother was sadly underused. Other than this, the depression angle seemed to be the only way out of the dilemma this story presented but it must have killed any hopes of a sequel for its die-hard fans (thank god). My rating -- a solid 6 with little re-watch potential. Btw, IMDb - I am STILL mad at you for taking away our discussion boards. Not cool and a really bad move.",Lights Out

318,arunanvinci,be afraid of the dark when the lights go out.,8,29 July 2016,"I'm one of those movie freaks who cuddles up and cajoles a valiant effort especially from new filmmakers. David Sandberg is one of them. When I came across this movie and got to know that there was a short film already on that I immediately watched it. And I knew the world should welcome this talented filmmaker with open hands. I lived what James Wan did with insidious and conjuring series. And he should be appreciated for realizing the potential of Sandberg and he doesn't fail to live up to it.I will come right to the point just like David did with the movie.Lights out has wonderful casting. Teresa Palmer probably has the role of her lifetime. Not only effortlessly pulling off gorgeous looks, she does also while being this tender, caring sister and daughter with a tormented past. Bateman though keeps a same expression whenever he sees the ghost and while being terrified. But he is apt. Maria Bello with those dark circles underneath eyes as psychologically influenced mother of two again with a troubled past soars above rest in whatever screen time she gets. DiePersia as Bret again keeps company with Palmer in a blink and you miss moments role. He gives the much needed comic relief throughout. And finally as Diane, the light fearing demon, played by Alicia Vela-Bailey (a stunt actress), is athletic to say the least if not as intimidating while looking in light than when lights are out.Above Palmer, who is there right throughout the movie, Sandberg manages to tell a metaphysical demon's story and the family it troubles and scares the living daylights out of them in a most frightening and shortest way possible without compromising on any of the commercial elements required to relax the audience. For me the greatest joy was watching the movie in theater with an audience who shrieks, shouts, gasps and haunted by the ghost and its activities and applauds and shouts out to the smartness displayed by the cast, especially in the second half. Credit goes to Sandberg again for engaging with the audience and keeping them on the edge of their seats. Despite taking inspiration from The Babadook, Mama and Hollow Man, Sandberg's story feels very original and the plot as intriguing as it should be for a horror movie. No wonder the makers of Annebelle 2 have entrusted him to be at the helm. With Eric Heisserer who himself has an impressive CV with the likes of The Thing and A Nightmare on Elm Street to his writing credits and an excellent cast (that probably trusted the director, a rarity) Lights Out does the act that is lost with horror genre, a self sustaining drum roll finish to an excellent prelude. A blip or a downfall, I could point out is the demon itself. Biggest plus for the movie is its biggest minus. Blame it on the make up or the utter negligence, Diana looks yuck while watching under lights. Without it, she is something else. However, David treads the line carefully by just showing her in the shadows and let our minds conjure up the image. Which brings me to the technical aspect of the film. Marc Spicer cradling the camera shows obvious experience after working with Wan in Furoius 7 (Wan has really lent his everything to this movie). Benjamin Wallfisch providing the most important aspect to horror movies, the background music. It is just where it is required. I really loved the BGM when Rebecca (Palmer) encounters Diane under the neon lights in her room. Small things like these go a long way in making a movie that really depends on technical and directorial skills and cast performance and not much on backstory and explanation.I would give a solid 8/10 to Sandberg's first full fledged movie and while expecting similar goose bump and jump from seat ride. After Lights Out I'm more intrigued to watch Sandberg other short films (Attic Panic, Closet Space)and only wish there will be production houses will come out with grander versions of it, with him at the helm only.",Lights Out

The quality of the movie keeps up the whole play through. Credible acting, effective camera work, a terrifying demon and a backstory that makes to think about. An intense, high quality horror movie. Really 'liked' this one.",Lights Out
320,unnamedhorror,Not bad but not stellar,4,26 December 2016,"Like many people who were interested in seeing this film, I saw the original short and was impressed by its simplicity and originality, but to me one of the most intriguing things about the short was that it made no attempt at all to explain the nature of the ""monster"" it was just there one night, and that was the beauty of it--it was completely unknown. One night, this woman turns her lights off and there's this ghoul in the shadows. No overwrought backstory, no clichés, none of that. That is where the feature film version falls short.In trying to expand the concept into a full length story, the writer/director had to come up with a backstory to explain the monster and unfortunately he ended up going down an all-too-familiar route. The monster becomes not only tied to the family history, but comes from a bizarre experimental therapy conducted in a mental institution. How many times has this premise been used? It's just overdone and unoriginal and frankly was a disappointment. As an avid horror movie fan, being able to guess every plot point before it happens is boring. There's even the classic scene where the daughter finds all the articles and research neatly stored away in her mother's house that perfectly explains where the monster came from. Wow.With that said, most of the performances were still good and there were some genuinely cool creature effects/scares that made great use of the practical effects chosen by the director.Teresa Palmer did a pretty good job essentially carrying the film, and showed good range in her portrayal of a sister suddenly being forced into the role of a caregiver. The shortcomings in her character come from the writing which has her character jump from loner to protector of her brother and accepting of her boyfriend very suddenly.Maria Bello did great as the unhinged but apologetic mother who started the whole mess, delivering a very believable and at times even sympathetic performance.Gabriel Bateman does a fairly decent job as the younger brother Martin, managing to pull off what is essentially the role of an abused/neglected child very well. His delivery/mannerisms in some of the scenes where he is dealing with being sent back to stay with his deranged mother are particular poignant.Alexander DiPersia was a name a didn't recognize but his face seemed familiar upon watching the film. Due in no small part to the poor writing of his character, his performance was completely forgettable, but I do think he did the best he could with the afterthought-style writing his character received.All in all, this was a decent horror movie, but I was a big fan of the mystery and horror-of-the-unknown created in the original short and was therefore disappointed by the formulaic, clichéd, all-too-common story crafted by the writer/director.",Lights Out
321,wowhaaa,Finally!A really enjoyable horror flick,8,27 July 2016,"We haven't had anything like Lights out in recent years. Sure we had some great horror movies, but those were either much more dramatic (The Conjuring) or much more like a dark fairy tale (Crimson Peak), rather than a good, ""just-for-fun"" horror movie.Lights out is exactly that. It does not take itself too seriously, and bravely balances on the edge of horror and comedy, just like Drag me to hell did a few years ago.Of course it has a dark backstory about a girl, Diana who died a terrible death, and now came back to h(a)unt everyone who tries (or at least she thinks that)to separate her and her bff,a little lunatic mom who is portrayed by Maria Bello. The main characters are her children, Rebecca and Martin, who are Diana's No.1 targets for the main part of the movie. The young actors are great, and the characters are likable, finally you will actually care about them instead rooting for the bad guy (or girl, this time) to kill'em all.Do not put your expectations too high though. You will have a great deal of fun, but do not expect a movie that will overwrite the whole genre of horror from the basics.One jump scare follows the previous one, and sort of that's about the scary part. You almost saw them all in the trailers already, still they work as they are done very well. Do not ask yourself why people will click the lights over and over again until the creepiest thing of all times will jump on them, instead of running. Do not ask how Diana, who suffers from the smallest light can approach Becca's apartment at the end of a well-lit corridor. Really just lean back and enjoy the ride.Aside of the well choreographed jump-scare scenes the film's atmosphere is not dark at all, it is full with heartwarming and even funny little moments.All in all, Lights out is not an instant classic, but is very good, and one of the most enjoyable horror movies of recent years. Go for it! (and borrow some reflectors from Batman, just in case)",Lights Out
322,mailsst-29721,Not too bad,6,22 July 2016,"I like the concept of the movie 'Lights Out', but the way the story was told was a bit unfulfilling. I don't particularly care much about the characters. Not enough time was spent on telling their back-stories, so I wasn't really emotionally invested in them. A snippet of how the entity came about was too short and not explicit enough to have an impact on me. For a good horror flick, I need gory details, which this movie is lacking. And the suspense wasn't long enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. It did have some jump-scare moments, though.

323,maartenbouwmans,Writing as fresh as stale bread,1,8 November 2016,"I'm a big fan of horror, but this movie was utterly uninteresting to me. In the opening scene it becomes apparent that the writers didn't really bother. The monster, named Diane with all the flair the creators could muster, doesn't follow any rules at all. She can only exist in dark, which is a cool concept. But I guess she also controls electronic devices, as she can make lamps go out at will. Throughout the movies it gets worse and worse. Teleporting, unless the movies feels she needs to use the door because banging on a door is scary. Mind control, because whatever. In the end we wind up with a monster that does a whole lot of random stuff, leaving me with the feeling that the stuff is happening because the filmmakers wanted to shoot something. Or rather had to, because they already signed a contract. It's just very lazy writing, and it left me so thoroughly unengaged to the point where intended drama provoked laughter. The characters are horrible. Especially the kid brother. Almost every line he delivers is some kind of wisdom through the honest innocence of a child. It's a mediocre cliché, and this movie wallows in it. I finished this movie because after 20 minutes or so there was some play with light that looked really nice. So I expected more shadowplay, hoping for more shots that were engaging. They never came tho.",Lights Out

328,matheusteixe,A roller-coaster of jump scares,2,26 August 2016,"Lights out an eerie silhouette of a human-like creature loiters down the hall. You repeatedly blink in an attempt to mould its blurred lines, but the dishevelled contour of the unfathomable spectre remains absolutely motionless. Lights on nothing there. Lights out it's moved a couple of inches near you, and your breath starts to come in short gasps. Lights on a tinge of stinging pain strikes your bloodshot eyes, and sweat covers your petrified face. You hesitatingly move your fingers upon the switch and take an abrupt stop in the middle to wonder what will happen the next time the lights go out. Well, let's see. Lights out perhaps, you shouldn't have been so curious.In 2013, Swedish filmmaker, David F. Sandberg, put out one of the most iconic horror short-film experiences that the internet had ever experienced. By that time, all the corners of the virtual realm were awash with the amateurish spine-tingling stories, and the emergence of urban legends, such as The Slenderman. They galvanised aspiring writers to leave their marks on virtual forums, but a selected few decided to take their projects to a whole new level by transferring them to a wider scope.Lotta Losten, who played the nameless main character in the short-film version, enacts a below-par reinterpretation of the same scene, which filled our hearts with sheer dread on Youtube. This time, she plays a woman who works in a mannequin warehouse, and, while clocking out, happens to have a ghastly encounter with a ghoulish presence; However, she's able to sheer away from a gruesome fate. Subsequently, she warns her boss, Paul, about what she saw. He doesn't seem to give much thought to it, but later on, while walking down a dimly lit hall, he comes across a monstrous apparition, which drags him into the darkness, and mauls him to death.The story follows the brothers, Martin and Rebecca, trying to fathom the depression episodes of their mother, Sophie, who happens to have an unexplained connection with the same demonic entity, who attacked Paul, their stepfather. Rebecca is the typical rogue girl who's then telephoned by the school, where her brother studies, to talk about his sleeping in the class, of which he attributes to the same entity which happened to haunt his sister. Rebecca feels beholden to become his responsible guardian, inasmuch as her mother is not of sound mind to look after the boy, and that's when the very same monstrosity that traumatised her childhood, decides to lurk in the shadows of her bedroom one more time.Unfortunately, the adapted version falls short in offering an immersing narrative compared to the original one. The short-film is well-off for uneasiness. It relates to the blood-curdling sensation of going to the kitchen, in the middle of the night, to get a glass of water, and feeling that, at any moment, a gelid hand will sneak up on you. The foundations of the original piece are the imaginary phantasmal beasts, which are masterfully woven due to mere creaks and noises.The experience does not establish a favourable pace in order to evoke a heartfelt sympathy towards the characters. The film doesn't take too long to showcase its premise by walking us through its mechanics. A glowing lamp pops up in the screen signalling its importance in the narrative and it appears that the whole story is used as a mere background for its successful jump scares extravaganza. 'Lights Out' didn't seem to have inherited the same traces that its predecessor could have bequeathed, instead, it limits itself as a roller-coaster filled with jump scares that do not allow the viewer to take in the events. Notwithstanding, it does not entirely fail to regale us. The formula can be categorised as hackneyed, but gets its message effortlessly through to us by simply saying: Grab a torch and give darkness a wide berth. Lights Out enjoy the ride.Verdict: 2/5",Lights Out
329,chicken1997,"Good scares, decent acting, dry writing.",6,20 October 2017,"Let's start with what we all see horror movies for, the horror. Lights out succeeds in this department. Though it fails to build any real atmosphere, its scary scenes are pretty well done as far as jump scares go and the antagonist entity is well handled in the scenes involving it. It's nowhere near the terror induced by films like Insidious or The Conjuring, but for a movie that is only an hour and 20 minutes long, the scares are worth the time.As for the acting, all the actors put on a solid, if not dry, performance. Not much to work with in the script to be fair.Which leads to the writing, the story itself. A pretty generic ""entity"" tale albeit well handled and with a very interesting background. I wish the writers had taken more time to build on the back story, which had me intrigued from the start. As for the characters, they were all pretty basic and one dimensional, no real development. Although, I did sympathize more with these characters then I do with those of most horror films. I felt the ending was very clean and was fitting to the film. Many horror films are perfectly good right up until the last half hour, where they derail. But that was not the case with lights out. It was well handled and more intense than I expected. And though it really has nothing to do with the movie, I was relieved that in this day and age of every movie having to become a franchise, they didn't try to tease a sequel and instead let the story wrap up nicely.Overall, a solid horror film with an interesting premise, some good scares, and a well handled ending.

But this movie nailed casting exactly right. Teresa Palmer's performance in particular is fantastic and deserves mention. Both she and Maria Bello developed their characters and have given us ""real"" flawed people. (The actor playing the boyfriend also does a nice job.) My one complaint with the film is that the filmmakers were too much in a rush to deliver scares. The story could have been more layered and built more suspense -- rather than going for cheap scares. We see the creature too often. But again this film is notable for the fine performances and should find a permanent place in your horror library -- if just for the characterizations. This film made me a Teresa Palmer fan -- that's for sure. She's like a more talented version of Kristen Stewart. In my opinion, Teresa Palmer has real star quality.",Lights Out

Minus a star for the jump-scare-apaloozafest but it's definitely worth it.,Lights Out
339,ModlerDK,Had great potential but didn't live up to the short film,6,26 July 2016,"I am a huge horror fan and the original Lights Out short film really scared me so my expectations were high - And with James Wan as a producer I had even higher hopes for this one! But unfortunately I don't love this movie as much as many others seem to do.The good things first: The acting is great and so are the characters and the story was pretty good. But this is why I am disappointed: It felt unfinished. I think it would have been great if they had chosen to dig deeper into the story of the Diana character, but the run time of the movie is pretty short and it became a bit rushed to me. The ""creature"" was also a lot scarier in the short film which disappointed me a bit, but I suppose that's a matter of taste. It seemed like a movie which didn't really know what it wanted to be – did it want to be a psychological drama with horror elements or a horror movie with a family drama in it? I think if they had chosen to go with the psychological thriller-drama with horror elements it would have been better, the subjects dealt with in the movie are very serious and it would have been interesting to see what they could have done, somewhat like the atmosphere of a movie like The Babadook which is one of my favorite horror movies. To wrap it up – it's a fine horror movie with lots of potential and some good elements, but it's not great, nor did it scare me that much. Even though this wasn't a favorite of mine I am interested to see more from Sandberg in the future, considering that his shorts films are really creepy.",Lights Out
340,DeadpanJoe,"Scare me twice, shame on me.",7,8 August 2016,"Lights Out is not the most original horror film, but what it does have is a premise that sets it up to be a great compilation of jump- scares, and it achieves just that. So rare it is to find a cliché horror film with the absence of some of the genre's most annoying clichés; there is no stupid character that causes the deaths of any of the other characters, the kid is finally believed by his adult counter-part from the get-go, and the heroine actually feels like someone who you'd want to be beside in a dark room. Overall, Lights Out is a fun and enjoyable horror film, however, you will find little to no substance with the story or expect it to break any new ground in the horror genre. Just gather a bunch of mates, eat some popcorn, and make sure the lights are turned all the way on...",Lights Out
341,MinhazReviewz,Great Potential but Looses grounds as the Film Progress,6,26 October 2016,"Based on the short horror film ""Lghts Out"" is a Swedish short supernatural horror film directed, written, produced, shot and scored by David F. Sandberg, known for his skills in budgeted film making showed some promising spooky highlights to scare the audience with the imagery of the entity who can only appear in the dark or else we can say it's afraid of the light. As the movie progress it shows the potential of plot twist but landed flat on the story telling part. The background story revolving the history of Diana is still ambiguous with less contrast on story the filmmakers failed to deliver the relationship of the mother (Sophie) with Diana. Except the weak story line, the film tries to engage the audience to keep them at their edge of their seat and definitely lights on.",Lights Out
342,aylagray99,"Fun, scary, AND good acting!",6,8 August 2016,"I heard many good reviews for this horror movie so of course I checked it out. From the very beginning everybody in the audience were whispering excitedly. The beginning of the movie set the tone for the whole movie, which was horrifying since it was in a shop full of mannequins. I also enjoyed when the police officers were at the scene where the monster was and one of the officers tried shooting the monster. After every round went off in the gun, the light would hit the monster causing it to go away and come back in a split of a second... Spooky!Some dislikes were that the backstory was a little confusing, but hey most horror movies are. Another one is that I wish there were more scary scenes of the monster torturing the main characters, because that thing was creepy.Overall this would be one of my favorite horror movies I've seen this year, it's one of those scary movies you like to tell your friends just to have them creeped out! It was also believable thanks to the extraordinary acting. My lights were definitely ON after I saw this movie.",Lights Out

I loved the originality of the story line and it will definitely touch base with some childhood fears. I can remember many times wondering what those weird noises were at grandmas house during the night. Those old farm houses could really creak and pop at night. If you truly want to get in touch with your fears, watch this movie in the dark. All in all what can I say, I hope they do the movie justice with the sequel.I gave this movie 10 stars and would recommend this movie to anyone that asks me about it.",Lights Out
344,aida091992,"My own interpretation, and loved it.",10,8 December 2016,"Excellent representation of depression. Diane represents black (negative automatic) thoughts. When person is in bad mood, specially in severely depressed state, it is all dark around her. In thoughts, of course. Fact that children saw Diane is that depression is partly heritage, partly factors of environment. Suicide part is usual characteristic of depression, and tough behavior of mother is what causes the children to suffer. That's why mother saved their lives, by taking her own. People whom she ''killed'' are actually feelings of guilt for certain behaviors, that is also typical for depression. I'm very thrilled by this movie.",Lights Out
345,natureman-27877,"Save Some Time and Money, Watch the Youtube Version.",5,20 June 2017,"I found myself really bored and not at all frightened throughout the film. Most of the film was spent with 2 characters talking about how bad the antagonist was, only 2 (possibly 3) people died throughout, and the attack sequences on the main characters were very repetitive and (this may be a minor spoiler) I never actually felt afraid that the characters would die (end possible spoiler).Though that may have actually been because none of the characters had enough depth for me to care about them. The main character had some potential for exploration when her mother mentioned ""She only pretends to be strong"" but that development died off soon after. Otherwise our protagonist seems like she's out of place; her apartment throughout the film looks like it's waiting for an emo girl with half a jewelry store on her face to come home and start crying eyeliner onto her pillow while listening to Avenged Sevenfold. Though our pretty blonde narrator does seem to cry eyeliner on occasion (a rather unexpected and slightly amusing touch) she looks like she would better fit in at a (shutters) KE$HA concert.....if those exist (shutters again).From a technical standpoint, I guess the lighting rigs combined with the camera work were clever. It had to be, the antagonist apparently can only attack in the dark.....or maybe not? why does she always wait to be seen before she attacks?.....except for those couple times....but she still has physical form and moves around in the light so that means when protagonist turns on the light RIGHT when she's about to get swiped she should've gotten swiped...whatever, I'd go back and verify but honestly, I don't think I can sit through the endless dialogue about the same thing every scene again. Anyway, I would've given this a 4.5 almost purely because the idea had potential and the rigging was cool. But I give it an extra half star because at least the main character was attractive. Just watch the Youtube version, it's scarier and only takes 5 minutes.",Lights Out

347,brijohns,"Good, not Great",7,22 July 2016,"The characters are likable, the premise frightening, and the storytelling good enough to keep people entertained and scared for an hour and a half.My only real complaint about the movie is that it doesn't leave a lasting impression. Everything feels like it's missing a crucial ingredient that could have turned this from a good film into a great film. The characters don't feel fully fleshed out. Ya, some of their backstories are kind of told, but they feel rushed and forced in in some cases. The ghost woman is great, but she shows up too much in the film. By the time it's over, your used to seeing her and expect her to pop out in every scene like a jack-in-the-box. And probably the biggest issue is that the ghost shows up right from the get go. There's no build-up to her reveal, no real questions about whether she exists or not, she's just BAM right there.But in the end these are minor complaints. I definitely enjoyed the film a lot more than I expected and would recommend it to any horror movie lover. I just wish it had a bigger impact.",Lights Out
348,slezak84,Quality scares.. but that's it.,7,28 July 2016,"The only reason my rating is higher than a 5/10 is because of the scares this film delivers. Sandberg has created an idea that most of the audience can relate to, and that's being afraid of the dark. The main antagonist, Diana, only shows up when there are no lights on inside the homes of Rebecca and Sophie. The film has you holding your breath whenever the lights go out, expecting the ominous, breathtaking creature to show up somewhere in the room. As an audience, we don't see much of Diana's actual appearance until the end of the movie. Hiding the details of her skin kept us on the edge of our seats, for we didn't want to see what she actually looked like.As for the acting, mechanics, plot line, and execution, Lights Out didn't leave a lasting impression like other great horror films. As each incident occurred, we don't see true terror in the eyes of Rebecca and Martin, as if they expect everything going on and are just caught off guard when Diana comes around. We see our three characters near the end of the film; Rebecca, Martin, and Bret, walking around in the threatening shadows of the house without much fear.All in all, this film deserves a sequel because of the scare tactics. Hopefully some of the other problems are cleaned up by the time the second movie is released.",Lights Out

Just because it's a good movie, a good movie that needs 2hrs for me to be satisfied. Watching a lot of horror movies, Lights Out somehow deserves my 10 rating, to be simple, I enjoyed watching it. There's no boring scenes and it has a great concept. Plus the people inside the cinema were screaming so loud, we even applauded the scene of Rebecca's boyfriend. I just wish that this movie should've focus on the psychological side, it would have been better that way I think. I really felt that they rushed the movie to be short. There should have been more scenes to support what we have watched at the trailer, that made us to expect high to this film. But overall, this movie standout and worth watching.",Lights Out
350,chiragvpatel,The Re-birth of Horror Genre!!!!!,10,12 July 2016,Going into this movie I expected much less than what the typical horror movie Genre is today in this generation. Well I will be damned!!! I had tickets to go see an early screening of this movie and let me tell you from Men to Women everyone was tense in the audience. Lots of people jumping in their seats and screams as well. This movie hit the spot from the acting which was sub-par from the evil entity. I give this movie a 10 out of 10. Most people should really give it a try it is worth the money for sure. The film is only 85 minutes which was a downfall but I will take it versus a 2 hour horror movie that is boring till no end. If the media is calling Conjuring 2 horror then Lights Out must be in a different horror category because it is def. SCARY!!!!,Lights Out
351,Robot_Fireman,Charming and pleasant to watch Mediocrity,5,24 July 2016,"I was looking forward to seeing LIGHTS OUT in the theatre. I'm always interested when an amateur director of a promising short is offered the chance to make a feature film out of his neat, little idea. For anyone who hasn't seen the shortfilm LIGHTS OUT by David F. Sandberg on which this movie is based, go check it out, it's on Youtube. It's funny and creepy at the same time and develops quite a charme in just 3 minutes.However, i have to say, when it comes to the full lentgh version of the film, it is simply not more than an above average horrorflic that definitely shows a potential in a young director who hopefully hones his skills in his projects. Compared to most other horrorfilms of late, LIGHTS OUT is definitely better than works like ANNABELLE, OUIJA, THE WOMAN IN BLACK 2, SINISTER 2, INSIDIOUS 2+3 or THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, but sadly this doesn't say all too much. Those Assembly-Line-Horrorfilms simply suck. It is also not quite on the same Level as 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE, THE BABADOOK or IT FOLLOWS, let alone the cinematic powerhouses of the last century.What I liked about the movie is the cinematography and the building of tension. The camera work isn't very dynamic, but the scenes are always crisp and clear. The angles are well chosen. The play with light and shadow is very creative and leads to moments that are tense as well as funny, e.g. in the scene where a red neon light is shining in intervals through the window of Beccas bedroom and the creature only shows itself when said light is switched off. All the horror scenes are well directed and even the occasionally thrown in jumpscares suit the situations mostly well. It's a constant back and forth between the chilling, tense absence of the creepy creature and the terror that unfolds when it finally shows itself. The horror aspect of LIGHTS OUT definitely works.However, the framework that holds everything together is simply underwhelming due to a boring script and a lack of experience when it comes to direct emotionally charged character interaction. The characters in the film are likable (especially Beccas boyfriend, who's struggling hard to convince her to open up to him and is very sympathetic in his clumsiness and earnestness) and we spend quite some time to just learn about them, but the movie doesn't do much with it. Especially when you consider that the movie is about a terrifying monster that comes across as scary and brutal in the well realized opening, the rest of the film is simply too harmless, undisturbing and shallow. Everything boils down to a very simple family drama without ever delving too deep into the regions of mental disorder or the disruption of family ties upon which the film touches. Also, for the most time, everything that the creature does is nothing more than a clawed hand shooting out of the dark and grabbing at one of the protagonists.Additionally, the creature seems to be quite stupid. It's motivation is - as is revealed about half into the movie - to be left alone. However, when it seeks out Becca in her apartment, revealing its presence to her and even scratching its name into the floorboards, it does provoke exactly the opposite. Also, the backstory of the creature is delivered in rather lame exposition and is overall pretty messy. The script could have done a way better job at presenting an engaging mystery here.So overall, LIGHTS OUT manages to provide short, effective and tense moments of horror and develops at least characters that are likable. That makes it entertaining to watch but overall pretty forgettable. It's never really bad, but also lacks moments that are really memorable (apart from the scene with the car keys, that one was awesome). Thus, I enjoyed it, but I probably do not have to see it again anytime soon.",Lights Out

In the movie there were some down falls to it. Like how at some parts it was to predictable, but I won't tell what parts so I won't spoil it. Also, the acting wasn't the best.

The acting is horrible, especially that mom, man she dumb as f-, everything is delivered over the top extra edgy and sh-t, i couldn't keep watching man. The daughter character is a walking cliché, there's a7x posters on her walls, she dating a sinister gates lookalike, the green bong in her apartment like ""sh---t, i'm this edgy messy chick man."", the back story for Diana is paper thin, the movie doesn't even let us in on her friendship with the mom and we're all expected to feel empathetic towards it, weak as sh-t angle. The dude is a complete goofball and his existence sh-ts all over the plot, which in itself is already sh-t. At first i thought this might be good, like maybe if it was told from a psychological disorder angle, but instead we get this f-King x-men mutant character with origins that make zero sense, they barely even expand on the father's character, it's like names keep popping up but there's zero emotional connection to them, like who even the f-ck is that, WHO THE F-CK IS DIANA?! was she like a lesbian lover? a coworker? a patient? WHOSE patient? What kind of experimenting were they doing on her cause it kinda sounded like they were just straight up murdering her. There's plot holes everywhere, but you know what?

It just works, so good, and I was super excited about the feature. So it hurts to say that the feature is far from the clever short. Why? They milk the concept bone dry in a couple of minutes. You get it all in the intro and everything after the title is just a downward spiral with a bunch of desperate attempts to keep it going. I hoped this could be a great feature version of the weeping angles from Doctor Who. If you haven't seen that you should watch the episode ""Blink"" right now. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1000252/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2Some of my favorite horror movies are the original Chainsaw Massacre, Blair witch project and The Evil Dead. What do they have in common? They leave a lot to your own imagination. You get bits and pieces of explanation but they never give too much. They let you fill in most of the blanks. Lights out wants to explain all of it and centers the whole story about that explanation. In that way they miss the thing that made the concept so good.

However, cringy dialog, particularly from the kid, as well as indecision in the film direction and dumb character decisions quickly derail the movie off the tracks.
Ultimately, the movie is unsure of what it wants to be, a monster movie (like 2013 movie Mama) or a movie about depression and grief (like Babadook from 2014), and it ends up failing as both, coming short of both movies which deal with subjects much better.

Second half is too damn awesome. Movie is completely different from the trailer. The story is good. but i am telling you, this movie is scariest one. The second half is full of jump scare. you are gonna surely jump out of your seat. Finally the horror genre is at track. Wish to see more movies like this. This movie is a perfect treat for horror movies lover like me.",Lights Out
379,megacooo,"Child fears in a new ""light"".",9,26 July 2016,"Based on the short film by David F. Sandberg ""Lights out"" is a fun summer time-waster, or at least that's what i thought it would be. The story is a bit hard to understand and follow at the beginning of the movie. We are introduced to the ""remains"" of once a healthy and happy family that is now terrorized by one of the family's members past. The main perspective, that we witness, is mainly by the children Rebecca and Martin and their struggle with the family problems and the horror that surrounds them. Teresa Palmer and Gabriel Bateman played their parts equally well and i did feel for them, which is a great start for a horror movie.The whole scare effect is pretty simple. The light is your friend. An idea that we are familiar with since little. This movie brings exactly that inner horror of what is in the darkness. What we cant see but it is there. The movie had some chilling moments playing with shadows and lights. The balance between those two was very intense and to be honest surprisingly creative. There were a couple of jump scares in the movie, that were nothing unseen before and i think that the movie knew this and did not capitalize on them a lot.The monster/creature had a riveting story but i felt that it needed a bit more clarification in some aspects. What was given as an explanation was enough to continue the development of the plot and keep your interest.I liked how the characters in the story were not helpless and actually thinking about their well-being. They knew what was happening and had an idea how to protect themselves. Those are some simple survival mechanics that made the experience more engaging.Intriguing plot. Great ambiance. Good performances by the actors. Thats all you need for an entertaining horror movie. If you are a fan of the genre i strongly recommend you to see ""Lights out"".",Lights Out

I don't have high expectations for horror films lately, even though I love them, and this one was very tempting. It was OK, though fairly confusing at the start, can't really tell how the first scene (with the creators of that short) had to do with the rest of the movie for awhile. Middle part OK. The main character needs to quit running her hands over her face in frustration. We get it, you're an anguished, punk-rock tattoo artist. Scary. This development has literally nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Glad we did that. So then there's some running around scary stuff. And then...the end is just effing depressing. Suicide isn't the way to wrap up any story. It's horrible. Daughter suddenly finds out her mom was in an asylum and mom kills herself to protect her family? Ughhh creators! You could have done so much with this. This ended up so cliché and also like...do you know how depressing suicide is? It's awful. It's not a feel good murder-mystery moment.",Lights Out

Considering that this movie is PG-13, it was pretty good. Unlike many actors in other horror movies, these actors presented really well. Not even ten minutes in, the horror"" started. I thought that was pretty unique. I enjoyed the movie, but I feel that it climaxed too soon. I wish would have dragged out the plot ine a little longer. It seemed as if a lot of backstory was left out, there was not really much of a backstory at all. Overall good, not great movie. I'd watch again.

386,jason_davidking1289,"A Brilliant, Genuinely Scary Horror Film",9,6 September 2016,"Although horror is one of my favourite genres I find myself always sceptical and almost worried that i will be let down by horror films either from the plot, the acting or the construction. 'Light out' was great in all areas. It nailed the character build. the plot was solid. the ghost 'Diana' had a unique weakness; that bought a different dimension to the film and made the story feel more immersive and drew me in further. My only complaint would have been the way they discover the history of the ghost. it just seemed a little cliché and rushed. However a horror wouldn't be a horror without a little cliché ! With that being said i conclude 'lights out' had me jumping out of my seat and covering my eyes and ears which is exactly what you should want from a good modern scary film !i always believe you should watch a horror movie on your own, in the dark, without distraction; to give it the fairest test.

Not bad for a summer fright fest, but don't expect more as you won't find it here. Technically it looked and sounded great, with a notable crazy-mom performance from Maria Bello. If you've seen the director's original short you've basically seen this movie already, however if you're looking for a quick scare without a lot of substance this should do the trick. For a good storyline with stylish direction look elsewhere, as the missed opportunities pile up rather quickly with this one.",Lights Out
388,pihingko,Excellent and well-directed horror films in such a long time,10,23 July 2016,"(Spoiler Alert: Some things in here are spoilers) The incredible filmmaker David F Sandberg debuts his first horror film. This movie is called ""Lights Out"". In this film, the cliché moves aren't really present. The characters make decisions that are smart and beneficial to their own safety. For example, when Bret (Alexander Dipersia) was being chased by Diana, he used his brain properly. He used his phone as lights and even used the lights in front of his car. The characters are picked perfectly especially Maria Bello who plays as Sophie or the mother of Rebecca (Palmer) and Martin (Bateman). You can actually see through her as she acts so genuinely and into character. Teresa Palmer is perfect too. She nailed the ""bad girl"" vibe that is supposed to be in her character. Gabriel Bateman as Martin is also perfect. You can see him trying to get a grasp on the character he is portraying and of course Alexander DiPersia, ""bad boy"" vibe was perfectly done and the chemistry between him and Teresa was there. The ""monster"" Diana, played by Alicia, was perfect. The gestures, the body shape, the scare factor is so present that sometimes you wonder ""Is she really not a CGI-generated character?"" The scares were actually used a few times over and over but something about it is so suspenseful and so scary that it keeps you every single time. The stories of these characters are very unexpected and very unusual starting off with her mother. Her mother was in a mental hospital back then when she was still a kid. The voice of Diana also added up to the scariness in the film. Diana's voice reminds me so much a demon-possessed person. The family problems were also laid out quite properly. They presented us with the statement of Sophie "" she left me when things got hard"" and ""she acts like she's strong but she's really not."" A dysfunctional family with the headmaster dead and a mentally-ill mother. Even though it is such a short movie, it still makes up with the fun ride and the scary phases that you are left to cope with when you watch it. Others may find it ""stupid"" but for me, it is a milestone marking the rebirth of the horror genre.",Lights Out
389,johara-84536,A well made horror film with an original plot.,8,26 July 2016,"As I was walking into the theater I had high expectations of or this movie, the thing about Lights Out, is they start the action way too early. Within the first five minutes of the movie people in the theater started to jump. Lights Out also relies on jump scares to scare the audience.One thing about this movie is it does have an original plot with hardly any clichés, and that's what drew me to this movie it wasn't some shitty slasher movie that had already been done thousands of times.This move is mildly violent and pretty terrifying for small children, so if you're kids are fine with scary movies they should be able to watch it because the violence really isn't an issue. there is one scene where you see a bong in a woman's apartment, but a 10 year old kid won't even know what that is. They say b**ch and sh*t once in a while, but that's pretty much it the language isn't really an issue. Don't listen to the crap on common sense of media that says you should be 15 to watch this movie. I think you should be 10 or 11 to see this move if you are fine with horror.One of The only big things wrong with this movie is the fact that they rely on jump scares to scare people, a good horror movie stays with you once you levee the theater",Lights Out
390,mayukhsuperb,Best of recent times,10,30 July 2016,"If you loved Conjuring, if you love Japanese style horror flicks this is the one for you. The best horror movies are the ones where you don't actually see the ghost. And that's where this movie strikes. It was s**t scary for most of the people I went to see the movie with. A very good script, very good acting, nice VFX adds to the pros. Only con I would point out is a bit unnecessary use of sounds to give the pang. I feel it would have been better without.Overall a very nice ride for the ones looking for textbook horror movies.P.S. It is high time scriptwriters should understand that ghosts aren't electrical engineers. They make me feel I have studied all in vain. :p",Lights Out
391,jasperjd-50434,One of the worst horror flicks i've seen in a long time,3,2 August 2016,"***SPOILERS*** Lights out is one of those movie concepts that sounds really interesting on paper, but falls flat on its face and breaks its nose as soon as it starts moving.It's a jump-scare filled slug that fails to impress, featuring a boring cast with no real personality, illogical decisions to try and make you jump, and a monster that doesn't even follow her own rules.The massive problem is the star of the movie itself: Diana. She's an evil woman that follows the mother of two kids, and relies on the mother suffering to survive her self. The problem with Diana is that she breaks her own rules all the bloody time. One moment she needs people to open the doors for herself, the next she's teleporting around like she's a god. In the next moment she might disappear when you flash a light at her, or she might decide to stand there and burn while screaming her lungs out.Diana herself doesn't seem to have any real goal other than being a jerk. She needs the mother to be depressed or she disappears *supposedly* but then decides to hunt her kids when they're trying to avoid her, which in theory she should be grateful for.Diana is also about as subtle as a Train wreck. Whenever she appears the music blats your ears in an attempt to scare you, but when you close your ears *since it's always easy to predict where she will be* and just look at the scene, you realize Diana is about as scary as Mickey Mouse with fangs.Characters also do the stupidest of things, like walking TOWARDS where they know Diana might be, instead of staying in a lit area where they're safe. And the excuse ""they don't know better"" is not valid, since the entire family knows Diana is real, and has multiple scars and wounds to show from it.In conclusion, Lights out is a poorly thought out movie that would have been better off staying as a short film. The only real good thing about the movie is that none of the ""living"" characters are inhumanly bastards. Don't waste your time.",Lights Out

The story behind the girl in the shadows is pretty interesting and you get to fall in love with the boy and his sister. You feel sad when the mom dies but relieved when you realized there's no more demon. This movie basically gives you a lot of emotions and its worth watching. James Wan, being the producer of this movie (not the director) really executes this well and helps the actors to give up their bests. This is definitely a box office hit and it could be one of the best horror movies of 2016. I really hope they make a sequel, but it better not ruin the original.",Lights Out

As a warning to anyone like me who would like to spend their time watching a scary movie with at least some substance and intelligence. A movie that was mentioned on Swedish national television, so even if I didn't expect ""Shining"" at least I thought there was some meaning of watching. The ""scary"" effect of pushing an ugly undefined shadow monster in the shade (each time with a boost of the soundtrack) and then move it up your face is the ""scary"" thing here. That's it. That's what the around 80 minutes are spent for. Story? Did you want that as well?I hear it was ""adapted"" from some YouTube clip that was a success. Well, I guess it might scare someone the first time as an effect but why couldn't that stay in the format of a YouTube shorty? The ""movie"" isn't more that that, believe me. Repeated over and over and linked by a script that is more than awful. The absolute first scene, when a woman (not a character of the movie more than that), see the shadow and not while turning light on and off, had something. With skill they could have been doing something from that. Instead, from that, it falls deep into the worst kind of C-movie trash you can imagine.It's just sad that this is ""entertainment"" of today. Is it that people totally addicted to click on all kinds of clips on the internet? Many click and a producer put some money in making crap that don't even is a story.To be honest I was bored and gradually annoyed the first 30 minutes of this. I stayed another 30 minutes and nothing developed at all. My interest was in how a script like this could develop into anything at all. Nothing in it was even related to something of substance and anything was allowed without any reason. No character even bothered to act in consequence with anything. Their decisions was so totally out of making human conclusions as possible.The last 20 minutes I jumped, just to see how bad the ending could be. No surprise there. It's just as bad as rest of the movie. Shame to the producer. Shame to the writers. who just as well could be a bunch of stoned teenagers a very late night. The director (my shame as he's a swede) and the actors got payed. Good for them.I can enjoy ""supernatural"" movies if the story has some kind of quality.

400,eladiasimonekennedy,Note: this review might have a some spoilers in it.,10,2 November 2017,"Lights OutOne of the scariest films I've seen is called Lights Out. This movie was directed by David Sandberg, who is actually a Swedish film director. He is mainly known for his short horror films, but he has gotten most of his recognition from Lights Out. The movie came out in theaters in 2016. There aren't any really big known actors in this movie, but everyone plays their part well. This whole movie will have you on edge, and it escalates pretty quickly. I've seen the movie twice, and it still makes me jump during the scary scenes.Lights Out is about a family that is haunted by a female ghost named ""Diana"", that was once the mother's friend when she was a little girl. She is a tall, skinny, and dark figure who attacks them in the dark because when she was alive she has a skin condition that would not let her be exposed to any light. The ghost haunts the little brother first, then his older sister, who gets involved while trying to help him. Unfortunately, the mother has issues because the ghost tends to get inside of her head and manipulate her into thinking everything is OK, so at first she doesn't see her as a problem. The ghost wants to control the mother, so it takes away both of her husbands to keep her all for herself. The rest of the movie shows how the ghost is trying to take away both of her children as they find out more about who she was, and ways to get rid of her for good.When I first saw the film, I was very excited because it had just came out in theaters. I already knew it was going to be scary, and it kept me on edge, which made it even better. In the theater, there was a lot of people, and they all would scream or jump during the crazy scenes. The way the ghost looked and acted in the movie was so creepy that it made me want to close my eyes but keep them open at the same time to see her next move. Something that stuck out to me was how they had her kill somebody in the beginning of the movie. It didn't actually show her kill the guy in the beginning, but you saw how he looked afterwards. For me, I just think it was wild how they had the movie climax, and scare me that early. The characters played their parts really well. It wasn't one of those movies where there was too much acting from the characters, or too little acting either. I personally didn't want any of the main characters to die because they were all good people. They were all scared, but still stuck together and made an effort to help each other when in danger, which I liked a lot. Unfortunately the mother died. I felt bad about that even though at first, she wasn't really on her children's side, but towards the end, she was. One of the good things about the movie was that the filming was good. On the scenes where the ghost would speed up, the camera stayed still and was clear. It didn't shake or move from her trying to attack the other characters. I think movies that do that are annoying, because then the audience can't really see what is going on. Of course the sounds that came out during the scary scenes were good too. Overall the qualities of the movie were good.The movie kept my family, friends, other people, and me on edge in the theater. It got reactions out of everyone in there. The second time I watched it, I had friends with me that never seen it, and they reacted the same way I did, maybe more scared. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get scared by a movie with a good story line. The whole display and all the climaxed scenes will keep you on the edge of your seats. If you look up the percent on Google of how many people liked the movie it would show 82%. It'll pop up right on your screen on the right, Also if you watch the trailer, I'm sure it would convince you to go see it. My thoughts on the movie before I saw it was that I wouldn't jump as much as I did, but I was wrong. I personally thought it was a good horror movie.",Lights Out
