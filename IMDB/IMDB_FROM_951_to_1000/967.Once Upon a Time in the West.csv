0,MartinHafer,"Before you have a stroke, please read WHY I was not entirely impressed by this film (then, you can hate me)",8,27 August 2006,"I have absolutely loved the Sergio Leone ""Spaghetti Westerns"" that he made before ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. So, given that I have given very positive reviews for FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE and THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY, my being far from impressed with this film isn't because I dislike the genre or have it out for Mr. Leone! No, I have some legitimate reasons why I think the film is overrated--certainly very few of the IMDb users can honestly think this movie is one of the best 25 movies of all-time (despite its high IMDb score).The biggest problem is the terribly slow pacing. While none of his films of the genre are fast-paced, they are deliberately paced and hold your interest. However, this film could easily have had 45 to 60 minutes chopped out of it without a major negative impact on the movie. The buildup is just way too long and drawn out to allow this to be a great film. Self-indulgent in its pacing, yes, but not great. I don't want to watch Jack Elam blowing a fly off his face again and again and again. I don't want to see closeups of the actors eyes again and again and again. And I certainly do not want to have a scene take three times longer than it would in any other Western! The second biggest problem is that although the film seems like a meticulous labor of love in some places, a few other ones it is just plain sloppy. The absolute worst is the actor who seems to play a younger version of Charles Bronson. Not only does it look almost nothing like him, but the eye color doesn't even match--and considering all the closeups of eyes, this is just sloppy (Bronson's are bright blue-gray and the other has dark brown eyes). Also, in a few other places it looks like scenes were missing as the movie just jumped from one scene to another--and I DID watch the extended version of the movie, not the edited version. And finally, how Jason Robards was able to carry on the entire final portion of the movie--apparently fine--only to keel over dead in the very end just seemed ridiculous and sloppy.Now as far as what I liked (and boy did I want to like this film). I loved having nice-guy Henry Fonda play a cold-blooded creep. This was great. And, although I generally hated the long, slow pace, the opening scene was worth the very long wait. The music, while not Ennio Marricone's very best, was still excellent and haunting. My advice is see these other Leone Westerns and then compare them. Even THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY (a very, very long movie as well) is much faster paced than this film.",Once Upon a Time in the West
1,TheLittleSongbird,One of the biggest and boldest westerns you will ever see,10,9 January 2011,"Although I have not seen all his films, I have yet to see a Sergio Leone film I hate. The movies I have seen of his are visually gorgeous with superb scores and interesting stories and characters. Once Upon a Time in the West is no exception. It is long and slow, but I think the film was deliberately paced like that.Once Upon a Time in the West does take a lot of risks, including improvising the action around the score's moods. This was a risk that paid off. The story is rich and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking and beautifully written. Leone also proved what a fine director he was by directing so wonderfully on this film.The characters are great and quite complex, and are further advantaged by being wonderfully portrayed. There is the brutish gunfighter, the beautiful widow, the mysterious harmonica player and the sympathetic outlaw. Henry Fonda particularly does brilliantly in the role of Frank. The visuals once again are exquisite and quite grandiose in its scope and beauty, while Ennio Morricone's wonderfully operatic-like score fully justifies why he is considered one of the all-time great film composers.All in all, a big and bold western and one unlike any other. It also took risks, ones which could have gone horribly wrong but due to the evident work and care of all involved, they paid off. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Once Upon a Time in the West
2,bkoganbing,Some American Meatballs In A Spaghetti Western,6,19 April 2008,"I have never been crazy about foreign made westerns because in my humble opinion it's an original American art form. We don't do Shakespeare or Moliere or Cervantes in American cinema, why do Europeans insist on a pale imitation of a uniquely American contribution to cinema? Not they've done bad westerns all the time, Once Upon A Time In The West is not a bad film. I've just never accorded it the landmark status that some give it.Still Sergio Leone certainly packed this film with enough American names so that it does read like a cast John Ford could have put together. In Ford's last western with Henry Fonda, Fonda played the ramrod martinet Colonel Thursday who led his troops into a massacre because of his pursuit of glory. That was as close to a villain Fonda ever played on the screen before. Leone made Fonda ratchet his game up several notches in villainy, he's truly evil here. Fonda's a man in the pay of the railroad who wants to get a homestead family off a particularly important piece of land. Fonda also goes and frames another outlaw gang headed by Jason Robards, Jr. for the evil deed. But what no one figures on is that the homesteader had gone and married a second wife played by Claudia Cardinale. She's got the land now.She's also got a mysterious guy with a harmonica played by Charles Bronson helping her while he's pursuing his own agenda. Who he is and what the agenda he's following is something you would watch Once Upon A Time In The West to find out.I've never been terribly crazy about the music Leone employs here. Some folks swear by it, but for me I'll take John Ford's use of American melodies any day and twice on Sunday. And although Jason Robards, Jr. has a beautiful death scene, it was copied in part from what Sam Peckinpah did with Joel McCrea in Ride the High Country.Still with a cast that also includes people like Keenan Wynn, Jack Elam, and Woody Strode there are enough Americans who know their way around the Hollywood west to give it a familiar ring. Once Upon A Time In The West is a decent enough western, but hardly rates landmark status.",Once Upon a Time in the West
3,Leofwine_draca,"In a word, masterful",9,22 September 2016,"A lyrical, thoughtful spaghetti western from Sergio Leone which is considered by many to be one of the best westerns ever made - with good reason. Although the pacing is deliberately slow, each scene is lovingly crafted in a unique stylish way which makes it a film like no other. The plot, concerning the development of a new railway line which cuts through the old western homes and towns, is a thinly-disguised metaphor of the end of the Old West and the ushering in of a new era, and the film is appropriately respectful and maudlin in tone.Ennio Morricone contributes possibly one of the best scores of his career, and great use is made of sound effects (especially unnatural silence) as well as the breathtaking images of deserts and mountains. The acting is, of course, of the highest order, from a well-familiar cast. Charles Bronson gives one of his best turns as the enigmatic loner dedicated to fighting the bad; his harmonica riff just adds to the character. Henry Fonda makes a cold, ruthless villain, while Jason Robards has the sympathetic role of an ex-criminal turned good. Claudia Cardinale proves herself to be a force to be reckoned with, as well as beautiful, and there are wonderful bit parts from Woody Strode and Jack Elam as hit-man.With an interesting script from the later maestro of horror, Dario Argento, and expert direction from one of Italy's most famous directors, everything about this movie is a classic. It has been proclaimed - rightly so - as one of the best (if not the best) westerns of all time. A true epic.",Once Upon a Time in the West
4,SnoopyStyle,symphonic style,9,25 July 2015,"The man with a Harmonica (Charles Bronson) arrives at a desolate train station. He's met by three gunmen sent by Frank (Henry Fonda) and he promptly kills them. Jill (Claudia Cardinale) is a new young bride from New Orleans. She arrives to live with her husband Brett McBain and his family in an isolated desert homestead he calls Sweatwater. She finds the whole McBain family massacred. Cheyenne (Jason Robards) is the prime suspect but he joins her along with Harmonica to seek revenge on the real killers, Frank and his men who are working for the railroad.This is a western dripping with the Sergio Leone style. The story is simple. It's a lot of attitude. The movie starts with the great Harmonica arrival scene. Woody Strode and Jack Elam are so great that I wish they survived to stay in the movie. A minor problem is that the opening scene is so great that the rest of the movie struggles at times to return to that level.",Once Upon a Time in the West
5,Horst_In_Translation,"The good, the bad and the.... err. good (again)? Gritty? Take your pick.",6,4 August 2019,"""C'era una volta il West"" or ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is an Italian/American co-production from 1968, so this one had its 50th anniversary last year and that sadly also means that most of the people working on it are long gone, which includes director Leone and his two co-writers Bertolucci and Argento (what a line-up) as well as the three male actors at the center of the movie. Still central female actress Cardinale and composer Morricone are still alive. But we can also be grateful for what all of them left us. I can somehat see why this western here is still so much later appreciated by so many as it sits comfortably in the imdb top 250, top50 even. Many maybe consider it the second best western ever made behind Good, Bad and Ugly, but maybe it is not too good to compare these two because while there are parallels, there are also significant differences. The other was set against Civil War with honestly this war not having too much of an impact on the movie and the protagonists. Here the setting is the expansion of the railroad through America and how greedy railroad tycoons and their henchmen are not scared of blackmail, extortion and murder in order to get what they want, even if honestly the guy with the crudges is just a leech and his motivation to see the Pacific Ocean is not entirely vile. But Frank's is. Still I felt he was a bit weak to be the main antagonist, even if Henry Fonda is a talented actor without a doubt. But come on he needed saving by Harmonica from his own men, he did not show up to the early meeting, he knows nothing about the power of money and of course there would be no way he could survive a gunfight against our hero. Speaking of the latter, the actor is Charles Bronson and while I have not seen him in anything else there is no denying the great screen presence he has here. His first two scenes when he plays the harmonica felt a bit strange, so I needed a bit to get used to it, but eventually I appreciated it. It also worked really nice as the soundtrack for the film which was great anyway (Morricone!), so the soundtrack was part of the film itself. Smart move there. And the final explanation scene why specifically a harmonica in the flashback to his youth was really nice too with him giving the harmonica back in the now then to the guy who killed his father. Although I think the age difference between Harmonica and Frank was maybe a bit too big in the flashback. Bronson looked older than he was anyway. But also how he quotes the names of the killed when asked for his name was nice as if he was some revenge angel to them.Now another character I did not mention yet is played by the stunning Claudia Cardinale in her late 20s here I think. She looks so much better with dark hair in my opinion. I think she was a really nice inclusion. It sure isn't easy to come up with a strong female character in a so very male-dominated western, but they did a pretty good job for sure. Cheyenne summarizes her really nicely and though it may sound vulgar to the untrained ear, he means it the most respectful way you could think of. Actually the comment about ass-grabbing and the actual act towards the end will be scenes that hopeless gender equality warriors these days will certainly not like very much. Oh well, times were different back then, mind over matter you could say. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter. Or if Cardinale, for that matter. Now eventually there is no way I can continue this review without mentioning Jason Robards. I also remember liking his performance the most when I watched this movie for the first time and nothing has changed. His introduction with all the gunshooting going on outside and him coming out alive and unharmed was really funny when he enters the saloon, like Tuco's really brief introduction in the other movie I mentioned early on. And Cheyenne (Robards) just does so much for me here, the epitome of an outstanding supporting character. Shame this film did not get any award/Oscar recognition at all basically. I will not really go into detail about Cheyenne's best scenes, but Robards has such amazing screen presence which made it mesmerizing for me to watch (him). I would love to see more from him for sure soon. And I will! I really hated that they killed him off out of nowhere in the end, probably only in an unnecessary attempt to show us Harmonica is the most badass and he is the only one from the guys coming out alive, especially because Cheyenne's death was so out of nowhere. I mean okay it made sense with the scene we saw including the railroad baron being hurt and desperately going for the water, but come on really, this toad is the one who kills Cheyenne? Struggling with that. Now away from him, this film will not make you laugh as much as Good, Bad and Ugly, especially in the second half it is all serious drama and western action basically, but I still want to mention a few moments that were pretty funny (also from the cool perspective). First would be when Harmonica says ""you brought two too many"" and the faces by the crooks. By the way that introduction sequence was reeeeeeallllly long. But it worked without a doubt thanks to Leone's great attention to detail. Okay the second funny moment is when the barkeeper at the saloon continues talking to the lady after the gun action is over as if nothing happened. That was certainly funny. And wait there was another moment right before that I remember. Let me think. Yes it was the one where he says inside the men there were three bullets. That was actually maybe the most laugh-out-loud moment of the entire film.Okay so overall, it is not one of my very favorite westerns, but again it works nicely for the most part and had me curious about what would happen next. It is worth seeing for the characters alone, some of them truly memorable, the acting, almost not a single false note and of course also for Morricone's music. I was lucky enough to see this one here in Berlin as part of a retrospective on Morricone's gigantic body of work and I sure enjoyed doing so. Yes this is a really long movie at over 2.5 hours, but it is also rewarding. I am not sure if it is necessary for me to give a recommendation though. I mean everybody who is just one bit into western films will truly like this one, but those who aren't will maybe also not be won over by this one unfortunately. So their loss then I suppose. I hope you are among the former because then you are in for soemthing great here, but lets be honest: You really have seen this film by now anyway haven't you? It's considered a classic with more than just a few memorable moments. I can't say I know much about the cast honestly beyond the key players. Well wait I have come across Woody Strode I believe, but he is gone quickly anyway, so yeah. Oh and another reason to watch this film here is Claudia Cardinale, who is really the prime example of how to make a female character in maybe the most male-oriented genre interesting and deep and not just include her for her admittedly stunning looks. I can see why Frank couldn't resist either. In contrast to the two good guys, that is. She was still a bit in mourning over her husband, so it is all good they did not include a forced love story, even if probably it would have worked if she had accompanied Harmonica in the end on horseback. Oh well, he is still a loner. Always has been always will be, but like he says who knows if he ever returns. I probably will return to this movie and give it another watch one day, but not right away. That much it did not win me over. Until then, I give this one a thumbs-up and very much recommend you to check it out if you haven't already.",Once Upon a Time in the West
6,Prismark10,The harmonica player,8,13 September 2014,"Once upon a time in the west has taken its time to achieve classic status in comparison to Sergio Leone's other western. The reasons, no Clint Eastwood and Henry Fonda playing a bad guy which was a turn off for American audiences at the time.Charles Bronson plays Harmonica, the hero of the story but like Eastwood's cowboy with no name this is a hero with rough edges. He has ghosts to exorcise.Leone takes his time to tell his epic story, with visuals and music playing an important part as the story. There is plenty of sly humour, plenty of stillness.Bronson who started out playing bad guys and graduated eventually to hero status is inspired casting as Harmonica. Claudia Cardinale is beautiful and alluring as the former good time girl who comes to town and immediately becomes a widow. Jason Robards also gives a powerful performance as an outlaw with a heart and tenderness towards Cardinale's widow.Henry Fonda relishes playing a villain but I can understand the audience of the day being conflicted, just as as modern day audience would be uneasy seeing Robert Redford playing a bad guy in some Marvel film!The film lacks the immediate attention of the Dollars trilogy, but as you watch it you appreciate this movie just as time itself has been kind to it and its reputation has soared.",Once Upon a Time in the West
7,claudio_carvalho,One of the Best Cowboy Movies (or Maybe the Best) Ever Made  A Masterpiece,10,30 November 2003,"Three bad guys stay in a station waiting for the train. Along more than ten minutes, there is a disturbing lack of action, with minor details being presented: a fly, a drop of water. Then, Harmonica (Charles Bronson, maybe in his best performance on the screen) arrives and there is a short but spectacular dialog between the characters. The next scene, the viewer sees a family being massacred by Frank (Henry Fonda, with a stunning performance). Then we have a long shot and panoramic scene in a station, with the arrival of Jill (Claudia Cardinale, with such a remarkable  beauty and performance). And last but not the least, there is a scene in a road bar, where we are introduced to the character of Cheyenne (Jason Robard, in a spectacular performance). The introduction of this four main characters is slow, but very well presented. And this will be the tonic of this film: slow, but very well constructed scenes and characters. The story was written by Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci, therefore it does not need any further explanation. All supported by the magnificent, wonderful, stunning, marvelous, fantastic soundtrack of Ennio Morricone. Another masterpiece of Sergio Leone. The DVD just released in Brazil in special edition, with two discs and lots of extras, deserves a special observation. Congratulations to Paramount: Sergio Leone, writers, screenplayers, actors, actresses, crew and the fans really deserve such a respectful edition! My vote is ten.",Once Upon a Time in the West
8,classicsoncall,"""I have a feelin' when he stops whittlin', somethin's gonna happen.""",9,23 September 2007,"When composer Ennio Morricone first got the script for ""Once Upon A Time In The West"", he was so impressed with the story that he began writing the music for it immediately. The entire movie was scored before even a single frame was shot, and Sergio Leone liked it so much that he had portions played for the actors while rehearsing to get them to 'flow' with the music. One could go so far as to say that a good part of the picture was filmed to the score! It took me a long time to get around to this film, but it was certainly worth the wait. Any movie that opens with Jack Elam and Woody Strode has got to get your attention, but when their characters didn't survive the opening sequence, I knew this was going to be something special. Actually, having seen Elam in countless movies and TV Western episodes, I can safely say that this is the best performance I've ever seen him in. His sparring with the fly to the omnipresent creak of the windmill was an inspired piece of work, and if you didn't know anything about the story going in, you would think that these players would have a major role in the story to come. And then Bronson appears! And then Henry Fonda appears. Curiously, his character's name was Frank. It didn't take until the end of the movie to make the connection to Frank James, brother of outlaw Jesse, and the character Fonda portrayed in two much earlier movies - 1939's ""Jesse James"", and the sequel, 1940's ""The Return of Frank James"". It made me wonder if Sergio Leone's original script named the character Frank, or if it was a result of getting Fonda for the part. It's no secret that Leone had been after Fonda to appear in one of his Westerns for a few years, with Fonda declining because every script he ever read was in Leone's fractured English. Fonda eventually relied on friend Eli Wallach's (Tuco/The Ugly in ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly) advice, who said he would have the time of his life.More than most, this is a Western that in turn, defines and is defined by the music. Even Bronson's character is called Harmonica, and his tunes are played to haunting effect. They mask a much deadlier nature to the quiet stranger - ""He not only plays, he can shoot too"".It took me a bit into the story to figure out it was Jason Robards under the beard of Cheyenne. I think it was interesting the way his character was written, leaving it ambiguous whether he was a lawman or an outlaw. The bigger surprise though had to do with a female character in the lead role, capably performed by Claudia Cardinale. She manages to arc through a wide range of characterizations throughout the story as situations call for, holding her own well against each of the male principals.This is certainly a film I'll have to watch a few more times for some of the points noted above. In particular, the single scene I could watch over and over, one that is inextricably linked with it's musical score, is Fonda's death scene set to the strain of Morricone's dying harmonica. Not only creative, but as effective as any finale in a Western I can think of.As a final thought, I was considering how Sergio Leone could have used the title ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" for this movie if it hadn't already been taken by another one of his legendary classics. But then again, Robards wasn't that ugly.",Once Upon a Time in the West
9,gavin6942,The Best Western I Ever Saw,9,9 April 2011,"Three men (Henry Fonda, Jason Robards and Charles Bronson) with various claims to morality spend their days shooting and circling around one woman of questionable morals and her dead husband's hidden treasure.Could this be Sergio Leone's best film? He has made many notable westerns (or ""spaghetti westerns"") but I have to say this is the western I have enjoyed the most of pretty much any western I have ever seen. I am not really a fan of the genre, but if more were like this, it would change my whole outlook.The score from Ennio Morricone, featuring the harmonica? Wonderful. Morricone has done a variety of music over the years, but his western themes remain his most notable.Dario Argento, who was only 20, wrote part of the story, which really opened doors for him. Not only did it get him a leg up in the Italian film community, but it probably later got him Jennifer Connelly to star in ""Phenomena"" after she had just finished wrapping up work with Leone.Some great lines in this film: ""How can I trust a man who wears a belt and suspenders? He doesn't trust his own pants."" And ""You remind me of my mother. She was the biggest whore in Alameda."" This whole movie was epic, could have been a mini-series or an ongoing show like ""Deadwood"" -- characters with no names who die are given more than adequate screen time. Character development is not in short supply here.",Once Upon a Time in the West
10,lee_eisenberg,it all came together,9,7 February 2006,"""C'era una volta il West"" (called ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" in English) truly feels like the culmination of Sergio Leone's artistic desires. This convoluted story of two men (Charles Bronson and Jason Robards) joining forces to protect heiress Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) from a thug (Henry Fonda) is a treat in every way. First, there's the opening scene: it really blows your mind when you see that the villain is Henry Fonda. Bronson and Robards play their roles as cool, but giving the impression that there's something beneath that suave exterior. And Claudia Cardinale is...well, you probably know that virtually all European actresses back in the '60s were hot babes, but this one makes the audience feel that there's more to her to than just good looks.All in all, this is a movie for everyone. It's weird to think that Dario Argento - now a horror director - was involved in the making, but it's true. Really cool.",Once Upon a Time in the West
11,jboothmillard,One upon a Time in the West,7,13 July 2010,"I will admit I didn't really get the sense that there was a plot in this western at all, but it didn't spoil anything, I was going to watch it regardless, from director Sergio Leone (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). Basically the railways are being placed all over America, even the far west, in particular a small border town full of guns and crime. It opens with an inspired sequence seeing men sitting around doing not much, one guy traps a fly in his gun barrel, they are waiting for the train to arrive. Anyway, Arriving into this town is Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale), who is shocked to find her new husband Brett (Frank Wolff) and family slaughtered, and the prime suspect is coffee loving Cheyenne (Jason Robards). The real killer however is gang leader Frank (Henry Fonda) who is trying to get his own way with the ownership of the railroad, along with the mysterious man known only for playing his Harmonica (Charles Bronson). Also staring Gabriele Ferzetti as Morton, Keenan Wynn as Sheriff, Paolo Stoppa as Sam and Marco Zuanelli as Wobbles. As I said, I didn't really get the plot, I just enjoyed the actors being cool and quite often quiet to effect, the violence and gun play, and some good music by Ennio Morricone. The critics describe it as some kind of operatic thing with the little dialogue, I suppose I'd agree with that, it is about fifteen minutes short of three hours, but it is certainly a different kind of western to see. Very good!",Once Upon a Time in the West
12,ccthemovieman-1,Excruciating Slow Or Fascinating: Your Choice,7,28 June 2006,"This was a unique western, one in which sometimes the action moves excruciatingly slow, which can either be fascinating or boring. Unfortunately for me, after spending big bucks for the DVD when it first came out, I found it more boring than fascinating. In my previous viewings, I always found it fascinating. Maybe I just had a bad day.The movie is filled with gaps of silence while closeups of the main characters' faces are shown. That's director Sergio Leone's trademark, and I believe he does it more in this film than in any of his others. When you get closeups of chiseled faces like Henry Fonda's or Charles Bronson's, it quite interesting but most of the movie feels like slow motion. At 165 minutes, this movie takes a lot of patience. By the way, the closeups of Claudia Cardinale's face were with a soft lens, so the wrinkles didn't show. That's so typical of older films with the vain female stars. Cardinale looks cheap, anyway, with all that 1960s-type eye makeup.At any rate, the action scenes are a decent and not bloody and the characters are quite real, meaning believable. I liked Fonda in here best even though I am not particularly a fan of his but his against-type villain role of ""Frank"" was excellent. I read where he said this was his favorite role. I'm glad to hear that. The best character in the film, though, was ""Cheyenne,"" played by Jason Robards.The opening credits - spaced out over 11 minutes (which was rare in ""classic movie"" days) - are considered by many as the most famous ever, in any genre. The music in this film is different, too. It's not as memorable as the score from ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly,"" however, done by the same composer, but it has its moments. Early in the film we see some shots of Monument Valley which are the prettiest I've ever seen. I wish there had been more of that.Overall, this is a western in which patience is rewarded, I suppose. It certainly looks beautiful on DVD and the sound has been enhanced as well. Note: when this came out on disc, the rating of the film changed from PG to PG-13.",Once Upon a Time in the West
13,rmax304823,Hank the Hubristic.,4,5 August 2010,"You have never seen such an array of tan, greasy faces, darkened by make up to a point that's positively Polynesian. It sets off the glistening white teeth we see during the infrequent grins but we don't see many grins. The default facial expression is the meaningful scowl. The most amusing display of meaningful scowls in at the very beginning, when three grimy dudes in long flapping dusters, including Western icons Jack Elam and Woody Strode, gather at the railroad station, waiting to kill the good guy, Charles Bronson. (Fat chance.) The director, Sergio Leone, gives us a long sequence in which Elam has a duel of wits with a fly that insists on landing on his chin or his lip. He manages to capture the dim-witted fly in the barrel of his Colt, caps the muzzle with a finger tip, and listens with delight as the fly buzzes angrily about inside the pistol.Another good scene. A henchman is sitting alongside the open window of a moving train. A cowboy boot descends from above. The henchman gapes at it. The toe of the boot turns towards the henchman's face and explodes. There is a pistol inside and the bullet forms a neat hole in the astonished miscreant's head.These and most other important scenes are wordless, surprising in that Bernardo Bertolucci was one of the writers.There are some impressive shots of Monument Valley. The production design is evocative and the set dressing impeccable. Leone has a distinctive way of framing his shots. Somebody's boots may be in the foreground, while in the distance another figure slowly draws back the flaps of his jacket to uncover his holsters.That's about it. I've tried to like this thing for years because Sergio Leone is admired by some friends whose opinions I respect. No can do. I don't find it funny. I don't find it involving. I really never cared much about who was or was not killed, which is always a bad sign. The movie seemed like a parody of a Western, with all the conventions drawn with absurd precision. And although Bertolucci wrote it, it isn't until AFTER the final face off between good guy Bronson and bad guy Fonda that we find out Bronson's motive for nattering Fonda. The motive, and the event that generates it, pops out of nowhere, flapping its wings like a stage magician's dove. It has nothing to do with the rest of the plot.However, don't let this stop you from watching it. I gather my opinion is a minority one, as is so often the case.",Once Upon a Time in the West
14,Tweekums,Sergio Leone's requiem to the West.,10,10 August 2009,"This is one of the best Westerns ever made, Leone was a master of the genre and this is probably his best film. It lacks the obvious humour of the dollar trilogy but makes up for it with a genuine sense of menace. There is almost a constant sense that violence may erupt at any moment.The opening is a classic, three men turn up at a remote station and with barely a word wait for the train to arrive. On paper the idea of spending the first ten minutes watching three men doing almost nothing sounds boring, but here there is the sense that this is the calm before the storm. When the train arrives it seems that nothing is about to happen but as it departs we hear the sound of a harmonica, the three men turn to see Charles Bronson, after a brief exchange the three men are lying dead. The next scene sees a man and his son return home after shooting some birds for dinner, the man talks to his teenage daughter as they prepare for a party; the man's wife is due to arrive that day. As the man gets water from the well a shot rings out and the girl falls to the ground more shots and the man and his elder son are dead too. The young son comes out of the house and is met by a group of men, led by Henry Fonda. Shockingly he guns down the child.That is two of the four protagonists introduced, the next is Claudia Cardinale, the widow of the man who's family we'd just seen die. Not knowing what has happened she heads to her new home, stopping off on the way at a bar. While she is inside we hear gunfire outside and the Jason Robards enters, his arms in chains. He confronts a man in the bar... the harmonica playing Bronson.What follows is a constant sense of danger interspersed with moments of violence. Why did railroad employee Frank murder an entire family? Why does Bronson play the harmonica and why is he so interested in Frank? Leone's direction is excellent, the film is long and for long periods nothing much is happening but I never felt bored watching because he created such great atmosphere. He is assisted by a fantastic score by Ennio Morricone. Henry Fonda put in a great performance, playing against type, as the murderous Frank and Bronson is ideally cast as the mysterious ""Harmonica"" putting in the best performance I've seen from him. That isn't to say there is anything wrong with the other actors, they all did a good job.I'd recommend this film to anybody, especially those who are fans of westerns. The only people I wouldn't recommend this to are fans of Henry Fonda who don't wish to see him as a bad guy.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Charles Bronson at his best provides an enjoyable acting as a suspicious stranger who has his own personal agenda by seeking for vengeance, this was his greatest performance in a very long career. Gorgeous Claudia Cardinale as the naive but obstinate widow, being wished by three violent macho men, as one to take her, one to love her and one to kill her .

16,BA_Harrison,Leone overdoes it.,5,23 May 2015,"A nasty railroad magnate hires some bad, bad men—led by evil gunslinger Frank (Henry Fonda)—to ensure that nothing gets in the way of business. Mysterious stranger Harmonica (Charles Bronson) and bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards) do their best to stop the baddies in their tracks. Beautiful widow Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) gives the men something else to think about other than shooting each other.There are those who consider Once Upon A Time In The West to be director Sergio Leone's magnum opus: with a magnificent cast, and contributions from some of Italian cinema's greatest names (the script is by Leone, Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci, the cinematography is by Tonino Delli Colli, and the score is, of course, by Ennio Morricone), the film certainly has an excellent pedigree.However, while it does boast solid performances and is often very impressive to look at (the widescreen cinematography is terrific), the film suffers from a severe case of over-indulgence, Leone taking his trademark themes and visual touches to the nth degree, the exaggerated style ultimately getting in the way of the storytelling. The director's signature moves are so excessive and drawn out that Once Upon A Time In The West proves hard to get through without dozing off at least once.Watch if you want to waste several minutes of your life as Jack Elam tries to blow a fly off his face, or to hear Charles Bronson repeatedly playing the same few notes on his harmonica, but give it a miss if you're looking for something even remotely as cool as any of Leone's Eastwood movies.",Once Upon a Time in the West
17,moonspinner55,"Elegant, but lugubrious Leone western...",6,21 January 2006,"Italian-US co-production from Italian director Sergio Leone, who takes the spaghetti western to an elegiac (and, at times, elegant) plateau, although the picture is hurt by overlength and is carefully (some may slowly) paced. Claudia Cardinale stars as a beautiful widow trying to hold onto her hot piece of real estate in the booming Old West, trailed by a cold-hearted hit-man. As photographed by Tonino Delli Colli, the picture looks splendid, though this screenplay from Leone and Sergio Donati (working from an original treatment by Leone, Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci) is thin, and Leone ultimately relies on the sweep and the scope to propel his story, which covers familiar territory. Henry Fonda is surprisingly icy as the villain; Cardinale is indeed gorgeous but is mainly used for decoration, despite being at the center of the action (it seems to happen around her). Ennio Morricone composed the stirring music. **1/2 from ****",Once Upon a Time in the West
18,Quinoa1984,Maybe Leone's second best behind GB&U- sophisticated weaving of techniques from past westerns into an near-mythic treatment...,10,6 February 2004,"Sergio Leone's the master of the spaghetti western- hard to refute that- and with Once Upon a Time in the West he goes for taking the skills he formed in the 'Dollars' trilogy (inspired by the likes of John Ford) into a stylistically complex work.  The story as well (by Leone, horror director Dario Argento, and Bernardo Bertolucci) slips the lines together without a flaw.  The four main characters- the suave, quiet Harmonica (Charles Bronson), the determined and sexy Jill (Claudia Cardinale), veteran outlaw Cheyenne (Jason Robards), and the worn, chilling  hired-killer Frank (Henry Fonda)- each get enough screen time by themselves or with each other to get the story going along, with the interweaving perfectly in sync.  And Leone's in luck- his actors all turn in top shelve work, with Bronson proving himself to be cool on par with Eastwood, Cardinale highly formidable as the first female lead in a Leone film, and Fonda creating one of his most memorable works.  Fonda's Frank draws you like no other actor could have in the first scene he appears.  A viewer can hardly believe he would set the story into motion like he does (looking into those blue eyes in the trademark close-ups), that is until the gun gets pulled.With all the performance in check, Leone creates a technical masterpiece. In a sense, Leone here created a film in the sense that Quentin Tarantino created Kill Bill- the later made a film about the conventions in grindhouse/martial-arts films, and Leone made a film about the conventions in the John Ford westerns (the commentary on the DVD goes into detail on this).  But, like Tarantino, Leone isn't just creating a compare/contrast show with guns and landscapes.  You don't have to have seen all those archaic westerns to get what Leone's doing here, since it's original in craftsmanship and how some turns are taken.  The craftsmanship, by the way, is anchored by the likes of cinematographer Tonillo Delli Colli, with similar and not so similar angles and pans and shots to GB&U - it's almost arguable that he should've deserved his lifetime achievement award simply for his three collaborations with Leone.  Also, Nino Baragli and Carlo Simi deserve massive credit here.  Along with a great vision comes other great people to work with, like Ennio Morricone, who has another score that's so evocative and in tune with Leone's mind-set it was created before filming even began.  This is the kind of work that could turn on a non-western fan onto the genre- though I would recommend GB&U as the introduction to this man's view of the 19th century in America.  One thing for certain- you'll have to see it twice before you can truly pass judgment. A+",Once Upon a Time in the West
19,tavm,Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the most compellingly dramatic Westerns of all time,10,14 June 2011,"When I first watched this movie on AMC late night during the '90s, I was impressed at the pace of the scenes by director Sergio Leone, the compelling score by Ennio Morricone, and performances of Jason Robards, Charles Bronson, and especially Henry Fonda. Having just watched it again on DVD with wonderful stereo sound, I'm even more impressed by the whole awesome spectacle of the dramatic and sometimes epic flavor of the thing. Everything just seems perfect with each shot and movements of the performances. And among them is Claudia Cardinale-top billed among the cast and the only other role I'd seen her in other than the ""Pink Panther"" movies-who provides quite a luminous presence as the only truly compelling female character in the movie. She has great scenes with all three leads. And Fonda, usually an actor who plays such idealistically decent characters, is such a revelation as the take-no-prisoners-villain Frank. His showdown with Bronson is one of the most compellingly tension-filled in movie history. With Leone, nothing feels too slow. It's just right with the way things happen. I think I've said enough, so on that note, Once Upon a Time in the West gets a definite recommendation from me. P.S. On a personal note, I loved hearing all the mentions of New Orleans, a city only a two-hour drive from where I live.",Once Upon a Time in the West
20,Coventry,A feast for eyes and ears! Leone's film is a timeless masterpiece!,10,30 April 2005,"THIS is perhaps the greatest film ever made. A passionately penned down portrait revolving on the downfall of the West-era. Brilliantly filmed, with careful attention for the smallest detail and performed by gifted actors and actresses in not so obvious roles. Straight from the slow and clammy opening credits sequence, you notice that this is an epic that will require your full attention and one that'll automatically provoke great feelings of respect and admiration. A cowboy's struggle with a fly is portrayed like it is a devastating battle, guided by unnatural noises on the background that put an extra emphasis on the unbearably tropic climate. This is the merciless West and you need your eyes and ears focused at all times to avoid trouble with someone more powerful than you. I have seen this masterpiece of film-making numberless times now and I still get mesmerized instantly when I behold the atmospheric set-pieces and the ominous characters. A truly magnificent opening to what will become a powerful movie experience and yet nothing of the actual storyline has been revealed yet!""Once upon a time in the West"" is a collaboration between titans...For the flawless screenplay, Leone (already a master-writer himself) received assistance from no less than Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento (this latter is a personal God of mine). These icons, who already deserve statues for the work they did separately, combine their talents and deliver a genuine western story that involves organized crime, blackmail, revenge and even human emotions. Separate story lines that only come together neatly in the end, after a series of fascinating sequences filled with suspense and dazzling action. Leone grabs every chance to innovate with both hands and this results in unexpected shock moments (the slaughter of the Irish family) and even completely unimaginable anti-castings (Henry Fonda as a relentless gangster?). The main story lines are very diverse but Leone takes his time to slowly clarify them all. Tough guys are hired secure the construction of a railroad while a notorious gangster escapes from jail, only to find out that someone abused his trademarks to get their dirty work done. A beautiful woman has been widowed without knowing it and she stands alone in an abandoned, dangerous land. And then there's a lonely cowboy patiently waiting to fight a personal battle of which no one knows the details. If you've chosen to watch ""Once upon a time in the West"", get ready to be overwhelmed by fascination and involvement...expect yourself to sit on the edge of your seat, exploring all the corners of the TV-screen as you want to make sure you're not missing a thing! Leone could count on the perfect cast, with the already mentioned Henry Fonda in an unusual but fitting role and Claudia Cardinale who embodies every male creature's dream. Charles Bronson and Jason Robards complete the great cast, both in the finest roles of their overall brilliant careers.The previously summed up elements already indicate that this is an unmissable cinema event and then I haven't even spoken of the music yet! For many fans the ultimate reason to point out ""Once upon a time in the West"" as the greatest film ever made and they're right! Ennio Morricone's score is so marvelous, so perfect that it began to lead its own life outside the film. The constantly repeated tunes ""Man with the Harmonica"" and ""Goodbye to Cheyenne"" cause a chemical reaction inside your body every time and they provide the story with extra depth and atmosphere. The images on the screen and the music you hear form a wholesome that can never be topped in cinema. This is the best, period! We should only use superlatives when talking about this film: the BEST and the most UNIQUE In case I haven't made myself clear thus far: ""Once upon a time in the West"" is a motion picture that belongs in every DVD-collection. With my most sincere apologies to Sam Peckinpah, John Ford and Howard Hawks but this is simply put the best western ever!",Once Upon a Time in the West
21,sunwarrior13,A Landmark Spaghetti Western,10,27 February 2012,"Once Upon a Time in the West is an Italian epic spaghetti western film directed by Sergio Leone for Paramount Pictures. It stars Henry Fonda cast against type as the villain, Charles Bronson as his nemesis, Jason Robards as a bandit, and Claudia Cardinale as a newly widowed homesteader with a past as a prostitute. The screenplay was written by Leone and Sergio Donati, from a story devised by Leone, Bernardo Bertolucci, and Dario Argento. The widescreen cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli, and Ennio Morricone provided the film score.In this epic Western, shot partly in Monument Valley, a revenge story becomes an epic contemplation of the Western past. To get his hands on prime railroad land in Sweetwater, crippled railroad baron Morton hires killers, led by blue-eyed sadist Frank, who wipe out property owner Brett McBain and his family. McBain's newly arrived bride, Jill, however, inherits it instead. Both outlaw Cheyenne and lethally mysterious Harmonica take it upon themselves to look after Jill and thwart Frank's plans to seize her land. As alliances and betrayals mutate, it soon becomes clear that Harmonica wants to get Frank for another reason -- it has ""something to do with death."" As in his ""Dollars"" trilogy, Leone transforms the standard Western plot through the visual impact of widescreen landscapes and the figures therein. At its full length, Once Upon a Time in the West is Leone's operatic masterwork, worthy of its legend-making title.If only the first 10 minutes of this movie still existed, this most hyperbolic of oat operas would still be acknowledged as one of the genre's greatest exhumations.Overall,it is a a landmark Leone spaghetti western masterpiece featuring a classic Morricone score.",Once Upon a Time in the West
22,hitchcockthelegend,"The operatic tale of greed, lust and revenge.",9,7 November 2010,"Once Upon A Time In The West is directed by Sergio Leone and stars Charles Bronson, Claudia Cardinale, Jason Robards & Henry Fonda. Leone co-wrote the screenplay with Sergio Donati, while the story was provided by Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci. Ennio Morricone scores the music and cinematography is from Tonino Delli Colli.After finishing The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in 1966, Sergio Leone felt he had done all he wanted to do with the Western genre. Thankfully that wasn't to be the case as he was lured back into Oaterville to make the unique and quite superb C'era una volta il West in 1968. Greeted with negative reviews on its release in America, it was a financial flop. But in Europe the film was richly received and took the box offices by storm. Time has showed the film to have risen above cult status to be widely acknowledged as one of the finest Western film's of all time.Everything about the film is bigger and bolder than previous Leone works. Opening with an almost silent ten minute sequence that has become legendary, the film follows four characters as they dovetail towards the reckoning. Harmonica (Bronson), Frank (Fonda), Jill McBain (Cardinale) & Cheyenne (Robards), all linked by death, and with each one represented in the narrative by a piece of music. Leone clinically weaves the four stories into one operatic whole. Not all of it makes perfect sense, which stops it being the masterpiece many consider it being. But its observations of Western mysticism, capitalism and progression of time; and with scores to of course be settled too, it makes for a fine story nestling in amongst the beautiful treats for the eyes and ears.While Leone clearly homages the genre and pays tribute to the old America (you will lose count spotting the Western film steals), his film is ultimately very much a pastiche piece. But he gets away with that lack of freshness (the story at the core mirrors Johnny Guitar for example) due to the unique structure. It's meticulously paced as the characters are fleshed out to the max, sometimes even without dialogue. Smart directing as Leone makes the story more richer and weightier in substance. Morricone's score is magnificent and so is Colli's photography, with the latter's shooting of Monument Valley good enough to have featured in John Ford oeuvre. While the casting is inspiring, notably Fonda as a villain (the impact shocked many back in the day).I can't call it a masterpiece because it does lift from many other sources, but it's darn close to being a perfect movie. One thing is for sure, that in it's uncut form the film is a work of art. Where repeat viewings keep rewarding and never dilute the enjoyment. 9/10",Once Upon a Time in the West

I can`t help thinking a lot of people have confused this with ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA The problem I had is that it`s massively overlong and it crawls along at a snails pace , most of this is caused by someone walking into a set , the camera spending several seconds holding a close up on their face , then the character walking along very slowly , they stop , camera holds close up on their face for several seconds again , and then , only then do they open their mouth , camera cuts to close up of other characters faces , then someone opens their mouth to reply .

24,Hey_Sweden,Cinematic brilliance from Sergio Leone.,10,17 February 2014,"""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a truly epic scale Western, one of the best ever made; no other film from this genre can quite touch this one in this viewer's humble opinion. Virtuoso director Leone gives it an impressive sense of grandeur while also always remembering to concentrate on human emotions, as it takes its characters and audience on this dramatic (but never melodramatic) journey. It's subtly performed by all, with absolutely gorgeous widescreen photography. Leone dares to take his time telling this tale (scripted by himself and Sergio Donati, based on a story by Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci, and Leone), which might drive less than patient people up the wall, but the film offers plenty of rewards for those that stick with it. You really come to either care for or loathe these characters, waiting to find out how things will be resolved and what will become of everyone. Enhancing all of it is one of Ennio Morricone's loveliest ever scores; it's likely to bring a lump to your throat several times.Four reliable performers play individuals whose lives come together: Claudia Cardinale is Jill McBain, a former whore who's married well and is on her way to join her husband and his family. Charles Bronson is the unnamed man with the harmonica, who's a man on a mission. Not until near the end does his motivation finally become clear. Jason Robards is Cheyenne, a notorious half-breed outlaw who gets falsely accused of the slaughter of Jill's family-to-be, which was actually perpetrated by the vile, ambitious Frank. In a genius bit of casting, Henry Fonda, who had played so many upright and morally strong men before, plays this role, and does it with commendable restraint, refraining from ever becoming a moustache-twirling Oilcan Harry. Forming part of the plot is the attempt to build a town that will take advantage of a railroad being built.Leone gets wonderful performances out of his entire cast. Some of them are just making ""special appearances"", which might make one wish that they had more to do, but they're welcome no matter what: Woody Strode, Jack Elam, Keenan Wynn, Frank Wolff, Lionel Stander. Gabriele Ferzetti has the delicious role of physically disabled but devious railroad baron Mr. Morton, but it's Mr. Fonda who proves to be the most fun to watch.Leone prepares you for what's to come with his effectively protracted, stylized opening credits sequence. It plays out slowly, but the tension is unbelievable. From then on he covers a lot of ground. The film has a long running time at two hours and 46 minutes, but never feels as long as that. There are some delightfully clever moments and plenty of time for the characters to make a lasting impression.One doesn't come away from ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" unaffected. It's very much essential viewing.10 out of 10.",Once Upon a Time in the West
25,Doylenf,Sergio's slow-moving western has some unforgettable moments...,6,3 October 2007,"I have to give ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST a decidedly mixed review.Before I begin, let me point to the major flaws involved: the dialog is not as sharp as in the Clint Eastwood westerns Sergio directed; the score is not quite as electrifying as those memorable background scores featured in the Eastwood flicks; and there is never enough exposition in the dialog to fill the viewer in with any background information nor is there any insight into the character motivations of CHARLES BRONSON. You have to wait until the last ten minutes of the two hours and forty-six minutes running time to discover why Bronson has been trailing the villainous HENRY FONDA.Aside from these annoying defects, the convoluted storyline does manage to hold the attention from the opening shots before the credits, consisting mostly of close-ups of WOODY STRODE and JACK ELAM as they await the arrival of a transcontinental train. The story is only vaguely made comprehensible by the time CLAUDIA CARNIVALE arrives to greet her new husband and his children--only to find that they have all been slaughtered. From then on, the tension never lets up, although it is drawn out interminably with scenes that never seem to move but have impact because of the clever editing.It's certainly a western saga and obviously cost a pretty penny to produce. The atmosphere seems authentic as to the sets and costumes and there is a distinct lack of a Hollywood touch to the gunplay and violence.But is it a great western? I would have preferred a less enigmatic approach to the storyline--but the strength of the film lies in the solid performances from an excellent cast. I would have liked a little more from Claudia Carnivale than a fixed stare, which she seems to substitute for an intense overall performance. However, JASON ROBARDS, JR. does an impressive job as the outlaw ""Cheyenne"".The final shootout between Bronson and Fonda is masterfully shot and within the time it takes place we're also given a flashback that shows why Bronson was tracking down Fonda's character. But the film's pace is much too slow and not exactly enlivened by a lack of dialog.And finally, I was disappointed that Morricone's score lacked the excitement of those he did for other ""spaghetti westerns"".",Once Upon a Time in the West
26,LeonLouisRicci,The Love of Cinema,10,31 May 2013,"In an age of quick cuts, shaky Camera and CGI, this Film will likely be a hard watch for the post ADD Generation. It is SLOW. The Cinematography lingers. The lines of Dialog are at the most minimum. It is LONG.So why is this considered one of the best Westerns ever. Because it is. An achievement that is a testament to the insatiable Love of Cinema, as Art, that the Europeans unabashedly utilize, like the Hug. They are not shy about physical displays of such Affection. That is the essence of this Film. Leone is a Lover and a Hugger. He is constantly hugging this Movie Loving every minute of it. He Loves the Genre, He Loves the Camera, He loves the Actors Faces, He loves the Landscape, he loves the Mythology, He just Loves and Loves. All that is apparent on the screen. Most likely that is why it is so lengthy. He Loved it all. What emerges is an Authentic Fantasy. There is on display a gorgeousity of grandeur that is quite a sight. Behold its panorama and its larger than Life Characters with their own quirky Personas and accompanying Musical Riffs. This is so playful and fun. It is all done for the Lovers of the World.

27,zardoz-13,The Greatest Spaghetti Western of All Time!!!!!,10,30 December 2007,"Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon A Time in the West,"" a.k.a. ""C'era una volta il West"" is one of the all-time greatest westerns. Indeed, hands down, it ranks as the greatest Spaghetti western. This tale about railroad expansion in the old West holds its own against the best domestic westerns of John Ford, Anthony Mann, Robert Aldritch, John Sturges, and Budd Boetticher, and Henry Hathaway. The cast is first-rate with iconic western star Henry Fonda playing against type as a cold-blooded killer and gimlet-eyed heavy Charles Bronson wearing the boots of the hero for a change. In between, Jason Robards is splendid as a bearded gunslinger named Cheyenne who has his own gang of killers and Claudia Cardinale as the up-rooted New Orleans prostitute who comes west as a mail-order mail bride for Frank Wolff, usually a villain in Italian westerns. Although it clocks in at a mammoth 165 minutes, ""C'era una volta il West"" never wastes a minute in telling its vast story, complete with flashbacks. Sergio Leone surpasses anything that he did in any of his Clint Eastwood westerns. The screenplay by Dario ""Suspira"" Argento, Bernard ""Last Tango in Paris"" Bertolucci, Sergio ""The Big Gundown"" Donati, and Sergio Leone contains several epic set-pieces that will never be equaled by anybody. Moreover, it features a sprawling plot. Ennio Morricone's orchestral score, which was finished before the first foot of film was shot, is a legendary in its own right with some unforgettable melodies. The day that Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale of ""The Professionals"") comes west from New Orleans to join Brett McBain (Frank Wolff of ""God Forgives, But I Don't"") at his house in the middle of nowhere, she arrives to find tragedy awaiting her. Brett, his two sons, and his only daughter are laid out on the very tables that Jill was to share a picnic welcoming her to their home. As it turns out, Frank (Henry Fonda of ""Fort Apache"") and his duster-clad henchmen show up ahead of Jill and massacre the McBain family. One of Frank's henchmen accidentally calls Frank by his name just as McBain's youngest son comes running out of the house. ""Now that you've called me by name,"" Frank observes and pulls out his revolver and guns down the kid! Nobody but Sergio Leone would have had the balls to pull this off with one of America's greatest heroes masquerading as the epitome of evil.Charles Bronson plays an enigmatic gunslinger who keeps his six-gun tucked snugly in his waistband near the base of spine. He plays a harmonica like you have never heard a harmonica played. Whenever The Man (Bronson of ""Red Sun"") utters a word, it sounds like a classic line. In fact, there isn't a bad line of dialogue in the entire movie. The Man meets Cheyenne at the same time that Jill encounters him at a remote stagecoach station in the middle of John Ford's Monument Valley. Jill is on her way to meet the McBain's when the driver pulls up for a drink. Inside, Jill asks about a bath and the proprietor (Lionel Stander of ""Beyond the Law"") tells her that only three people have used it today. All together, she inquires contemptuously, or one at a time. About that time, Cheyenne (Jason Robards of ""Hour of the Gun"") makes the grandest entrance of them all. A fusillade of gunplay sounds before he stumbles into the way station, gulps at a jug, and then has a man shoot off his shackles while he holds a gun on him.Sergio Leone pours more style and substance in these 165 minutes than you can stand. There isn't a single thread of the plot that is left dangling (unless you watch a cut version of it on AMC) and everything fits together like a puzzle. ""C'era una volta il West"" was the first Spaghetti western to be filmed partially on location in the United States. The film is an indictment of big business, meaning the railroads, and railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti of ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"") serves as a visual metaphor for the corruption in the railroads with his bone cancer that forces him to walk with crutches or an overhead grid of poles that he can lower to enable him to walk around his railroad coach. Morton dreams of reaching the West coast with his railway. Frank acts as Morton's right-hand man and both men understand each other all too well. Without one the other could not exist.Repeatedly, Leone serves up a flashback that has a younger but just as mean Frank chewing on an apple and sauntering through the desert with a sadistic grin on his face. Frank's idea of a good time is to hang the brother of one man by forcing him to stand on his little brother's shoulders. The older brother hangs only after the younger one has collapsed from the exhaustion of holding brother up.""C'era una volta il West"" contains some of the coolest shoot-outs ever staged on-screen. The opening shoot-out at an isolated water stop along a railroad in the desert is classic with three gunslingers waiting for the train to arrive. Jack Elam catches a fly in his gun barrel and listens to it buzz. Woody Strode stand under a water tower and lets water collect in the rim on his Stetson. Al Mulock as 'Knuckles' cracks his knuckles in ways you could never imagine. This scene goes on and on and then Bronson arrives and the showdown begins. Anybody who likes Spaghetti westerns must see ""C'era una volta il West."" The lip synchronization is 100 per cent on the money with no discrepancies. The photography is flawless and costume design is marvelous. Interestingly, the closest that most Hollywood westerns can to the long, dark, duster coats that Leone's gunslinger sport were the rain slickers. ""C'era una volta il West"" was a smashing success overseas but a resounding flop in the states.",Once Upon a Time in the West
28,grantss,Decent,6,18 March 2014,"Decent spaghetti western by Sergio Leone. However, it suffers from the same problems as all of Leone's westerns: overly long, often- ridiculous dialogue and an abundance of hammy acting.Starts off well enough. Good build-up with much intrigue. However, if you think only the intro is going to be slow, to build up the suspense, and are hoping the remainder of the movie will movie will move at a quicker pace, you're in for a rude surprise. The whole movie moves at that pace.Has some good action sequences. Despite the unnecessary, and seemingly random, complexity of the plot, it comes together well at the end.As mentioned, dialogue and acting often leave much to be desired. Henry Fonda is great in his role. Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale are solid in their roles and even Charles Bronson is more-or-less okay (it is touch-and-go though!). However, as usual in Leone movies, it's the supporting cast who are largely atrocious. Some of the worst acting you'll ever see. Prize for worst performance here goes to the villain who gets thrown off the train and shot by Henry Fonda. I hope he went back to his day job.",Once Upon a Time in the West
29,Boba_Fett1138,What a great story!,10,12 August 2009,"Of course lots of westerns are far from original. They often imitate each other and the always feature all of the same ingredients and clichés. Also the characters are often alike, as is its overall style. Leone movies are also like this, with as a difference that Leone was the trend-setter and pioneer for the genre and above all things also was at the top of his game.What also really makes this movie distinct itself is its story, that makes this movie a real original as well as great one to watch. It's entertaining, adventurous and all truly original as well, as far as the genre is concerned. It takes some original approaches such as for instance featuring a woman in a central role. Normally women feel very out of place within a western and distract a lot from the movie its story. The love-stories are annoying and never work out as they should. They take away a lot from the movie. In this movie they actually managed they let it all work out well for the movie. I think this is simply due to the fact that Leone featured the female role in the movie quite prominently, while in other cases they were merely supporting characters, with like 5 minutes of screen-time.But aside from the female part in the movie, the actual story itself is also just great and perfectly written. Surprisingly enough the story got created by two of Italy's greatest Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci, who are best known as directors and normally weren't every involved much at all with the western genre. What I foremost liked about the movie was that it perfectly knew how to feature 3 different characters, of which none of them you really knew what to think about them till the end really. None of the is fully good really and none of fully bad. It's not a black and white story and the characters are not one dimensional. It's not really a typical western, which is also positive for the people who aren't really into the genre. It features plenty enough of ingredients and themes to make this movie perfectly watchable for all people, even more so than usually is the case with a Leone western.The movie is a typical Sergio Leone western, that features his distinctive and trademark style. The movie once more proofs that he was a great story-teller, who could tell an epic tale, without having too feature a lot of dialog. It's a bit of late western from Leone and the '60's were coming at and end. This means that the style is a bit different from his earlier acclaimed westerns. This mostly can be seen back in the movie its cinematography that is quite dynamic at times. but still of course the movie features lots of long, empty shots, with nothing but people staring and close-ups. All of the things Leone became so well known for.The movie has quite a surprising cast. Most surprising thing perhaps is that it doesn't feature Clint Eastwood and instead this time has Charles Bronson in it as the mysterious gunslinger. Also no Eli Wallach or Lee Van Cleef in this one but instead there are Jason Robards and Henry Fonda, in the most villainous role, while he had never played a villain before in his career. All of the actors are nevertheless well cast and each of them give fine performances.It's a movie that slowly moves toward its end. At first you don't know who all of the characters are and what their motivations are. Also each of their story lines seem to have nothing to do with each other but as the movie more and more progresses you realize that they actually do and their faith are all bounded to each other. It's build up to its end that mostly certainly does not disappoint, not in the least. It has a great and also a bit of surprising ending that for instance is just as memorable as the end of ""Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo"".The movie and some of its scenes are also made by it's music by Ennio Morricone. It's one of his most memorable western scores and has a couple of nice different themes in it.A great tale, even for those who aren't really into the genre.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Once Upon a Time in the West
30,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Leone knew how to shoot and cut... he was an expert at both,10,11 May 2010,"Right from the very opening moments to the last, this is perfectly crafted. You immediately realize that you are in skillful hands. This builds up tension masterfully, including in the first minute(!). The use of sound(and silence, lest we forget) is incredible, with spot-on use of the exaggerated audio produced by real objects. Morricone brings to this an astonishing score, with distinct themes(with electric guitar as well as softer instruments) and sweeping pieces, all impeccably well-composed. The editing and cinematography, with effective reveals, beautiful sets and nature, heavy use of close-ups and a sincere focus on atmosphere and mood(whilst also delivering amazing gunfights) help make this downright operatic. No, this isn't in a hurry like more recent movies, and there is not an action sequence every ten minutes... however, if you find a single frame of this ""boring"" or anything of the sort, then I would think that your attention span is simply insufficient, and I urge you to attempt to improve it and give this another chance. Other than being contrarian, I can't imagine why one wouldn't find this timeless and relevant; it's about the future(not in the science fiction way), development, love, and personal dreams... the things life itself are made of, what we all cherish most. All of this, without any instances of sentimentality, preachiness or, at 160 minutes, any wasted time. It fits so much plot(note that viewers are expected to piece some of it together) into that time without coming off as rushed and avoiding overwhelming the audience. The pacing is beyond reproach, with a gradual speed that lets all of the events unfold. Every scene is done exactly right, and they fit together with impressive precision. The sense of humor is great. Costumes are beyond reproach. Everyone in this is a perfect casting choice, right down to the least seen extra; their faces add an immeasurable amount to this, especially in the cases of the goons and the three male leads(R.I.P., truly sorry to lose you). Robards is so ridiculously charming that I could remember him from Enemy of the State(yes, for as briefly as he appears in that), Fonda plays against expectations with an absolutely chilling result, and Bronson, I believe, started doing his thing, what he's so famous for, in this very picture. Do I even need to point out that this is among the (spaghetti) Westerns(it references the classics of the genre, by the way) that constructed our idea(then and current) of what macho is? Compare it. The short lines, ""cool-ness"", their behaviour(I will put no details here). Cardinale is *stunning*, and, as goes for the others(not merely the leads), an excellent actor. She is an early strong female character(that all of them are marvelously developed begs mentioning), too. Dialog is well-written. There is plenty of violence that gets brutal and contains blood here and there, occasional sensuality and a little moderate language in this, and it is disturbing at times. The Special Collector's Edition DVD comes with a rather interesting and informational commentary track(by directors, including the ""Johns"" Carpenter and Milius, an author of a book on Sergio and a film historian), four featurettes, two stills galleries and a trailer. I recommend this to any fan of the medium. 10/10",Once Upon a Time in the West
31,view_and_review,Harmonicas Have Never Been so Symbolic,8,23 March 2019,"The familiar face of Clint Eastwood was replaced with that of Charles Bronson in this western and not a beat was missed. Bronson played the steely-eyed, rugged gunslinger with a penchant for playing the harmonica. Harmonica play has a whole new meaning to me now.

32,evanston_dad,Sergio Leone's Fairy Tale West,9,14 May 2014,"""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is Sergio Leone's leisurely Western saga about a newly-widowed bride (Claudia Cardinale) and three men (Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson and Jason Robards) who circle around her like sharks in an effort to get out of her what they need in order to further their own aims.None of the three is exactly a good guy, though Bronson and Robards come close, but Cardinale, thanks to some facts we learn about her character on the way, isn't exactly our traditional Western heroine either, and she's more than capable of dealing with whatever these guys have to throw at her. Robards and Fonda are both excellent, Fonda making such a good villain it makes you wonder why he wasn't cast as villains more often. Leone's film is operatic in sweep and tone; Ennio Morricone's simply gorgeous score bathes everything in an elegiac aura, a fitting attribute for a film that is, after all (as the title implies), a fairy tale. The film doesn't achieve quite the level of greatness of Leone's masterpiece ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" but few films do.At the risk of sounding like a chauvinist, I have to believe that Leone's films work better for men than for women. Not to say that women can't like them, but the themes and emotions that Leone conjures on screen have a primal maleness to them, which is why I think he and his films have become so emblematic of ""guys' movies.""

The two opening segments are horrendous though; one unnecessarily drawn out forever with an amusing line, the other poorly acted and out of place with the rest of the film. It does pick up and engage though and I could see it being someone's favourite of the genre, as it's not the same old thing. Bronson's character's just ridiculous to me though and Frank had no reason not to just kill him earlier, instead of having him tied up and then leaving. The parts of Cheyenne and Jill are decently played, by Robards and Cardinale. The run-time unnecessary, with plenty of staring instead of dialogue and the same music played over and over.

She nonetheless vows to carry on, and is later helped by a man known as Harmonica(Charles Bronson) who has also vowed to kill the same man that killed her family.Sprawling story details the westward expansion by train that transformed America irrevocably, ending many ways of life. I did like this film, it is stylish and ambitious, with a good score, but it does become tedious at times, not to mention uncomfortable(Fonda's scenes with Cardinale, for instance...)

36,Wuchakk,"The Good, the Bad and the Slow as Molasses",7,11 November 2015,"Released in 1968, Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is an epic story of a mysterious stranger known as Harmonica (Charles Bronson) who joins forces with a desperado named Cheyanne (Jason Robards) to protect a newly widowed ex-prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) from a ruthless assassin, Frank (Henry Fonda), who works for a railroad tycoon (Gabriele Ferzetti).As my title blurb amusingly suggests, this movie is really slow. It's basically an hour and 25 minute movie stuffed with filler to make it twice as long. For example, a man merely getting off his horse and approaching someone to talk is made out to be an epic blow-your-mind event. Absurd. I'm not saying it's not a good movie; it is and it has numerous attributes, like the great cinematography, outstanding cast and hypnotic score. So it's definitely worth watching, but you have to be prepped for an epic, slow movie that's more of a piece of art than a piece of entertainment.Fans of the film defend its slowness on the grounds that it's an allegory of death. They suggest that the movie's always revealing and expanding itself until the last act, where it becomes clear how everything's connected. At this point the film becomes a catharsis as the plot points converge, ending with a duel. Then the picture loudly reveals its theme: The death of the west, the death of gunslingers and the death of the myth. My response: The death of the West and the gunslinger via the encroachment of civilization (here represented by the advent of the railroad) is a constant theme in Westerns, before and since this film. While it's a great theme for any Western, it was nothing novel in 1968. Speaking of 1968, that was the year ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" came out, which is sort of the Sci-Fi counterpart to this film. Let me put it this way, if you loathe ""2001"" you'll probably hate this one too.Some say that ""Once Upon A Time In the West"" is very different from Leone's previous film, the iconic ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" from 1966, but I see a lot of similarities: The epic (overlong) length; the three main characters consisting of good (Bronson), bad (Fonda) and ugly (Robards); a fitting score by Ennio Morricone; and Leone's unmistakably mesmerizing style.Despite my honest criticisms, this is a notable Western and a one-of-a-kind film, highlighted by Bronson's laconic hero, Fonda's villainy, Claudia's curvy beauty and Robards' likable good-desperado. I can see why some hail it as an artistic masterpiece, but I can also see why others think it's repetitive and boring. My appraisal falls in between these two extremes, albeit closer to the former.The version I saw runs 165 minutes and was shot in Arizona; Moab, Utah; Sonora, Mexico; and Andalucía, Spain.GRADE: B",Once Upon a Time in the West

Sergio Leone made Western's which looked dirty and real. The Bad: Two and half hours is way too long. Many scenes added little or dragged the story down, and should have been cut.

38,deloudelouvain,"Sergio Leone, king of the Spaghetti Westerns",7,19 September 2020,"Sergio Leone is the king of the spaghetti westerns, that's a fact. Almost everyone knows his movies, or has seen at least one, that is if you're of a certain age. His movies get really high ratings on IMDb, even though I don't think they're all that good. For instance For A Fistfull Of Dollars (1964) has a weak story, yet it still scores really high. The same for Once Upon A Time In The West, great acting and cinematography (certainly for that time), but the story isn't that great. That said I still enjoy this movie, just for the great soundtrack of Ennio Morricone, the sublime tension building between the different characters (nothing beats those face offs in Leone's westerns), or the superb close-ups of the villains. Like all his other movies it's a very long movie, and maybe sometimes the shots are just a bit too long and not to everybody's taste but to me it adds to the tension building. I don't think this one is his best though, I preferred For A Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly (1966), but that's only my opinion. The acting was good, with a young Charles Bronson, Henry Fonda and the always stunning looking Claudia Cardinale. If there's one typical thing in Sergio Leone's movies is the amount of bad guys that all add to great visual close-ups. His casting is just really good, his way of shooting those images even better. But what strikes me the most with his early movies is just the quality of the images, for that time it was just great cinema and for that alone all his movies are worth watching.",Once Upon a Time in the West

It's beyond subversive.That said, this is a masterpiece in shot composition (widescreen, especially). The gunfight staging, the staggering scenery, gorgeous Claudia Cardinale; it's all in the visuals, at least for me.

41,JamesHitchcock,The Handiwork of a Master,8,18 March 2015,"The formula ""once upon a time"" is traditionally used to begin a fairy- tale or legend, and Sergio Leone's use of it here may be intended to claim legendary or mythical status for his epic story. (He was later to make a gangster epic entitled ""Once Upon a Time in America""). Certainly, he makes use of two familiar Western situations, so familiar that they might as well have been drawn from a fairy-tale. One involves a railroad company trying to force honest homesteaders off their land, a trope so well-known that Mel Brooks was to mock it in ""Blazing Saddles"". The other involves the mysterious lone gunman out for revenge. The film is generally classified as a ""Spaghetti Western"" because Leone was Italian, but in fact it was partly shot in Spain and partly in America. The action takes place in and around the fictitious town of Flagstone; the name was presumably inspired by Flagstaff, Arizona, and the location is doubtless supposed to be somewhere in the deserts of the American South- West.Brett McBain, an Irish-born homesteader, and his three children are shot dead by a gang of bandits in the pay of a corrupt railroad boss. The railroad want McBain dead because they want to acquire his land cheaply; it lies on top of the only reserves of water in the area and is therefore the only possible route for their new line, as they need water for their locomotives. McBain is well aware of the value of his land and is holding out for a better price. What the villains do not realise is that McBain has recently married Jill, a former New Orleans prostitute who arrives in the West to find herself already a widow.Jill, however, decides to stay and fight the railroad and their hired gunmen. In this she has two unexpected allies. One is Cheyenne, another bandit whom the gunmen have tried to frame for the killings. The other is a mysterious stranger with his own reasons for seeking revenge on Frank, the leader of the gang who killed McBain. We never learn his real name; he is always referred to as ""Harmonica"" because of his fondness for that instrument.Harmonica might seem like a natural role for Clint Eastwood, and he was indeed offered it, but turned it down, and it went instead to Charles Bronson. I have in the past been critical of Bronson's lack of emotional range, but here his deadpan inscrutability serves him well, adding to his character's air of mystery. This must count as one of his best performances. The casting of Henry Fonda as the cruel, sadistic Frank has been described as ""against type"", although this was not the only film in which he plays a villain. In another Western from 1968, ""Firecreek"", he also plays the leader of a gang of outlaws; in both films he shows that he could play a bad guy as convincingly as a good guy. The one cast member I was less keen on was Claudia Cardinale as Jill; she was never the greatest actress in English-language movies, especially in movies where, as here, her dialogue was spoken for her by another actress. (Cardinale did speak her own lines in the Italian version). Another actor whose lines were dubbed was Gabriele Ferzetti as the crippled railroad boss Morton, but he nevertheless makes a memorable villain. Leone was keen to give an epic look and feel to his film, and ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is quite deliberately slow-paced, much more so than his earlier ""Dollars"" trilogy, or at least its first two instalments. I understand that the film exists in three versions; I saw the 145-minute version originally shown in American cinemas, but I understand that there is also a 166-minute version made for the European market and a 175-minute ""director's cut"". Even the short version, however, features long, slow scenes in which there is little dialogue and little action, with the action sequences themselves brief if violent. This is particularly marked in the famous opening sequence in which in which three of the outlaws wait at a station for the arrival of a train, and around ten minutes goes by in which nothing much happens other than a windmill creaking and a fly buzzing around Jack Elam's face. (This scene was inspired by a similar one in ""High Noon"", one of a number of deliberate references to famous Westerns).Mention also needs to be made of Ennio Morricone's haunting musical score, at times discordant and plangent, at others melodious and lyrical, making use of unusual instruments including tubular bells and (naturally enough) a harmonica. This music makes an important contribution towards the film's emotional impact.Leone's direction in this film will doubtless divide opinion, with some decrying his slow-motion style as boring and others hailing it as evidence of the handiwork of a master. For myself, I lean towards the latter view; Leone may take his time over telling his story, but in doing so he adds to the film's power and grandeur. Attempting to speed up the action would only have weakened the film's impact rather than improving it. I would not perhaps rank this film as the greatest-ever Western, which is how some have described it, but it is among the best Westerns of the sixties; I would certainly rate it higher than a number of contemporary Westerns, such as ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"", ""True Grit"" and ""The Wild Bunch"", which have also been much praised but which for me fall short of greatness. ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" comes very close to falling within that description. 8/10",Once Upon a Time in the West
42,lasttimeisaw,Sergio Leone's first saga of his ONCE UPON A TIME trilogy is a killing Western classic,8,5 October 2014,"Sergio Leone's first saga of his ONCE UPON A TIME trilogy after competing THE DOLLARS trilogy. ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is as good as his classic Spagetti Western predecessors if it is not better. Mustering three Hollywood toughies Bronson, Fonda and Robards, the film evidently echoes the pattern of THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (1966, 8/10), although Bronson is a perfect specimen embodies both the Ugly and the Good, and for the first time Sergio deploys a woman, the Mediterranean beauty Cardinale to be a pivot among these three, contrives an interwoven plot with vengeance, duel, murder, vice as well as the righteous side of the Western ideology: masculinity, integrity, fraternity and chivalry. Three men are introduced with their own respective sequences give their characters a full-blown presentation: the mysterious and tacit Harmonica (Bronson) is a marksman with a stern resolution and trademark music (the 10 minutes-long opening scenes of three gunslingers waiting in the train station is a homage to the opening sequences of HIGH NOON 1952, 8/10); Fonda's Frank is an appalling child killer, remorseless and intimidating, he has no mercy in anyone and can wipe out anything standing in his way; Cheyenne (Robards), the wanted bandits who would be framed for Frank's slaughter, is the most inscrutable one, we cannot easily categorize him at first, his weathered face glimpses with acute wariness, he has escaped from numerous pursue and capture, he could be the last man you ever want to mess with. Cardinale's Jill, a former prostitute from New Orleans, also is granted a strong narrative arc, she is secretly married to Brett McBain (Wolff), nevertheless, on the first day of her arrival for her wedding, her husband's family is being cold-heartedly massacred, she becomes a new widow and inherits a large tract of land, where they intend to build a station when the railway reaches out. Jill inevitably falls the victim of Frank's atrocity, but she is not a common chaste heroine, she necessarily knows how to exploit her advantage to keep alive and find a way out, at the same time, she is not afraid. It is a career-defining role for Cardinale, her strong-willed resilience only add more allure on the erotic exotica of her glamor. Come to the rescue of Ms. McBain is Harmonica and Cheyenne, both harbor an unsaid affection towards her, even more is admiration. They have some unfinished business with Frank and his gang, which also includes the railway tycoon Morton (Ferzetti, who is considerably memorable as he wonderfully conveys the exasperating angst from his bodily defects ), who initially is Frank's boss but slowly loses grip over him as Frank runs amok with his evil deed. The segueing confrontations slacks off a bit in the sense of tension and certain sequences are befuddling for a first-time viewing especially the subplot concerns Cheyenne in the third act is bluntly excised as one could assume a film running around 175 minutes, is there really no room for such an important set piece since obviously Cheyenne is the most interesting role and Robards is so competent and accomplished to convey even the most subtle expression without any affectation, contrast to Bronson's perpetually unfathomable smile hanging on his round but ragged visage, slowly deadens its enigmatic spell and degrades into a deadpan one trick pony. It is Henry Fonda's most iconic role as an out-and-out villain, he is bone-chillingly vicious from his first appearance, but Fonda is also fated to carry on a human level of consciousness when he is forcibly bedding Jill, he is a monster no doubt, and he softens himself in front of the luscious figure which he sympathizes not only out of lust, but also a little glint called kindness. Even during the final showdown, as we all awaits his doom, he is still reminiscent of a man who is perplexed by a riddle or blurred by his memory, until finally Harmonica reveals his identity, his demise is more like a quick relief than a belated punishment for a rotten soul. The film is a bona-fide epic from all aspects, from its immense Flagstone set and the beguiling desert scenery in the 2:35:1 aspect ratio; to the lengthy patience in atmosphere-building and character-establishing; to Morricone's sterling score, which can not be circumvented by any reviewers, the entire sound voyage of the film can take one's breath away, it is visceral, mellifluous and completely at the service of every plot turn, one can even admit, it gallantly steals the thunder from its visual counterpart, and Morricone's virtuosity is still without parallel, so is Sergio Leone's enormous contribution of the undying genre.",Once Upon a Time in the West
43,Red-Barracuda,A beautiful western,10,30 December 2010,"Once Upon A Time In The West is no ordinary western. Despite the non-descriptive title, this is a film that redefined the genre. With his dollars trilogy, director Sergio Leone proved that he was the master of the spaghetti western; with Once Upon A Time he transferred the conventions of that genre – the operatic sense of drama, the nihilism, extreme close-ups, epic widescreen photography, Ennio Morricone music and moral ambiguity – into Monument Valley, the setting of the traditional American western. The result is pretty unforgettable. Leone tells a simple story via images. Looks, as opposed to dialogue, are used to convey meaning wherever possible. When characters do speak, their lines are significant. Every bit of dialogue is considered, no one talks unnecessarily. This combined with the phenomenal cinematography and unforgettable music results in a sort of operatic minimalism. The western has never been depicted so artistically.There is a real feeling of time and space. The opening credit sequence where the three gunmen wait at the train station typifies this. Instead of launching straight into the initial confrontation, Leone waits. Insignificant details become epic. The fly and the dripping water for instance, are given real significance, and are integral to the pace of the scene. Nothing of narrative significance happens, not a word is said but the pacing and magnification of the smallest details add human depth to what would otherwise be cardboard characters.There are four stand-out performances from Charles Bronson, Henry Fonda, Claudia Cardinale and Jason Robards. Bronson plays Harmonica the mysterious stranger, Fonda brilliantly cast against type is the cold-eyed killer, Cardinale is the stunningly beautiful woman in the centre of the narrative and Robards is the grizzled outlaw. Together, they are terrific. And Leone moves them around the widescreen frame quite beautifully. Morricone's score once again is quite outstanding. The haunting harmonica theme is a particular standout; only Morricone could make a harmonica sound so sweeping, evocative and mystical.Once Upon A Time In The West is truly epic film-making of the very best kind. It's a western of intense emotions and brilliant acting; of peerless photography and ground-breaking music. It illustrates perfectly how to use cinematic space and how to pace events within it. It refashioned the western and brought the highest cinematic artistry to Monument Valley. It goes without saying that it is a masterpiece.",Once Upon a Time in the West

It just didn't entirely grip me as a whole. There's no doubting the high quality of the picture and the skill behind the camera that explodes on the screen, but I found it to be a rather empty experience. More so in the ponderous, wind-out feeling, than anything else. What made it a whole lot easier to take on aboard with this opera style story of raw emotional was that of Ennio Morricone's tailor made score. His usual unique and trademark sounds draw upon very strongly in the heartfelt, but also stinging moments of pure sublime touches that simply drains the energy out of you. Leone used that asset beautifully and crafted more emotion then words could display. Each tune had its own character and organic feel by finding its way into each shot and Harmonica's theme was simply breathtaking. Of course the sound effects was the film's most important and striking component.Also stimulating, grand landscapes cover the surface with splendidly, dynamic photography capturing the sombre mood and colourful faces. Leone's cunning direction is so composed and spacious by giving the film grit and a coldness, but with a certain elegance that never can be matched. He stages some cracking scenes and the showdowns are simply unforgettable. My eyes were certainly, glittering after the powerfully precise opening 15 minutes and it would go on to be one expansive stage show with authentic settings worked into the presentation by innovative composition. But his direction and storytelling is inspired from the music cues that control the actions and emotions. The fragmented story has a more serious and level approach to it and a death stench lingering within its context of the dying west (the railroad making headway) that emerges from these characters' journeys into the new frontier. And also a certain cycle of western references creep into the feature. Like his other films it doesn't glorify its actions, but its hard not to be taken by the visionary that's on show, despite the slow moving pace, flawed story (seems rushed and convoluted towards the end with some continuity shifts) and the way it milks out its scenes. But there's certain perfection in this craftsmanship that can tell many stories with out too much effort and it finishes up with a Zen like awe.Now the magnificent performances were very capable and Charles Bronson really surprised me in his sensational role as Harmonica and the doll face Claudia Cardinale is perfect as Jill. Especially since her character is the heart of the film. Ironically, the epitome of total cold-hearted and barbaric ominous fitted Henry Fonda like a glove here, as Frank. Jason Robards is the life of the party with the wise words, as Cheyenne and Gabriele Ferzetti was jarringly, good as power hungry, but psychically ill Morton. Also you have Woody Strode and Jack Elam in cool minor roles.Simply a ravishing, haunting and baroque looking western epic that deserves to be watched. Nothing short of high art, but I don't see it as the masterpiece like some do. But saying that, watching the special features on the disc has made me appreciate it even more to up it from an 8 to 9.",Once Upon a Time in the West
45,ElMaruecan82,The Agony and the Ecstasy of the Old West ...,10,8 March 2012,"""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a movie of a few words  but each one carries a symbolic resonance that transcends the limits of the story  and emotionally enriches it, leaving the seen and unseen, the spoken and unspoken, cohabiting in a perfect harmony.As usual in Sergio Leone's films, music plays a vital role as the movie lives through the perfect balance between what the scenes show and what the music conveys, as the line between the real and the abstract flirts with imperceptibility. The iconic tune played by Harmonica (Charles Bronson), one of the most defining of the Western genre, ominous and menacing, announces an imminent revenge while the woman's theme is more operatic and nostalgic. The beautiful Jill (Claudia Cardinale) came to Sweetwater as Mrs. McBain only to find her husband and his family as corpses, ordered to be killed by Morton, a ruthless crippled railroad baron, her theme embodies the sadness of a woman carrying the weight of an intolerable past as a gorgeous whore from New Orleans and her impossible purification. Harmonica and Jill are both prisoners of a condition they try to escape from, for a future desperately uncertain.That's the recurring theme of the ""Once Upon a Time "" series opened by Leone's Western masterpiece, they are less 'telling stories' than inviting us to contemplate the destiny of characters torn between haunting memories and a dreamy future, and that's what Leone's last films are : haunting and dreamy. While the 'Dollars' trilogy's hero played by Clint Eastwood had no name, therefore no family, and no connection whatsoever with the past, in ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", the two leads are incapable to be architects of their own fates if their soul are not in peace. There are no good or bad people but you can determine who the antagonists are by the way they had already sold their soul before the story begun. And speaking of antagonists, it's impossible to talk about ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" without mentioning the performance of Henry Fonda as Frank, one of the most despicable and sadistic movie villains.Fonda's performance is even more impressive because he's always been relegated to the roles of good-hearted and inspiring characters, and if there ever was something missing to prove how immensely versatile he is, it was a villainous performance. ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a role of a lifetime that allowed him to finally implode his talent. And the first effect Frank had on me was when I stopped watching the film, as a kid, as soon as he decimated the Irish red-haired McBain family. Maturity growing on me, I overcame that trauma and saw finally the shock for what it was, a demystification of the Old West, showing that what cost the lives of millions of Natives could also be applied to American pioneers, as their lives had no meaning for the major companies, like in other revisionist westerns such as ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" or ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"", the antagonism is commanded by big corporations in the name of 'progress'.""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is the poignant chronicle of a time that has passed, a time between tradition and progress, it's the demise of the Old West and the majestic flag it raised. The pioneer family is symbolically eliminated by the corporatist world. It's all about making profit and only a ruthless and heartless bastard like Frank could have accepted to kill a family for greed, what no other outlaw from John Ford's movies would have done, except a Native. The child was killed as a continuation of the McBain threat and Jill's sentence wouldn't have been suspended if she didn't have some assets of her own. Claudia Cardinale is the emotional core of the film, with this mix of false strong-mindedness and wisdom to know how to use charm as a survival instinct in a dark and savage world with no place for 'little people'. The light of hope that kills off this cynical mood is incarnated by the providential help of Harmonica and Cheyenne.Cheyenne plays a significant role as the counterpart of Fonda's Frank, an outlaw with principles and heart, the good Old West, his theme sounds like a playful saloon' piano tune and in a way, he seems to exist only to provide a connection with the past, for Jill so we can know more about her, he's her link to the past. And it's tragically ironic that he is shot by the crippled Morton, not even in a spot that would have made his misery short. His agony, magnificently expressed by Jason Robards, symbolizes the agony of the Old West myth, and elevates ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" as the masterpiece of Western revisionism.On a side note, I finished reading Ebert's review and I couldn't believe the man who put ""2001 : A Space Odyssey"" among his greatest films and said that a great movie was never too slow, complained about the slowness. The slowness is not just a trademark in Leone's film but an absolute necessity to taste the instant's poetry. It's like a joke that is repeated so many times, it goes from being funny to annoying until it becomes funny again, the breath-taking beauty of the cinematography invites for a meticulous attention to details, you've got enough time to see the 'unspoken' in the eyes of characters; to contemplate the magnificence and the ugliness, to let yourself haunted by the lyricism of the moment, what can't be done with faster pacing.Leone is a director who trusts the intelligence and the patience of the viewer, and doesn't adapt his style to the attention span of the audience but invites the audience to appreciate these long quiet moments before the storm.",Once Upon a Time in the West
46,paul2001sw-1,There's a train a'coming...,5,8 January 2009,"Most westerns are actually about the death of the old, wild, west; and 'Once Upon a Time in the West', with its story centred on the coming of the railroad, is no exception. One thing that Sergio Leone has done in this movie is to make a truly cinematic film: it's hard to imagine how the script read, as so much of the meaning is conveyed in the facial expressions of the actors or by Enrico Morricone's score - there's a balletic quality to Leone's work. Unfortunately, I found the music intrusive, the exaggerated grimacing of the characters merely comic, and the plot contrived, difficult to follow and arbitrarily bloody; I don't believe that even in the wildest west, six people would be killed outside a bar and everyone inside would just carry on drinking as if nothing had happened. Personally, I prefer Robert Altman's treatment of a similar storyline in 'McCabe and Mrs. Miller', a film that uses rather fewer of the conventions of the western, but which seems closer to life as a result.",Once Upon a Time in the West
47,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Perhaps Leone's best.,8,3 June 2020,"'Once Upon A Time In The West (1968)' is an epic not of scale but of scope, more concerned with unspoken emotion than complex plotting. Of course, the thing is still grand in almost every sense of the word. I mean, just look at it. It's gorgeous. Leone proves, once and for all, that he's the master of composition, making each and every frame as beautiful as possible. The screen constantly seems full, be it with a sweeping vista or a single pair of eyes, and that makes for an incredibly engaging experience. It isn't busy - in fact, it makes a point of taking its time - but it's always saying something. The entire affair feels soaked in emotion, an intangible romanticism that almost provokes a strange kind of nostalgic melancholy. It's an odd effect but it's undeniable; there's nothing quite like it. Instead of focusing on macho stand-offs or, even, western archetypes, it focuses on the dynamics between its core cast of somewhat atypical characters. They aren't outwardly complex but they are inwardly rich, brimming with desires and feelings their harsh environment doesn't quite allow them to express. They're all portrayed impeccably, too. This is the kind of acting that doesn't get the recognition it deserves, the kind that can break your heart without so much as a whisper. It's all in the eyes, be they bright blue or boldly brown, and it feels strangely real. Make no mistake, the film is stylish. Its final dual may just be my favourite in film history, with its perfect editing and bullet-across-time conclusion. Then, there's the music. Morricone's score may just be the best he has ever produced. Each distinct character theme is almost as effective as the last, contrasting and complementing in the most satisfying of ways. It's simply sublime. The same can be said of the entire affair, really. It's arguably Leone's best effort, easily rising towards the top of its genre, and it's undeniably affecting, to boot. It keeps getting more and more impressive, its filmmaking often making you smile simply because it's so good. It's also really entertaining. There's no doubt that the experience is one worth having all over again. 8/10",Once Upon a Time in the West
48,gbill-74877,"Classic, but has some flaws",7,24 February 2018,"Coming in at 2 hours and 45 minutes, and giving us vast canvases of the old west, this film from director Sergio Leone is truly epic in scope. The cinematography is fantastic, and while marveling over the wide shots, you really feel as dry and dusty as the characters. The overall tone screams old west, and while it takes awhile to get there, the final 30 minutes or so is stirring, and memorable. The film is legendary in reputation and adored by many, so I'll tread as lightly as possible in my criticism. I just found it fell a little short in its casting, in its muddled middle portion, and its treatment of Claudia Cardinale's character. I'll start with Henry Fonda, who is a mixed bag for me. I liked the contrast of his blue eyes with his dark character, and he certainly does things which emphasize his cruelty - killing a child in cold blood, knocking down his crippled boss, and committing rape. It's a decent performance, but to me Fonda didn't quite fit in the part. Not enough grit to be believable, and at 63, too old. Charles Bronson is similarly 'just ok', and he's certainly no Clint Eastwood. It may be unfair to compare Leone to his other work, but I liked 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' much more, because of Eastwood, a more compelling plot, and that extraordinary musical refrain. The harmonica we get here kind of pales in comparison. While it's fantastic to see the beautiful Cardinale in the film, the rape scene made me cringe, and not because of the act itself, but because how Leone captures it. Cardinale is supposed to be pretending to go along with Fonda to survive, so some of what we see is to be expected, but to see no fear or disgust, and just waves of rapture instead, is sickening. Earlier Cardinale says that Cheyenne (Jason Robards) could bend her over the table and have his men have their way with her, and all she'd have to do is wash off with hot water afterwards. It could be the voice of the hardened prostitute talking, but the overall impression of rape this scene and the other give is that it's just a sex act, one a woman may actually enjoy, instead of an act of great violence with devastating consequences. So we have a male fantasy of rape to go alone with that of the fantasy of the fearless, cool gunslinger, the latter of which has plenty of Americans wanting to walk around carrying a gun, thinking they fit this image.My apologies if this is coming across unbalanced in the other direction, and too negative. There are plenty of great moments and great shots, both of the scenery and in close-ups. The relationship between Fonda and Bronson is effective, and as in Leone's other works, they share the mindset of the hardened killer, understanding one another as they circle each other's path throughout the movie. While we certainly have an idea of the backstory behind Bronson's character, the reveal towards the end is a powerful moment. If you like westerns, this is must-see. If you don't, I don't think I'd pick this one to try to convert you.",Once Upon a Time in the West
49,cricketbat,They could have cut out 45 minutes,6,28 December 2018,"Once Upon a Time in the West isn't Sergio Leone's best work, but it's still an iconic Western. It features complex characters and an engaging storyline -- not to mention a memorable soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. However, they could have cut out 45 minutes and it still would have felt a little long. This movie drags a bit. Don't watch it when you're sleepy.",Once Upon a Time in the West
50,secondtake,"Hey, it's slow on purpose. Is that a good thing? When it's this gorgeous, yes.",8,5 November 2010,"Once Upon a Time in the West (1968)On the heels of ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,"" is this equally sprawling and archetypal Western, this time with less obvious dubbing, and Henry Fonda as a kind of tie in to Hollywood's hero paradigm. It's indescribably beautiful, one of the most gorgeous Westerns ever photographed, indeed a model for good visual directing and cinematography in any genre. That alone makes the almost three hours a pure pleasure.But it's not a fast movie in any other way. It can't be. It depends on lingering over delicious details, small ones, shot up close in startling detail and ever deadpan looks and steely eyes. Nothing is believable and it's not meant to be. It's not even a fable, quite, but more a celebration of being inside an incredible film, as strange as that sounds. Not that the scenes are not believable--even the very last shots of the makeshift town and the railroad being built is about as realistic as it gets. Great stuff.Plot? You might, at times, wonder where the plot went. There are lots of bad guys, and you're not totally sure there's a protagonist, unless the one woman in the movie is the center of our concerns, even if she is clearly a bystander to it all. When it gets clear, in the last twenty minutes, it's again archetypal (and has echoes of the over the tops showdown in ""Good Bad and Ugly""). A small bit of slow motion (not needed normally in a movie where everything is slow already) makes clear this is the key moment in the film, the thing that made the rest of it, with all its confusing and violent layers, sensible.For my money, I'd love all this incredible visceral stuff, the sounds and sights, filled in with some kind of deeply felt conflict, not a purely dramatic one. I watch and am shocked, or swept away, or impressed, or dazzled, but I'm actually never moved, not from the heart. And there are plenty of aspects here that should really move us--including feeling for the woman's plight, rather than simply recognizing that it is, after all, quite a plight.Still, another landmark Sergio Leone movie.",Once Upon a Time in the West

52,Bored_Dragon,Who are these people?,10,4 October 2018,"Damn, I don't know where to start. First, there's no Clint Eastwood. Why the hell this movie does not have Clint Eastwood?! There's no John Wayne either. If there is neither Eastwood nor Wayne it is not Western. I mean, who are these people?! Whoever heard of Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda ?! OK, maybe true cinephiles did, but we ordinary mortals did not pay a ticket to watch some unknown faces that only fans of art drama know. Second, the story. The story is so superficial and shallow and linear that it does not hold attention for half an hour, let alone three. And not to speak about racism and sexism. All the main characters are white. Few black people appear here and there as servants and few Indians just briefly pass the screen and that's about all diversity you'll get. And not the single gay man. Leading female character is a prostitute. A prostitute is a woman they pay for sex. And this actress is so nasty that I would not touch her even if she paid me. Claudia Cardinale?! Why didn't he cast Sharon Stone or Charlize Theron to fill theaters properly. Or, even better, Laura Dern, so we can watch this instead of porn. No, he cast some grandma born in '38, my goodness. And this Morricone is all the same. The fourth film in a row he can not think of nothing new, so he steals music from the commercials. And the one with the harmonica that knows only two tones. He could have learned at least one decent song if he wanted to play a musician. I mean, really...I'm sorry. I read crappy reviews every day for years and I just had to try. I saw ""Dollar Trilogy"" several times and I was sure it is a peak of the genre. And until now, when I'm almost forty, I didn't realize I haven't seen ""Once Upon a Time in the West"". This movie could be added as the fourth part of the ""trilogy"". Instead of Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef here we have Fonda, Robards and Bronson, but although I personally prefer the first three, I must admit that these are no worse. Leone and Morricone managed to maintain the standard that they set up by the ""trilogy"", and the story, although significantly different than in a trilogy, is no less complex and brutal. For my taste, three hours is a bit too much, but the film is not boring for a moment, and Claudia Cardinale I could easily watch for six hours. However, I have to distance it from ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" at least a bit, so I rate it9,5/10",Once Upon a Time in the West

54,slightlymad22,A Masterpiece,9,3 February 2021,"Once Upon A Time In The West (1968)I love this Sergio Leone classic. Unfortunately, they will never make a movie like this again. As sadly people are put off by 3 hour run times unless it is an action packed Avengers movie.This isn't action packed, it's very slow-paced as Leone really allows it to breathe, there are long scenes with no dialogue, the opening scene of example. Made today, I think an hour with be trimmed as audiences don't have the attention span. Even trailers have 15 second mini trailers before the actual trailer starts, because of this.It has Henry Fonda playing against type as a bad guy, with intensely blue eyes, he is an evil, cold blooded, nasty man!! God, he is chillingly brilliant. Easily one of the best movie villains of all time. And yes, I don't say that lightly, he really is up there with Hans Gruber and Darth Vader, for me.Charles Bronson (originally Leone wanted Clint Eastwood, but he wasn't interested, then he offered it to James Coburn, but he wanted too much money) is amazing as Harmonica, a character whose motivations, you are never quite sure about.. But my God!! When you see a flashback.... It's absolutely brutal. Bronson is so cool here, it's a brilliant performance.One of Ennino Morricone's finest and epic scores stands out too.Claudia Cardinale needs mentioning as Jill McBain, she is brilliant.Epic film making, and just a work of art.Sergio Leone liked to tell the story of a cinema in Paris, where the film ran uninterrupted for two years. When he visited this theater, he was surrounded by fans who wanted his autograph, as well as the projectionist, who was less than enthusiastic. Leone claimed the projectionist told him ""I kill you!

55,sol-,West Stride Story,9,10 May 2017,"Captivating right from the eerie, near silent opening with only the faintest sounds of birds and windmills, this critically acclaimed Sergio Leone western circles around a widow, the man who killed her husband and two strangers who have their own reasons for helping the widow beyond simple benevolence. To reveal any more of the plot would not do the film justice because part of its charm is how gradual the exposition is; only as it slowly progresses do we begin to get clues as to what is motivating all the characters. This might sound a little frustrating, and at times it is, but there is a lot to like about how we are simply thrown into the middle of the story (as clueless as the widow is), forced to observe these characters and see what makes them tick before coming to understand their actions. This is an inventive film beyond its storytelling approach though with much quotable dialogue (""you brought two too many""), imaginative shooting scenes (a boot!) and several impressive graphic/audio matches, most notably a speeding bullet cut against an approaching train. The conclusion of the movie is perhaps too sentimental for its own good and the very deliberate pacing of the project is not going to please everyone, but it is amazing how great a film Leone and his team manage to spin here with such an unconventional plot unraveling approach.",Once Upon a Time in the West
56,briancham1994,Master of tension,9,3 January 2021,"Previously I had watched Sergio Leone's famous The Good, The Bad and the Ugly and I was not that impressed by his use of slow tension-building scenes in that film, but Once Upon a Time in the West has fully won me over. The slow scenes here are used to great effect to construct an impression of a desolate, anarchist wasteland with plenty of masculine bandits who really rule the land. Every little moment has its purpose - the playing of a harmonica, the buzzing of a fly, the wind in the desert and more. This all supports a gradually unfolding story that is as mysterious as its characters, culminating in the victory of big business, railways and the building of civilisation that end the classic impression of the ""wild west"" the characters thrive in.",Once Upon a Time in the West

58,Dr_Coulardeau,"Good, better, best, bestest !!",10,30 November 2008,"Sergio Leone is unique in his field, and particularly in the western genre. He was in his fourth year of spaghetti western, let's say in full swing, in this film. You know it is Sergio Leone by several elements that do not tell a lie. The music always has the same texture, the same taste, the same sonorities, with the eternal harmonica. Then the landscape, the sunshine, the light, the vegetation and of course practically no fauna, and in this one, not even a snake. Hardly a few horses, a couple of partridges, or whatever, and a pair of chickens. Nothing to brag about. Sergio Leone is concentrating anyway on the human animal and there the menagerie is by far diverse and grotesque enough. Then the economy of the dialogue is also typical because Sergio Leone never uses one word too many when he can do without any word at all. The silences are long and so meaningful that you must be blind not to hear the resounding sense of that emptiness. Then the few words that are actually pronounced become so powerful in their scarcity and rarity that you definitely have to be deaf not to see the subtlety of that sound track. Those are the most significant traits of Sergio Leone's style. And this film is the acme of that style. The plot itself innovates in the subject, that is to say in who the thieves are. In this case some railroad contractor who wants to get rid of some settler who has bought a big chunk of land on the very way where the railroad has to go and who has a contract that allows the railroad to go through for nothing if the station is built before the train can come. You can then imagine the intricacies of the action between several gangs and tribes and bands of good and bad men, bad and good beings, and all the nuances, hues and shades in between. The best detail of course comes at the end when the main bad guy realizes who the one who has just destroyed him is. Don't expect me to tell you. You have to watch the film till the very last five minutes to finally understand. Enjoy it. And if you get the collector's edition you will also enjoy the complementary features on railroads and their advance in and through the west.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",Once Upon a Time in the West
59,zkonedog,"Leone's Overblown ""Epic"" More About Nostalgia Than Merit",2,4 March 2017,"After recently re-watching Sergio Leone's ""The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly"", I was recommended this film by someone who considers it to be the greatest western of all-time. Suffice it to say, it has been a long time since I have been so let down by a film.For a basic plot summary, ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" is a battle over a piece of valuable land owned by recently-widowed Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale). Frank (Henry Fonda) wants the land to prop up his corrupt outlaw philosophy, while Cheyenne (Jason Robards) & mysterious stranger Harmonica (Charles Bronson) fight to help the widow.To say that this film can even hold a candle to Leone's earlier spaghetti westerns is almost an injustice. Whereas the ""Man With No Name"" trilogy (and especially ""G,B,U"") is full of drama, tension, and incredible atmosphere, ""Time"" is as dry and parched as the territory in which it is set. Leone westerns have never been known for their sterling plots, and this one is no better. The difference, though, is that his other efforts cultivate that incredible atmosphere of tension/mood. At no point during ""Time"", though, did I ever feel as if I were excited or emotionally involved whatsoever. An hour into it I was wondering when the action would pick up, 90 minutes in I knew I was going to be severely disappointed, and two hours in I actually even began fast-forwarding a bit (and I can't even remember the last time I did that with a movie).So, why is this movie considered one of the greatest westerns of all-time? IMHO, it is because of the nostalgia factor for those who remember the ""Golden Age of Westerns"" in the 1960s. First off, movies were just made differently back then; it being an ""event"" to see ""Time"" (something that will leave an indelible memory). Secondly, Fonda was a big draw back then, as was Bronson as the ""man's man"" (strong and silent type). While I can name movies featuring both of those actors that I thoroughly enjoy, their combination here is pitiful. A scene towards the end of the film that is supposed to mimic the graveyard scene at the end of ""G,B,U"" actually even elicited a laugh from me. The Eastwood/Wallach/Cleef chemistry is nowhere to be found here. The only reason I can see someone enjoying this is for the same reason that, 20 years down the road, I will get a kick out of watching movies (even some of the bad ones) from my generation. Finally, Claudia Cardinale is the epitome of 1960s sex appeal which, again, plays more on viewer nostalgia than actual performance.Upon completing ""Time"", I did a little research on its critical reception, finding that when it was released in 1968, it came in barely over budget. Essentially, it was kind of a dud. Only in subsequent decades did it obtain the reverent place in the western genre it holds today. Again, then, I would argue strongly for the nostalgia factor being the prime motive behind that reckoning. From an ""outsider"" viewpoint like mine (I've seen a lot of westerns, but was born in 1985), ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" is neither exciting or even particularly artistic. It is just a stinker.",Once Upon a Time in the West
60,johnnyboyz,"Leone falls in love with his style a little too much toward the end but this is still a cracking film, albeit it has gained a status I'm not entirely sure it deserves.",7,27 July 2008,"Leone's now iconic film stands out for two very distinct things for me, personally. That is, number one: the brilliant, brilliant soundtrack that adds feeling; raw emotion and atmosphere as well as number two: editing and shot composition which differs between long, wide angled long shots to the gritty close up of the face for certain reactions and objects for certain atmosphere. Many things have been said about how brilliant the film is and in terms of the genre, this genre film is usually considered one of if not the pinnacle itself of the Western. But whereas the typical American western might include John Wayne or some other such hard bodied American taking on a role of 'honest as they come guy' who gets caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time, Once Upon a Time in the West is a slower and less-obvious film that somewhat ignores these conventions. Therefore it is a shame that I liked it rather than loved it once it had ended.The European influence grabs a hold of you right from the off in Once Upon a Time in the West. Afterwards I read a brief summary on the film stating it may well have the best opening to any film ever and that could well be the case. Leone's style here is to ignore the process of 'action, causes action, causes re-action, action, causes action...etc.' and show the guys who are a part of Frank's (Fonda) gang wait for a train to arrive rather than have the train arrive; have the gang arrive and then play out actions  Leone pays attention to sound (windmill and the fly) and has tantalising long shots of the train track in the distance that announces to us that the train is not going to arrive anytime soon. Cut back to ground level and the guys are killing time before the train arrives  we don't know why they're there and given it's a Western, they could be minutes away from death so the character's casualness and the build up through composition work really well.Once Upon a Time in the West carries a certain elegance despite its dirty, gritty and slimy nature. Characters look rough, wear dirty clothes and spit more than they need to and the dusty desert locations in Spain and The States work so well that to see the film is to almost feel hot and bothered. From the opening, the film develops with the arrival of Harmonica (Bronson), a man with no name indeed bar the one he's given by a fellow character for spending so much time playing said instrument. As a character, Harmonica epitomises the strange, the mysterious - a man that does not, you feel, belong in the film but a man who has his reasons and a back-story but the European influence is there again in the sense Leone chooses not to show it until well into the film. As a character, Harmonica brings diegetic music to the film in the form of his harmonica, an object he will never forget the manner of which he came across it. When it is played, it echoes and sounds louder than usual giving the man a presence that is almost uncanny  the music teeters on the brink of being within the film and not being within the film and certainly maintains a brooding and unnatural atmosphere.But Leone does not limit his style to composition choice, locations and harmonica sounds. He broadens his arsenal so much so that at times, the objects are doing the speaking for the characters. Another character is introduced, she is Jill McBain (Cardinale) and she arrives, like Harmonica, into this town by train. The genius here is that a simple introduction of a character by train has been stretched out through having a prior tragic event happen in a preceding scene that will affect McBain  how will she react? Then there is the brilliant cutting between her pocket watch and the station clock, creating a 'jump' in time between waiting there. Such a technique is rarely seen today and further acts as an example of Leone's ignoring of the 'action, causes action, etc.' method.But even that is not the first time it happens since later on, a card game will happen in a train caboose which doubles up as the only urban inspired 'space' in the film amongst all the dusty and dirty rural settings. The game is accompanied by odd sounding train noises which could be read into as the noises going on inside the player's minds as the pot grows and the tension rises. Once Upon a Time in the West is a film that can bring pleasure to its viewer but it's really brining its director the most pleasure. At 165-odd minutes, Leone is clearly in love with his unfolding of a film rather than his telling of a story and his style does overtake a lot of what I would've liked to have seen, that is to say more of an interesting narrative and less of the style once it had been established he could do it. But it will remain a film studied and looked at for years to come. Like I said with the original Japanese Godzilla film, you get the impression if they'd known it was going to be looked at and studied so much in the future, they might've made sure it would have held up a little more.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Saw this recently again on a DVD aft many years. The plot- Claudia Cardinale arrives at her ranch, to find that her husband has been murdered by hired gun Henry Fonda. Mysterious gunman Charles Bronson wants an appointment with Fonda. Bronson teams up with outlaw Jason Robards to help protect Cardinale n her ranch from Fondas evil intentions. There are long scenes where you get close shots of a person's face. Sergio Leone loves the stare-down, and you can see it in virtually all of his films. In this movie he allows the camera to linger longer than ever before. You get those quiet scoreless scenes where the natural sounds of the environment are greatly exaggerated. Leone's opponents take a long time to feel each other out before they act. One may find the long stretches of silence and inaction tedious n boring. Honestly, even i found some scenes boring, especially the opening scene. Henry Fonda is terrific. No one expected him to play such a ruthless and brutal killer. Bronson was decent but Jason Robards was much better with his tip on guys patting females bottom n the tip on don't get shot by a person who doesn't know to shoot. One of the best part bah the film was Ennio Morricone's score, especially the recurring harmonica music during the final closing fight. This is Morricone's best moment in a long, treasured career.

63,SAMTHEBESTEST,The Greatest Western of All Time. Sergio Leone surpasses his own Western Cult Classics.,8,25 November 2020,"Once Upon A Time In The West (1968) :
Brief Review -The Greatest Western of All Time. Sergio Leone surpasses his own Western Cult Classics. Hollywood was finding it tough producing Classic Western during 60s after delivering so many Iconic westerns in Old Hollywood and then a Master Director Sergio Leone took this genre to whole New Level in the 60s decade. He delivered a Cult Trilogy in Spaghetti Western genre which was considered the Best Western at it's time. When people thought this is the end line, we can't get better than this in Spaghetti Western then Leone made Once Upon a Time In The West and proved those people wrong. I am stunned, thrilled and shocked to see that one man delivered 4 Universal Classics in the same genre and all of them in the same decade. OUATITW is perhaps the last level of quality filmmaking in Western genre and i am saying this after watching so many classic Westerns (although i am yet to see just one or two). Sergio Leon's cinematic vision while presenting this Human story is unmatchable. The way he crafted the story, characters, showcases, filmmaking aspects and his own directorial skills is stupendous. People always say there is nothing called a perfect film, yes i agree but there's something called near perfect and that's what this film is. A terrific writing, amazing screenplay, perfect casting, fabulous storytelling and visionary restoration of western work it all takes this film above classic status. I easily point out the minuses in any film and even in Classic films but don't ask me what went wrong in this film. Because there was nothing wrong in it. I have to say a thing which i don't say often, yes Everything is Perfect. What a great star cast this film had. Henry Fonda in one of the most powerful antagonist's role, Charles Bronson as one hell of a protagonist, Jason Robards in one of the best supporting role ever written and Claudia Cardinale as gorgeous brunette. Now i got one problem here, i said that everything was perfect in the film except for one thing. The character of Jill played by Claudia Cardinale was that one imperfect thing. I mean i don't know how carelessly it was written and handled in this nearly Perfect Cult Film. She was married to one man, then she was sleeping with antagonist to give everything to him and then she was loving protagonist and the supporting character too. This all in the Span of Just few days, not years or months. What the hell was that? Except for this mistake i don't have any complaints at all. I was about to go with 9/10 rating with Masterpiece Verdict but that one big blinder with lady's character forced me to cut down half the mark )Why the hell do we even need a lady in big role in western films?). Anyways, Once Upon A Time In The West is a Cult Classic and a Must Watch for every single movie buff who knows or want to know Western Genre. Probably, the Film Of The Decade.RATING - 8.5/10*By - #samthebestest",Once Upon a Time in the West
64,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"A Leone classic, a Morricone masterpiece",9,22 August 2009,"After completing the Dollars trilogy, one would come to expect Sergio Leone to have reached his peak with ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" just two years earlier, but he doesn't let up an inch with ""Once Upon A Time in the West."" The Italian-born filmmaker delivers once again the kind of western the genre will be remembered by.Then there's Ennio Morricone, Leone's longtime composer. He is the glue of ""West"" if not arguably all Leone's films. Assigning musical themes to each of the film's three main outlaws, he gives us something to truly remember the film by, something to cushion his intense close-ups and lengthy takes. What makes his work in ""West"" so special, however, is that it carries so much more weight. It's a living, breathing part of the script and it gives the conflict energy considering these characters don't say much, at least compared to Clint Eastwood's character in the Dollars trilogy. Although Morricone's ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" theme is his most memorable, that film has more to hang its hat on.""West"" is Leone's dream spaghetti western, an American western done in his style. Admiring Henry Fonda, he convinced Fonda to play one of his most unique roles as the outlaw Frank, a merciless killer employed by a railroad owner. Then he brings in Charles Bronson as the quiet but hardened Harmonica, who offers his help to the beautiful widow Jill McBain, whose husband and family were killed by Frank because their huge property stood in the way of railroad expansion.It's classic revenge-driven western, where every scene feels on the verge of something big. The use of the Techniscope when filming, which helped make ""Ugly"" a step above its predecessors, continues to serve Leone well for close-ups and various camera movements. Faces are so important in Leone's work and he has some excellent ones to work with such as the blue-eyed Fonda.Then there's the way this film quietly revolves around the railroad, the wheels of progress, the symbolism of movement -- all of which are inherently American while also making great material for Leone. One of the film's best scenes, for example, is when the third outlaw, Cheyenne (Jason Robards), who Harmonica enlists as help, takes out a bunch of guys on a moving train.But what this film keeps coming back to is the way Morricone's score tells this story, or as I've read, even dictates the story at points. Every time his music is at its fullest, electric guitar riffs and all, the film is just infused with this great power. Even when what's on screen doesn't completely say everything you need to know, this masterful score fills in the gaps. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",Once Upon a Time in the West
65,funkyfry,Leone's best film?,10,28 October 2002,"The western to end all.  A film about American mythology, to which end Henry Fonda is central as a sadistic hitman.  This role pretty much undoes his whole career of do-gooding (with the exception of ""Fort Apache"", which, it has been noted before, shows signs of influence on ""Once Upon a Time...""), but more so it also undoes a ""mythological"" complex in American film. 
The film's shallowness is in its inability to produce any artistic or philosophic alternative to the myth.  Its attempt to do this is Claudia Cardinale as ""earth mother""/water bearer.  Her character, the protagonist, is interesting and there are many parallels to Joan Crawford in ""Johnny Guitar"" (redeemed prostitute, the ""dream"" of a rail station, etc.). 
The images are blazing with truth, and the characters are fantastic.  We even get to see Woody Strode and Jack Elam in a memorable opening scene involving a fly (possibly a touch characteristic of contributing author Dario Argento?).  Bronson is very good in the role of the ""man with no name"" or ""man with the harmonica"" or whatever you want to call him. 
The music is some of Morricone's best.This is a western film that is about westerns, about the West, about America, about Europe, about art and death.  It impresses me that Fonda's character is not truly evil:  he's actually a petty, unsuccessful hitman, out to grab a piece of the West, and doomed to fail.  This makes him no less frightening, for he is a dangerous man.  But it does strike a blow at the whole image of the ""villain"" in the West which, if this film had been seen by more people, might have undone the whole genre (much as his previous ""Fistful of Dollars"" undid the hero in the genre).",Once Upon a Time in the West

Only then those wonderful actors called Claudia Cardinale, Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Jason Robards. And between them, as a gorgeous and vital ""buffer"", Morricone's music, without which any Leone's movie would have the half-size of the value if not even reduced to a quarter. I've seen it several times, I studied for a long time, I could give my doctoral thesis with this film, as with all the other films directed by old Sergio. The story is very simple and the only secret, the true identity of Bronson-Harmonica, is revealed, just like in other Leone's films, only at the end. Jack Elam and Woody Strode would have deserved more screen time. It could have taken, for example from Gabriele Ferzetti's time. Lionel Stander, Keenan Wynn, Paolo Stoppa and Frank Wolff are very good and

Sergio Leone's flick has three things going for it that make this one a classic, 1.) The opening credit scene. 2.) Having Henry Fonda play such a despicable, sleazy low life character and 3.) The final showdown between Harmonica (Charles Bronson) and Fonda. The movie has been beautifully restored (I wish they had the rights to his four hour cut).

68,bsmith5552,Leone's Homage to the American Western!,9,7 December 2003,"""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is arguably Director Sergio Leone's best movie. Having established himself with North American audiences with the Clint Eastwood ""Dollars"" trilogy (1964-66), he creates here a homage to the American western complete with Monument Valley locations and recognizable American actors in the leading roles. This film has to be seen in widescreen at is full 165 minute running time to be fully appreciated. Leone creates breath taking panoramic shots using John Ford's favorite Monument Valley locations. And there's that beautiful haunting score by Ennio Morricone within which, there are framed. And the opening sequence at the railway station seems to be a tip of the hat to High Noon"" (1952), as well. The story begins with the McBain family on a ranch in the middle of nowhere, being slaughtered by a gang of outlaws led by the cold-hearted tobacco spewing Frank (Henry Fonda). The reason for this carnage is not made known until much later. Meanwhile three of Frank's gunmen including Woody Strode and Jack Elam are awaiting the arrival of a stranger, known only as ""Harmonica"" (Charles Bronson), because of the eerie theme that he plays before speaking. Leone adds a couple of nice touches that break the tension in this sequence. First there is a hilarious encounter between Elam and a persistent fly and Strode standing under a leaky roof letting the drops land on his hat and then drinking the water. Anyway, it seems that McBain (Frank Wolf) had taken a wife while in New Orleans and was awaiting her arrival at the time of his murder. The bride, Jill (Claudia Cardinale) arrives and learns of the tragedy and goes to the ranch. Meanwhile at a trading post, we meet the bandit ""Cheyenne"" (Jason Robards) who has been blamed for the massacre and is being pursued by the law. While there, he meets Harmonica and it turns out they are on the same side but for different reasons. Jill it seems has a ""past"" and already knows both Frank and Cheyenne. She figures out the reason for the massacre. Railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzatti) was after the ranch because there is water underneath the land. He sent Frank to murder the McBain's dressed like Cheyenne's gang. And, Harmonica also has a bone to pick with Frank. Amid a few double crosses, a few gunfights and a final showdown everything is sorted out. The casting of Fonda as the chief villain, was stroke of genius. Cast against type as a cold hearted henchman with no feelings, he gives a chilling performance. (Omigod was that Henry Fonda who shot down that kid?). Bronson, who would achieve major stardom as the result of this role, is perfect as the silent hero. Robards turns in his usual good performance as Cheyenne, however his character really adds little to the plot. Cardinale, who was a major star in European and American films at the time, is totally miscast as the heroine. Her accent is inappropriate for this role. Ferzatti turns in an excellent performance as the greedy but crippled and dying Morton. And look for Lionel Stander and Keenan Wynn in brief cameo roles as well. One could easily see Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach in the roles played by Bronson, Fonda and Robards respectively, and reportedly Leone originally wanted them, but it is now hard to imagine anyone else in the parts. One of the best westerns of all time, Leone's masterpiece.",Once Upon a Time in the West
69,thinker1691,"""When you've killed Four, it's easy to make it five.""",9,27 June 2007,"In the annals of western film lore, there are good and bad films. This is one of the finest. Because ""Once Upon A Time in The West"" is such a remarkable film, it is hard to define what makes it so memorable. The story centers on a beautiful former prostitute called Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) who arrives to assume the role of wife to a stubborn, crazy, red-headed Irishman with a dream. Waiting, instead is tragedy and 'Mr. Morton' who is a powerful, but ailing land grabbing baron (Gabriele Ferzetti) who desires to crush everything and everyone who stands in his way to reach the Pacific ocean with his railroad. To help him is an equally ruthless gunfighter named Frank (Henry Fonda; the success of this movie owes much to Fonda who plays a very convincing heavy) who has been removing obstacles for years and now targets the McBain family for death and that includes Jill. Unfortunately for Frank, he has accrued many enemies over the years with one particular, mysterious and deadly Harmonica playing stranger seeking revenge. Frank arranges for three of his best and fastest gun hands to meet and eliminate the stranger at the train-station. Joining the instrument playing stranger is an unpredictable, half-breed, renegade, who is a notorious gunfighter called 'Cheyenne.' ( Jason Robards ) The entire film is a triumph to the superb direction of Sergio Leone, who christens each major character with their own theme song. Each theme was created by Ennio Morricone and when the character makes an entrance, the theme prepares the audience for mood change, drama, action, and lifelong memories. Special guest appearances, by Woody Strode, Jack Elam, Keenan Wynn and Lionel Stander add to the classic nature of this excellent story. ****",Once Upon a Time in the West
70,BeneCumb,"Slow, but stylish and witty",8,16 November 2013,"Once Upon a Time in the West is an epic western focusing on the fate of four different persons, with roots in the past and extension of railways in the background. Life is hard, with lots of violence and injustice, and all means are good for increasing wealth... Apart from directing, camera-work and music, the cast is great as well, particularly all protagonists: Claudia Cardinale as Jill McBain, Henry Fonda as Frank (looks like younger Jack Nicholson - or vice versa), Jason Robards as Cheyenne, Charles Bronson as Harmonica. Their expressiveness is great, boosted by long camera shots; today's fast alternation of events (= often shallowness) does not need such acting anymore - pity... And many filmmakers today would create a max 1,5 hour movie from such a script.For many contemporary viewers, some scenes are too long and out of context, but as there are tensions behind and it is a color movie, then they do not become annoying.

71,Polaris_DiB,"Trans-genre, highly influenced and influential, vengeance narrative",9,10 January 2008,"Normally I'm suspicious of Westerns, mostly because I really don't like the Cowboys and Indians sub-genre and I'm not very keen on the expansionist themes inherent in most Westerns, stated or otherwise. Like any genre, however, there are exceptions, and of course Once Upon a Time in the West is one of them. Sergio Leone creates a methodical, tension-rising piece of vengeance narrative set in the hard-grit reality of the West, featuring gorgeous vistas, compellingly brown-faced gunslingers, and a surprisingly unique rocking score by Ennio Morricone.Four people arrive in a small town in one day. The first is a mysterious stranger later dubbed ""Harmonica"" because of his token entrance cue and prominent instrument playing, a man searching for a one ""Frank."" The other is Frank himself, psychotic yet conniving muscle-man of a railroad emperor, out to gain his own business prospects and kill a few men, women, and children in the process. The third is handsome Cheyenne, rascal bandit of the old-school type who has his honor but also his history. And the fourth, and most important, is Jill McBain, ex-prostitute from New Orleans come to a wedding destroyed by cause of death of the groom, who has to learn how to protect her own interests in an outlaw world of grit and steel as the three men connive over the various things they want from her.Leone takes his time, building relationships like Kurosawa and allowing the camera to just soak in the imagery like his contemporary and script-writer, Dario Argento. Leone is famous for his ""spaghetti westerns"", Italian takes on what is quintessentially an American-themed genre, but he shows an awareness, respect, and even joy for the type of imagery and action that the genre creates. Furthermore, he sees the isolation as key--this vengeance narrative could not exist in the vigilante-style of a city, nor in a much more temperate climate, much less could the characters really grasp and engage with each other the same way had they closer connections. In a way, heck, one could consider this film something of a horror film, as the unknown (the motivations of Harmonica) drives anxiety and tension to an ultimate moment of revelation that stabs right for the gut.

73,ackstasis,"""When you hear a strange sound, drop to the ground""",9,13 February 2009,"Sergio Leone may not have chosen the high-brow subject subject matter of his 1960s European contemporaries, but, boy, his films are pure cinema. Leone may have progressed beyond the charming but erratic editing style of his earliest Westerns  'A Fistful of Dollars (1964)' and 'For a Few Dollars More (1965)'  but his use of the camera is unlike any other filmmaker I've ever seen. The director's wide frame, captured in Techniscope, is like a freshly-painted canvas, its watercolours glistening under the intense Western sun, and style dripping from every shot. Mostly gone is the slightest hint of parody that I observed in his earlier films; Ennio Morricone's score, rather than being joyously overwhelming as in 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly (1966),' instead meditates gracefully on the passions and losses of its major characters. This added grace recognisable throughout the film emerges no doubt from a far greater budget, the film bankrolled by Paramount Pictures and shot largely in the United States {with Leone paying tribute to John Ford through the use of his favoured Monument Valley}.Leone has stated that ""the rhythm of the film was intended to create the sensation of the last gasps that a person takes just before dying."" That most of his set-pieces end in a bloody shootout suggests the aptness of this analogy. However, like Leone says, the heart of his pictures is not to be found in the moment of death  however gratifying we may find it  but in the final gasps for air. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' opens with an astonishing ten-minute prologue in which three armed outlaws (Woody Strode, Jack Elam and Al Mulock) impatiently await the arrival of a train. The minutes pass by almost without dialogue. In the sweltering heat, the men lazily brush away flies; a windmill creaks as it spins idly in the breeze; a telegraph machine chatters inside the railway station. This simple act of waiting, in less talented hands, could easily have been tedious, but Leone rejects the standard perceptions of time by allowing the viewer to immerse themselves in the canvas that he has just painted. These minutes of waiting become a Danse Macabre - the final moments these three men will ever know.As in the director's previous effort, the film's main characters blur the line between ""good"" and ""bad"" (and ""ugly""), but the clear villain of the piece is, memorably, Henry Fonda as Frank. His against-type performance is wonderful, not because it's a far cry from his usual persona, but because it isn't. Close your eyes, and you'll hear that same righteous drawl that spoke with such rectitude in '12 Angry Men (1957).' But Juror #8 he certainly isn't; Fonda adds a nasty, sadistic sneer, and Leone focuses most closely on the actor's hypnotic blue eyes. It's almost frightening how Fonda's squeaky-clean persona can be corrupted so readily. Claudia Cardinale plays Jill McBain, a stunning widower who refuses to bow down to those who murdered her husband and his family. Morricone's score only has good things to say about Jill, but Leone appears to admire her precisely because she, like her male cohorts, is not a hapless innocent. A former prostitute, this lady from New Orleans has absolutely no qualms about sleeping with the enemy. No pride, only objectives  that's how you survive in the West.",Once Upon a Time in the West

From the very first scene of this movie it is quickly established that Fonda is a bad ass and he delivers his character to perfection. The cast as a whole is awesome. Bronson is also great but Fonda really steals the show in this as a ruthless villain that seems unstoppable. Cardinale is absolutely gorgeous as the damsel in distress. The script and dialogue in this is excellent and the shootouts are outstanding and well shot. The settings, costumes and backdrops are all outstanding. The storyline does a great job of keeping Bronson's goal a mystery until the very final scene then the movie comes perfectly full circle.There's nothing I'd change about this film.

This is the Wild West as only a European could see it: bigger than life, bolder than life, and much more savage than life. The plot, as suggested by the title, is a fairy tale amalgam of every Western movie myth (i.e. cliché) since Edwin S. Porter's 'Great Train Robbery', with beautiful widow Claudia Cardinale defending her homestead against an aggressive railroad tycoon. Included in the subsequent carnage is the usual cast of Spaghetti Westerners: the enigmatic, nameless anti-hero (Chuck Bronson, replacing Clint Eastwood); the scruffy desperado sidekick (Jason Robards Jr., providing welcome comic relief); and an entire secondary cast of swarthy Italian gunmen, most of whom are killed off before the closing credits. Leone toned down the often surreal amorality of his Man-With-No-Name trilogy, but in a stroke of brilliance cast Henry Fonda against his image as the sadistic mercenary hired by the railroad to ""clear obstacles"" (including a young boy, blown apart at point blank range) from the path of the train.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Problem was, all the major studios wanted him to continue making dusty pistol-wranglers. He obliged with this; a somber, atmospheric piece that touches all the familiar hallmarks but lacks the heart, passion and tenacity of his preceding ""Dollars Trilogy.""Once Upon a Time in the West depicts a cutthroat competition between a posh businessman, a nasty outlaw, two vigilantes and a widow over the development rights to a crucial piece of land in the middle of nowhere. That won't be the case for long, however, as progress demands a continental railroad and the only source of water in a fifty-mile radius lies on this property. Everyone wants a slice of the inevitable riches, if not the whole pie. Matched with a characteristically stirring, yowling musical score from Ennio Morricone, outfitted with big-budget equipment and name actors, the film is positively drenched with character. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the opening scene, where Leone wordlessly dwells on three would-be assassins as they patiently await their mark. We don't need dialog to appreciate how grimy and low-down the trio is, loose with their morals as well as their manners, and the dense ten minutes of their mini-arc wraps us up like a smallpox blanket.In such a bite-sized dose, the restraint is delicious. Leone applies it to the entire sprawling, 160-minute film. It's all syrupy texture with very little concrete storytelling, a drastic example of mood over substance. I love the idea of Henry Fonda playing against-type as a scummy, conniving scoundrel. Charles Bronson, in a role clearly written for Clint Eastwood, deals almost exclusively in piercing squints and creepy harmonica riffs. Claudia Cardinale is breathtakingly beautiful as a recently-widowed spitfire with oodles of defiant willpower. The cast seems well-primed for a wonderful story, but instead they loiter about, rubbing elbows and making threats, while the plot rambles and sprays mundane, cryptic implications. It takes forever and it barely goes anywhere. Clearly, this is the work of a talented director who'd lost interest in making just one type of movie.

I was blown away by Sergio Leone's direction in The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly, and that was the only film of his that I'd seen up to this point, but now I honestly can't say which of the two films I prefer. This is perhaps a better film because it is set on a grander and epic scale, but perhaps not as entertaining as the other. Both films have terrific performances with memorable characters and a masterful score composed by Ennio Morricone that accompanies Tonino Delli Colli's beautiful cinematography. Leone's exaggerated close ups show us the dirt and the sweat coming out of these grim people's faces and it's juxtaposed perfectly with these extremely long shots of the vastness of the Western valley. I can't imagine liking this film more than I already do, but it is clear that these films were made to experience them in the big screen and it's a pity I couldn't do so. There are also many memorable quotes in this film and I absolutely loved the screenplay. For the first 90 minutes or so I wasn't sure what direction the movie was heading and that is what I liked about this film since it had me guessing at some of the characters motivations and where the plot was trying to go. The characters have a lot depth and not even the villain is portrayed in a stereotypical way. Along with Unforgiven these are the three best Westerns I've seen so you can bet I will watch more of Leone's spaghetti westerns in the future. The film couldn't open in a more spectacular fashion as the camera follows three gunmen waiting for someone at a station. Once the train arrives, the men don't find who they are waiting for and as they are walking away they hear someone playing a harmonica. It is the mysterious man they've been expecting (Charles Bronson) who asks them where Frank is. They've been sent to kill him, but Harmonica is too quick for their guns and finishes them off claiming they ""have brought two horses too many."" Then we are introduced to a recently married family man who is living on his deserted property with his three children and expecting his new wife to arrive that very day, but a group of bandits led by blue eyed Frank (Henry Fonda) kills them all one by one for reasons that aren't explained yet. The bride, Jill (Claudia Cardinale), arrives to find them all murdered and the officers find evidence that lead them to believe that the outlaw Cheyenne (Jason Robards) is responsible. The lives of these three men all intersect with Jill's and as the story develops the plot and mystery unfolds. Sergio Leone had me engaged with the film from the very opening sequence and he sets the slow paced tone rather quickly. He takes his time to let the action unfold but thanks to the beautiful cinematography and the gripping score I was never bored for a minute. I was continually trying to guess what was going on and what the motivation of each character truly was. I was surprised that Leone decided to have Ford's character shoot a young kid in a very early scene in the movie, and I can only imagine what a shocker that must have been for audiences during that time who were used to seeing Ford play the hero. Bronson is mysterious but it is rather obvious from the beginning what his intentions are. He still delivers a gripping performance as this mysterious character and when his backstory is finally revealed it all pays off. It was Robards' character who had me guessing at times what his real intentions were. At first I believed he was going to be one of the main villains, but he delivers most of the funny scenes and was perhaps one of the best characters in the film. The breathtaking Claudia Cardinale may have not been given a strong female role, but she wasn't simply a damsel in distress and she seemed to know what she was doing. Once Upon a Time in the West is not a straightforward revenge story and it blends several tones throughout the film having you sympathize with each character at different points of the story. Leone maintained the thrilling atmosphere for its entire runtime and the final showdown is rewarding. This is an epic masterpiece and a new addition to my favorite movies of all time list that I'm glad I finally had the opportunity to experience.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Once Upon a Time in the West
79,JasparLamarCrabb,Something to do with death...,10,27 November 2014,"Sergio Leone's greatest film and a strong contender for the best movie western ever made. Claudia Cardinale arrives at the desert home of her new husband only to find him & his children massacred. What ensues is a hideous game of cat and mouse between Henry Fonda (as the blackest black Bart imaginable) and the nameless & nearly silent Charles Bronson. Things are kept ambiguous as the viewer tries to figure out who is looking to save Cardinale's land and who is looking to steal it. To say Fonda is cast against type is an understatement. He's a conscienceless devil incarnate. Bronson, while ostensibly the ""good guy"" is no saint either. Jason Robards, in a role of pure irony, provides the moral compass for a cast of lurid characters. Leone proves to be a real artist with this film. The score, the editing, the cinematography and the pitch-perfect, wholly outrageous cast come together to produce a brilliant piece. Ennio Morricone's music score is rightly considered his finest and the stunning photography is by Tonino Delli Colli. Leone worked on the script with, among others, Bernardo Bertolucci & Dario Argento. The enormous supporting cast is excellent and includes Lionel Stander (frequently cut for some prints), Jack Elam, Woody Strode, Frank Woolf (in the pivotal role of McBain), Paolo Stoppa, Keenan Wynn, Fabio Testi, Don Galloway and the great Gabriele Ferzetti as an infirm yet ruthless railroad baron. Versions of this film reportedly run as long as 170 minutes though the US version available on DVD runs 165 and is considered complete.",Once Upon a Time in the West
80,jimbo-53-186511,"It has a few good trademark Sergio Leone touches, but as a whole it's surprisingly unsatisfying and is far from Leone's best work",5,11 September 2016,"Once Upon A Time In The West tells the story of two men Harmonica (Charles Bronson) and Cheyenne who both join forces to protect a widow Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) from a ruthless assassin Frank (Henry Fonda) and his men. Although both men show great chivalry it turns out that protecting Jill isn't their only priority and both men have personal agendas with Frank.I've seen a few Sergio Leone films and have enjoyed a great number of them. He's an interesting filmmaker who does possess a gift for building up tension and suspense in the simplest of manners; the start of this film is classic Leone - there's about a 15 minute section with no dialogue where we're just basically seeing close ups of a bunch of men and see the camera pan in and out and around the area. We also hear things like wind turbines spinning round and drops of water falling on heads etc. It all sounds rather poor when you put in all I writing, but when watching it on screen it is quite compelling (in an odd sort of way).Once Upon A Time In The West gets off to an impressive start, but unfortunately the wheels seem to come off very early on. Charles Bronson makes an appearance early in the film but then disappears for an awful long time. I also felt that there wasn't enough focus on the rivalry between the 3 men - I expected there to be more confrontations and showdowns which undoubtedly would have made the picture miles more enjoyable. Unfortunately, a lot of the focus and attention went on Jill McBain (yes she's attractive and important to the story), but she isn't a particularly interesting character and her acting isn't brilliant either which ultimately made large parts of the film feel rather dull.Thankfully, many other cast members do put on a good show and try their best to make up for the rather tedious story; Henry Fonda seemed like an odd casting choice here but he is OK (although I would have loved it if Lee Van Cleef played the role of his character). Jason Robards is good and Bronson was one of the coolest actors of his era and effortlessly carries the film when the opportunity arises.The biggest problem with this film is quite simply that the story isn't very strong and isn't particularly engaging; there's very little in the way of character development and it doesn't help that Leone plays the film very straight (there's little in the way of light-hearted humour here which is a great shame).The film throws in a plot twist at the end which does explain one character's motivation, but to me it still felt a bit lazy (as though Leone thinks a last minute twist can make up for the lack of development or insight that he offers his audience to any of his characters).Once Upon A Time In The West does have some nice touches, some good performances and some cool scenes, but to me it all just feels a bit half-hearted and lazy and I just found myself bored rigid by the largely uninteresting story. I have liked every other Leone film that I've seen thus far, but this one left me feeling cold and slightly disappointed.",Once Upon a Time in the West

It is beautifully shot, perfectly cast, ambitious, erotic, humorous and wonderfully scored by Leone's regular composer Ennio Morricone, whose haunting melodies are just as important as the widely separated dialog occurring on the action..The film opens with an extreme close-ups of Jack Elam, Woody Strode and Lionel Stander waiting at a station for Charles Bronson... Henry Fonda has sent them to kill him...The railroad wants a property for its water well belonging to the newly widowed Claudia Cardinale, a fancy lady from New Orleans who just arrived in Flagstone and learns about the tragedy... We would come to understand, much later, Claudia Cardinale's role as the bearer of water, life, and continuity to the civilization of the New West...Fonda, a despicable hired gun, kills her husband and orders, without a twinge of guilt, the slaughter of the entire family, innocents women and children...Henry Fonda, in a chilling performance, plays the cold-blooded murderer, the most vicious villain in Westerns history to ever ride the big country... the blue ice-eyed child killer, gunning down a 9-year old boy...Bronson as 'The Man' is like Clint Eastwood 'The Man With No Name,' with only one thing in common: they are the most ruthless heroes in Westerns history sharing the same character in their quality 'not' to say much in their need of emotions, in their fast draw, in their disinterest in women, in their air of mystery and in their macabre sense of humor...Their differences are also very clear: 'The Man With No Name' has no past whatsoever, and 'The Man' is motivated by revenge to settle an old personal score... Claudia Cardinale plays Jill, the well-proportioned, husky-voiced beauty, the lady, the businesswoman, the maker of coffee involved with Fonda in an incredible perverse erotic sequence...The blood, the violence, the humor, the several gunfights and the final showdown have been constants in Leone's Westerns since ""A Fistful of Dollars""...The highlights of his movie are so many: Leone's overwhelming shot when he raises his camera over the Flagstone train station office revealing the sprawling town; when he replaces a shot of a smoking gun with a shot of a smoking train; when he uses close-ups instead of dialog to reveal what a character is thinking; and the striking use of his extreme close-up in the final shootout... Leone builds up tension by slowly circling his two characters, focusing with his camera on their eyes, hands and guns while the level of the music is raised to evoke the action... Leone's film is a brave epic Western, extremely violent, immensely powerful... It's above all fable and fantasy, as the desire for revenge is childish and fruitless... It is the essence of a great filmmaker...",Once Upon a Time in the West

83,barnabyrudge,Outstanding epic western that is truly one of the best of its kind.,10,10 September 2006,"C'era Una Volta Il West is a real contender for the title of greatest western of them all. A masterpiece on every level, it is easily the best film ever made by director Sergio Leone  fine praise indeed for a man whose other works include the likes of The Good, The Bad And The Ugly and Once Upon A Time In America. What makes the film doubly impressive is the way that it moves at its own uniquely languid pace, with the camera pausing on sweaty faces and vast empty landscapes for seemingly indefinite periods of time. These frequent lingering pauses  almost certain to provoke tedium in any other film  here take on an absorbing significance and fascination. Although the initial reaction is that much time seems to be wasted during C'era Una Volta Il West, on reflection one realises that every frame is beautifully composed and makes some kind of contribution to the overall atmosphere of this most atmospheric of films. It is a film that continues to leave impressions on the viewer long after the final credits roll.In the Old West, a mysterious ""Harmonica""-playing gunslinger (Charles Bronson) arrives at a remote railway station anticipating a meeting with someone named Frank. Instead he is met by three hired killers, who try to gun him down but are actually themselves killed in the exchange. Later a family of homesteaders are murdered in cold blood by a gang of gunmen, led by the afore-mentioned Frank (Henry Fonda). The father of the murdered family was supposed, before his death, to have collected from the nearest train station a prostitute he married during a trip to New Orleans, the beautiful Jill (Claudia Cardinale). When he fails to collect her from the nearby town, Jill ventures to the homestead to find out what has become of him. During her journey from the town to the house, she has a strange encounter with an outlaw on the run, Cheyenne (Jason Robards), as well as the enigmatic Harmonica. Upon discovering her new family dead, she inherits their remote home and later realises that her deceased husband intended to transform the house into a railway station when the ever-expanding train tracks reached their piece of land. Frank is instructed by railway mogul Morton (Gabrielle Ferzetti) to get Jill, now the legitimate owner of land that he wants, out of the picture by whatever means necessary. Meanwhile, Harmonica keeps flitting in and out of Jill's - and Frank's - life, an almost supernatural figure whose motives remain unclear until all is revealed at the film's haunting climax.C'era Una Volta Il West is visually perfect throughout, with every camera angle and widescreen shot worked out literally to the millimetre. Ennio Morricone provides an incredible music score  my favourite film music of all-time by a country mile  in which each of the five main characters is cannily given their own leitmotif, repeated every time they're on screen. In the final showdown between Harmonica and Frank, both characters' leitmotifs are cleverly overlapped to generate extraordinary drama and tension. The performances are excellent, most notably Fonda (cast against type as a despicable murderer, and mightily effective in the role), Robards (who is wonderfully charismatic as a charming rogue), and Bronson (whose nonchalance and woodenness as an actor is used to the film's advantage to make him supremely enigmatic). A film of endless pleasures that stands up to renewed viewings time and again, C'era Una Volta Il West is a triumph  a film that simply MUST be seen by any one who loves movies.",Once Upon a Time in the West
84,dwpollar,The best stylistic western I have ever seen...,8,25 August 2005,"1st watched 8/25/2005 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Sergio Leone): The best stylistic western I have ever seen. Sergio Leone uses sound(and sometimes the lack of it), music(by Ennio Morricone), atmosphere and some of the best acting talents of the time to create a masterpiece of a western that grabs you before the beginning credits finish to pretty-much the end with only small lapses in the middle. It's neat to watch each of the unique characters go thru their paces as they wind thru the story coming to each of their conclusions. Charles Bronson is great as ""Harmonica"", the man who plays before he speaks. He has a story to tell that comes out in the last 15 minutes of the movie in the way of a flashback. Most of Sergio Leone's characters don't speak a lot except for Jason Robards' character who is the most un-Sergio-leone-like but his character even works for the most part. Fonda plays a ruthless killer who's looking to gain the property of the widow played by Claudia Cardinale and along the way gains respect for Harmonica despite their extreme differences. Cardinale is unpredictable as the widow who's just trying to do what's right for herself and holds her own very well. This epic western could only have been better if it never ended. A sequel would have been great just to see how the remaining characters carry on and to see how the new town of ""Sweetwater"" exists with Cardinale at the helm. Bravo Mr. Leone!! This is the kind of western that I can handle. Deep on character and story with just enough bravado to not lose it's western-branding.",Once Upon a Time in the West

86,myriamlenys,thumping good Western with an almost operatic quality,9,5 October 2019,"One of the great classics : a riveting, wildly immersive Western set against the historical backdrop of the expansion of the railroads. The Ennio Morricone music is rousing, the scenery is jaw-dropping and the various characters spring to colourful life.This last fact owes much to the casting, which includes a bit of truly inspired counter-casting : actor Henry Fonda, used to playing pretty decent guys, takes on the sable-black persona of an amoral middle-aged mercenary fully capable of killing random children. It's a marvellously chilling performance - but wait for the ending of the movie, where a short flash-back shows the mercenary as a young man already much given to taunting and torturing. Fonda takes on a sick, twisted intensity that can only be described as diabolical.Now this is a long and intense movie which requires attentive viewing, meaning that it is a good idea to create an intermission and watch it in two parts.

88,drystyx,"Disjointed, horribly directed waste of time",1,7 March 2007,"Sergio Leone will one day, maybe fifty years from now, replace Mister Wood on every critic's list as the worst movie director of all time. He'll at least make the top ten. At least Wood could make a story interesting, at least one character you might care about, and didn't have the gigantic Leone budget. Leone fails on every level. The story is very disjointed. It's mostly just comically unrealistic gunplay, with some guys being able to kill minor characters from great distances, but unable to kill major stars that should be easier. That's nothing new, but the circumstances are quite laughable. The story is just killing after killing, to take land away, and it follows sadist Henry Fonda, and his opponents, Charles Bronson and Jason Robards. Jack Elam appears in what amounts to a cameo. The characters aren't much to like. Bronson makes little jokes like an underdog hero of a Japanese movie, but the plot is so bad, and the characters so unlikable, you don't really care. To be fair, they aren't as unlikable as other spaghetti Westerns, but they don't have any appeal, either. You struggle to watch the film. You won't be able to do in one sitting. You'll have to watch a piece at a time, because you will fall to sleep. What makes the movie a bomb is the use of such outstanding cool music that neither matches or contrasts the situation. It falls flat, and it is a waste of good music.",Once Upon a Time in the West
89,slokes,The Last Western,8,27 June 2006,"People who view movies as foremost an art say ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" is the best western Sergio Leone ever made. I say ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly,"" but that's because I prefer films as entertainment. Films like this one judge you as much as you judge them.A family living on a desert ranch called Sweetwater is gunned down by a gang led by Frank (Henry Fonda), one cold hombre. He brushes off his boss's complaint he was just supposed to scare them by saying: ""People scare better when they're dead."" Frank in turn is hunted by a stranger known only by the instrument he plays, Harmonica (Charles Bronson). Every time Frank asks Harmonica what his name is, Harmonica gives him the name of someone Frank murdered in his dark and bloody past. Matters come to a head when the new wife of the head of the murdered family, Jill (Claudia Cardinale), stakes her claim to Sweetwater and incurs Frank's wrath.What you have here is an exercise in pure cinema, with incredible compositions, soaring music, an existential subtext that holds up to later reflection, and references to just about every western ever made. What you don't have is very much of a story, at least an intelligible one. Characters get in and out of jams without much explanation, people die suddenly from unexplained causes, there's a final showdown that could have happened at just about any other point of the story with a lot less collateral damage, the hero tears the heroine's dress for no better reason that to make us wonder about him.I don't even like this film as much as I do ""For A Few Dollars More,"" maybe Leone's most satisfying film in its simpler way. But what you are getting here is magical, an expansion of the vocabulary of film. The astonishing opening scene, where three bad guys await Harmonica at a train depot, is alone a quantum leap from anything then in cinema: ambient noise, long shots of people staring at nothing, Jack Elam's battle with a fly.It's a different kind of spaghetti western, that's for sure. There may be less than 30 gunshots in the whole picture, and Leone is using a nearly whole new cast, with a female, Cardinale, as nominal lead. Bronson is a different kind of hero than Clint Eastwood was in Leone's earlier films: humorless, sinister, and laconic to the point of catatonia. The dialogue is still pretty quotable, but there's much less of it this time. An entire faceoff between Jason Robards' tough outlaw Cherokee and a dandy with an itchy trigger finger goes on for about five minutes and has but one word: ""Bravo.""It's really a western as epic, and an interesting response to anyone who might have thought Leone couldn't have done up anything grander than ""Good, Bad, & Ugly."" The use of themes and ideas from other Westerns, particularly those of John Ford, give this film a sense of taking stock of cinema's first genre. And Leone is getting it all in, even from the very beginning: That opening shot of Frank's pistol going off into the camera quotes directly from 1904's ""The Great Train Robbery,"" the granddaddy of westerns.I love watching this film unfold in its gradual way, and can't help feeling a sense of exultation over how everything gels, but it's impossible to ignore the flaws. The film drags. There's little humor. Robards' character is never integrated into the rest of the film. Leone's disinterest in plot becomes more apparent, and disabling, as the film goes on.What is Harmonica's purpose here? Is he an angel from God? The Grim Reaper? He seems to serve some mystical function, as Leone's emissary bringing down the curtain on Fonda's Frank, the ultimate bad guy, and the West that spawned him.""Once Upon A Time"" feels like a dead stop that way, both for Leone (who would make only two more films, neither much appreciated in their day, in the next 20 years) and for the western. They were still churning out good westerns in 1969, like ""True Grit"", ""The Wild Bunch,"" and ""Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid,"" and even bad ones like ""Mackenna's Gold.""

Amazingly shot working hand in hand with Ennio Morriconne's incredible trademark score with meticulous attention to detail, especially with costumes and sets. The ensemble cast of Charles Bronson, Claudia Cardinals, Jason Robards and Henry Fonda as the diabolical Frank is awesome as well. The storytelling is solid and done in Sergio's innovative style. The plot deals with corruption, murder and revenge and gives the sense of the desolation and grit of the American west. This is much darker in tone and a completely different take on the great John Ford westerns that influenced Leone . Overall for cinophilles, Once Upon A Time In The West is a must watch. There has not been a film that was anything quite like it before and hasn't been seen since. There are lots and lots of spaghetti westerns, but nothing that was done on such a large scale or done as flawlessly.

92,Witchfinder-General-666,One of the All-Time Essentials - A Masterpiece that Overwhelms In All Regards,10,24 March 2010,"There are Westerns that every Western fan should see. There are Westerns that every film fan should see. And then there are the chosen few that everybody MUST see. Sergio Leone's quintessential Italian Westerns doubtlessly belong to that latter category, and ""C'era Una Volta Il West"" aka. ""Once Upon a Time In the West"" (1968) in particular is a masterpiece that no one even remotely interested in the art of motion pictures could possibly consider missing. Along with Leone's earlier masterpiece ""Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo"" aka. ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (1966), this is arguably one of the two most brilliant and overwhelming Westerns ever made.There are countless reasons why this masterpiece must be seen by anyone interested in cinema, but I shall stick to the most obvious ones: Co-scripted by Bernardo Bertolucci and the later Horror-master Dario Argento (who is a personal god of mine), ""Once Upon a time in the West"" is absolutely overwhelming in all regards, be it story-wise, stylistically or visually. Maybe even more than Leone's other Westerns, all visually stunning and brutal masterpieces, ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" shows the old West from in its most brutal and most beautiful side. Leone's fourth Western in often compared to opera, and these comparisons are well founded. Visually overwhelming from start to finish, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" comes along with what is positively the most brilliant of Ennio Morricone's magnificent film scores; a score that overwhelms. Listening to Morricone's music alone is capable of building up suspense, even if it's listened to out of context. Maybe more than anything else, it is this score by the positively greatest film composer who ever lived, that carries the film and makes it the unforgettable experience it is.""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a film that uniquely takes time in order to build up tension. The opening sequence alone is a unique piece of art the likes of which are very seldom in cinema. I do not wish to go too deeply into detail about the story, as this fantastic experience should be experienced rather than read by anyone who hasn't seen it (if there still is somebody out there who hasn't). As much as it is a film about the Old West, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is also a film about the end of the Old West, the triumph of capitalism over the 'pioneer spirit'. The film begins with the brutal massacre of a family over a piece of land, which becomes the object of desire for a murderous villain (Henry Fonda), a bandit leader (Jason Robards) a vengeful gunman with a Harmonica (Charles Bronson) and a ravishing beauty (Claudia Cardinale).The film casts Hollywood's best, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards and Charles Bronson are all at top of their game, this positively being the greatest film either man has starred in. Robards is fantastic as the rough-and-ready desperado Cheyenne, Fonda is gloriously devilish as the villainous Frank, and Bronson, one of my personal favorite actors, is unforgettable as the vengeful Harmonica. All three characters rank among the most memorable ones in cinema, all three actors deliver outstanding performances. As fantastic as these three brilliant actors are, there is one person who steals the show: In over a century of cinema, there have been countless beautiful, sexy, ravishing actresses in seductive, charming, fascinating roles. It is a rare actress and role, however, whose beauty is so overwhelming that it makes the viewer fall in love with her at the very second of her appearance. This is the case with Claudia Cardinale in ""Once Upon a time in the West"". Doubtlessly one of the most ravishing women who ever blessed the screen, Cardinale plays Jill, who is angel, femme fatale and hooker with a heart of gold all in one, and who brings out the most lovable, most intriguing and most erotic side of either of these traditional female roles. Cardinale isn't simply beautiful in this film; she is a goddess, who will immediately turn every male viewer into a lovesick teenage boy. Without displaying explicit nudity, Clauida Cardinale's Jill is one of the most erotic roles ever in any film. It is impossible to watch this film and not fall in love with her.The supporting cast includes many fantastic actors such as Woody Strode, Lionel Stander, Jack Elam ad Frank Wolff. All cast members fit perfectly in their roles.The locations and cinematography are overwhelming, unlike Leone's Dollar Trilogy which had been shot in the Spanish Almeria desert (as many other Spaghetti Westerns), ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" was mainly shot in Arizona.As mentioned above, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a film that overwhelms in all aspects, be it Leone's unique talent to build up tension, the phenomenal photography and rough beauty of the landscapes, the incredibly compelling story, the brilliantly drawn characters or the incredible score by Ennio Morricone – there simply isn't the tiniest aspect about ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" that is not absolutely brilliant.The Sergio Leone Spaghetti Westerns have been personal all-time favorites of mine ever since childhood, and it is impossible to say which one is the best. To me, it's either ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" or this one, these two films being my choices for the greatest Westerns ever made. They are doubtlessly also two of the greatest films ever made, regardless of genre. I could go on for a long time doing nothing but praising this masterpiece, but it would all come down to the same point: ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is one of the greatest, most essential films ever made, and nobody who hasn't seen it is yet a true film fan.

93,Steffi_P,"""Something to do with death""",10,19 March 2007,"It's funny how so many of the greatest westerns, particularly those by directors who are best known for the westerns, are ones which deal with the death of the old west. There's John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance; Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch; Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven to name but three. However, for me the best of all these is Leone's masterpiece Once Upon a Time in the West. It is also my favourite of all Leone's pictures.Leone had always been a director who packed his films with atmosphere, style and rhythm, but here he organises every single element to create one overwhelming mood. Everything in the film is geared towards reminding us of death, of a time coming to an end. The pace is slow and measured  Leone really takes his time in telling the story. The buildings are rickety and creaking, many of the minor characters and extras are old and look worn out, and the wind howls across the open spaces.Symbolism is everywhere in this film. Jill and the railway both represent the death of the west. The coming of the railway of course literally heralded the end of an era, but Leone also had a rather strange theory that this time was also the beginning of a matriarchy in America  so women also represent change. Jill and the railway are often synonymous. Jill arrives on the train. The train is black and so is Jill's dress. In contrast, most of the characters are dressed in browns and yellows, matching the landscape of the open plains. The railway magnate is called Morton  ""mort"" as in death. Another very subtle touch is that most of the movement is towards or away from the camera. Jill and the train are the only things regularly seen moving from side to side across the frame, as if they are the only ones really going anywhere.The flipside to this atmosphere of death is that it is tinged with the hope of rebirth and progress. This is represented by the recurrent water motif, as water symbolises life. The train needs water to run, and the Sweetwater ranch will provide a watering stop. Jill likes to bath frequently, and later she brings water to the railway workers. Jill is a survivor, and she and Sweetwater represent hope for the future.While Harmonica, Frank and Jill have been analysed to death elsewhere, the character of Cheyenne I feel is often overlooked. Although he rarely drives the plot along and could have been edited out of the story without changing much, he is really central to the tone of the film. He more than any other single character represents the old west. He is tough and rugged on the exterior, but gradually his façade is stripped away to reveal a tired, middle-aged man who just wants to settle down. He is the most real, the most human character, and the one given the most depth. Jason Robard's performance has also come in for a lot of flak, but I think he's perfect for the role  he does that forlorn look very well.Ennio Morricone's music here continues to evolve alongside Leone's style. The score of Once Upon a Time in the West is not as rousing or listenable as the music from the Dollars Trilogy, but it perfectly mirrors that sad and weary tone. The Leone-Morricone trademark of giving each character their own musical theme is even more firmly stated here. It's particularly clever how the theme for the final confrontation mixes Harmonica's and Frank's themes. Leone and Morricone also worked together to make use of natural sound to create atmosphere, something which up to this point had only really been explored by Alfred Hitchcock (most memorably in The Birds, but I'm also thinking of the use of sound in his 1930's pictures). In the opening scene, the creaking of the windmill, the chattering of the telegraph machine and a number of other noises take the place of a musical backing.If there is anything wrong at all with Once Upon a Time in the West, it's that it takes either repeated viewings are extreme concentration to take in every minor plot point and understand every character motivation. The dialogue is sparse, and often more for effect than to give information. There are many short cuts in the narrative and very little is made obvious, so most of the time you have to join the dots yourself to work out exactly what is going on in each scene. There are two pieces I find people get confused about most often, so I'll give my explanations here. Firstly, why Harmonica tears Jill's clothes before going out to the well. This is to make it look as if the two of them have just had a quick session in the barn, thus Frank's men don't expect Harmonica to be armed and ready to fight and so let their guard down. Secondly, a lot of people (including Alex Cox in the DVD commentary) think there is a continuity error when Frank abducts Jill at Sweetwater and is then seen talking to Morton at his hideout in the cliffs. However the scene where Jill and Frank are in bed together is also at the cliffs  the walls are made of stone. The implication here is that Frank took Jill from Sweetwater back to his hideout, even though there is no linking scene to show it happening.So, it can be a little confusing, but I'd rather have taut narrative than lots of unnecessary material bogging the story down. Besides, with a film that is this entertaining and this beautiful, there's no burden whatsoever in having to watch it over and over",Once Upon a Time in the West
94,ShootingShark,Something To Do With Death,7,17 January 2009,"In western days, Jill comes to remote Arizona outpost of Sweetwater to make a home with her new husband and his family. But they have been brutally murdered by Frank, an evil gunman for the railroad. Jill is helped by two men; the outlaw Cheyenne, whom Frank has framed for the murders, and the mysterious Harmonica, who seems to have an old and lingering score to settle with Frank This is a beautiful and melancholy film, perhaps one of the most exquisite and haunting westerns ever made. It's been described as, ""an opera where the arias aren't sung, they're stared"", and that fits it perfectly. Ennio Morricone's music (which was composed prior to shooting) is so rich and affecting it permeates every image, every nuance. This is a movie where all the emotion and atmosphere is communicated not through clumsy words, but through pictures, music, expressions, movements. Jill, Harmonica, Frank and Cheyenne are myths made flesh in front of our eyes, thanks to four stunning and contrasting performances, each of which is a study in old-fashioned acting skill. I particularly like Fonda here, an amazing choice for a heartless villain, given both his age (he was sixty-three) and his nice guy reputation, and the supporting cast are full of the usual Leone amazing faces, notably in the opening shootout with Elam, Strode and Mulock. Leone's biographer, Christopher Frayling, ranks this as the greatest spaghetti western ever made, though personally I think Leone's two previous movies are better. The reasons for this are hard to qualify. For me, this film is somehow just a bit too melancholy, a bit too rich in its excesses and its self-worth. What makes the Dollars Trilogy so special for me is its uniqueness in both style and wild characterisation. This movie is a little bit more like a conventional American western, with less action and less craziness, and Harmonica is more of a traditional moral hero than The Man With No Name. Also, I always feel that Leone never really managed to write or direct successfully for actresses; Cardinale is excellent here, and Jill is a fascinating archetype, but literally all the women in Leone's films are whores - she just happens to be the most prominent one. There is also a great sadness to this film I think; for all its brilliance, it essentially symbolises the end of Leone's tragically brief career. His follow-up, Giù La Testa, was a bit of a failure, then he languished for years before making one great final film, Once Upon A Time In America, but it was butchered to pieces and barely distributed. For a such an influential filmmaker this is a sad coda, almost as if he had become Cheyenne and Harmonica, struggling to stay ahead of the civilisation that the railroad represents and that they cannot be subdued by. However, what we have here is an exquisite, beautifully paced, lovingly crafted elegy to the myth of the American West, filled with rich and moving scenes and extraordinarily skillful craftsmanship.

95,valleyjohn,Another leone Classic,8,3 March 2009,"Over the last few months i have started to discover the movies of Sergio Leone. I vaguely remember seeing some of his films as a kid but obviously i was to young to appreciate the pure genius of the man. Although in my opinion ""One upon a time in the West"" is not his best movie , it still provides all the hallmarks that make Leone on of the most admired directors of all time.To get his hands on prime railroad land in Sweetwater, crippled railroad baron Morton hires killers, led by blue-eyed sadist Frank , who wipe out property owner Brett McBain and his family. McBain's newly arrived bride, Jill , however, inherits it instead. Both outlaw Cheyenne and lethally mysterious Harmonica take it upon themselves to look after Jill and thwart Frank's plans to seize her land. As alliances and betrayals mutate, it soon becomes clear that Harmonica wants to get Frank for another reason -- it has ""something to do with death.As i have said there certain things that make Sergio Leone movies extremely distinctive and in this movie they are no different. The cinematography is sharp and crisp and it puts most modern films to shame. How he gets such detail in the profile shots of his actors is amazing and is strangely hypnotic. He also manages to get his actors to perform at the top of their game even though a lot of the time they are doing very little other than looking into the camera.Henry Fonda's portrayal of Frank is probably the best i have ever seen from him and is maybe the best performance by an actor in a Leone film that i have seen so far. His piercing blue eyes stare down the camera lens with a haunting glare and it is hard not to feel sucked in. One scene that particularly sticks in my mind is when he is on the bed with Jill. You can see Henry Fonda is not really comfortable with the scene he is doing and that only adds to the creepiness of Frank .( after all he was 33 years older than Claudia Cardinale ).Charles Bronson is good without being spectacular and i actually preferred the preferred the performance of Jason Robards who played Cheyenne.We are also treated to another fantastic soundtrack. A strangely out of tune piano accompiniament and that haunting harmonica is just perfect.The only criticism of Sergio Leone's films i have is that they tend to be a little too long. Once upon a time in the west is no exception and a story that could easily have been told in 100 minutes ends up being 160 minutes but to shorten it would not be Leone's style . Purist would say the longer the better but not me. I'm still of the opinion that "" A few Dollars More"" is Sergeo Leone's best Spaghetti western but it's surprising how many regard either this film or ""The good , the bad and the Ugly as his best work. I'm hoping to watch ""One upon a time in America"" in a month or two just to see how , or if , his directorial style had changed much over the years.8 out of 10",Once Upon a Time in the West
96,davidmvining,The Old West dies,8,1 November 2021,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly felt like the work of someone in over his head, unsure of how to spend the massive amount of money for the large production. Once Upon a Time in the West feels like the work of a mature filmmaker with a fuller understanding of how to use a large budget. The interesting thing to me in the credits is the story by credits for Sergio Leone that he shares with Dario Argento and, in particular, Bernardo Bertolucci. It's documented that Bertolucci was responsible for the idea of making the main character a woman, but the film has a certain structural feel that reminds me of some of Bertolucci's own work like 1900 and The Last Emperor. There's a cohesiveness to the central story with the larger canvas that was simply missing from the previous film.The story is of the dying of the Old West. It's a common motif and theme of Westerns since the beginning of the genre because even the earliest movies understood that the time of the West was over, that the personalities were either getting older or already dead. Leone takes the familiar and sad tale in his own deconstructionist and cynical direction, highlighting the violence and greed of the personalities that pushed the country westward and pulling in references to many familiar and unfamiliar Westerns along the way. The story overall covers similar ground to John Fords 3 Bad Men that told of Hell on Wheels, the effort to push the railroad construction as fast as possible (though, it's not like Ford's film was free of devious antagonists willing to kill to get what they wanted or anything). That's the epic scope part of the story, anchored by Jill (Claudia Cardinale), the New Orleans prostitute who married the farmer Brett McBain (Frank Wolff).He had gone to New Orleans, met the beautiful woman, married her in secret, and then paid for her passage out West to his dusty farm where nothing grew with promises of wealth and finery. However, Brett and his three children get shot down by Frank (Henry Fonda) before Jill even arrives at the remote little town of Flagstone, some miles from the town. Along the same time, the mysterious figure known only as Harmonica (Charles Bronson) arrives, kills three men dressed as the men of the local bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards), and begins his search for Frank. Cheyenne himself escapes from custody on his own (his men lagging a few minutes behind) and needs to untangle the mystery of the men, who were not his, dressed like his men and what they were doing on the remote, worthless McBain farm.Jill arrives to find her husband and stepchildren dead, knowing that they were killed for something, but she doesn't know what. Cheyenne shows up as well with questions, hoping to find something. He's menacing in look and gruff in demeanor, but he's less interested in what Jill could find than the mystery itself. Amongst the items of the late McBain Jill finds a toy train station.Frank, though, is not some random madman, he's working for the train company, represented as the dying cripple Mr. Morton (Gabriele Frezetti), traveling up and down the line in his resplendent train car, moving around the car by brass bars that extend from the ceiling since he can barely walk. He has dreams of making it to the Pacific, seeing the expanse of water before he dies, and in order to make that, the railroad must complete fast, giving our bad guy a tangible reason for his villainy which is nice.The story moves towards confrontation (of course) between all of them in different ways, especially when Jill learns the truth of her husband's plans. He had purchased the worthless land on purpose, knowing that the railroad had to go through that property, and in order to maintain his ownership he needed to build a station, the wood for which arrives after Jill.What's really interesting about the story here is how much more important to the movie it is than in Leone's previous films. Story always felt like a secondary concern, little more than a bare excuse to hang great moments on, but here everything feels of a piece, working towards a common narrative goal. The story actually feels like its coming to a point instead of just genre thrills, and that point is the dying of the Old West. Cheyenne, Harmonica, and Frank represent the wild version of the West. They are the gunslingers who dominated the myth of the Old West. Jill, an Eastern woman of fine tastes, represents the new West, the civilizing influence coming into the wild parts of the country on a path forged by the railway man Morton. As I said to start this review, there's a mature feeling to this film that's missing from Leone's previous work, and I strongly suspect the influence of Bertolucci.There is one story bit that falls a bit flat to me, though, and that's the reveal of Harmonica's connection to Frank. We're not even really given hints through the film beyond the idea that there is a connection, and then the connection is revealed as this deeply emotional moment for Harmonica. And yet, it just doesn't really work, probably because the slivers of slow-motion flashback were just too bare to establish the emotional connection with the audience.Of course, just story isn't Leone, even in a more refined form. His distinct style is still on display and it is both a strength and one of the film's smaller weaknesses. I think, at this point, Leone didn't know when to quit and some of these moments just go on for a bit too long (I'm thinking of when Morton has to bribe his way out from under some gunmen during a card game), but the rest of the time he's using his combination of slow action and active editing to create wonderful tension, like in the opening scene at the train station as Harmonica arrives or Jill's arrival at Flagstone (that Zemeckis would imitate in Back to the Future Part III).I don't think Once Upon a Time in the West quite rises to greatness, a key emotional beat doesn't work and Leone's style occasionally gets in the way of things, but it's a consistently entertaining and intelligent work by a filmmaker who suddenly discovered the art of telling a story rather than just having great individual moments strung together. Leone really grew here as a filmmaker.",Once Upon a Time in the West
97,onepotato2,Jason Robards destroys this movie.,3,2 July 2010,"Every Sergio Leone movie has impressive stuff in it. The sequence here where Jill arrives at the train station and takes a carriage through town, and then Monument Valley (while a ravishing piece of Morricone scoring plays) is astonishing.But... I've never loved an entire Leone movie. He's too self-indulgent. Here, long stretches of silence are his only idea. When they work, the results are sublime. But here that's only three times out of twelve. There's so many of them they're quickly exposed as a gimmick/crutch, BUT alternately, when he gives lines to his actors the quality instantly plummets. We never become interested in a single character's arc. As soon as Claudia Cardinale talks, you go ""oh, that mysterious, vivid creature we've been looking at, is just a common two-dimensional female lead... meh..."" Her Doonesbury mascara is a bit much. This movie plays like an unrelated series of scenes Leone wanted to shoot.It still might have been a decent effort... but then Jason Robards shows up, and destroys the movie. In the history of film, has there ever been a less interesting actor than Jason Robards? At his best he's average, at his worst, he's an energy vampire, sucking the life out of projects. Over his entire career no viewer has ever said ""I've just got to see that new Jason Robards movie this weekend."" If you ever thought actors were interchangeable and all you needed was a competent one who could read his lines, watch Robards here. What was Leone thinking? You cannot hang an entire movie on Jason Robards. His heavy is feeble, not intimidating. He wanders around hoping to look competent; clueless about where to place the emphasis in his lines, or what to do with his arms. And when he tries to flash an intimidating look, he focuses too close to his face and just looks cross-eyed and silly. He molds nothing about his presence or his role. It actually seems like he's thinking 'I'm all wrong for this. I hope no one notices.' He brings nothing to the table. He' s completely out of his depth. Nothing resembling chemistry forms between him and Cardinale. Charles Bronson's harmonica theme is excruciating. It's Morricone's worst motif.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Is highly ironic that 'A Fistful of Dollars' was so poorly received on its initial release but just four years later, the world had already bowed to the genius of both the director and especially Ennio Morricone (who scored the film, even before the first shot was filmed).

100,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A slow burner but entertaining western,8,10 January 2021,"The names Sergio Leone and Spaghetti Westerns have become practically one and the same. Most filmmakers who end up making period piece films credit Mr. Leone for their inspiration. The films he worked on were that influential. Despite him having only eight head director credits, Leone had written scripts and operated as assistant director to many other pictures. The three films that would make him a household name were A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). The last official western though Leone would end with, was this movie even though he tried getting Clint Eastwood to appear in it somewhere, one last time. Instead, he got a different lead star but it propelled them to stardom all the same.Jill McBain, an heiress to a man's fortune (Claudia Cardinale) discovers she's a widow when her family is gunned down by Frank (Henry Fonda) a deadly mercenary. Hoping to keep himself away from the law, Frank frames Cheyenne the bandit (Jason Robards). At the same time, searching for Frank is an unnamed gunman who plays the harmonica (Charles Bronson) who has his own mysterious intentions. The script was written by frequent partner Sergio Donati and Sergio Leone himself. Rarely are there times where a screenplay ties up all loose ends for characters with little to no question. It's not easy to do and sometimes things are left ambiguous. But for this feature the Sergio duo made sure to the audience saw each character cross paths in a way that felt natural as well as explaining the backstory. This can be difficult seeing that Leone also directed this feature as mentioned before.What's nice to see though are characters who are fleshed out and have charisma to them. The acting is performed very well and immerses the audience in the setting. The dialog feels appropriate and uses only words that felt like they came from that time period. Even for a rated PG-13 film, the curses are not what one would typically hear...if any for that matter. Being that the story revolves around Jill McBain, Claudia Cardinale portrays her character with strength that perhaps was not seen very often. Especially for the time period of the film, but also the story. It's also a much more serious character opposed to her role as the princess in The Pink Panther (1963). Playing another serious character is Henry Fonda as Frank. Seen mostly as good guy characters, it was quite a shock to discover Fonda playing the antagonist, and a pretty heartless one at that.Jason Robards as Cheyenne the bandit is a peculiar character as he gets caught in the mess, but doesn't play to either side. If anything, he's kind of there for comic relief but not all the way. It's strange though because there is one thing about his character that comes about which doesn't add up and can't be explained in this review. There's railroad baron by the name of Mr. Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) who also gets tangled up in these various characters. He too plays to neither side really and comes across as a slightly sympathetic character. Lastly though is the harmonica player played by Charles Bronson. While Bronson had been in films before, this was one of his later pictures that brought him to the forefront of tough men. Bronson's performance is stoic yet charming simultaneously. That's scarce in most of those roles. The only thing that works against this movie at times is its pacing.The film lavishes taking in the scenery and set designs which are well crafted. To some, it feels like a drawn out setup. The intro credits alone take ten minutes to get through. It may just seem excessive. That's not a discredit to Tonino Delli Colli as the cinematographer. Having worked on many projects, Delli Colli captures lots of details and makes them jaw dropping. His last picture famously was Life Is Beautiful (1997). Finally, the film score composed by another frequent Leone extension Ennio Morricone is nothing to scoff at either. Morricone created themes for many characters, more specifically Jill and Bronson's role. There's even guitar that kicks in elevating the tension to unheard of heights considering the time period this movie was made. Way before 1980s rock. Well done.If extended long shots and meticulous world building is something seen as boring, best to stay away. But that's the only real thing seen as an issue. The music is flawless for the time, the cinematography is magnificent including the set design and the actors are great in their roles.",Once Upon a Time in the West
101,p-stepien,"Once was, will never be again",9,6 October 2011,"Two stories intertwine in a classical movie centered around the construction of the railroad to the Atlantic and the impeding end of the wild west. Much like the movies of Sam Peckinpah ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a romantic swansong to an era gone past, as well as to its idealised pop-cultural meaning. The film centers around four characters with a varying level of immorality. Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale), a former New Orleans prostitute turned housewife, will do anything to preserve her life, even for the sake of her honour and dignity. Cheyenne (Jason Robards)is a fearless outlaw, but with a code of honour and a lot of class. Harmonica (Charles Bronson), a mysterious gunslinger travelling with only a gun in hand and a harmonica hanging on his neck, enters the fray is real style and remains the main protagonist of the story. Opposing them is the villainous Frank (Henry Fonda), a scrupulous gun-for-hire with a knack for torture and psychological warfare, which does not back down from killing women and children in order to forward his own gains.In this bleak vision of the American west dichotomous concepts of good and evil have R.I.P. written all over them. Sergio Leone delves into this world, but adds his own touch of class to the realism. Interested more in the calm before the storm much of the focus is placed not on the action and gunfights themselves (these are normally over within a matter of seconds), but the emotional buildup that precedes it. Long suspenseful shots, which create an unmistakable aura and tension, inhabit the story in droves and also cause it to last over 2,5 hours. Some of these intense scenes are absolutely memorable, while the opening shootout at the station remains one of the best sequences in movie history ever. That said there seems to be an overload of such scenes, which cause the story to drag to a halt. Given this movie lacks the tongue-in-cheek humour of ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"", it can be a sometimes awkwardly tiresome affair. One however that is well worth the toil.Despite being much more somber in nature than the previous trilogy there seems to be much less weight to the story and save for some spectacular storytelling and cinematography I much prefer the mentioned ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"", despite giving them similar notes. The symbolical use of water and trains throughout the movie does seem rather simpleminded at times and doesn't really add depth to the movie. Nonetheless ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" remains an classic tale about the end of an era. Whats more I get the immense feeling that no one will ever be able to tell a similar story with such unmistakable wit and charm as Sergio Leone did. His westerns seems impossible to replicate in form and whenever I see anyone replicate his long focused shots full of tension and expectation it always seems to be bordering on farcical.Sergio Leone had a short and uneven career. Despite the fact that I feel his ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and ""For a Few Dollars More"" are vastly overrated and rather poor movies ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" stamps out his position as one of the all-time movie greats.",Once Upon a Time in the West

To which he takes them down all at once. Just to illustrate that Charles Bronson is really awesome. The character of the quiet mysterious stranger looking for revenge comes by a lot, but never like Bronson could do it. Sergio Leone had to make another western because the studio forced him to, and figured he might as well do the best one ever made. The camera work in this movie is amazing. The actors look like gods on their silver screen, towering over the world, delivering classic lines like it's a contest or something. This movie uses every western cliché in the book and makes something beautiful one of them. The highlights can hardly be counted, but to me the inevitable duel scene takes the cake. The close-up the characters are getting, I love them. And I haven't even talked about the music yet. Morricone is a genius, they're simple obvious musical ideas but only he could come up with them.

103,winner55,The entire history of the Western - in two-and-a-half hours.,10,28 June 2006,"I'm sure this has been said before, perhaps I even read it somewhere or listened to it - but it's worth repeating. This film is not ""a' Western - it is all Westerns.Almost at the same time this was released, Peckinpah released the Wild Bunch. That film took a whole host of Cowboy movie conventions and turned them inside out, first by its infamous portrayal of violence, but more importantly by treating the ""bad-guys"" with respect while presenting all the supposed ""good-guys"" as cruds - with the exception of the Mexican revolutionaries; but then, even this was a violation of an unacknowledged convention - ever since the murder of Villa by the American Army, Hollywood has covered over that criminal trespass by portraying Mexican rebels as little better than bandits - which of course was Washington's official line on the Villa case.At any rate, the point is that Peckinpah's film blew traditional cowboy clichés right out of Hollywood. It hasn't been really possible to make a traditional Western since then.So it's dam' fortunate for all of us that Leone made OUATITW when he did, because one of the goals he appears to have set for himself is to use practically every Cowboy movie he could remember without actually slipping into overt cliché. And, quite amazingly, he pulls it off.The chief means of accomplishing this, as a number of reviewers have noted, is structuring the film as an Italian opera, using the character's actions and responses (both physical and verbal) to take the place of opera's lyrics, performed before the magnificent music by Ennio Morricone, enhanced by editing that's so smooth, it's often not noticeable. For instance, on repeated viewings it becomes clear that certain scenes - the massacre of the family, the final shoot-out - which are so tense on first viewing that they seem to go on forever, actually happen rather quickly; other scenes that at first seem to snip along - such as the scene when Cheyanne and Harmonica first meet - are actually fairly leisurely paced.The ability to manipulate his audience's sense of time is one of Leone's greatest talents. In all four of his major Westerns - this film and the Eastwood films - the final shoot-out (always staged as a set-piece) seems to bring time to a halt; when the smoke clears, we're left wondering what day of the week it is, because even if we have a watch,we don't trust it any more, since it is clearly not in synch with the film. Leone accomplishes this with an editing approach that is musically timed (quite literally, he is editing it to Morricone's score), utilizing long shots as melodic riffs and extreme close-ups for heavy beats.OUATITW is actually the first movie Leone made where he is fully aware of this. Thus he is taking real risks in his choices of which Western conventions to highlight, and which to let drift into the background. Just as example: All three of the Eastwood films have a horse-chase sequence. There is none in OUATITW. Leone wants the horse to begin drifting into the backdrop of history - this is a film about the coming of the 'iron horse' - the railroad. The second to last image of the film is a man riding off on horseback; the final image is the train facing us as the laborers lay down track leading it directly towards us, as the music we know to be the woman's theme swells, reminding us that she is there with the laborers, and that somehow, while the old West (the West on horseback) has breathed its last, the new West, still a land of promise and new beginnings, remains.A magnificent farewell to an era - not just an era of American history, but an era in film history as well.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Without wanting to disenfranchise Eastwood fans, ""Once Upon a Time"" is the culmination of the previous trio, the perfect finale to the series.From the moment Bronson steps off the train, bounty hunters Jack Elam and Woody Strode waiting to claim their quarry, the movie sets a tone that is artistically and narratively unique. Morricone's music is even more powerful and the presence of the alluring Cardinale adds a dimension that in my opinion makes the movie less distant than its predecessors.Fonda's piercing blue eyes underscore his callous villainy, but even bold director Leone can't show the unthinkable in that classic scene where Fonda is confronted by the collateral damage caused by his deeds. His unflinching response while only implied is jarring enough. The film is stylish, refined and essential - whether you're sampling best of breed in westerns, or just catching up on the best films ever made.",Once Upon a Time in the West
106,Takethispunch,Masterpiece spaghetti western with awesome cinematography.,10,19 June 2016,"The film portrays two conflicts that take place around Flagstone, a fictional town in the American Old West: a land battle related to construction of a railroad, and a mission of vengeance against a cold-blooded killer. A struggle exists for Sweetwater, a piece of land near Flagstone containing the region's only water source. The land was bought by Brett McBain (Frank Wolff), who foresaw that the railroad would have to pass through that area to provide water for the steam locomotives. When crippled railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) learns of this, he sends his hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) to intimidate McBain to move off the land, but Frank instead kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards). It appears the land has no owner; however, a former prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans, revealing she is Jill McBain, Brett's new wife and the owner of the land. Meanwhile, a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), whom Cheyenne later dubs ""Harmonica"", pursues Frank. In the film's opening scene, Harmonica kills three men sent by Frank to kill him. In a roadhouse on the way to Sweetwater, he informs Cheyenne that the three gunfighters appeared to be posing as Cheyenne's men.Once Upon a Time in the West (Italian: C'era una volta il West) is a 1968 epic Spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone. It stars Henry Fonda, cast against type, as the villain, Charles Bronson as his nemesis, Claudia Cardinale as a newly widowed homesteader, and Jason Robards as a bandit. The screenplay was written by Sergio Donati and Leone, from a story by Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci and Leone. The widescreen cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli, and the acclaimed film score was by Ennio Morricone.",Once Upon a Time in the West
107,sme_no_densetsu,Another fine spaghetti western from Leone,8,14 April 2009,"In 1968 Sergio Leone followed up his classic ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" with another spaghetti western of similarly high caliber. ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" shares some common elements with its predecessor but that doesn't mean that it's a re-tread. Here, a mysterious stranger and an outlaw join forces to protect a beautiful widow from being manipulated by a ruthless railroad employee.The cast is a good one with Henry Fonda, Jason Robards & Charles Bronson supplying American star power to this Italian film. Claudia Cardinale amply supplies the eye candy as the beautiful woman at the centre of the story. Once again, the dubbing of non-English speaking actors is less than perfect but that's a fairly minor flaw.The script, with input from Italian film legends Leone, Bernardo Bertolucci & Dario Argento, is evocative and well plotted. It's more complex than ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" but does not end up being convoluted.Leone's direction is top-notch, as expected, and the Ennio Morricone score is a good one, though not quite as memorable as his iconic score for ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"". All in all, the film looks and sounds quite attractive.Like its predecessor, this film is one of the finest spaghetti westerns ever made and a fine film by any measure. While I doubt that its appeal warrants the surprisingly high IMDb rating I do think that it is a worthwhile film for western fans and film fans in general.",Once Upon a Time in the West
108,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,It's a sweeping epic that isn't shy of going big.,10,25 July 2020,"Once Upon a Time in the West is a true Western: it's got all the ingredients of stories concerning gunslingers and outlaws, and it goes all the way with showing the scope of what life was like on the American frontier; just as the railroads began to span the countryside.It's got sharpshooters in the concentrated forms of Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda, and they're two men fighting for different causes: Bronson's Harmonica is a mysterious trauma-ridden cowboy while Fonda's Frank is like a remorseless gangster trying to control his interests wanting to exploit the frontier's proliferating steam-engines.The thing that's great about Once Upon a Time in the West is that even though the story's got ridiculously big scope, it knows that in the middle of the vast American deserts of the Old West, the people roaming it are still very much interconnected in ways that can't be changed regardless of how much terrain one can traverse by train or horseback. It's an epic with a tight-knit character-driven story dissecting the simplicity, vastness and ruthlessness of the American frontier.This one's a movie for the ages, and it came out in 1968; probably one of the best years in cinema history, thanks to this, Yellow Submarine, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Planet of the Apes and The Great Silence.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Together they fight the scrupelless killers and try to reestablish justice.First of all I'm not a huge fan of the Western genre, which might partly explain my lack of excitement for this classic. However I have to say that the movie does have enormous lengths that in my eyes aren't made up for through some shooting or action scenes that you have in pretty much every western. The music might well be a masterpiece and you can't say much against the acting, it's only the plot that seems to me neither highly creative nor very thrilling. Too much black and white, very strict moral lines between the characters and a logic that is at least questionable.All in all this is a movie that many love and so you should give it a try. For me it was not a total disappointment but a rather hard watch and all in all not too satisfying.",Once Upon a Time in the West
110,Cosmoeticadotcom,Masterpiece,10,15 September 2008,"I had never seen the uncut version of Sergio Leone's famed Once Upon A Time In The West, before stumbling across the DVD at a bargain price. I had seen major portions of it, chopped up by censors, studio heads, and the nitwits who need to run commercials for local television stations. While intriguing I did not think it could hold up to his justly praised Once Upon A Time In America. I was wrong. It does, and in its own way is just as good, or great. Whereas America is amazingly complex, and follows the lives of several gangsters, West is sparse, amazingly straightforward, yet surreal- having been released fifteen years before America, in 1969. Instead of having affinities more in tune with Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather and Apocalypse Now it resonates with the TV series The Prisoner and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. The film is quite surreal, depending far more on what is shown (imagine that- a film where the visuals are the most important element!) than what is said. In two hours and forty five minutes there's a reputed only fifteen pages of dialogue; most of that cryptic and seeming torn from a Beckett play, rather than being at home in a Western, a genre I generally detest for all the American triumphalism and John Waynean braggadocio, celebrating the worst aspects of the Ugly American. Yet, this film is loaded with symbolism, and a very simple plot. A land speculator named McBain is killed, along with his family, as he awaits his new wife's arrival from New Orleans. She is Jill (Claudia Cardinale), a gorgeous ex-prostitute. The murder is ordered by a man named Morton (Gabriele Ferzettii), a robber baron railroad man whose physical handicap leaves him a prisoner on his train (much in the mode of a 19th Century James Bond supervillain), and who employs a killer named Frank (Henry Fonda), who actually does the deed. On his tale is an unnamed man named Harmonica (Charles Bronson), for the instrument he plays, and also a bandit gang leader named Cheyenne (Jason Robards), whom Frank has framed for the crime.The film follows the interactions of the four main characters, as described by others. As for the film, it is surreal, yet also hyper-realistic in its use of the scenery of Monument Valley, and the great faces of many of its character actors- from Jack Elam and Woody Strode in small, early roles, to Lionel Stander and Keenan Wynn in later roles. There are scenes that ring true, even as they are also pure symbolism, such as Cardinale's close association with water and self-image, Bronson's almost magical sliding in and out of frame, and the way Frank radiates more real menace in a lip curl than Hannibal Lecter can in a whole film. The film damns Romanticism, even as its title celebrates it. It dazzlingly inverts clichés and, most importantly, realizes that film can and should make use of time, and long shots and scenes. MTV has destroyed much of appreciation of the brilliance that long scenes can hold. This is never truer than the film's start, where three gunman waiting at a train station for someone or something that is coming on the next train. No explanation, no conversation; not a word is said, yet they deal with water drips, flies, and knuckle cracking. Fifteen minutes pass before what they are waiting for arrives, yet it's a visual and aural feast for pure cinemaphiles, on par with 2001's opening scenes of prehistoric humans.Throughout the film, glares, scowls, and small facial twinges convey emotion far more effectively than most pallid dialogue. And the grandiose scenes of natural beauty are something even David Lean would admire. The four musical themes attached to the main characters are highly effective. There are also many great lines in the film. Two of the best are when Harmonica is told by one of Frank's henchmen, after asking if a horse was brought for him, that it 'looks like we're shy one horse.' Harmonica replies, 'You brought two too many.' The other is when Frank, after being queried on his methodology, says, 'People scare better when they're dyin'.' Touches like this, and even the title, lend credence to the idea that, like his later Once Upon A Time In America, this film is nothing but someone's dream of the West, not the real thing. Yet, both within and without, people must wake up to modern America. Damn!",Once Upon a Time in the West
111,bobsgrock,Leone goes a new route with the same results.,9,29 October 2008,"With a style very much unlike that of his previous three Westerns, Once Upon a Time in the West takes a long time to tell this epic and powerful tale of three men all connected by their past and all destined to connect in the future. The acting is universally excellent with Fonda playing a very uncharacteristic part, but since he is such a great actor he has no problem filling the shoes of the merciless gunslinger, Frank. Jason Robards is great as the outlaw with a good heart, Cheyenne; and Charles Bronson is very Eastwood-like as a man known only as Harmonica with a mysterious past and a quick draw. The central character, though, is that of the beautiful Claudia Cardinale as Jill, a widow seeking revenge.Sergio Leone used a slower, more romantic style for this Western, but he still was able to produce some great images and a story that will forever be remembered. He doesn't deal too much with character development, rather showing us their actions and letting that speak for themselves. And, of course we cannot forget the score by Ennio Moriconne. Though not as memorable as The Good, Bad and the Ugly, it adds a great deal to the film. Certainly one of the best Westerns ever made, this is film making at a very high degree.",Once Upon a Time in the West

I was a child when I first saw this film and I loved it. Was it the story? Well..the story was -- okay. Was it because it was a western? No, I hated Westerns. Until this one. What was it?The men.This film has the most gorgeous, rugged, old west, sexy, handsome, men I had ever seen in my life! Why is this important? Maybe not for YOU, but it's just to let you think about how films can actually get to little girls and shape how they see stars. These men were..well..the paramount to what men should be. I see that there was a woman in this...that's nice. I also know the plot revolves around her..but I had her killed off in my mind the moment she came on the screen. Bring on the guys! They each had ""that something"", and it really wasn't all about looks. Henry Fonda wasn't that good looking but he was handsome, rugged. Charles Bronson, well what is there to say about the strong silent type with those blue eyes and dust beaten almost leathery skin? Woody Strode, just sculptured yummy!!! And Jack Elam...ya just gotta love that ole scruffy teddy bear. The first 15 or so minutes of this film is what I watch over and over again and never tire of it. Ladies...this western is for you!",Once Upon a Time in the West
113,Jeremy_Urquhart,"Without a doubt, one of the best Westerns of all time",9,30 September 2017,"I won't claim to have the ability to say anything new about this movie. It's been around for nearly fifty years, and is widely regarded as not just one the best Spaghetti Westerns of all time, but one of the best Westerns full stop. And it's not hard to see why: an incredible soundtrack, strong performances from the entire main cast, some surprisingly good humour and funny one-liners, a few tense sequences, a well-told story that doesn't rely on excessive dialogue or exposition, and consistently amazing cinematography and direction throughout. At least half the frames in this movie would probably make good paintings- no exaggeration.It's probably the marriage of the great visuals and soundtrack that make Once Upon a Time in the West work as well as it does. There's a good number of dramatic camera movements and interesting reveals that are tied up perfectly with the music- almost like some kind of singing-free musical at some points.Sergio Leone was one of the greatest directors of all time. It's a real shame that he apparently never got the kind of recognition he gets nowadays while he was still alive. Out of all his films, there's a strong argument to be made for this one being the closest to perfect. Honestly, there's not a lot that could be changed to make it better. My biggest direct gripe is the way the title pops up at the very end of the film, and rotates in a full circle before it disappears. It looks really cheesy, and comes close to killing the mood the otherwise extremely strong ending creates. While we're on complaints, another minor one would be that I want to say the film feels a little too long- maybe about 10 to 15 minutes. But at the same time, I wouldn't really know what to cut. Every scene is so well-constructed and orchestrated, and there's always something interesting to look at or listen to or think about, so I'm not really sure what should be cut. It's a pretty weak complaint, I know. Like I said, this thing's close to perfect.The Good The Bad and The Ugly might be a tiny bit more entertaining, and Once Upon a Time in America might have a slightly better soundtrack and stronger emotional moments (for me, personally), but it's still really hard to find much to complain about here. Absolutely recommended to any Western fan, and it gets a little better every time I watch it (four for me now, and counting).",Once Upon a Time in the West

And Leone's next great movie, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is whole step above what the great Italian director had ever accomplished before and after. ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" has the humor, craft, thrills, and compelling storyline as ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"". But the one thing that makes it stand out as a better film is its overall more serious approach to the look of the West, and the violence that was exchanged in its time. It's title, starting with ""Once Upon a Time"" may give you the impression that the movie is a fairy tale or fantasy kind of movie, but it's far from that.Starring Henry Fonda in the one time I ever saw him cast as a villain. And he's not just a Western gunslinging bad guy in this movie, he's one of the most cold-blooded, deadly killers ever shown on the screen. Opposing him is Charles Bronson in what might be his finest performance and role ever. And Jason Robards, another talented figure in movie history. These three ever-famous names helped contribute to the overall power of the movie, for it is some of their greatest achievements in their careers. All of the supporting actors and actresses were top-notch. The storyline and plot was extremely well-developed and the film does not have a body count that just continues and continues to climb and soar endlessly, which is a more realistic and therefore, powerful approach on Leone's part.Music was composed by the master of soundtrack, Ennio Morricone, who created some of the most memorable music ever in ""Once Upon a Time in the West"".""Once Upon a Time in the West"", running nearly three hours long, is an extremely compelling movie that is full of artistic approaches and styles by Sergio Leone. From its suspenseful beginning to its suiting ending, it reveals itself to be one of the greatest cinematic shows ever.

However, the timeless themes of progress, often times championed by evil men, crushing little people under it's considerable weight is a narrative that never gets old.The sight of a nearly-nude Claudia Cardinale isn't too hard to look at either.Highly recommended.",Once Upon a Time in the West
118,mentalcritic,"Often imitated, never equalled...",10,24 August 2004,"Ask a genuine film expert what they consider to be the greatest Western ever made, and there are generally only a handful of director's names they will mention. Sergio Leone is legend among that short list because the major productions he brought out in his international career, pretty much all of them are in this short list. Sure, there are also directors like John Sturges or Sam Peckinpah, but neither churned out the masterful epics with the same consistency.C'era una volta il West is probably one of the most restrained and subtle pieces of his career, and it is also one of the most sublime. As commentators on the DVD-Video have pointed out, every moment in the film is slow and distended to the nth degree, and yet it is never boring. The actors are all at the top of their game, selling their roles with a stony dedication that one almost never sees in current-generation actors. About the only actor in today's system who even comes close to Henry Fonda's legendary villain or Jason Robards' amazingly ambiguous mercenary would be Johnny Depp, and directors rarely give him an opportunity to prove his salt in front of the camera.What I'd like to see is a director's cut, or at least a cut produced from Sergio's old notes about the piece since the man is no longer with us, as there are a lot of moments in the English-language DVD-Videos that make it clear the studio still had marketing rather than coherence in mind. This in spite of the fact that Leone had already proven himself as one of the most brilliant directors who ever lived on no less than three previous occasions. I challenge any lover of cinema to find a director who has used the 2.35:1 aspect ratio in a more dynamic fashion than Leone. It might happen one day when the bugs are ironed out of the use of HDTV in cinema production, but don't count on it.In place of the usual endless gunfights that typically dominate Westerns, we have a slow-paced, sedate story that really looks as if the makers simply went back in time to the colonial days and photographed a few people. Each moment is exactly what you'd expect to see real cowboys living in the nineteenth century doing, and that is what gets the film its dramatic poise. Every character is so believable that one is almost bracing themselves for the next struggle they face.Most of the plot is fairly straightforward. It lulls the viewer into a false sense of security for the one final dramatic plot twist at the end when we learn why Charles Bronson's character has been so fascinated with that of Henry Fonda. Even if you find the rest of the film less than spectacular, this one dramatic moment will make you sit up and take notice. It's also not hard to see why Ennio Morricone received continued work from the Hollywood system after his association with Sergio Leone. The music in this film is what gives the audience something to focus on while they are waiting for the distended setups to come to fruition. On the second viewing, modern viewers will get more used to the languid pace, of course.In all, I gave C'era una volta il West a ten out of ten. While I don't consider it to be the absolute best film that Sergio Leone has ever made, even his worst is preferable to some of the countless imitations it has spawned. See it at least twice.",Once Upon a Time in the West
119,jaredmobarak,Watch those false notesOnce Upon a Time in the West,10,13 August 2008,"Between our three male leads, and even our female star, not a one can be called a hero of any sort. One is a killer, one a criminal, one a whore, and the other a man looking for vengeance, making friends, but really just traveling to the point of avenging a wrong done to him and his family. Do the two men protect the newly widowed Mrs. McBain from the ruthless killer Frank? Or do they just use her and the prospect of her money to get to where they want to be? Just because someone risks his life for another doesn't mean it is a selfless act. Quite the contrary, it usually means they have a lot more invested in the situation than one might think. Concerning these four characters, you never can tell where allegiances lie, or how long they may hold up. All one can be sure of is that the almost three hour ride they take together, from strangers to intimate acquaintances, for better of worse, is a helluva good time.I completely understand any complaint that the film may be too long and perhaps even boring in stretches. There are plenty of times where little to no speech is uttered; all we have to work with are the amazing visuals and sumptuous score. Each character seems to have their own song that follows them along, giving away their presence as time passes. The use of sound in general is so integral that those passages of silence, on behalf of the cast, is a necessity to create mood and tension between them. Who couldn't think that a short diddy on the harmonica can elicit the amount of suspense it does here. Not only does it give away the position and identity of its player, it inflicts fear in those confronting it. An uncomfortable unease at this weathered cowboy exuding such a lyrical melody mingled with the inability to know if the musical talent hides an expertise with the gun or compensates for a lack thereof. The absence of sound also helps at moments to keep the audience off balance. In one of my favorite sequencesnot to ruin anything, but the death of the McBain clancontains two extended instances of nothingness. A father and his children are smiling and readying themselves for the arrival of Jill, their new wife and mother respectively, yet are taken off-guard twice at the lack of noise from nature, and, on our end, score. You know something is amiss and causing the turmoil to the circle of life, you just don't quite know when or where that rift will show its face.Cinematically, one couldn't ask for more. There is a laborious, detail-orientated craft in play, carefully framing each second for full impact. The multiple showings of a large head in the foreground opposite a full figure in the distance, at diagonals to each other, never grows tired. The long focus, keeping it all in view is stunning to behold, as are the sweeping shots from above. A few long takes are interspersed as well, uncovering a dusty, realistic cesspool of deceit and wild west aspirations, the desert and tumbleweeds crawling around while the action moves through. Even the introduction to each character is handled with a skilled touch, framing them in silhouette, in close-up, or from afar, adding just the right amount of intrigue and importance to each. Especially for our three male leads, it couldn't be better. After a long sequence at a deserted train station, men dealing with the heat, dripping water, and uncaring flies searching for a place to land, we see the figure of Charles Bronson's Harmonica, just arrived from the passing train, telling the three men that they brought ""two horses too many"". For Frank, an amazing role of villainy by Henry Fonda, we see his handiwork from off-camera as the McBains fall one after the other, culminating with a true glimpse into the compassionless void where his heart should be. And even Jason Robards' Cheyenne enters with subtle bombast, walking into a saloon, slowly and with confidence, following the volleys of gunfire and struggle outside the establishment's walls, ending with the camera upon his handcuffed wrists, pouring alcohol down his dry throat.Claudia Cardinale has her moments as well, those times where she appears to be a lady of good-upbringing, truly distraught over the murder of her new family, a clan of farm folk that would allow her to leave the life of prostitution she had in New Orleans. A strong-willed firecracker, her Jill is unashamed to use her body for whatever means necessary; she likes the touch of a man, knowing that a hot bath will wash away all the unpleasantness for her to continue on living afterwards. Never allowing her to be the victim, Cardinale is no waif in need of protection and help, she can most definitely hold her own.There is of course a story holding the brilliant character studies on display together, one of greed and power. The land left to Jill by her dead husband is worth a fortune once the railroad reaches it's station, something Frank and his benefactor Morton, (another great performance by Gabriele Ferzetti), know, causing him to commit the murder. Harmonica and Cheyenne take it upon themselves to save that land for Jill, although their true reasoning results from the desire to stop Frank and all the evil he has caused the world. No one here is innocent, all are after power in some capacity, selfishly and without too much caring about the others except how much they can help achieve it. Truly a tale of humanity being undone by a world without rules, Once Upon a Time in the West is everything you've heard it was and more. I almost don't want to watch another Western because I'm sure all the rest will pale in comparison.",Once Upon a Time in the West
120,aciessi,Leone's Epic Western,8,23 May 2020,"Here, Sergio Leone matures into his craft of recreating the west. This is one hell of a slow burn. But it contains moments of tremendous beauty. This is a far more sentimental western. Standoffs and gunfights aren't all this film has to offer. It's best moments are in subtlety. The opening scene best exemplifies what I'm talking about. What other film can make you hang on to your seat over a fly landing on a cowboy's face?",Once Upon a Time in the West
121,KnightsofNi11,The formation of the modern western,8,29 August 2011,"Sergio Leone is most definitely the face of the modern western. Leone revolutionized the genre with his raw, brutal, and visceral films that matured and revitalized the spaghetti western and made it into something so much more grand. Once Upon a Time in the West is arguably his most ambitious film, and the biggest production he has ever tackled. It's almost three hours long and boasts an all star cast and very impressive sets. The film is about an assassin working for a massive railroad conglomerate who is out to get a beautiful widow. A mysterious harmonica playing stranger joins forces with a notorious bandit in order to protect this widow and stop this madman. The story is one of epic proportions that spans many large set pieces and an all around epic scale production. But along with all that, it is also one of Leone's most passionate homages to the spaghetti western genre that inspired him to make the classic films he did.Once Upon a Time in the West is slick, cool, stylish, and at times painfully overdrawn. However, it all plays up to the kind of film this is. Sergio Leone is obviously trying to do something so specific with this film and he may have overshot that, but it doesn't detract from the fact that this is such a wicked film. You can easily strip the film down to hard boiled men staring at each other for extended periods of time, but Leone has a way about him to where he can capture those long stares and make them intense, invigorating, and all too captivating. After the first two hours of this you begin to realize how over the top and extraneous these moments are, but a part of you doesn't care because it's the absurdity of these situations that make the film as a whole so much fun.It is in no way a poorly made film, in fact it is quite the opposite. Leone directs with a suave nuance that pulls you into the intensity of the moment and makes you never want to look away. Leone proves his status as one of the greatest directors in history with this epic saga. He couldn't frame his shots any more perfectly. He couldn't capture the heightened emotion and rigorous sincerity any better. He couldn't bring out any more talent in his already incredibly talented lineup of actors even if he tried. There is an elegant purity to the style of this film that is never overbearing to the story, but always remains an incredibly significant element in making this film as epic and as ingenious as possible.I'm not going to say that this is a particularly easy film to sit through. It's not. It is very long and it drags out every scene possible, squeezing every drop of sincerity and intensity out of the story. I would go as far to call it grueling at some points when you just wish the film would move on. But somehow it all pays off in the end and I still managed to love this film. It is what it is, and Leone captured exactly what he wanted with this epic scale production, and I have a lot of respect for that. Under the right circumstances I might sit through this film again, because it is incredibly good despite anything negative I can say about it. But, love it or hate it, there is no denying that Sergio Leone did things for the western genre no other director did during the latter half of the 20th century. And for that, my admiration of Sergio Leone grows exponentially, and it brings me around to having undying respect and love for Once Upon a Time in the West.",Once Upon a Time in the West
122,Bob-45,SERGIO LEONE DOES ORSON WELLES (BY WAY OF David LEAN),10,12 July 2004,"Is ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST a stunningly beautiful western saga or overblown, pretentious horse opera? Take your pick; you'd be right either way. What else but self-indulgent can you call an opening scene which runs ELEVEN AND A HALF MINUTES and ends with its principal players dead? John Ford could made a 90 minute movie from this thin script. Howard Hawks might have added a few action flourishes and come in at 105. Instead, Leone has given you ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE minutes, several scenes which run in excess of five minutes and what has to be most beautifully photographed western in motion picture history. Leone milks every ounce of drama from the meager story of the coming of the railroad to the future town of Sweetwater and its effects on the principal players. Leone matches his cinematic skill with his ingenious casting. Henry Fonda has never been better than as the 'evil as a snake' Frank. As Jill, the movie's central character, Claudia Cardinale uses her expressive face to provide the perfect landscape for Leone's frequent close-ups. Jason Robards, Jr. is surprisingly perfect as the 'Bogart-tough-but-lovable' Cheyenne. Gabriele Ferzetti provides the slick, oily but decadent railroad baron just the right touches of class, crass and ruthlessness. At first, Charles Bronson, as 'Harmonica,' seems the only casting misstep. As Fonda's chief adversary, Bronson never seems up to the task, artistically or otherwise. However, upon reflection, this unequal match now seems to be deliberate on Leone's part, to generate the necessary suspense to keep audience attention to the very end of this overlong masterpiece. Not enough can be said to praise Ennio Morricone's evocative, operatic score, or the other technical credits. ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is not simply a triumph of style over substance. In the end style has BECOME substance, etching the characters permanently into our memory. While lacking their dramatic depth, Leone brought to the cinema the same kind of visual splendor as Orson Welles and David Lean.I give ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST a '10'.",Once Upon a Time in the West

In the old West a gunfighter, with ambitions to become a wealthy businessman, prepares to drive a woman off her land, which is sought after by the railroad company.Once Upon A Time In The West is an immensely long and convoluted epic Western, director Sergio Leone's first within the Hollywood studio system, in which he revisits the motives, most of them less than noble, that led to the opening up and exploitation of the West. In this context, casting Henry Fonda, a revered American icon, as a grasping violent opportunist was a counter-intuitive master stroke. It's a beautiful-looking film that takes its sweet time in getting where it wants to go, but riveting all the same.",Once Upon a Time in the West
124,sjanders-86430,Sergio Leone is my all time favorite director,10,23 September 2021,"Sergio Leone was always wanting to do a film about America and about the West. This film is about the railroad coming and transforming the West. The four main characters are Jason Robards, Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, and Claudia Cardinale. Leone had to have Fonda or he wouldn't do it. Fonda was about 63. He had to be older than Bronson to fit the plot. Morricone composed a musical theme for the three men main characters. When you hear a certain musical piece, you know that character will appear. Fonda makes love to Cardinale in a close up of his old face, and the scene doesn't work. Other close ups are genius like those of Charles Bronson; he never looked as good. The film opening is famous for no music; just the fly buzzing and the squeaking windmill and the water dripping on one man's head. The train shot is from under the train. The train pulls out. Bronson stands alone. ""We only have two horses."" ""That's two too many."" responds Bronson who then shoots the three men dead. This beginning with the fly on the closup of the man's mouth, the drip on the bald head, the duster coats, the rough hewn platform, and the old man are all striking elements that continue throughout the film. Cardinale's arrvival to the shocking family deaths is unforgettable. The crippled railroad man with the Pacific Ocean painting on the wall of his office railroad car are other unique elements. Jason Robards wants coffee from Cardinale. Fonda wants sex. Bronson wants nothing, and she likes him the best. Her dead husband bought the lumber for the train station. The water is there, and so the end shot shows the train has arrived.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Highly recommend.",Once Upon a Time in the West
126,EijnarAmadeus,Thee epic western,10,5 July 2004,"spoiler alert. ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is one of the last great westerns. The spaghetti-western style were invented by Sergio Leone, that had already made three movies about Blondie, with Clint in the leading role. With Ennio Morricone's brilliance with soundtrack making, Leone were quickly the God of western. But he got bored, and wanted to make a gangster-drama placed in the 1920ties, named ONCE UPON A TIME IN America, but people didn't have faith in it. So Leone decided after all to make one more western, and it was going to be the last great epic one, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST.A mysterious and fascinating man called Harmonica wanders 'around and teams up with a local gang-force to save a beautiful widow from being assassinated by a gunman working for the railroad-company. This is leaves us for brilliant dramatics...Leone's style of filming is peculiar, everything goes very slowly and it always has a twist of either pure coolness or charm under it. With Morricone's absolutely fantastic tunes threw the whole movie, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST simply had to be something spectacular. The beautiful Mexican-tunes charming you, and the brilliant look of late 60ties movie making. The dialogs are truly superb, and with its genius actors the movie takes us into the last time of true cowboy drama, with everything you can ask for. Rough'n'tough revolvermen, showdowns, dusty desert, sweaty foreheads, tired boots, filthy hair, pure drama and off course a simply amazing woman. Things works it ways slowly and safe, until the pure brilliance of the movie just gathers into the tricky and epic climax. The opening stands as one of cinema history's best scenes; the pressure and excitement of it, before it ends quickly with brutal bullets flying threw the air. ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is one of the very few movies ever that's captured the true essence of western time. The movie stops just to let you enjoy pure cowboy look, before it continues into a new burst of attractive scenes. Fonda is truly fabulous as Harmonica, the mysterious man that simply is way to cool and to relaxed to shoot down with one bullet. Sergio Leone does everything right along with the rest of the movie, he twists easily with the audience and let's us into suspicion, dramatics and charm. If it hasn't been for the beautiful lady's appearance, the movie had been a sort of follow-up to THE GOOD,THE BAD AND THE UGLY, with three rough guys, all knowing how the handle the gun. But the woman, steals every scene. Her natural beauty capturing you, swinging around with us, and being such a perfectly attractive female with beautiful face, beautiful body and beautiful attraction to men. This is on every level a true motion picture, and is without doubt one of cinema's biggest and best classics. Although it never really got to be the last true western, because Eastwood made a brilliant last time western with UNFORGIVEN some years ago, but in the same time, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is the last great western, because it came at the perfectly right time, and, it's Leone, the only thing missing is Clint, although he isn't really missing in this one.STARS: 5/5",Once Upon a Time in the West
127,tonypeacock-1,Excellent entry in the Spaghetti Western genre,8,27 June 2019,"Excellent 'spaghetti western from director Sergio Leone.The film has the same Italian crew as the Dollars trilogy it appears but has a lot more money on the screen.The set designs, cinematography and locations including Death Valley in Utah, U.S. are used to full effect.I had some trepidation before watching the film about the casting. Rather the omission of Dollars stalwart Clint Eastwood.I needn't have had those thoughts. Charles Bronson appears to fill his role as the gunslinger with little vocabulary (rather a harmonica) with ease.You can see some of the Bronson hallmarks of revenge in his character incidentally called Harmonica!
The music from composer Ennio Morricone is excellent again. A blend of late sixties/seventies guitar strings with the harmonica influence.I watched with the television on high volume to appreciate the soundtrack and some excellent sound effects such as rusty railway station signs blowing etc. during tense stand offs opitimised by staring of characters!
The stand offs do drag on at times and inevitably the run time of the film goes up. One of my few complaints.The polished appearance of the film whilst noticeable goes against the lower budget grittiness of Leone's Dollars trilogy.
The American locations are used to full effect as the story revolves around the expansion of railroads.At times I felt I was spotting excellent actors from other films I have enjoyed such as Henry Fonda and Gabrielle Ferzetti (On Her Majesty's Secret Service).",Once Upon a Time in the West
128,jdkraus,One of Sergio Leone's best!,9,21 September 2008,"Trying to find ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" on DVD much less on VHS is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. After months of searching for it at rental stores and libraries, I finally found it and got a chance to see it. As a person who likes the western genre and the ""Dollars Trilogy"" I really enjoyed this movie. For starters, Sergio Leone's direction is breathtaking. The shots of the western landscapes are beautiful and so are the intense facial up closes that he uses so often in his other films, particularly during the duels. This builds much tension, even if the outcome may seem predictable. But not only does his directing talents capture such a grand film. Tonino Delli Colli's sweeping cinematography helps plaster the western backgrounds and landscapes. As with the actors, they all add diligence and layers to their characters, making each of them unique and complex. For the first time in a western, the story focuses on a woman, Claudia Cardinale's character. In earlier Sergio Leone films, women are depicted as a stereotype, either as having a heart of gold or as a whore. In a sense, the female lead is both, but she's more than just a three-dimensional figure. She's a character with feelings and emotions, and in which the story revolves around her.Henry Fonda often plays the nice good guy in movies, but he's the exact opposite in this; a ruthless, psychotic killer, who feels no remorse for those he kills. This was an unusual twist for him, but nonetheless, he makes a believable villain. Jason Robards and Charles Bronsan are likewise excellent in their roles as the two gunslinging protagonists. Robards delivers his lines of wisdom and humor fluently and Bronsan makes himself as the man of mystery, like ""The Man With No Name"" in the ""Dollars Trilogy"". The difference between the two is that Bronsan's character has a story.Adding more drama to the characters is Ennio Morricone's score. It is very unique, different from the other films he had worked on with Leone. Unlike in ""The Good, Bad, and the Ugly"" which was made up of a couple of great themes, his score is solely written for each of the different four lead characters. His music develops moods for each of them as it does in reflecting the story's emotional points such as: sorrow, fear, tension, and love. Overall, ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" is an excellent western that any Sergio Leone fan or buff of the genre should see. However, the one thing that this movie lacks is the action. Sure, there is some shooting, but not enough to carry a film that's almost three hours. At times, the movie gets boring, but the story and character development make it interesting, so I should not complain.",Once Upon a Time in the West
129,AhmedSpielberg99,"There are only two elegiac films that are worthy of their titles; No Country for Old Men, and this operatic epic Spaghetti Western!",8,4 November 2018,"My second Leone film, and I expected to see another Western masterpiece, with a gorgeous Morricone score, stunning cinematography, and incredible stand off's, stares & shooting scenes, but that is more serious, and not as cool as, than The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, and that's almost what I got. But what I didn't expect to see is one of the best, and most profound, contemplative movies ever made!Signifying the end of the Old West, Sergio Leone loaded his near-three-hour sprawling epic with symbols. The symbolism is seen in almost every aspect of the movie; the setting, the costumes, the music, and most importantly, the characters. In fact, each character stand for an iconographic Western role. But Leone did humanize them through his melodrama, and the result is that all the characters became some of the most interesting and compelling characters ever!What amazed me is how rich the plot seems despite its simplicity. And as convoluted as the narrative sounds, the movie never lost me. That's simply because the story is actually pretty simple, but the sophisticated themes and symbolic characters gave it mythic feeling.Aside from its remarkable opening scene, which became one of my all-time favorites, I found the first hour of unbearably tedious! I usually don't mind watching movies with a deliberate pace, but almost the entire first hour gave us nothing but glances of each of the interesting characters that I totally invested in afterwards. The extremely strong, compelling, sympathetic, interesting and memorable characters portrayed by a spectacular charismatic cast definitely made me forget how bored I was during the first act, but also definitely didn't make me forget that I was about to fall asleep a couple of times!(8.5/10)",Once Upon a Time in the West
130,CountZero313,irresistibly stylish,10,15 June 2008,"From the opening sequence of three non-verbal gunmen waiting for someone at a train station, grimly determined through the flies, dust, and leaky roof, to the inevitable quick-draw climax shot in extreme close-up with little or no dialogue, Once Upon a Time in the West astounds and entertains with its inventiveness, referencing of other westerns, and its judicious use of actors' reactions to tell the story.The influence of this film on modern movies is unmistakable. In the sudden demise of pseudo-protagonists in A History of Violence, or the complete vision-and-sound opening 20 minutes of There Will Be Blood, we see the ripples of Leone's first American masterpiece. At the time of writing revisionist westerns like The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford are having their day in the sun. But put a Colt 45 to my head and make me choose between these two great movies, and I'll take Bronson's revenge-driven cool over Pitt's sado-masochistic angst every time.Leone is a master of timing and pace. There isn't a missed beat here, but the sequence that most impresses is Henry Fonda's saloon exit into a street populated with assassins. In one sequence we have rising tension, new questions for the audience about Harmonica's motivations, and evidence that Frank is a formidable antagonist when he cleanly and economically picks off three gunmen.Often acclaimed for its visual storytelling, the dialogue in Once is spectacularly high-calibre. From the first punched beat about the number of horses, through to Fonda's throwing down the gauntlet to a waiting Bronson, the dialogue continually stays true to the characters while moving the story forward and telling us something new. And sometimes it's funny.It could reasonably be argued that this is the best western ever made, and will no doubt be number one on many people's all-time best film list. In short, a timeless classic.",Once Upon a Time in the West

The film is admittedly very very slow paced, but somehow that works in its favour and I enjoyed the journey even more.All of the main characters are very detailed, interesting and you actually care what happens to them.

132,RJBurke1942,Up close and very personal...,9,12 December 2006,"All good stories come full circle, laying the seeds of the denouement in the opening chapter or, in this case, the opening scene. Once again, Sergio Leone invokes a man with no name (Charles Bronson) who dispatches three hired killers in quick succession, after alighting from a train at a windswept desert station; at the denouement, the same man disposes of his nightmare, in the same fashion  a bullet  at another windswept desert station. In between, we have a complex, psychological drama encompassing a corrupt railroad tycoon, Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti); a delicious, reformed gold-digger, Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) recently married to Brett McBain (Frank Wolff); a sociopath, Frank (Henry Fonda) who simply delights in killing; and a bank robber/killer, Cheyenne (Jason Robards) who is wrongly accused of mass murder and thus determined to set the record straight.If that isn't enough to get your interest, this story is also a mystery on two levels: why does the man with no name (but, in the story, everybody calls him Harmonica  because he is often playing one that hangs around his neck) want to meet with Frank? And, where is the gold that Brett McBain told Jill was at his farm, when they married in New Orleans a month ago? If you like Westerns, you'll like this one; if you like Sergio Leone's work with westerns, you'll just love it... I know I did.At 165 minutes though, some will probably complain that it's too long. Don't listen to them at all! Sergio Leone, of all directors, probably used the close-up and extreme close-up more than any other director I can recall, letting the camera explore very millimeter of the actors' faces, searching for the emotion, the feeling, the expression to tell much more than mere words. So, there are long wordless sequences. However, the acting, direction and camera work provide the narrative perfectly. This is a masterfully constructed film by a trio of master story-tellers (Dario Argento, Sergio Leone and Bernardo Bertolucci) and a director (Leone) whose attention to detail is legendary. Couple all that with a musical score from the ever productive and imaginative Ennio Morricone, and you have one of the truly great westerns.Purists who know guns, of course, will laugh at the accuracy of those who manage to kill at over ten yards; six-shooters are notoriously inaccurate. The final battle, at five or six paces between the antagonists, however, is exactly right and must be seen to be appreciated.So, if you've not seen this one yet, then I highly recommend it; if you have seen it, why not have another look?",Once Upon a Time in the West
133,skepticskeptical,Cinematic Excellence,9,27 May 2020,"Long before the dawn of the blockbuster age, when garbage pizza franchises such as Raiders of the Lost Ark began to emerge, were the action-film gems of serious visual artists such as Sergio Leone. I have not decided yet whether Once Upon a Time in the West or The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is the better film, but both are extraordinary works of art. I suspect that the first fifteen minutes of this work may be the best fifteen minutes in the history of film. I am totally impressed by the composition of every shot of these films.

135,virek213,Leone's masterpiece,9,19 July 2001,"He made a mint out of his ""Dollars"" trilogy, and made Clint Eastwood a household name with them, but director Sergio Leone made his ultimate masterpiece with ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. Instead of just making a fourth ""Dollars"" film or turning it into a mere spaghetti oater, Leone created a very long but fitting elegy to the taming of the West. Released just shortly before Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, like the Peckinpah film, was unfortunately chopped by its distributor to allow for more showings in theaters, making it a critical and box office bomb. Since then, however, time has rectified this once-sad set of circumstances.Claudia Cardinale is a widow who comes out west to find out that her entire family has been slaughtered by gunmen hired by a railroad magnate (Gabrielle Ferzetti). Apparently, the spread that her husband had laid out is the starting base for building a new town, and that town is located over the only underground water for fifty miles in either direction, and it's a supply that Ferzetti wants for his railroad. Cardinale, of course, isn't willing to give it to him, at least not for free. Protecting her (but are they really?) are a lone gunman (Charles Bronson) and an outlaw (Jason Robards) wrongly sought by the law for the massacre of Cardinale's family. Looming very close in the picture (and looking to take over for Ferzetti) is that steely gunman, played with chilling perfection by Henry Fonda (!). And Bronson has a score to settle with Fonda, though we are left hanging as to what score that is until they have their final showdown.Shot partially in Spain (where Leone shot his previous spaghetti westerns) and in Monument Valley, the home of many a John Ford western, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is not exactly for those who want their action fast and furious. At nearly 2 hours and 45 minutes, it is very, very long. But Leone manages to cram a lot of things into that frame, and as usual he does so with another fabulous Ennio Morricone score. Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography is enormously impressive, shot in Technoscope to give Leone's trademark extreme close-ups a highly charged feel and to make the wide open spaces seem even wider than they are already.Leone gets very good performances from everyone (including veteran western heavyweights Jack Elam and Woody Strode in the film's 15-minute opening credits sequence, perhaps the longest such sequence anywhere), with Bronson's ""Harmonica"" character a perfect sub for Eastwood's ""Man With No Name"", Robards' half-breed bandit done brilliantly, and Cardinale essaying one of the best female roles in a western of any kind up to that point. Even more important, however, is how Leone managed to get Fonda, who almost never played heavies, to give what must stand as one of the most chilling villain performances in screen history. A sarcasm that we never thought was evident in the man evinces itself when he questions a henchman about the man's trustworthiness because he has trouble keeping his clothes on: ""How can you trust a man who wears both a belt AND suspenders? The man can't even trust his own pants.""Despite its extreme length, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is still a fascinating western epic after all these years. Rectifying the mistake it made when they chopped it up originally by putting Leone's final cut out on VHS and DVD, Paramount has had the good sense to give audiences of today a glimpse into one of the finest westerns ever made. For patient viewers who like a great story, great cast, and great direction, this film is the ticket.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Though I read that this masterpiece of his flopped in the US box office, it still remains one of the most well directed, well shot, and best western movie ever.The story is about a ruthless assassin Frank (Henry Fonda), who kills a whole family to build a rail road. His mission is finally stopped and the widow Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) is rescued by a stranger Harmonica (Charles Bronson) with the help of another notorious dacoit Cheyenne (Jason Robards).The plot is simple, but the narration is brilliant. The characterization, the silence, the style, the choreography of sound, and back-ground score is marvelous. There is a built up of suspense through-out the movie. Always seen Henry Ford as a hero, packed against a team of dacoit and stranger  brings certain tension of purposefulness of the motives of the characters. In the end, Henry Ford emerges as a villain and Charles Bronson as a savior.The camera angle, the sets and costumes are fantastic. The dialogues are minimal. The love scene between Henry Fonda and Claudia is a bit too much and serves the only purpose of formulaic insertion in the narrative.The small details, the slowness of pace, the lazy movement of people, the sun, the heat the dust all add up the canvas being painted BIG.

A young woman arrives by train in a small town in the interior of the American West and when she arrives at the farm where she will live with her new husband and children, they find them dead at close range, victims of greedy men who seek to take possession of the land that will be worth a fortune with the passage of the new train line through the property. Alone, she gains sympathy from the main suspect who offers to find the real responsible for the murders, and also from a lone gunman looking for revenge. The script is exquisite, with precise dialogues. The characters are goods built and interpreted by the beasts of the time, Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson and Claudia Cardinale, but the one who stole my attention was the actor Jason Robards who lives the Cheyenne, a crude and very honorable man. It is a western with long plans and with its own time, which despite causing strangeness for the duration, are necessary for the narrative of the story.

This film is a work of art, the most beautiful thing ever put on celluloid. I don't know how Sergio Leone does it but he manages to create something so huge with nothing but a camera, the greatest composer and a handful of brilliant actors. For the first ten minutes of this epic western there is no dialogue, none at all. We see nothing but these three men waiting for a train, that is all we know. This is the trademark style of epic spaghetti western director Sergio Leone, his use of the camera has never once been bettered.Ennio Morricone's score is perfect. He manages to capture the mood of a particular scene or character so well with his music. Morricone and Leone were the best cinematic duo in the history of cinema.Claudia Cardinale, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards and Charles Bronson give four outstanding performances. They all have very different roles and they are all stunningly good. Claudia Cardinale gives a beautiful and moving performance as recently widowed Jill who is under protection by Harmonica (Charles Bronson) and Cheyenne (Jason Robards). They are protecting her against Frank (Henry Fonda) a ruthless man who is hired by a railroad baron to knock off settlers who get in the way.

I can think of some very ordinary westerns not many know that were better in terms of rhythm, story and morality.This is so over-the-top it is cartoonish. No character is identifiable and literally seems taken out of a comic book, where all those other previous Westerns gave you a feel of 'real', realistic characters with real incentives, motivations and relationships.This here is looooooooooooooooong, endless ""stylistic"" Euro-type cinema conjugated with large American budget production, top actors, and just such a thin center it feels practically agonizing that it's stretched over nearly three hours. You know what it feels like ? A soap opera. Yes. A Western-set soap opera.

Unfortunately, words like slow, painstaking, and violent term the film just as accurately. I'm not one to shy away from a film simply because it's long. If done correctly, plot can be woven along quite nicely through a long film. (One of my favorite films is From Here to Eternity, which tells a story through a long film quite well.) This film however, felt more of a poorly done documentary than a film at all. (It should be noted that I am a documentary fan, emphasis on poorly done.) The audience has traveled 2 hours into the film full of excess violence and bloodshed before we get any details on the plot. With what is well done in the film, like the lighting, the long shots, the editing, and sound effects, there is so much more that detracts from it. The acting was only sub-par, saved only by a strong screen presence from the veteran Henry Fonda, albeit, in a shift in the roles I'm used to seeing him in. Packed with more violence than a Tarantino flick, the needless bloodshed especially against a little boy 20 mins. in was off- putting to say the least. Maybe it wasn't my type of film, and maybe I'm not well-versed enough in westerns to appreciate this film, but Once Upon a Time in the West is not a story I will be revisiting.",Once Upon a Time in the West

144,TheMan3051,Leone does it Again!,10,25 August 2002,"Following his greatest picture of all times, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly Leone directed Once Upon A Time in the West. This film is OUTSTANDING! Not only is it outstanding but it's Leone's second masterpiece and it wouldn't be his last. Leone's direction is outstanding, Ennio Morricone's score is once again a powerful and memorable score which captures the beauty of the film, and the performances were great. Anyway, I'm not going to get into the plot so I won't risk spoiling anything but then again you probably already know the plot from other reviews.Still even with how brilliant this movie is I felt it could have been better. Why? because of the performances. Two of them to be exact. Now while Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda both did a respectably great job let's not kid ourselves. The role of Harmonica was written for Clint Eastwood and no one could have played that role better then Eastwood himself and the Frank character would have been played better by Lee Van Cleef.
Now I have to ask myself if Clint Eastwood were in this picture would this be the fourth installment of the Man with no Name saga or would it be a sperate movie on it's own? If this were the fourth picture then it would have given us a more psychological reason why Man with no Name is a bounty hunter to begin with! Regardless this is an incredible movie which is extremely underrated by the Hollywood community and deserved a Best Picture and Director Oscar or at least a nomination! 4(****)out of 4(****) stars",Once Upon a Time in the West

I mention this because I really, really, did not want to watch this, when I eventually gave in and let my roommate put it on.It's probably the best ""western"" ever made, and definitely the best of the ""Sphaghetti Westerns"", it's beautiful, intense, and marvelously composed. The music is incredible and infamous, the performances subdued and brooding, (just watched Peter Fonda last night in ""Toute Va Bien"", which is apples and car batteries to this film).

I then went out to search for more, but all I could find was ""Once Upon a Time in America"". Not that I don't want to see that, I would have just rather see ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" first. I eventually found it at a library and rented it. It was well worth the search.Although not as good as ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"" in my opinion, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" offers new adventures and plot. Along with a nice music score.Claudia Cardindale gave a good show as Jill McBain, the attractive widow who just lost her new family. Although she was good, I thought her character was just a little stale at times.Henry Fonda was great as Frank, the menacing, cold-blooded murderer. Fonda seems to be more accustomed to playing the hero, so this was certainly a surprise to see.Jason Robards gave the 2nd best performance of the film as Cheyenne, Frank's former gang member who is convicted of murder early on and leaves Frank's gang.By far, the best performance was Charles Bronson as ""Harmonica"", the mysterious man whose brother was killed by Frank years before. He seeks revenge now, and goes around playing a harmonica and getting on people's nerves. He had a lot of great lines and was a very cool character.The music score for this movie was one of the best I've seen. The background score mixed with Harmonica's own music made it even better and really set the mood for a lot of scenes.Fans of Leone's ""Dollars"" trilogy should see this movie.10/10.",Once Upon a Time in the West
150,supertom-3,"Epic, visionary and Charles Bronson a total Bad-Ass!!!",10,24 March 2005,"In one of cinemas greatest debates, the question remains: Which is Sergio Leone's best film? The answer would boil down to a choice of three epic masterpieces. Once Upon A Time in either the West or America and of course The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. It is a question I dare not answer because it is so hard to choose between the sheer class of the three. Leone's epic western Once Upon A Time In The West remains one of the greats of all Westerns, the last great one in fact. While many would still prefer Good, Bad and Ugly, this is undoubtedly the more sweeping and epic as this was a big budget affair. Then it also boils down to your preferred choice of bad-ass, Clint or Charles? Well Charles Bronson is a superb bad-ass.OUATITW is such a gorgeously shot piece of work it must be said. Leone uses he camera like no one else. The sheer rhythm and timing of each movement and the flair is remarkable making the film stand up to the visually superb films of the last 20 years from such visionaries as Ridley Scott and John Woo. Leone's style is perhaps the most influential in cinema, aside from Kurosawa. Leone is of course someone who likes to stretch scenes to the limit, get to the heart of the characters at that point and increase tension to near the breaking point. His sense of timing is unrivalled. In The West we have a number of brilliantly constructed scenes that tease the audience before finally releasing the tension, usually in stylised violence. The face-off between Bronson and Fonda is absolutely the epitome of tension of just coolness.As far as the cast goes, Leone always gets a good performance. Even with a guy like Bronson and indeed Eastwood in his earlier career, two guys not noted for their acting prowess, however he gets a subtle, superb performance from Bronson, which is almost entirely told through Bronson's eyes. It's an understated performance of such cool and such toughness that he barely has to raise an eyebrow for us to know exactly what's going on in his head. There are some actors great at acting visually but not too many. Bronson gives a great performance. Leone's gift in choosing actors with a visual intensity is genius. Not only is Bronson good but in a similar way Henry Fonda gives a great performance, again with minimal dialogue. Fonda's sadistic cowboy is one of cinemas great villains, but one filled with depth. Fonda's steely cold stare is chilling. Then there is Jason Robards who perhaps steals the show, narrowly. Claudia Cardinale is also excellent. I do believe that some of the best directors can pull big performances form the actors, with the littlest dialogue. People like Leone, John Woo, Ridley Scott and Scorsese for example have always been great at this.Once again Ennio Morricone gives a marvellous score that is full of grandeur and atmosphere. While the films use of sound is excellent. This is without doubt a film that any movie buff should have in their collection. *****",Once Upon a Time in the West

The most distinctive element ended up being how original Django is compared to the composite mimicking that went on in Once Upon. Looking back at the dates of the best westerns and chronology of this film, it's less surprising.Beyond that, the first thing you'll notice about this, at least viewers who see Star Wars long before they get around to classic westerns, is that Princess Leia shares a similar hair style to an Irish teen in this.While money and guns are once again a big focus in this film, revenge becomes the primary theme. Underlying everything is the dirtiness and lack of water, which is one of its better qualities.Technically, it has an enjoyable, whistling-worthy soundtrack along with a lot of authentic looking settings and trains, and even bathing and coffee making. It's enough to make it worth seeing once, but hardly one of the best, even once upon a time in the 1960s.",Once Upon a Time in the West
154,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,10,2 October 2021,"Good Morrow, countrymen.If you're making a list of the ""Greatest Westerns"" Sergio Leone's masterpiece is sure to be in the top 10. It's up there with The Searchers, Rio Bravo and personal fav, The Outlaw Josie Wales in my opinion. Every frame of this epic has Leone's signature style. Most notably in the opening train station scene. The way he captures each henchman...focusing (humorously) on Snaky (Jack Elam) and a pesky fly that's crawling around his face for and eternity. As you viewer, you're wishing he'd just swat it with his hand. He doesn't and you watch, uncomfortably or irritably, the fly walking around his mouth as Snaky tries to blow it off without success. Leone lets this play out just long enough to get the emotion from the viewer he's seeking. Tension.Being a Bronson fan (who isn't?), I do believe Harmonica is one of the most unique characters in any classic Western. ""Instead of talking, he plays. And when he better play, he talks."" His motivation for vengeance isn't necessarily new ground, but at least you get the ""why"" of the harmonica. In a lesser Director, the harp would be a trait created out of thin air to give the character some depth.The dueling plots of the railroad/station and Harmonica seeking vengeance against Frank (Henry Fonda) come together over Claudia Cardinale (Jill McBain), in arguably her most famous role.She so much more than just a pretty face. I'd equate her as the Italian equivalent of Raquel Welch, who I could have seen in the role (given her great performance in 68's Bandolero and 71's brilliant Hannie Caulder). Cardinale plays Jill, a former prostitute not as a weak flower on the frontier, but a pragmatic survivor with a dream and goal to honor her dead husband.I could write more, but I'll just say that this film rewards re-watches. Leone gives a masterclass on how to make a movie and it gets my highest recommendation.Fare thee well. It's hoecakes and Madeira time!",Once Upon a Time in the West

Against the backdrop of a whining windmill, Jack Elam catches a fly with the barrel of his gun, as his two companions and he await the arrival of the man with the harmonica (Bronson).Then we see Cardinale's husband shot dead by one of the screen villainest villains ever - Henry Fonda, playing an unusual baddy in this movie - and Cardinale's arrival in all her beauty, while the film's languid and elegiac theme plays: one of the most beautiful sequences in the entire history of the cinema, not just Westerns.The film continues with memorable vignettes and performances (even the rather limited Bronson shines), a wonderful soundtrack, and lovely photography.

158,Rockwell_Cronenberg,"Not really my thing, but I still found enough to admire.",5,1 April 2012,"As someone who has never particularly been a fan of the western genre, I'm sure that I don't fit much into the demographic for Once Upon a Time in the West. Still, I was able to find enough to admire here. Sergio Leone is a director who, if nothing else, knows damn well how to stage a scene. The first hour is basically a combination of extended introductions to our main characters, but each one is incredibly tense and memorable. We meet the mysterious Harmonica (Charles Bronson) gunning down those who were out to kill him, the villainous Frank (Henry Fonda) as he shoots a child, the mischievous Cheyenne (Jason Robards) as he escapes custody and the beautiful Jill (Claudia Cardinale) as she arrives off her train.Each sequence is drawn out but doesn't feel overlong, giving us a first look at the characters that sticks with the viewer until long after the credits roll. That opening hour doesn't delve into the plot much, or the characters themselves, but it's easily my favorite area of the film as it shows a lot of what Leone is best at doing. In these scenes Leone shows his gift for building suspense, utilizing silence when it's appropriate as opposed to trying to ratchet up the tension with directorial tricks. He lets the silence build it all, giving an eerie calm so that when the violence occurs it startles you, shakes you up. In a time so desensitized to graphic violence on film, Leone knows how to make his bullets matter.The four main characters are all memorable and solidly well-acted, potentially with the exception of Harmonica. I found Bronson serviceable in his role, but the role itself wasn't one that I cared for; the whole mysterious stranger playing his harmonica because he's a badass thing was something that I found laughable almost immediately and it was hard for me to take seriously throughout the film. Bronson allowed me to get over it after a while, along with lessened use of his theme that I found incredibly grating in the opening act, but I still had a hard time not laughing at the basic idea of the character. The other three were sources of great enjoyment for me, though. Fonda goes against his persona and plays a vile bad guy, which is a genius bit of casting on Leone's part, and he uses those baby blue eyes to penetrate you so he can rip out your heart. I think it's one of his finest performances, seeing someone so adored for being wholesome take on such a cruel bastard.Claudia Cardinale is stunningly gorgeous here, but she also brings a lot of womanly fire to the boy's club. Working against people like Fonda and Bronson, it could have been easy to fall into the role of the helpless woman, but Cardinale makes Jill McBain maybe the most aggressive character in this show. She's got a ton of passion and refuses to let the men push her around. Cardinale may be my favorite performance in the film, but I'd have to say that my favorite character belongs to Jason Robards' Cheyenne. While the feud between Frank and Harmonica rages on, battling with each other while Jill is caught in the middle, Cheyenne is just a wild outlaw having fun in the midst of it all; and oh what fun Robards makes him. You can tell that Robards had a great time shooting this, and seeing him in this character brings a levity to the film that is a welcome relief.There are definitely a lot of things that I liked about this film, but for everything that I liked there was something that I disliked as well. As great as Leone is at crafting individual sequences, the film became rather tiresome once it tried to actually start doing something with it's characters and narrative. The first hour is exciting and the final half hour or so was a nice conclusion, but everything in the middle dragged on and on. I enjoyed the characters but I didn't particularly care about them, and the script writes them all so thin.Everything is too black-and-white, with a meaningless plot that was clearly created around the individual scenes. It's like they were writing their cool characters and cool sequences but then realized they had to actually make a narrative to have them exist in so they just tossed something together. It doesn't have a drive at all, despite such excellent moments. Once Upon a Time in the West is a film with a lot to admire, but for me it ended up being less than the sum of it's parts.",Once Upon a Time in the West
159,bobbobwhite,Probably the best western ever made,9,27 July 2004,"I won't detail the film as others have, but state that the proper human emotion for each scene was the primary sought-after element throughout and was gloriously achieved by the brilliant writer, director, and composer.  A one of a kind film and a truly great accomplishment, and by an Italian, not an American, director. Probably had to be that way to do it right as American directors want only action and more fake and unrealistic and historically incorrect action, not human reality or sensitivity...... ""Hell, boy, this is a Western!""Contrary to American made westerns where the tough macho guys just bull through everything without a sensitive or caring thought ever wimping-up their manhood, this film connected true human emotion to every action and reaction, whether good or bad, weak or strong.  This was obviously the director's and writer's main intent....to show that abject meanness and cruelty, but also much goodness and humanity, existed side by side within our heroic struggle to settle the West. And the wonderful and original soundtrack, added at just the right moment each time it was used, served to complete the formation of the correct perception of each human feeling in the characters. This is not your typical John Wayne flick, folks, and thank heaven for that. It is merely the best western I have ever seen.",Once Upon a Time in the West
160,jcbutthead86,"One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Powerful,Unforgettable Epic Masterpiece From Sergio Leone.",10,11 June 2013,"Once Upon A Time In The West is one of the greatest Westerns ever made and a unforgettable,Epic Masterpiece from beginning to end. Filled with powerful direction,great acting,beautiful photography and a brilliant score,Once Upon A Time In The West is not only one of the greatest Westerns of all time,but also one of the greatest films ever made,one of my all-time favorite films and Sergio Leone at his best.Once Upon A Time In The West tells the story of a mysterious stranger named Harmonica(Charles Bronson)who teams up with outlaw Cheyanne(Jason Robards)to protect widow Jill McBain,a former hooker now wife and widow(Claudia Cardinale)from ruthless killer Frank(Henry Fonda)who wants Jill's railroad. Now,Harmonica and Cheyanne must defend and fight for Jill and stop Frank at all costs.Once Upon A Time In The West is a Classic Masterpiece of Cinema that right from the very start has you glued to the screen and give viewers an unforgettable cinematic experience that is a large epic not only in scope but in length. Director Sergio Leone gives viewers a different kind of Western than his excellent and Masterful Dollars/Man With No Name Trilogy especially with The Good,The Bad,And The Ugly. I guess that is one of the reasons Once Upon A Time In The West was overlooked when it came out in 1969 because it was a different film than The Man With No Name Trilogy in other words if the Man With No Name Trilogy were Action packed Westerns with big ambitions than Once Upon A Time In The West is a visual Art film Western. Leone takes the epic scope of TG,TB&TU and expands on it with this film giving us a powerful film that has more visuals than dialog and more drama than Action and also pays tribute to the great Western genre taking the trademarks and familiar things that are in a Western film and turning the trademarks on their head and raises the trademarks to a higher level. One of the great things about OUTITW is that this film is more about visuals and tone than it is about dialog because with this film we are shown and given images that are not just there just to be there but add to the story and makes understand what's going on in with the story and the characters who they are and what their motivations are. The images are haunting and at the same time beautiful and add to the films power and greatness. OUATTW doesn't have a lot of dialog but when the dialog is said it is great and memorable making the characters feel gritty and real. It's interesting that OUATTW and Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyseey came out in the same year and while both films are in different genres(Western and Science Fiction)both films are alike in terms of using visuals and little dialog. Leone and cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli give OUATTW a beautiful visual style making the West look romantic and epic while at the same time making the film gritty and true to how the old West really was. The style is Spagetti Western but is filmed like a Hollywood Western of the 1940s and 50s All though the film is long(at 2 Hrs and 45 Minutes)OUATTW moves at a great pace and there is not a wasted scene in the film because OUATTW is one of those films that is so excellent that you want the film to be longer and keep going. The four main characters Jill,Frank,Harmonica and Cheyanne are great characters who represent the classic Western movie standards and arch types(hooker,killer,mysterious gunfighter-gunslinger,outlaw)but the four of them are presented in a larger than life way and are stylized but at the same time feel very real. With the exception of Frank the other main characters Jill,Harmonica and Cheyanne are given a moral ambiguity and have gray areas where you feel sympathy for the three of them and wonder what will happen with the three of them. Although this is not an Action film there are enough Western gunfights to satisfy Western and Action viewers and when the Action happens it is fast and intense. The final 15-20 minutes builds into one of the best endings in film history because it is filled with tension,suspense,surprises and at the same time sad and optimistic. It's an excellent and unforgettable ending you will not forget.The whole cast is great in their roles. Claudia Cardinale is excellent and beautiful as Jill McBain,with Cardinale holding her own against Bronson,Fonda and Robards. Henry Fonda is brilliant and intense as Frank,one of the greatest villains in film history. Fonda is cold and pure evil and you'll never forget his performance. Charles Bronson is wonderful and mysterious as Harmonica,a quiet gunslinger who plays the Harmonica and has great scenes with Cardinale,Fonda and Robards. Jason Robards is great and humorous as Cheyanne,an outlaw that helps out Harmonica and Jill. Gabriele Ferzetti is amazing as Morton,the railroad baron who is also Frank's boss. Frank Wolf(Brett McBain),Lionel Stander(Barman),Paolo Stoppa(Sam)and Keenen Wynn(Sheriif-Auctioneer)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Western favorites like Woody Strode(Stony-Member of Frank's gang)and Jack Elam(Snaky-Member of Frank's gang).The direction by Sergio Leone is excellent,masterful and powerful,with Leone always moving the camera,using great angles and intense close-ups bringing a unique visual style to the film. Great direction,Leone.The score by Ennio Morricone is brilliant,beautiful,unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history,with Morricone's score matching the tone and powerful of each scene. A masterful score by Morricone.In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Westerns or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In The West,a true Masterpiece of the Western genre and a Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Action, music, and humor, which were the main three elements of Leone's past works, are this time kept to the minimum necessary to emphasize the slow-burning wait for the gun to fire, for the hero to finally appear. While ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" was held back by its episodic nature, this time we have a coherent complex plot that connects all characters and slowly reveals their nature, at a time where the Old West was about to be wiped out by the birth of a new nation. The film has a melancholic mood and is packed with overt references to western classics taken out of context, as if Leone's aim was to bid farewell to the genre that had made him a household name.

164,disinterested_spectator,Reverse Quotations,10,20 January 2015,"I was in college when this movie came out. I had already seen the previous Westerns by Sergio Leone, and was especially awed by ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" (1966), so I looked forward to ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" with great anticipation. I was disappointed. On the one hand, I could see that it had a lot of good stuff in it, but there was something lacking. As I found out later, what was lacking was all the footage that had been cut out of the movie for its release in America. It was not until the movie came to television, and I saw much of the additional material (with some stuff edited out for the usual reasons), that I realized what a great movie it was. Even then it was not until somewhat later that I saw the restoration, which included even more material. Unfortunately, those who restored this movie messed up on the music at the end, which is hard to understand, because it would have been simple to do it right. I guess we Americans just were not destined to see this movie in its perfect form, and certainly not in a movie theater (at least not where I live).On the whole, the critics did not seem to like the movie when it first came out either. Some of them may have also reacted negatively to the chopped up presentation, but others were offended by other things, such as the slow pace or the amoral characters. Some of the critics objected to the way it copied stuff from other Westerns. What they (and I) did not realize at the time was that these were quotations, not necessarily in the sense of quoting what had been said in other Westerns, but in the extended sense of creating images and plot points similar to those in previous Westerns. Presumably, Leone had intended that people would watch his movie and smile appreciatively at these quotations, and I suppose some people did precisely that. What he probably did not realize was that these quotations were more likely to be appreciated in reverse, as was the case with me. I had seen many of the Westerns that were quoted, but only once, and thus did not catch the references. ""Once Upon a Time in the West,"" however, I watched every chance I got, and I quit counting after I had seen it twenty-five times.Little by little, I watched the classic Westerns again, or for the first time in many cases, and I would experience déjà vu. For example, one night I was watching ""The Plainsman"" (1936), somewhat listlessly, when suddenly, toward the end of the movie I felt a ripple of exhilaration go through me. At first, I did not know why, but I quickly realized that when Gary Cooper dressed up in black and entered the bar, he looked just like Frank entering the bar to buy the land back from Harmonica.From then on I never knew when I would catch another quotation and get another feeling of déjà vu, as I did when I watched ""High Noon"" (1952), ""Johnny Guitar"" (1954), ""The Searchers"" (1956), ""Shane"" (1953), ""3:10 to Yuma"" (1957), ""Warlock"" (1959), and many others. Those are fairly obvious, but others can easily escape notice, as in the case of the little piece of material missing from the brim of Harmonica's hat, just like the hat Charles Bronson wore in ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1960).Of course, one's ability to appreciate these reverse quotations presupposes having seen ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" many, many times. No problem.",Once Upon a Time in the West

(And make no mistake: this is the wide, wide West, folks--so the widescreen/letter boxed version is strongly recommended.) The unholy trinity of Italian cinema--Leone, Bernardo Bertolucci, and Dario Argento--concocted the story about a woman (Claudia Cardinale) hanging onto her land in hopes that the transcontinental railroad would reach her before a steely-eyed, black-hearted killer (Fonda) does. (The film's advertising slogan was: ""There were three men in her life. One to take her ... one to love her ... and one to kill her."") Meanwhile, Leone shoots his stars' faces as if they were expansive Western landscapes, and their towering bodies as if they were looming rock formations in John Ford's Monument Valley",Once Upon a Time in the West
166,patches89,Absolute Masterpiece,10,20 January 2021,"Ive seen alot of westerns growing up but very few i've truly enjoyed as its not a subgenre I love. This film however was brilliant and will easily make my top 100 films of all time. Sergio Leone has a knack for creating brilliant pieces of cinema all crafted with love and attention to detail and was helped by a fantastic cast led by the amazing Henry Fonda. Ennio Morricone's score was one of the best in cinematic history rivalling the stuff he did in ""Once Upon A Time in America"" and ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"".",Once Upon a Time in the West
167,Emerenciano,it must be seen more than once,9,28 April 2003,"I had heard about this movie, but I hadn't seen it until when my mother came home with the tape. I watched that and really like it. It's beautifully made and the performances are very good. Together with ""El Dorado"", this is certainly one of the best western film ever made. The music by Morricone is wonderful and ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is something we can't miss. Actually, it must be seen more than once.",Once Upon a Time in the West
168,jose-cruz53,"Excellent western, though not among the best films ever made",9,2 October 2012,"This is an excellent film. Has great cinematography and a very epic music score. However, it has many flaws which kept it from achieving its full potential and it is simply not remotely as good as ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"", at least according to my subjective preferences.The films flaws are many: its pacing is too slow, which place increased stress over the viewer's patience. The director appears to believe that the most dramatic scenes were those where the characters stared blank on each other for the greatest amount of time: the final confrontation has the two main characters starting at the ugly faces of each other for 20 minutes straight in complete silence.Overall, I found it highly recommended but not the perfect masterpiece of cinema.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Set in the west, two men (Jason Robards and Charles Bronson) try to protect a widow (Claudia Cardinale) from a vicious gunman (Henry Fonda) who's dressed in black.Out of the performances, Fonda and Bronson really stand out here like the landscape, editing, and Ennio Morricone's picture perfect musical score.",Once Upon a Time in the West

171,bwaynef,The Composer as Auteur,10,28 March 1999,"Unquestionably a masterpiece, the best of all Leone's films, and one of the 10 greatest Westerns of all time.  I certainly don't wish to take credit away from the director, but the true star of this epic is Ennio Morricone whose score, as I understand it, was written BEFORE the movie started shooting and used as inspiration.  This may be an example of a new film theory:  The Composer as Auteur.  Morricone's work here was deserving of an Oscar, and the fact that it wasn't even nominated in a year in which Burt Bacharach's atrocious score for the mediocre ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" was honored, speaks volumes about the Academy's ignorance and lack of taste.  Or is it jealousy?",Once Upon a Time in the West

This is a movie that everyone should have the pleasure of experiencing for themselves with no review spoilers. All I will say is you will fall in love with the music score, this is Charles Bronson's best, one of Henry Fonda's best, and Claudia Cardinale, you could just watch her all day, she's so beautiful. Oh and I can't forget Jason Robards who was amazing, really great stuff from all Four of these actors. Not much dialogue in this film, the way a great western should be(although there are many great westerns with a good amount of dialogue in them). This is a very visual film, it's a film that has everything- it's a film that symbolizes the very foundation of why we love to watch movies. This film will draw you in in a way that you've never been drawn into a film before. Probably one of the most underrated films of all time, everyone should see this movie and experience it's magic for themselves. You cannot go wrong with this movie.",Once Upon a Time in the West

174,noahgibbobaker,"Gud, it gud",8,7 June 2021,"'Once Upon a Time in the West' - A human story of humans defined by violence rather than a story of humans defined by violence, near everything reinforces this; native Americans often depicted as brutes are actual people, struggling people robbed of everything by American development. People die left and right with consequence. And the score features the most human thing of all as a motif for humanity in the midst of the mindless violence and pointless death... The voice.Human voices had been used in western scores before, by Ennio Morricone too, but never with such purpose to accentuate humanity in an inhumane world. In itself using singing in this way is another subversion of a typical western.",Once Upon a Time in the West
175,fimimix,"..a ""10"" for the cinematography..",10,3 October 2007,"Had I seen the very beginning of ""Once upon a Time in the West,"" I suppose it would have been less difficult me to try to figure-out the plot of Sergio Leone's and Bertolucci's film. I had heard several good remarks about this movie and was looking forward to seeing it. I just lucked-up by TCM's presentation of it. Although I appreciate the fact that it shows just how brutally girtty ""The Old West"" was, to me, it could have moved-along a lot faster.BECAUSE I didn't see the very beginning, I had no idea why ""Frank"" (Henry Fonda) was killing so many people (from Morton's train)....took me a while to figure-out why he murdered the entire family. When I finally saw ""Harmonica"" (Charles Bronson), I couldn't relate to his attachment to the harmonica. Finally got that, too. I did not recognize Jason Robards (""Cheyenne"") because he was so scroungy-looking. And, his entrance into the film (with all the shooting and noise outside of that tacky ""saloon""), with him entering in handcuffs, completely threw me.I never could tell one ""gang"" from the other.....I couldn't understsand just when in the movie - except after ""Harmonica"" roped-off the station - so many men were working on the railroad, and where they came from. It was a mystery to me why ""Harmonica"" was working so hard to make a railroad-station for ""Jill McBain"" (Cardinale), because there had been no romantic nor friendly connection between them. MY impression of Cardinale's arrival was as the mother of the children who were murdered; after all one son said ""my mother died 7 years ago"".Yes, I thought the movie was wonderful, but wanted it to keep to a line of plot, rather than jumping-around so much. Kudos for all you folk who truly idolized this movie. Maybe I need to see it again.",Once Upon a Time in the West
176,illbebackreviews,To make a masterpiece 2 years after another masterpiece tells us that Leone was a masterful director!,9,20 May 2013,"Before watching this film, I was concerned whether or not this film would please, despite the undying praise given to this film. This is not just because Leone made a masterpiece 2 years before but also due to the fact that he was set to retire from Spaghetti Westerns before reluctantly making this film. Now that I've seen it, Sergio Leone simply made the right choice in continuing with Spaghetti Western film making! The story revolves around a young woman named Jill McBain who was driven to a town where she finds her family slaughtered by a man named Frank. During this time, a mysterious man playing a harmonica is found as well as another man named Cheyeene who must join forces to save the girl's life from Frank's assassination attempts as a ploy to get the woman's land.Much like 'The Good, the bad and the Ugly', this is an extremely moving and epic tale told in the grandest of fashions to the very best of one's ability. The characters in this film are truly memorable as is the brilliant musical score composed by Ennio Morricone who simply outdoes himself with these films. The performances throughout the film are brilliant and the fantastic cinematography, writing and directing are flawless! Whilst The Good the bad and the Ugly had three of the most memorable characters (Blondie, Angel Eyes and Tucco), so does this film in having Frank, Cheyeene and nicknamed ""Harmonica"" who closely resemble the characters from Leone's previous masterpiece. These characters are extremely intense, entertaining even hilarious at times and most definitely great examples of fantastic characters in films. Frank, played by Henry Fonda, plays the antagonist in the film who must try o either kill Jill and take the land for his boss or to convince her to give it up. He has an absolutely fantastic scene in the film where we are introduced to him just as he viciously kills a young boy. This scene alone simply strikes a threatening image in our mind as to who this guy is and what he is like. Cheyeene is the extremely likable guy who throughout the film can be both dangerous and helpful certainly for Jill. His character is an iconic Western image right up there with Eastwood's character from the Dollars trilogy. Harmonica is the best character in the film who throughout the film keeps a cool head and plays a harmonica. In one scene, in the dark, Jill hears him playing his harmonica and attempts to gun him down and she only realizes he fails when she hears the music once more! That was another memorable scene in the film Full of fantastic directorial moments and a great script, the performances in this film are rich especially by Henry Fonda who literally becomes another person for this film. As do Jason Robards in a brilliant performance as Cheyeene. Charles Bronson delivers yet another one of the most memorable performances as Harmonica. The rest of the supporting cast all do a great job making the performances in this film are outstanding Ennio Morricone is a large reason as to why Sergio Leone's Westerns work to the extent they have. This musical score is the same in the fact that it is simply such an iconic piece of music that throughout the film perfectly resembles the tone of each scene.Simply to say, Once Upon a Time in the West is an absolute masterpiece of a film that will remain one of Leone's best. I have no complaints with the movie that if I were to pick a bad part, I would only be able to say that it isn't quite as brilliant as 'The Good the bad and the Ugly'",Once Upon a Time in the West
177,alfiefamily,Wonderful acting and flashy camrerawork make this picture...,7,20 November 2004,"But I would hardly say that this is one of the best pictures ever made.I liked this film very much, but I'm not a huge fan, as almost all of the other posters on this site seem to be.Leone does a wonderful job of focusing on the characters and using his camera to set a wonderful mood to the film. I think that all three of the male leads are excellent. And despite what some have said, I believe it is one of Fonda's best pieces of work. In my opinion it's the last excellent performance of his career. You can feel how tired and beaten Jason Robards is by looking at his hang-dog expression.I know that Leone had great affection for the American western, and he wanted to acknowledge as many great western films as he could by adding little hints during the movie. I thought this was a great idea and made the film even more interesting to watch.I think my favorite scene is the one in the beginning at the station. The lack of music, and just hearing the normal sounds really helped to build this scene into a classic.But I did not think much of the Claudia Cardinale role of Jill. While she is quite the central figure, we really don't learn too much about her. And I don't believe Cardinale was right for the roll.Overall, a very good film that I would like to see again, and maybe it is a classic western, but still a little unsatisfying.7 out of 10",Once Upon a Time in the West
178,dumsumdumfai,killer opening,10,10 September 2008,"It would have been even more classic without the few opening lines and just have pure sound effects only. But that is sooon forgotten with the sweaky metal sound and the water dripping. This is the most memorable opening in any movie for me. And talking about looks can kill, Jack Elam and the bald guy alone have the goods. The fly sequence is just as tense as it is annoying. You want jack to just shoot the thing!the stunner for me is after the opening gun sling, Bronson goes down! and the sequence of cuts leads you to believe Bronson was the little kid. What a trick that is.The score in this film does most of the talking and dramatic development. Henry Fonda's cool villain stare is refreshing. Not sure about Jason's role but the plot is already complicated enough - gets a lighter sub theme song. Bronson gets the spin-chilling loner score. And Claudia's operatic strong woman sub theme makes the entire thing super melodramatic - that is until the acting calms everything down.with scenes like that who cares about the ending!",Once Upon a Time in the West
179,paudie,The classic Western it sets out to be,8,5 January 2011,"Everything about this film indicates that Leone set out to make a masterpiece. Having set the bar so high for himself it is even more remarkable that he has succeeded. The slow pacing, Monument Valley setting, typical Morricone score and all star cast are testament to how memorable he wants this film to be. You can picture him poring over each detail of every scene, even before shooting any footage.The story is a familiar Western tale of a railway baron trying to get his hands on the land he needs by hook or by crook. Unfortunately for him his chief henchman has not bargained on a figure from his past returning to wreak long awaited revenge.As the plot advances Leone treats us to a series of set pieces, with plenty of lingering looks, unspoken hatred and usually a dramatic and violent conclusion.The coup de grace is the casting of Henry Fonda, so often the good guy in his movies, as the black-hearted henchman who clearly loves his job. Claudia Cardinale, Charles Bronson and Jason Robards are all excellent.There isn't much point in going into much more detail in a mere review. The only way to appreciate this film is to set aside about three hours, draw the curtains and let Leone transport you to his vision of the coming of the railways to the West.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Violent and intense start of the movie promised a great things and fulfilled every one of it. As we are more and more drawn into a characters stories and purposes plot gets way twistier. Now things are starting to get serious and Harmonica starts to really take his place as main focus. Frank and Mr. Morton are the guys responsible for all trouble and they are trying to kill Jill as she is the only one left but in all that Harmonica and Cheyenne are determined to keep them away. In magnificent turnout of things comes the brilliant ending. Cheyenne is returning obviously wounded, Harmonica is waiting for Frank and Jill is seemingly worried about everything. Cheyenne went to train and had a great shootout with Mr. Morton and Frank has come and gets ready for duel with Harmonica. Jill is shaken while Frank tries to realize why Harmonica wants to meet him. In shootout we realize he couldn't save his brother and only thing left to him by Frank was harmonica. As Frank dies he got same harmonica back. Amazing turnout of events left with great ending. Claudia Cardinale as Jill is absolutely amazing, as she is beautiful, charming but at the same doesn't hide what she really is temptress and prostitute. Fonda as Frank is powerful, leader that is not afraid of anything and cold blooded murderer. Bronson as Harmonica was incredible, as he is quiet but dangerous, calm and in seeking revenge shows that he cares for things being right. Some absolutely incredible scenery and amazing directing of the movie. Music was probably one of the best ever in western movies as it has some weight but also creates all sort of emotions and creates amazing situations feelings. 4/4",Once Upon a Time in the West
182,Sonatine97,Henry Fonda's best ever role!,8,20 June 2000,"It's already been said by other reviews on this page as to how a true masterpiece, ""..West"" really is. So rather than add to the adjectives I will comment on the major factors of the film.Charles Bronson, a very underrated actor I feel; alarmingly underused by silly egotistic directors who feel he has only one character to offer - the vigilante!The ""...West"" was his shining beacon in his film career. A part that perfectly matched his personnae, as the man with that expressive face & threatening grin; a man of few words but lots of intentions.Clint Eastwood simply wouldn't have been the right choice. The ""..West"" is a true Italian operetta, while the 3 Dollar films were little more than Italian filling. I especially hate it when people associate ""...West"" with the Dollar films, even more so when they use ""spaghetti western"", such a derogatory term for a piece of cinematic art.Jason Robards, almost overlooked in the film by the two main protagonists. Robards, plays Cheyenne, a decent kind of cowboy with a few rough edges and an air of menace when required. He is perhaps the light relief in this film, which is a masterstroke by Leone. The film builds up so much tension there doesn't seem to be anywhere to let off a little steam and give the audience a respite.Claudia Cardinale, as Jill McBain, the widow of the wealthy landowner, Henry Fonda so ruthlessly gunned down, along with the rest of her family. Here she plays her part with so much power & dignity that for me, its her best film. Leone doesn't just regard her as some kind of dumb doll; instead she is perhaps the fulcrum to the whole story and carries that burden of responsibility well, especially when faced with all three male stars.Sergio Leone. Without question, and regardless of what he may have privately felt about this film, ""...West"" is his most perfect film of all. There is nothing...nothing at fault here, apart from the film company hacking the length of the movie down from around 3 hours down to just under 2 in some prints!!Leone had a good foundation with the Dollar movies, but with the added writing from  Dario Argento (yes, that one, of Suspiria fame!) and Bernardo Bertolucci, this film becomes more than just a western!In addition to the script the cinematograpy is simply awesome, especially in widescreen; his clever use of lighting & shadow is so intricate that if you blink you'd miss something.  And of course the (in)famous long silences between dialogue only adds, not distracts, from the enthralling ballet!Ennio Morricone a master of the film score; too many to mention, all of them excellent in their own right. But only ""..West"" gave him so much gravitas that you felt the music was like an invisible character on a par with Fonda or Bronson. In fact I have the main title from the film playing as  I write this, and I feel so lifted by the sweeping power & emotion each note unravels!And finally....Henry Fonda!A lot of the die-hard Fonda fans hated this film, or more specifically, Fonda for playing such a cold blooded killer. For years they had seen him appear as the hero, the do-gooder, as Mr Right. But now he chooses to be the Devil, and they didn't like it.But ignoring that, I have to say that this is without doubt Fonda's crowning moment, including On Golden Pond & 12 Angry Men.For a film star of his stature to decide to go against  the grain and play a baddie...and God, WHAT A BADDIE!!! showed, great credit on his behalf to go against his adoring fans and play against type for a change.I have to say, and I hope the IMDb guidelines will let me off just once here, but...Fonda's portrayal of Frank has to be seen to be believed. Never have I seen such a sadistic, uncaring, cold hearted son of a bitch in all my movie life. This man is pure evil, without question. Those blue eyes hide a black soul and he really doesn't care about anyone, young or old, male or female.Of course his first entrance in the film, dressed all in black and about to shoot a 9 year old boy, has similar parallels to that of the black dressed Darth Vader from Star Wars. But I'm convinced even he would run a mile if confronted by Fonda!Once Upon A Time in the West, is the best ""western"" of all time, only Unforgiven, comes close. Even if you're not keen on westerns you really should take a look at this, if only for the music & the pure majesty of the camera's eye!!

183,Brogan,The best Western of all time.,10,20 November 2002,"I didn't originally care much of any Western genre films.  It wasn't until I sat down and watched all of Clint Eastwood's masterpiece, UNFORGIVEN, when it first came out, that I began to discover what a excellent genre the Western films were.  I saw that at the end of the film that Eastwood dedicated UNFORGIVEN to ""Sergio (Leone) and Don (Siegal)."" I then watched and began falling in love with Sergio Leone's films, FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, THE GOOD THE BAD & THE UGLY, FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE, etc.  But it wasn't until I watched ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, did I realize I found my favorite Western. To me, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is not only my favorite Sergio Leone film, but my favorite Western of all time.  It has the most original characters, a very well done story, fantastic direction, and the most beautiful score of all time.  For me, WEST is the achievement of Leone's career, it was the only Western film Leone directed that was actually shot in America, at Mounument Valley, the location of several of John Ford westerns. I find all of the characters in WEST to be original and different. Jill (Claudia Cardinale), the prostitute who is settling down for a new life until she finds out her husband, Brett McBain (Frank Wolff) and his children were murdered.  Cheyenne (Jason Robards) the outlaw who actually has a good soul inside of him that loves Jill and does whatever he can to help her. Harmonica (Charles Bronson) the man who expresses his vengence and pain by playing the harmonica , but is also very quick with his gun.  Then there's Frank (Henry Fonda), my favorite role in Fonda's career as well as my favorite villian of all time.  A villian so cold and vicious, a man who uses witty remarks and shows his evil personality by killing anyone who get in his way.  But it's not just Frank with the witty remarks, but also Harmonica and Cheyenne give some memorable lines as well. The story, written by Leone, shows the talented director use of creativity. The story was also co-written by Dario Argento, who would later become a legend himself the Italian horror genre, notably with SUSPIRIA. And co-written by Bernardo Bertolucci, who has done directed modern Italian neo-realism films like THE CONFORMIST, 1900, and THE LAST EMPEROR.Then there is Enni Morricone's score.  The most beautiful and moving score I have ever heard.  Morricone using a different musical insturment to identify each of the major characters.  Jill has the string instruments. Harmonica, naturally has the Harmonica.  Frank has the electric guitar. And Cheyenne has the banjo.  The score of ""Man With Harmonica"" is very popular and influental that it was recently be redone with a techno dance score and even played on a recent episode of THE SOPRANOS.  But it's the actual theme for the movie, that has become a modern classic, that the song is being played at weddings replacing ""Here Comes the Bride"" or ""Cannon In D.""  If you heard the theme of WEST, you would understand why.  Everytime I hear the theme, tears are still coming out of my eyes.  The musical score, is without a doubt the best score ever written! Then there is the visuals of the film, the way Leone shot and edits the film.  The intense opening scene where three of Frank's men (Jack Elam, Woody Strode, and Al Mulock)are patiently waiting for Harmonica to show up. Elam traps a fly in the barrel of his pistol and listens to it buzz; Strode has drops of water cumulative add on his hat; Mulock cracks his knuckles. Then the showdown between the three of them against Harmonica.  The first scene where Fonda's character is seen.  The scene when Jill arrives in Flagstone, and rides the horse carrige through the scenery of Monument Valley.  The revealing of why Harmonica is given his name, and how he acquired the instrument. I know people will argue with me about the best Western film. UNFORGIVEN, THE WILD BUNCH, THE GOOD THE BAD & THE UGLY, BUTCH CASSIDY & THE SUNDANCE KID, THE SEARCHERS, STAGECOACH (1939), SHANE, FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, HIGH NOON, THE OX-BOW INCIDENT, RIO BRAVO, MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, and even BLAZING SADDLES are all excellent Westerns that many will considered to be their favorites.  But none of those westerns has the look, mood, and feeling that ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST has.  It's those elements that are inside WEST that gives it it's soul.  And this Western has one of the most powerful souls ever put on film. Sergio Leone will be remembered for FISTFUL OF DOLLARS since it was his first successful box office hit, and THE GOOD THE BAD & THE UGLY because it's his most popular.  But people should remember Leone's work with ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST.  The ""true"" wester epic of his career.  If you should catch ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, please see it the way it was ment to be seen, in it's widescreen format, or letterboxed. And please catch the full 165 minute version, not the butchered 145 minute version. Or better yet, if it's playing at a cinema house near by, then catch it there!  This is a masterpiece, and I am so pleased to see that as the years go by, WEST is becomming more loved and is the second favorite Western on the Internet Movie Database list.  I just hope as the more years go by, that it will be number one.  At least it's seen as a classic, and after watching all of it, you can understand why.  Please, whenever this film is on Turner Classic Movie, or any pay per-view movie channels, sit down and watch this classic. I hope Paramount Pictures will understand how many people love this film and will finally release it on DVD.  Hopefully it will be soon.  Don't miss this movie, please see it! ***** (out of five) ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!",Once Upon a Time in the West
184,Hancock_the_Superb,"""Yes, yes, it will be magical!"" - Dib, ""Invader Zim"" **Spoilers to the plot**",10,11 July 2002,"Wow.  That's what I have to say.   In my review of ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"" (if it gets posted), I've already commented upon Sergio Leone's films and their look and feel. This is my second favorite film ever.   (*SPOILERS*) The film takes a very simple plot - settlers vs. the railroad - and twists it in all sorts of directions.  Leone (and Ennio Morricone) create an unforgetable atmosphere with the authentic guns, trains, and leather dusters.  The creaking wind mill in the opening scene is a brilliant touch.   I would believe that this was meant by Leone to be a pastiche of the American westerns.  All the stereotypes are there - the good-hearted prostitute, the lone, silent hero, the scraggly, helpful outlaw, the man in black who mows down innocent families.  Leone gives nods to dozens of Westerns, including ""Rio Bravo"", ""High Noon"" (in the opening scene and the shootout in Flagstone between Frank and his men), ""Jubal"", ""Shane"", ""The Searchers"", ""Fort Apache"" (Henry Fonda as the bad guy), ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Vallance"", ""How The West Was Won"" - and yet, it is shockingly original.  Nothing is as it seems.   The plot contains a ghost story, superb performances, Morricone's haunting theme, and some of the best shootouts ever filmed.  The final scene is haunting and touching at the same time.  Fonda isn't really as shocking as you'd expect him to be, but he's good.  Charles Bronson rehearses his role as the vigilante in the ""Death Wish"" films, among others.  Jason Robards was never an A-List actor, but his performance as Cheyenne is superb.  Claudia Cardinale is beautiful and extremely tanlented, as she shows here in the difficult role of Jill McBain.   Cameos by Western veterans Jack Elam, Woody Strode, and Keenan Wynn (along with Lionel Stander) are enjoyable as well.  Gabrielle Ferzetti is also notable as Mr. Morton, the railroad tycoon.   This was to be Leone's last Western, but the studios pressed him to make the disappointing (by his standards) ""A Fistful of Dynamite"" before finally commencing work on his magnum opus, ""Once Upon A Time In America"". Nonetheless, this is a superb film.  What more needs to be said?   ""I saw three of these dusters a short time ago, they were waiting for a train.  Inside these three dusters were three men.  And inside the men were three bullets."" - Harmonica",Once Upon a Time in the West
185,manendra-lodhi,"""Words cannot describe the style""",9,17 March 2013,"The king of the Spaghetti Western delivers his film with a punch in every style in the film. The story is again the same revenge based but need anyone think it to be a negative point when it comes to leone? The thing in the screenplay and the execution which makes the film more exciting till the end is that I just pondered all the time about the characters. They are so mysterious. From the middle things start to become clear. Till then the way characters are established is going to be memorable forever. The opening sequence which has the 'wait' is one of the best sequences in the film. With his tight close ups and slow reactions of the character, I never felt if the movie was going slow. Add to that, the intricate music by morricone and we get a hell of a cinema. The story again involves three main characters.

For that reason only, it is flawed. It drags at times, and it took me several days to finish it.

187,kurciasbezdalas,The dark western,10,11 November 2008,"I've seen Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and A Fistful of Dollars and this film appeared much darker to me. And that's what's good about it. Previous films (especialy The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) were more comical sometimes but this film was made in more darker theme. I was impressed by Charles Bronson's performance, I used to see him in movies like Death Wish but this role was probably the best his performance, now I realized what a charismatic actor he is. I liked his character very much. Every time when you hear him playing that creepy melody with his harmonica, you know that it's a bad news for someone. I also was impressed by Claudia Cardinale's acting, at first I thought that she get that role only for good-looking but later turn out that she's a good actress too, it's funny, that I newer heard of her before, I should check out her other movies. Jason Robards glinted in some scenes too, especially in first dialog between his character and Claudia Cardinale's character. And it would be really unfair to make no reference on Henry Fonda who was playing a bad guy, but he did it so well, that sometimes I wasn't sure which side am I on.",Once Upon a Time in the West
188,son_of_cheese_messiah,"Strong on visuals, weak on story",4,7 December 2010,"The magnificent opening set piece -surely one of the greatest in the history of cinema- promises a masterpiece. Alas this promise is never realised and the film descends into rambling, long-winded and often confusing sequences, usually visually stunning in themselves, but containing huge leaps both in logic and time.There is much that is left unanswered by the end of the film and what explanations there are often are unsatisfactory. It barely seems plausible, to take a small example, that the newly arrived wife would choose to stay alone in a deserted cottage knowing her family has just been murdered there and that the murderers were still on the prowl, both in terms of her safety and the sheer morbidity of it. I get the impression that Sergio Leone cobbled together this rather ropey story around a few set pieces he had in mind and used his considerable cinematic artistry to try to hide the plot holes.There are too numerous head-scratching moments to mention but one of the most notable involves Jason Robards as Cheyenne. He escapes (offscreen) apparently by murdering his prison guard? Its not too clear. This homicidal tendency then disappears and he becomes a kindly figure. Later he allows himself to be handed in by Bronson for $5,000 although we never discover what he is wanted for, presumably a serious crime? Again, off screen, he escapes from captivity. I presume we are not shown this since it would involve the killing of law men? Or maybe the film was already WAY too long? Then he seems to be pursuing the widow. Bronson leaves, then he leaves? Then he and Bronson are riding off together and he just falls down and dies of a wound that has not been mentioned till that point?Worth watching for a few great set pieces. But the narrative's all over the place.",Once Upon a Time in the West
189,peeedeee-94281,A Reasonably Good Western For Non-Fans of Westerns,6,29 November 2019,"I will admit I don't watch too many westerns, at least not the old ones. I've seen many of the later ones, The Unforgiven, Quick & The Dead, Quigley Down Under (although set in Australia), etc...
I thought this was a reasonably good movie, albeit a bit long in places. Like the wait at the train station. I get it, it's the title sequence. But it felt like it dragged a bit too long.
McBain's wife and her motivations were confusing. So we learn of her history, where she came from. She's a city girl who comes to the area, but why does she insist on staying. It doesn't sound like she even had any idea how to live out in the middle of the desert, but she chooses to stay. The only reason she appears to want to leave later in the movie was due to pressure from her husband's killer. I couldn't figure out why she was necessary to be in the film other than to be some eye candy to tantalize all the men, including her husband's character Frank. There is even a confusing 'love' scene between her and Henry Fonda (Frank). I guess it was to stay alive, but it seemed way too romantic to look like she was going through the motions to save her life. I expected her to be a tough woman, shooting at bandits and such, but she was just another maiden in distress.
Charles Bronson's character was alright. His character seemed underdeveloped. The harmonica motif got tiresome after a while, even when you learned about why he had it, later in the movie. He just seemed to be there to show off his weathered face and squinty stare, little emotional range. Even at the end, when he got his satisfaction, there was little reaction from him. Jason Robard's and Henry Fonda's characters seemed more developed, much more interesting.
The story itself felt cliched and generic. I don't know if this was typical of most western movies. I remember watching Shane a week or so earlier, and it had a similar plot: Wealthy land owner wants to buy someone's property, but they refuse to budge. So people die, and it's up to the stranger in town to save the day. In this case, there was more than one 'stranger' to help out.
The musical cues were nice, but as pointed out, the harmonica to announce Bronson's entrance, and other repeated musical cues were a bit much by the third time they were used. Usually there's more variation in musical scores, I guess Leone and Morricone wanted the exact same sound for each character.
Overall, a reasonably good movie for anyone who isn't necessarily a fan of the Western genre. With some judicious editing, it could be a much more interesting film. I found myself watching it in pieces over 3 or 4 days. I couldn't imagine trying to sit through the whole thing in one sitting.",Once Upon a Time in the West
190,aleksanderk-95350,Wild West,8,21 June 2021,Amazing film with wonderful acting. The film is very slow paced with long scenes. It does not get boring though and stays entertaining. Which is a very challenging thing to do. The acting mainly keeps it exciting and interesting. An amazing performance from Henry Fonda. Who does an excellent job at being a sinister evil gunslinger. Charles Bronson is great as well creating a mysterious persona.,Once Upon a Time in the West
191,freaky_dave,Another epic western from Sergio Leone,10,12 February 2007,"I never thought Leone could ever top The Good The Bad The Ugly, one of his greatest works, but with Once Upon A Time In The West he comes really close.Once Upon A Time In The West (I'll just call it The West for this review) tells the tale of Jil McBain(Claudia Cardinale)who comes from New Orleans to be with her husband in the west. Once she gets there she discovers she has been widowed because her husband and his entire family have been wiped out by a ruthless assassin named Frank(Henry Fonda). The land, which was owned by her late husband, was going to be used to build a railroad station which would've made them all rich. However Frank and a railroad baron named Morton (Gabrielle Ferzetti) have there own plans for getting rich the same way and that's why Morton had Frank kill them. Neither one of them knew about Jil though, and soon their vile plans turn on her.However there is one man (Charles Bronson) who plays a harmonica and steps in to keep her safe. With the help of a desperado named Cheyenne (Jason Robards) they work to protect her from the evil clutches of Frank and Morton. Harmonica however has other reasons for wanting Frank dead, and it is left as a guessing game up to the end when we finally discover the real reason why Harmonica was after Frank in the first place.Just like with The Good The Bad The Ugly, Leone uses extreme closeups of peoples faces as well as wide long shots of large opened settings to tell a wonderful story about the west. With TGTBTU he told a story during Civil War times, but with this movie he talks about the time period when railroads were being created to stretch across the country.The acting in this film was phenomenal. I loved the expanded shots of the characters which said more than any words could ever say. Don't get me wrong though. The West had a lot of interesting dialoque which helped embellish the characters flaws and behaviors even more.The movie is long, as was TGTBTU, but like that earlier film, this one never becomes boring either. If I were to compare the two films and make a choice, I would say that both were great movies. However TGTBTU would edge out The West as the better movie.",Once Upon a Time in the West
192,karl_consiglio,A Long Art Western,8,4 November 2006,"A magnificent, dense, sometimes angry, exhausting film about the end of the West or the western for that matter. Its about the arrival of the railroad and the decline of the old ways. We got Fonda, the killer for hire with business ambitions, we got a noble bandit framed by Frank's(Fonda) men, Harmonica Charles Bronson, the enigmatic gunfighter seeking revenge and Jill, the New Orleans reformed prostitute, heiress to The McBain family farm and thorn in the side of the railway company. The real subject of the movie is other westerns. This is a film that proves the impossibility of the western surviving the screen and brings it all to a lovely and noble end. All the characters in the movie are western archetypes, they all have there own Morricone background music and they speak in lines from previous westerns, and they move in slow, stylized sequences through a conspicuous cinematic landscape. Its a kaleidoscopic view of all American westerns put together, done successfully.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Leone's masterful storytelling and Morricone's crazy, beautiful, epic soundtrack; desperate, haunted faces which look like the barren landscapes the story is set in and a plot that unfolds with impeccable pacing to culminate in THE ultimate western finale.As in Leone's previous films, music isn't just used to add to the atmosphere but is essential to the story, or perhaps even more: Morricone's main musical theme plays the actual role of a (or rather: the) protagonist in the film. Anyone who thought that the so called ""Spaghetti westerns"" were nothing but cheap, violent B-movies had to reconsider after seeing this film. It doesn't get any better than this: this is movie history; iconic, classic, unforgettable, epic.

194,JaydoDre,Contester for the best Spaghetti Western?,8,30 January 2015,"This movie has some of the best atmosphere. The sets are wonderful, with so much detail. There are panning shots of rooms that clearly show the whole room as an actual location and absolutely filled with stuff. The towns look real and lively. The camera pans are used to a great effect. This film goes far to build up its tension and atmosphere. It would not be too much to say that it is its most distinguishing feature.Moreover, the cinematography is smart, like there is a scene of a person drinking from a bottle, thereby raising his hands and showing that they are in handcuffs. That is smart writing right there.Ennio Morricone is responsible for the music, as with most Sergio Leone's Westerns. He brings a good variety of noticeable tunes. There are emotional strings mixed with a choir or a female solo, and of course the main star is the iconic dramatic harmonica theme of the main protagonist that gets mixed with a menacing guitar. Music in this movie is definitely not part of the background.One of the most interesting actors is Jason Robards (I had to check twice it wasn't ""Roberts"") as a gang leader. His high acting ability is mixed with a warm charisma. The main villain played by Henry Fonda is well acted but is a little plain. The protagonist is covered with the spaghetti part of the spaghetti western. His signature harmonica thing is cool but then he plays that same tune in situations that do not call for it. And of course he talks with the rim of his face covering his eyes. And of course he is mysterious and shoots perfectly.The main lady role is played by an Italian Claudia Cardinale's. You can read a lot off of her subtle facial expression changes. Unfortunately, this lady is rather clearly dubbed at times.There are also a few other characters who do not appear on screen for long but are nonetheless memorable.The dialogue is good. There is not much of it, but it is good and to the point.This Sergio Leone's film was a memorable one, with many interesting characters, unique musical score and good tension.",Once Upon a Time in the West
195,Artimidor,"Cinematic paradise, made for the history books",10,24 December 2011,"""Here's looking at you"" might be Humphrey Bogart's trademark slogan, but eyes in a Leone Spaghetti Western reveal much more emotions and even plot than Bogey ever could convey with his. Sergio Leone made extreme close-ups the dominant shots to explain character - and a look into Frank's eyes (played by Henry Fonda), who was deliberately cast against his usual character in ""Once Upon a Time in the Wild West"", makes it perfectly clear why. There's no need for lengthy dialog if a capable director can do so much more with style alone. And of all around brilliant visuals in Leone's Westerns there is no shortage, no doubt about that. If the widescreen scenery is as grand, deep and epic a director can even deliberately allow the weight of silence to descend on the viewer and let the image speak for itself.Once sound effects are added to compositions like these they become more than nice enhancements or mere fillers, they turn into characters themselves of a total work of art. An art that reaches even higher levels if you take Ennio Morricone's melancholic score into account which rounds off this rare masterpiece. Morricone delves deep into the souls of characters, makes whole landscapes tangible, even develops plot of the powerful story. Add to that a flawless cast (aside from Fonda Jason Robards, Claudia Cardinale, Charles Bronson and others star) and every lover of the moving picture is likely to be seriously moved. Or blown away if you haven't seen anything like this before. There are so many memorable shots in ""Once Upon a Time in the Wild West"" that one can stop counting them early on and take the whole thing as the ultimate template on how a great film should look like. Films like these are cinematic paradise, made for the history books, and every moment of it should be savored. Definitely one of the greatest.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Ennio Morricone's music fits this movie so perfectly. It creates a western-atmosphere that couldn't have been better. In fact, the great atmosphere is what this movie is all about.

201,jay4stein79-1,The Western as Rock Opera,10,5 March 2006,"I never acquired a taste for Sergio Leone's westerns. We're told to enjoy the Man with No Name trilogy, but, as artful as they are, I found them a bit dull. Clint Eastwood might command your attention now, but, frankly, his laconic nature left something to be desired in those films. Then I saw Once Upon a Time in the West, which might be the greatest western ever; if it's not, it's occupying the same plane as The Searchers, Red River, Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia, and the Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. What I think separates this film from The Good the Bad and the Ugly, Fistfull of Dollars, and For a Few Dollars More is, quite simply, its glee. With Once Upon... Leone and Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento are taking a p**s with the American western. Yeah those other three movies flipped the western myth around a little, but they did so seriously. I'm pretty sure Leone's tongue was firmly in his cheek with this one. How else can one explain the opening scene that draws on and on and on creating such tension that it infuriates us when the money shot never really arrives. The gunfight that ends that scene happens so quickly and we see so little that you're left wanting more bloodshed. And that's the wonderful point that this movie makes to its audience--you're bloodthirsty. But will Leone give you what you want? Not a chance. Bodies may pile up but the violence lacks gratuity and, really, blood. There are also several great performances in Once Upon... First, and most important, is the turn by Charles Bronson. He's, basically, the Clint Eastwood character, but about ten-times as charismatic. Then there's a terrific Jason Robards and a terrifying Henry Fonda. I'm always amazed watching that man act and this is among his greatest achievements if only because it goes so completely against type. We knew he could do noble (Grapes of Wrath and the Ox- Bow Incident) and humorous (The Lady Eve), but who knew he could also do evil? He's a slimy villain here and the perfect choice for the role, what with those icy blue eyes and loquaciousness (villains are invariably more frightening when they talk a lot). And, of course, one cannot forget Claudia Cardinale who deserves to be more widely known if not for her acting then for her unrivaled beauty. The plot itself is inconsequential--railroad men murder a family whose home lies in the path of steam engines; nameless gunfighters protect the family's new mother and the property from the railroadmen; some people die and some don't; the end. Once Upon a Time in the West is about interesting characters, great acting, and a lot of attitude. It's a great film.",Once Upon a Time in the West
202,atzimo,Art meets the West,10,21 February 2004,"'C'era una volta il West' is not an easy film to watch. Its pace is hypnotic and the story unfolds in a way that blurs the viewer rather than provide exposition.Saying that its not easy to watch, doesn't necessarily mean that the movie is not a great one. In fact OUATITW is probably the greatest art western ever made. I still believe that 'Unforgiven' is the greatest western story of all time, but this one is a joy to watch, for all its artistic endeavors.The casting is genius. Especially Henry Fonda. It takes a genius to see that Henry Fonda could play the ultimate bad guy. Bronson's movie career was defined by this movie and Claudia Cardinale is absolutely stunning.If you are a DVD enthusiast, the restoration of the movie will bring tears to your eyes.

Almost 3 hours long, Sergio Leone's ""masterpiece"" loses focus most of the time and doesn't seem to go in any particular direction.The scenes are way too long and most of them don't even create tension as better Leone films so greatly do. The haunting score by Morricone is good and Henry Fonda as the baddest cat in the west is also very intriguing. The movie is propelled by the motivation of Harmonica, which we always want to discover. That being said, the shootout between Fonda and Bronson is awesome, with flashbacks revealing the nature of Harmonica's motivations. But after that, the movie should have ended quickly, for it deserved a climactic ending, at least. But it doesn't, and it's just another 15 minutes (at least) of talking, talking and more talking!The Good the Bad and the Ugly is Leone's masterpiece.

205,Renaldo Matlin,THE GREATEST WESTERN EVER MADE,10,21 November 2003,"The first time I saw ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" I was about 14 and didn't really get it. I thought it was cool for sure, but also slow-moving and almost eccentric. Then I saw it again a couple of years later and I suddenly realized the pacing was part of what made it great and the ""eccentricity"" was beautiful story-lines, brilliant acting and last but not least: in-your-face first rate, high class, a cut above the rest, cool and classy dialogue.Then I didn't get a chance to see the movie for a couple of years, and all that time it lingered in the back of my mind. The scenes, the composition of the cinematography and the music haunted me, the hair on my arms stood up just thinking about the evocative beauty of the film, and finally when I got the chance to see it for the third time: POW! It finally emerged, dawned on me that this wasn't just Sergio Leone's greatest film ever, it was the best western movie ever made!John Ford, Anthony Mann and Howard Hawks will have to forgive me, but Sergio Leone really plays like a ""Best of Western"", a ""Greatest Hits"" collection of everything that makes a good western great. And since this is what Leone originally intended with his movie it is quite amazing to realize that he managed to full-fill this dream to such an impossible degree. His second greatest western, ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is wonderful, and truly one of the coolest additions to the genre, but as you grow up ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is the mother of them all, a mature tribute told with a beauty and grace that would have most masterpieces pale in comparison.And since I'm not alone telling people that ONE MISERABLE VIEWING IS NOT ENOUGH, it is apparent that the movie is like fine wine that only gets better with age. See it again. And then see it again. When you've seen it again, you go and see it again. And see it in all it's wide-screen glory, the way it was intended. Then let the movie play in the back of your mind for a couple of years, then see it again and look back on your first reaction with shame. I feel this so strongly that I won't even bother getting into a discussion on the film unless they have seen it at least three times (and I do not mean back-to-back on the same night, don't force yourself, let the movie come to you)!The way this revenge-story develops into a moving showdown between the old and the new west, and how it leads to the most gripping show-down in the history of movies gives me goose bumps just thinking about it. And the music... oh the music... With the movie Leone turns a standard western-plot into an original masterpiece almost singlehandedly through stunning visuals - the wide-screen shots are enough to take your breath away - and the film-maker's talent for resting just long enough with each of his captivating frame before moving on to the next will blow your mind. The way he mixes the art of moving pictures with entertainment is so impressive it will leave you in dumb-struck. Unlike in ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" here EVERY character - not just the ones in the title - have become legends.Anyone who has seen the film can never forget it's brilliant, long opening sequence with the three gunmen waiting for the train to arrive, a wind-mill moving slowly in the background. Jack Elam trying not to pay notice of the fly bugging him, Woody Strode in all his beautiful glory just standing there - collecting water in his hat - looking mean. All the time Ennio Morricone's legendary music luring patiently in the background, and then suddenly... the train is heard approaching... the scene is every bit amusing as it is terrifying.Originally Leone wanted Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef from ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" to play the gunmen in this scene. Leone wanted to show the world that he had matured as a film-maker, and wanted to get rid of the past in a wonderful way that sadly never was to be (Eastwood was away working on another project). That sums it up doesn't it? When even Leone himself felt the other three movies was just a mere warm-up to this one. But sadly ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" would flop at the box office, and only slowly getting the recognition it so highly deserved, whether it be through filmmakers like Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino acknowledging how much the movie influenced them, or just through normal movie-buffs discovering all it's glory and splendor over time. Remember, even movies like ""Vertigo"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"" weren't considered box-office hits in it's days, it took time, and now it's about high time some so-called movie-lovers get their head out of the sand and realize what they have missed, now that it is finally out on DVD in exhilarating, crisp picture quality.I could keep on using words like mesmerizing, breathtaking, spellbinding, enchanting, but when push comes to shove this is one of those few movies where words don't do it justice, just EXPERIENCE it.",Once Upon a Time in the West

209,Kubris,Once Upon a Time...,9,25 June 2011,"IMDb Top 250: 20Sergio Leone's western epic 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is arguably the best western ever made. But it's not for everyone- if the Good the Bad and the Ugly is a firework (and it's not) this is a slow-burning cigar. Leone takes his time to let things play out, and lets the music do the talking instead of voices.As usual, the soundtrack is incredible, arguably perfect. In a film with such little dialogue, the music has far more responsibility. Each major character has a theme, expressed through a tune. Each is great. I believe the best music occurs when Frank rides towards Harmonica at the end. Very emotional.The dialogue, while few and far in between, is excellent. They are delivered well, but more on that later. But the content is fantastic. One example is the ""three dusters"" bit said by Harmonica. Also, one line in particular has the most mind-blowing foreshadowing that I didn't realise until I had finished the film. I won't spoil it.This is a 3 parts + 1 movie. Two of the actors play badasses, and being a badass doesn't warrant extra-special acting. Then there's Frank, played by the iconic Henry Fonda. I've never seen a Henry Fonda movie: only through the IMDb did I learn of his good-guy reputation. But look at the guy: he just looks like a saint. Like Jimmy Stewart. He cannot be bad. But he is. He's evil. Which makes his acting exceptional. A gripe though is that viewers see two explicit actions of evil, one early and the other a flashback. I think it would've been beneficial to see another example, somewhere towards the middle-end of the film. That being said, he's a highlight.There's some exceptional lighting done here, especially in scenes with Harmonica, like in the dark at the bar.Lastly, the plot. Once Upon a Time is about the end of the West, but the story revolves around Jill's arrival. The plot trots, with occasional action scenes, but the pacing is deliberately stop-start. There are a few big revelations, and the ending is very fitting. However, the viewer has to do some thinking. I intently watched the film, and I still missed things. Once Upon a Time demands a second viewing to fully understand the film.Once Upon a Time is an iconic and memorable Western. So many things are right, and nothing is outstandingly wrong. Personally, I didn't like it as much as the Good, the Bad and the Ugly, but this is an epic not to be missed. 9.2/10",Once Upon a Time in the West
210,joelgodinho,"""Looks like we're shy one horse""",9,24 December 2020,"Once Upon A Time In The West is a 1968 Western directed by Sergio Leone and starring Henry Fonda, Claudia Cardinale and Charles Bronson.This is easily my favourite Leone film that I have watched so far, and possibly my second favourite Western as well, behind only John Ford's The Searchers.The cast is incredible, Henry Fonda plays the ruthless villain Frank perfectly in one of his best performances ever, Charles Bronson is great as Harmonica in what may be his best performance, or at least his most memourable, and Claudia Cardinale, Gabriele Ferzetti and particularly Jason Robards are also really great.The film is incredibly suspenseful with really great action sequences particularly the beginning (which is one of my favourite beginnings ever) and the ending.The score is magnificent and in my opinion Morricone's second best.9.8/10",Once Upon a Time in the West
211,widescreenguy,such a haunting theme,8,15 January 2007,"thank goodness for IMDb !!! I remember over the years that echoing mournful theme song but since I missed this movie on first release I didn't make the connection, and it never played on television because of rights issues and the unusual length for the time.finally I bought it on DVD and there it was, that theme song that gave me flashbacks big time.then I finally knew what the interview with Jane Fonda was about where she described her recollections seeing her father Henry in the unusual role as archvillian, and another one with jack Elam about how it took all day to do the scene with the handgun and the fly.this is a remarkable western, despite some stretches of credibility.the railroad indeed was the thing that finally opened the west; it was the only way to move millions of tons of goods and tens of thousands of people over the long distances, wagon trains were too dangerous and got off the beaten path too easily and couldn't carry enough provisions. the railroad allowed in a symbiotic relationship, towns to be founded and flourish with mining, cattle herding and farming around them.and thus the premise of the movie, McBain is going to build a town right in front of the advancing railroad.the corruption, violence and greed depicted were certainly problems of the day considering the fortunes to be made. no different than today when a big factory is built and the land selected gains 20 times its normal value and those 'in the know' engage in speculation. or oil or mineral resources are discovered on land held by simpletons who mysteriously are murdered in a 'botched' robbery or some such nonsense. it does happen.the movie is so long I haven't seen it once yet without falling asleep which is not to be taken as a criticism, just that wailful haunting theme song gets to me ..... and it is close to 3 hours long.at least the good guy, in this case, the good girl wins in the end.gawd Claudia Cardinale is beautiful and still making films.",Once Upon a Time in the West
212,Dodger-9,Optimistic stuff,10,27 May 2000,"The trouble with many Westerns is they can be a pessimistic excuse for gunplay and bloodshed. Once Upon a Time in the West employs age-old gunfights and squinty eyed heroes out for vengeance, but to masterful effect. As with all Sergio Leone movies, this is best seen on the big screen as the wide screen vistas and stunning artistry ensure that the full impact of the movie pays off dividends when seen in its original format.The plot, in a nutshell, centres on land rights, the development of a railroad, a cold-blooded killer (Henry Fonda), a harmonica playing stranger (Charles Bronson) and a widow who is a lot more than just a gorgeous Old West bimbo (Claudia Cardinale). A must for film fans, not least because of the calibre of its creators. Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci and Leone are a tough act to follow. Little wonder few have topped this in the years since its release.Good soundtrack too by Ennio Morricone.",Once Upon a Time in the West
213,murtaza_mma,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A piquant cocktail of style and substance in equal parts,10,4 March 2010,"Once Upon a Time in the West (OUTW) is a piquant cocktail of style and substance in equal parts, potent enough to catapult the viewer into a whirlpool of incessant excitement transcending him beyond the usual realms of an adrenaline rush. Vintage Leone, OUTW is inarguably the best Western ever made and undoubtedly features amongst the very best works of cinema, period. Leone incredibly surpasses the brilliance of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (TGTBTU) with OUTW by blending his favorite theme of Greed with that of Revenge. The only thing that TGTBTU lacked was the presence of a strong female character and Leone more than makes up for it in OUTW. Its eccentric yet consummate plot revolves around a female protagonist, thereby revolutionizing the very tenets associated with the genre where machismo and chivalry had solely held sway, hitherto. OUTW is a juxtaposition of the lives of five individuals, viz. Harmonica - a mysterious stranger, Cheyenne – a notorious desperado, Frank – a ruthless assassin, Jill – a beautiful widow with an obscure past, and Morton – a railroad baron, whose motives inevitably make them cross each other's paths albeit through an act of fate. Henry Fonda is a revelation as the cold-blooded assassin, a portrayal that is remarkably contrasting to his usual 'good guy' on-screen image. He goes about his business with a sublime touch of feral grandeur that makes him equally chilling and fascinating as 'Frank'. Charles Bronson plays his part with utmost conviction and incredibly manages to conjure up an element of mystery in his portrayal that not only brings 'Harmonica' to life, but also gives it a very distinct identity despite Harmonica's conspicuous similarities with Eastwood's 'Man with no name'. The role of 'Cheyenne' is played with equal brilliance by Jason Robards. He has taken care of the various subtleties and nuances to such an extent that he perfectly fits into the shoes of notorious, yet likable, 'Cheyenne'. Claudia Cardinale is ravishing as the beautiful, yet vulnerable, 'Jill McBain'. She has fully justified the trust shown by Leone in casting her and by Bertolucci in penning down a strong feminine part in a Western. She truly entrances the viewers with her mystifying pulchritude and enigmatic charm. She meticulously highlights the flaws in Jill's character while also managing to depict the elements of tenacity and grit which represent the true spirit of femininity. Gabriele Ferzetti is quite effective in his cameo as the crippled railroad baron, 'Morton'. He suffers from the tuberculosis of bones and each passing day brings him closer to his end, thereby further intensifying his desperate urge to fulfill his far-fetched ambition of taking the railroad to the Atlantic. He truly represents a man worthy of achieving the impossible, unfortunately cut short by his haplessness. Despite the inhuman and unjust means adopted by him to fulfill his naked ambition, one finds it excruciatingly hard to derive pleasure from his perpetual plight and eventual doom. Contrary to the popular belief, the slow pace of the movie and laconism in dialogue pose no impediment to the viewing and in fact this deliberate pacing enormously adds to the detail and beauty of the movie, and also helps in brewing the desired level of tension before it is finally punctuated suddenly with quick bursts of action. Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography is vividly descriptive and has elements which have become his and Leone's trademarks like the extreme close-ups, the quick panning of the terrain, the rotating camera shots etc.The haunting score written yet again by the master composer, Ennio Morricone enhances the grandeur of the movie tenfold. If Leone's direction and Colli's cinematography are the backbone of the movie, then undoubtedly Morricone's plaintive score is its heart and soul. The surreal score has shades of melancholy, intrigue, and romance that become more obvious with each passing moment. The music features leitmotifs (a melodic phrase that accompanies the reappearance of a character) that relate to each of the main characters (each with their own unique theme music). The soundtrack to the opening scene is a creative orchestration of ordinary sounds like that of the dripping water, the clicking of a telegraph, a buzzing fly, and the screech of a windmill after Morricone experienced a musical performance created by the medley of these sounds. This created an exaggerated version of what had come to be known as 'Spaghetti sound'.OUTW is a magnum opus unparalleled in direction, screenplay, cinematography and music. With its slower pace and relatively somber theme (compared to Leon's previous works), Leone managed to transform his image of a satirical showman into that of an accomplished auteur capable of producing much profound works. OUTW also served as the harbinger for Leone's surrealistic masterpiece, 'Once Upon a Time in America'. P.S: OUTW is an absorbing masterpiece; an absolute gem of a movie and a must watch for those who understand the true meaning of 'A Timeless Masterpiece', and are willing to indulge themselves completely through the whole length of the movie. 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",Once Upon a Time in the West
214,possumopossum,Leone and Morricone Do It Again,9,31 December 2006,"These two made one hell of a team, Leone with his marvelous directing/story telling and Morricone with his music. That HARMONCIA MAN theme tells you everything you need to know about Charles Bronson's character without him having to say a word (the same is true of all the characters.) This theme stays with you long after the last note has sounded, and it depicts pain and a desire for justice, and a determination to get it one way or the other. (Man, don't that harmonica sound like a wail of pain!!! It gives me chills every time I hear it.) The ending of this movie is perfect justice. Talk about make the punishment fit the crime! This gives a whole new meaning to that phrase.My only gripe about this movie is what they did with Jill's character. At first, you're made to feel sorry for her because she comes up and finds her family murdered and she is in danger of losing her home, possibly her life. But when she makes love to Frank (Henry Fonda) later on in the movie, (oh, hell, let's be honest. She didn't make love to him, she f**ked him.)I lost my respect and sympathy for her. Instead of being a widow mourning for her dead husband, she seemed more like a common slut who would do anything to save her own neck and to hold on to her late husband's property. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with this story line, but if we're supposed to feel sympathy for Jill, this scene kind of spoils that effect. Cheyenne and Harmonica were more worthy of respect than she was after that scene, although Harmonica has a score to settle big time and I found myself rooting for him throughout the whole movie.My favorite western. 9 out of 10.",Once Upon a Time in the West

217,TankGuy,Dream or Nightmare?,9,24 December 2014,"Sergio Leone's epic pastafest from 1968 is the closest the stalwart director ever got to making a western. Yeah sure the dollars movies were westerns, but they satirised American horse operas in Leone's unique tongue-in-cheek style. Duck You Sucker is not really a western. It's a buddy actioner which criticised war, patriotism and social hierarchy. Finally we have Once Upon A Time In America. Something of a labour of love for Leone, this depression set crime epic would be an object of obsession for the final part of his life. With West, dear old Sergio was merely tipping his hat to his inspiration, the American western. A love letter to Hollywood directors like John Ford and Howard Hawks, West is comprised of subtle references to several American westerns. However, there is only one variation. With these references, Leone has taken the conventions of the Hollywood western and reversed them, giving birth to mind blowing authenticity. Still, Leone's immortal style remains and the symbolism of the dollars trilogy is present.Allow me to explain further. At the film's outset, we have 3 villains waiting for a fourth at a train station. While waiting, their appearance frightens the conductor. Now, obviously there are several variations, but think High Noon(1952). At the beginning of Fred Zinnemann's classic, 3 villains wait at a train station for a fourth. These nice fellows also make the conductor wary of them. Now there are 2 differences. In High Noon, the train doesn't arrive for at least an hour, whereas in West it arrives within 10-15 minutes. Secondly, High Noon has our 3 villains waiting for their leader, bad guy Frank Miller, but West has the 3 baddies waiting for the film's hero, Harmonica. As with Leone's other westerns, symbolism is abundant. When you strip away the complex plot, West tells the story of the expanding railroad. The construction of the railroad represents life and how it is eternally progressing. However, the progression of life always has and always will be wrought with different evils. These evils take the form of the corrupt railroad tycoon Morton and his hired gun Frank. Still, in spite of these evils, life continues to progress unaffected and when the evils are rid of, a new evil always rears it's ugly head. When Morricone's trancelike score is combined with slow, uninterrupted shots of stillness, West feels like a beautiful dream, or is it a nightmare?. You decide.West has an ingredient that the dollars trilogy and DYS lacked, a strong female lead. Claudia Cardinale was excellent, like a breath of fresh air. Henry Fonda was deliciously menacing as Frank, probably the most robust role he's ever played. Charles Bronson made for a staunch anti hero as Harmonica and Jason Robards nearly steals the show as the tough outlaw, Cheyenne. Fore reasons I can't quite explain, Gabriele Ferzetti owned the movie as the crippled railroad baron Morton. Personally, I believe West to have the greatest musical score ever written for a western, Morricone's finest hour!. Composed in stunning, majestic style, ""Jill's Theme"" alludes to a resplendent utopia away from the violent filth of the frontier. ""The Man With A Harmonica"" is the ultimate soundtrack for a showdown. The piercing shrieks of a harmonica juxtaposed with the fuzz of an electric guitar and the soaring tempo of an orchestra is eerily atmospheric, evoking exquisitely the ritual of the final duel. ""Cheyenne's Theme"" is catchy and you will be whistling it long after the credits have rolled. As you would expect from a Leone film, West has the blessing of consummate cinematography. The penetrating zooms and close-ups of Harmonica and Frank were proficient and the infinite shots of silence dazzling. While it was still commendably tight, the suspense was a little too tenacious. The slow build ups were nearly as taut as they were in the dollars trilogy, but the intense explosions of violence came too soon and too fast. The tension just wasn't as sharp as it should have been. It also wasn't as copious as it was in the dollars movies, therefore some parts of the film were slightly desiccated. In a brief showdown in the town's street, there are a couple of positively spectacular stunts!. I'm surprised stuntman Fabio Testi wasn't paralysed for the rest of his life. A queasy flashback intercut into the climatic duel between Harmonica and Frank provided the confrontation with fierce bite.What else can I say?. If you love any kind of western you must see this movie. Just falling short of the glory of the dollars trilogy and Duck You Sucker due to some acute flaws, West is a cast iron classic nonetheless. 9/10.",Once Upon a Time in the West

220,kyle_c,**** out of ****,10,1 December 2002,"Sergio Leone set out to create the ultimate western here, and succeeded. Combining pieces from all of the great westerns that preceded it, he made a one of a kind film.  Showing the natural progression from his first three westerns to here, he more or less takes a lot of the same themes and ideas from those and pulled them together.  More epic and operatic than `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,' and without the lightheartedness that gave that film it's undeniable uniqueness.  Instead, Leone focuses more on the dark side of the west, and the dark side of human nature as well.  The four main players, Charles Bronson, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards, and Claudia Cardinale, all give the performances of the lifetime.  From a filmmaking standpoint, few movies have ever been so perfect  the combination of gorgeous cinematography, incredible music, and the sheer style are second to none.

222,raphaklopper,"The Best Western ever made??? Not quite, but still is AMAZING!",10,23 October 2013,"After the great success of the masterpiece ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" which perfectly finished the ""Dollars"" trilogy. Sergio Leone get bored with nothing to do, and decided to start another trilogy, the ""America"" trilogy with ""Once upon a time in the West"". That today is considered the best Western ever made in the history of cinema.""Once upon a time in the West"" begins when the farmer Brett McBain (Frank Wolff) and his sons are murdered in cold blood by the hands of the ruthless bounty-killer Frank (Henry Fonda) who puts the blame on the criminal Cheyenne (Jason Robards). Frank was hired by the legged-rail baron Morton (Gabrielle Ferzetti) to just scare away McBain and his family of their land, because she would be much valued with the advancement of the railroad. But on the same day Jill (Claudia Cardinale) arrives in town, coming from New Orleans, and when she finds out of the crime she reveals that she married Brett McBain weeks before in New Orleans and therefore the land still had a owner. On the same day, Jill meets a mysterious man who is known for Harmonica (Charles Bronson) because he always carries with himself a harmonica, and offers itself as a protector of Jill. And when the criminal Cheyenne knows that he is being unfairly prosecuted, he decides to join forces with Harmonica to help Jill keep the lands of her deceased husband. But a web of mystery and deceit circulates between the contradictory relationship of the characters.When the film premiered at the time it was poorly received by critics and was a box office failure, only today that the critics and the public praised the film as not only the best Sergio Leone's movie, but also the best Western ever made. Well, not quite (in my opinion), but I understand why people praise him as such. The main complain of the critics to the film at the time, it was that the film was extreme slow. But this slowness is caused by some reasons.The first one is that the film was completely different from all the Western films ever made, even from the ""Dollars"" trilogy because Leone gives the film a dramatic tone. What Leone tries to show in the story is the end of the Old West, the title shows that perfectly. The original translation from Italian to English was ""Once upon a time THE West"", that is, the end of the Old West. And that originally came in the time of the advance of the railways, and the grand corruption and death that she brought to the population. Leone shows that giving the film an excellent script (written by him and Sergio Donati), which gives the film a superb narrative with beautiful dialogs between the characters, but like any Leone's film, it never loses his great sense of humor.The other reason is, as always. the magnificent direction of Leone, which once again shows advanced for its time. With its perfect close-ups on characters and enormous scenarios, making everything beautiful and epic. But there it comes the problem that prevents the film to even beat ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"". Leone was known for his quiet moments brilliantly filmed, and ""Once upon a time"" is full of them (but maybe too much). Without considering the first 10 minutes of the film (which is brilliant, putting us in the heat of the scene), but others seem to boring taking the power of narrative and our investment on them.Another problem with the film is the relevance of the characters. Not that they are not superb and memorable (which they are): Jill is nothing more nor less than the representation of the women in the world of men in the Old West and its extreme strength and intelligence, along with an excellent performance from Cardinale; Cheyenne can be compared with Tuco from ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"", both characters are cruel bandits, but in several times they are shown to be simple human beings with their problems and their kind and innocent side; Frank is another cruel-badass villain that Leone built in his films, Frank is a bounty-killer who in previous films its showed that they are honored to their ""job"", do whoever they were told and paid for and nothing more. But Frank in the film betrays its own principles, and gets into the corrupt world of the railways; Harmonica is almost the same character that Clint Eastwood was in previous Leone films. Mysterious, don't talk much, and never shows his true motives (only at the most epic and badass moment of the film). All characters are fantastic, but thanks to the silent moments of Leone, their relevance and relationship fails in several moments in the history.I don't agree that this is the best Western film ever made, but I understand why people consider it so. From a fabulous story that shows excellently the end of the era of legends with a flawless script, magnificent direction and unforgettable characters. All this makes ""Once upon a time"" not only one of the best Western films ever made, but a beautiful masterpiece of cinema and the beginning of another amazing trilogy! 10/10",Once Upon a Time in the West

224,Mnemosyne15,One of the best martial arts films in the West,8,18 March 2020,"One of the reasons why film thinking is different from other artistic thinking is that film does not need to be described, and it does not need to be processed by other media and communication methods. The camera can directly and completely record this complete space and movement in space, but literature must describe It is the same with all kinds of details, sculpture, and fine arts. Only the movie is closer to the original reality, and the movie is closer to life. He can really show the details of life directly. This is why Bazan said that film art does not imitate reality, but reality imitates film. What he meant was that film directly created reality, which also led to different ways of thinking between film and literature, film processing and literary processing It's quite different. Film only intercepts and does not need to describe encoding and conversion. What about literature? If you are interested, you can think about how to use the lens to express the scene of the rice dumplings I described earlier, how to express it in words, and see if the way of thinking is different.
Furthermore, in terms of authenticity, films are also fictional, but they are also fictional. Films have a closer life-like realism, repainting and painting, sculptures are made more lifelike, and literary depiction is not as immersive as realism. The movie is closer to reality, although everyone is fake. Of course, this is only more realistic, and authenticity is not the sole purpose of art.",Once Upon a Time in the West

226,TheNabOwnzz,A grand epic haunting masterpiece,10,4 May 2018,"While it is still most commonly stated that 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is Leone's ultimate masterpiece, this label is quite unfortunate for another Leone masterpiece, 'Once Upon a Time in the West', which is also one of the greatest films ever made.First and foremost Once Upon a Time in the West is a masterpiece of storytelling. A lot of early scenes will leave you with questions that will only be answered later on after everything becomes clear. The story is a complex and multi layered mystery that is handled with impeccable editing and a slow pace which is always evolving. In the end all of your questions as viewers will be answered in one of the greatest reveals ever in cinema history when nearing its end. It also features an incredible use of sound, having birds chirping when everything seems safe and creating silence and awareness of the characters in question when there is danger brewing. Leone was a master of creating tension, and this way everytime the birds would stop chirping you are at the edge of your seat. There are a lot of close ups as usual in a Leone film, and emotions are put into the incredible facial acting ( especially by Henry Fonda ) and the once again terrific Ennio Morricone score.With Charles Bronson as the mysterious harmonica player who seems to be able to kill with his eyes, Henry Fonda as the intimidating blue eyed villain & Jason Robards as the charismatic bandit Cheyenne we have an incredible cast of actors who are used to the best of their abilities. Ofcourse Fonda was barely cast as a villain before this film, frequently appearing as the hero in a lot of Hollywood movies before this one, which makes his appearance all the more shocking and intimidating when the camera glances from his shoes towards his piercing blue eyes. However, i have a slight critique on Claudia Cardinale ( Jill ), whose dialogue seems to come across as forced, yet her facial acting is absolute world class. One of my favorite scenes has to be the one where she jumps off the train only to find there is no one there to pick her up. Her confused and melancholy look is absolute divine, and combined with Leone's elevating shot which shows the town right when Morricone's music hits its climax, it creates one of the greatest cinematic scenes ever made.The cinematography is absolutely beautiful as usual in a Leone film, especially during the shoots of all the workers working on the railroad, in the background, middle and foreground, all flowing across the screen effortlessly due to Leone's artistic directional talents. Jill's ride to the McBain farm is also one worth of notice, with a lot of beautiful widescreen distance shots of the western environment in a very similar style to John Ford, which was one of the influences of Leone.From its incredible opening sequence devoid of almost any dialogue whatsoever to the very end, it is a movie that grabs you and never lets go due to its incredible slow paced storytelling. It is just a brilliant piece of writing that manages to make every scene look useful and more mysterious, building up to an ending that has to be one of the greatest sequences ever put on the screen.",Once Upon a Time in the West

230,Aristides-2,"A long, long, long movie",3,9 July 2010,"Numerous times during my viewing of this movie I was distracted by a persistent thought: What's the mph of a Galapagos turtle moving at top speed? Oh did this movie drag on and on! Seeing 'OUATITW' also reminded me of Shakespeare: did the actors, during the seeming hundreds of interminable pauses between the banalities they uttered think they were doing 'Hamlet' or 'King Lear'? My irritation and the distraction it caused led me to ponder minutiae; I wondered a few times how the characters were feeding their horses and livestock. No fields of alfalfa, no streams or rivers. Just 'stark' arid desert. (Perhaps 19th Century American western fauna could find nutrition in cacti?) On occasion I enjoy seeing forty, fifty, sixty year old American films with all star casts even if the movies stories don't hold up. But in this case I experienced a physical torpor not unlike a backpacker crossing Monument Valley without enough water or food to sustain himself. — Aristides, Winthrop, WA",Once Upon a Time in the West
231,doug-balch,"Great movie, but overrated",5,8 August 2010,"I saw this movie as a youngster when it first came out and was enthralled by it. Subsequently, I re watched it over the years a number of times and it has always been one of my favorites. However, recently I decided to begin a hobby of becoming an amateur critic of the Western genre. I have begun a multi-year project to review and rank all ""A"" Westerns ever released. I understand why some fans may consider this one of the best Westerns of all time. It is a high psychedelic opera that can be mesmerizing. I am sad to say, however, that ""OUTITW"" if fairing very poorly in my rankings. As much as I used to like it, when I take a harder look at ""OUTITW"" and compare it against other top Westerns, it comes up woefully short in a number to critical categories I use to rank the great Westerns. I'll start with a list of positives: Of course, this movie is mostly about style and Leone gives this movie the full treatment. For me this is both a positive and a negative. A positive because style is what's great about a Leone Western. A negative, because in this case he overdoes it. Details in my negative list below The casting of Henry Fonda is a stroke of genius. Frank might be the most effective heavy in the history of Westerns. His blue eyes are perfect for the Leone close-ups The opening segment ""High Noon"" tribute is classic Leone Claudia Cardinale is one of the sexiest females to ever appear in a Western. She is also well characterized and her role is integral to plot developments i.e. she's not a gratuitous sex object. It's not often remarked on, but Morton, the railroad baron, is very well characterized. Nice touch to have him be a cripple, but the important thing is that he is not one-dimensionally evil. He is humanized not just by his infirmity, but also by the painting of the ocean on the wall of his train car. The soundtrack is very effective, as usual with Leone. It's a good looking film and Cardinale's carriage ride through Monument Valley is one of the most visually beautiful segments in the history of cinema, let along Westerns. Now for the negatives: Leone's strength is his style. In ""For a Few Dollars More"" and ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" he managed to integrate his style into a compelling storyline, replete with clever plot twists, snappy dialog and excellent comic relief. ""OUTITW"" has none of these things. To make matters worse, he slows the pace down to a crawl and adds an hour of running time. This might have worked if he had created another compelling character except Frank. The fact is that we don't care about anybody in this movie. The only sympathetic character is Harmonica, but we don't have any reason to feel for him until the movie's final scene. There is virtually no comic relief, outside of Harmonica's ""two horses too many"" line at the beginning and Cheyenne's antics on top of the train. Compare to ""TGTBTU"" where Eli Wallach created one of the most fascinating comic villains in the history of cinema. Not only that, but you actually CARED about Tuco more than you do anybody in ""OUTITW"". What an achievement! Leone even messed up the landscape. After Cardinale's stunning buggy ride through Monument Valley, we are immediately aware that the movie is really being filmed in Spain or somewhere, certainly not in Monument Valley. The film then gets stuck in the ugly town they built and stays there. Jason Robard's character is beyond dull. The movie would have been much better if they had just deleted this character, who really serves no purpose. And Cardinale can't act her way out of a paper bag. First billing over Fonda too. Go figure that. The fundamental plot is too thin to support a three hour film. Finally, Leone seems to think that all Indians had been fully exterminated from the region in the 1880's Arizona. I didn't see one. In fact, Leone deserves some kind of career Razzie award for making five Westerns without a single Indian. I don't mean no Indian characters, I mean not even the presence of a single Indian. Some ""student"" of Westerns.",Once Upon a Time in the West
232,albrechtcm,Disappointing,4,26 April 2014,"This film was beautifully filmed with impressive scenery and well-designed sets against a beautiful musical score. The story line is pretty standard, but okay. Water rights, railroad coming in, new town, etc. However this film can't quite decide whether it wants to be a horse opera or a soap opera. At over three hours it's something like watching a full season of Days of our Lives meets The Young and the Restless in the Old West. A good half of that three plus hours is spent on close ups of the different characters staring at each other, or into mirrors, or just staring with gritty expressions on their weathered faces.Henry Fonda gets to show us how bad a bad guy he can be, but that's just not the Henry Fonda we knew and loved and it didn't really work for me.

234,cafescott,when your nemesis arrives,10,20 April 2013,"Before adding my comments, I enjoyed reading Michael Coy's (""Something to do with Death"", 1/2001) witty discussion of the surprisingly complex (i.e., ""labyrinthine"") roadhouse. For those of us who have seen this movie ten or more times, thinking about the roadhouse is a source of humor.I also enjoyed reading Jonathon Dabell (""Outstanding epic western that is truly one of the best of its kind""; 9/10/2006) and byroncallas (""Best Western Ever Made"", 16 February 2002).Sergio Leon's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (OUTW) is the most satisfying western in cinema. It captures the isolation, lawlessness and brutality of that period and location. With Ennio Morricone's (arguably) peerless film score, with unique musical signatures for the major characters, the themes broaden.For example, the concept of the birth of a frontier train station unifying people and bringing them together suggests a populist economic renewal. At the beginning of the film, the numbers who stood to profit from the new station were few. At the end of OUTW, a large number of railroad workers have arrived who are both building the station's infrastructure and laying tracks. It would be hard to argue against the idea that OUTW depicts a socialist economy triumphing over a fascist and/or capitalist one.Then there is the pairing of 'Morricone's score with Leone's imagery of Claudia Cardinale at the film's end. It seems to bring to mind philosophical questions about womanhood. Jill is an ex-prostitute and she ends up the heiress to a frontier railroad station. Isn't a prostitute in her own way, a 'station'? So what are Leone and Morricone telling us? For me, the complex feminine theme arising from the past and future of Cardinale's Jill is filled with intellectual ardor that has seldom been equaled.The opening sequence of credits paired with the arrival of three dangerous men at the remote train station is exquisite. The opening sequence is very clever visually.The entire cast is superb. The major characters are wonderfully conceived. Cheyenne is a hybrid between fearsome outlaw and comic relief (particularly with his musical signature). His relationship with the other characters brings the quartet closer.The concepts of ""revenge"" and ""what is a nemesis"" are perfectly demonstrated in OUTW. Henry Fonda's psychopathic, icy-blue-eyed Frank; and Charles Bronson's unblinking, relentless Harmonica are career-best performances from both players. The tension between the two seems heightened by the hereditary differences of the actors. Fonda's angular, WASP-like features and tall stature versus Bronson's rugged, ""nation less"" appearance seems to be a more rousing spectacle than had Clint Eastwood played Harmonica.When Leone's film is winding up and Morrione's score is filling the air the moment is euphoric. We all go to movies to be swept away like this.While OUTW is great in many ways, it does have a flaw: The body count, particularly in the first forty-five minutes, makes it difficult for OUTW to be screened in concert halls. The body count means it can't be enjoyed by every age demographic.Let me conclude by wishing eternal damnation to the censor who removed all references to Jill's past life as a prostitute in the TV screening that was my first look at OUTW. I can't believe someone could live with their self after doing that.I'd like to meet up with The Censor somewhere near Monument Valley with a harmonica in my mouth.",Once Upon a Time in the West

237,Danimal-7,Shows what a genius director can do with mediocre material,8,26 August 1999,"The script of ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is hardly brilliant or original. The beautiful Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) comes to a Southwestern town to meet her new husband, only to find that he and his children have been murdered.  The killer is Frank (Henry Fonda), a paid assassin of a railroad businessman, who has framed a local outlaw named Cheyenne (Jason Robards) for the crime.  Then there is a Mysterious Stranger, identified only by the harmonica he constantly plays, who for some reason is trying to find the killer Frank.Sergio Leone, who had by this time established his reputation as the inventor and uncrowned king of the spaghetti western, takes this essentially hackneyed tale and builds incredible tension with it.  He rations information like a miser, leading us along on a bread-crumb trail of clues that leave a good taste in our mouth but always hungry for more.  The performances he coaxes from his leading actors are arguably career bests for all of them.  Henry Fonda is shockingly cold and hard as Frank, the archetypical Western Killer in Black.  There is no other fear quite like the fear of seeing the comforting and familiar warp into the menacing and alien; hence the power of casting Fonda, a man who played heroic leads for his entire career, as a heartless villain.  Charles Bronson's secretive face and knowing smile will keep you fascinated; it's hard to believe this is the same man who proceeded to give identical schtick performances in movie after movie throughout the '70s and '80s.  Claudia Cardinale's face speaks much more powerfully than her accented voice: her spirit and defiance make for a commendable character.  Robards' scrappy outlaw is charming as he slowly warms to Cardinale's character.But the feel of this film, which is half its power, is hard to describe. Ennio Morricone's magnificent score, of course, is part of the magic; each major character has a theme music that is played subtly differently depending on how they are seen, which is why OUATITW is sometimes called ""operatic.""  Leone sets up some wonderful shots: as where Bronson's eyes are alternately lit and darkened by a swinging lantern (arguably symbolizing our uncertainty whether he's a good guy or a bad guy); Bronson's silhouetted figure framed by closeups of the men who have been sent to kill him; Fonda's graceful, sidewise swagger as he prepares to draw down; the catlike speed with which he turns and draws when a man behind him reaches into a desk drawer; the shock and fear on Cardinale's face as she throws the door open to reveal a danger seen by her but not us.  Leone's every shot simply oozes style, and makes us forget any flaws in the story.It must be admitted that OUATITW shamelessly romanticizes the gunfighters. That's not necessarily bad, for a mythical story can be as good in its own way as a factual one, but anyone who sees this film should also see UNFORGIVEN to get a more realistic feel for what gunplay in the Old West was really about.Simply put, this is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, and it is due almost entirely to the director's skills.  I rarely use the word ""auteur"" (which is merely French for ""author"") for a director, because the word is so often  abused by arrogant faux-critics as a disguise for humbug. However, I will admit that OUATITW is truly a case of a director, or auteur if you must, making magic out of the most unpromising of materials.Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.",Once Upon a Time in the West
238,latsblaster,C'era una volta il West: My redemption,10,1 July 2003,"""C'era una volta il West"", also known as ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" changed my life and became my redemption. I was chocked that a film could be as good as this. It influenced my opinions and thoughts about film in general. ""C'era una volta il West"" is maybe the most stunning film I have ever seen.This is perhaps Sergio Leone´s most advanced film, filled with references to other famous Westerns such as ""The Searchers"", ""Rio Bravo"", ""How the West Was Won"" and his own dollar-films, but the biggest influence are from  ""High Noon"", ""Shane"" and ""Johnny Guitar"".I think that ""How the West Was Won"" had the biggest impact for the making of this film, this is like a remake of the MGM-film but in an artistic way with a more complex and twisted script, narrated in a much more complex way and with a more stylish direction, all with the Morricone and the Leone touch, with less respect for the history books but more for the Western-genre and with the highest ambition to have personal style which ""How the West Was Won"" never had. It is also much more like a John Ford-Western than Leone´s other Westerns.Every scene in ""C'era una volta il West"" has the highest intense, with some of the coolest quotes ever. The two best scenes has Ennio Morricone's great theme ""Man With a Harmonica"".Should be seen in it's original widescreen format.Rating: 10 of 10.",Once Upon a Time in the West

240,cleary-joshua,I completely and utterly adored this film...,10,22 January 2014,"The ""Western"" genre is not one I'm particularly familiar with, and I didn't quite know what to expect when I watched ""Once Upon a Time in the West"". I'd heard good things, seen its high position on the ever-reliable IMDb Top 250, so I decided to take a risk and watch this 2.5 hour film. Thankfully, I was not in the slightest disappointed. In fact, I completely and utterly adored it. It's filled with great performances, gripping tension, and completely justifies its long running time.The film tells a story of land-ownership and revenge, with Henry Fonda playing against type as the villain, Frank. Fonda does this with brilliance, and manages to make you forget all of the great hero roles you've seen him play (see ""12 Angry Men""). He's dark, mysterious and extremely hateable. The other standout role here is that of Charles Bronson, as Harmonica. Harmonica somehow manages to be an even more mysterious character than Frank, and Bronson manages to keep this running throughout without losing a connection with the audience. The chemistry between the two is electric, and the reveal at the end why vengeance is so important for Harmonica is a stunning twist. The dialogue between them is constantly excellent, but it's also the looks and the silence that really make their hatred of each other real.Being relatively new to the genre, I cannot talk much about references to other Westerns, however there were so many things that instantly made me want to explore further. Leone's direction is fantastic, and he has a great vision running throughout the film. This is set up extremely well in the first 10 minutes, a long dialogue-less scene where three men wait for a train. For all of these 10 minutes, you're on the edge of your seat waiting for something to happen. The action sequences in the film are exciting and don't feel at all superfluous. To bring all of this fantastic film-making together is Ennio Morricone, whose score is tense, exciting and beautiful all at once. The ways that he brings the melody played by Harmonica on his instrument of choice into the rest of the score is masterful. Even though his score for ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" is now seen as clichéd, he moves away into new territory while also staying familiar.For anyone who is completely new to Westerns, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is almost certainly the place to start. It's gripping and thoughtful all at once. And it doesn't feel for one moment like you're watching a 2.5 hour movie, you never want it to end.",Once Upon a Time in the West

242,Wulfstan10,Another Masterpiece,10,21 April 2005,"This is clearly among the greatest movies ever made and the very top westerns ever made, its main competitor (in my opinion) being another Sergio Leone masterpiece: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. It's hard to say which I think is greater and I tend to place them pretty much equal as the greatest Westerns ever. This is partly due to the fact that they are in many ways, especially plot, depth,and even basic approach to the genre, quite different.Whereas The Good... has a simple story dealing only with three gunmen looking for gold, Once Upon... has a much more complex plot with a number of deeper themes. It delves into the relationships of people, the end of the Old West and the place of gunfighters, the spread of development and the future, revenge, etc. Unlike some, I don't consider this plot ""superior"" to The Good; it's just different, richer, and more complex, and certainly has more potential. However, the plot of The Good is compelling and clean in its simplicity. I also thoroughly appreciate how The Good doesn't make any excuses or try to be sentimental, yet in its grittiness there is amazing depth. Therefore, I really think that the two are just very different and while Once Upon is certainly more complex and grand, it is not necessarily better.More fundamentally, these differences seem to result from the fact that Once Upon really seems to be an homage to the ""classic"" American westerns such as those of John Ford, taking their basic themes, elements, and approaches. Everything, though, is handled very differently, so that characters are much richer, more ambiguous and subtle, the plot and scenes more tense, the events more violent, gritty, and hard-hitting, and the ""classic"" elements are in general given a new freshness, so that the emotional impact is incredible. Whereas Leone's earlier westerns really reinvented the genre and broke from the ""classic"" mold, this film went back to the ""classic"" predecessors and blended the key elements of those films with Leone's new style and approach, making a film that really brings the ""classic"" western to its apogee. An homage to those earlier films, it expands them and morphs them into something greater so that this is undoubtedly the greatest western based on those ""classic"" traditions. Of course, a film's plot is only part of the mix, and a film must be put together well: directing, cinematography, editing, costumes and other details. In this regard, Once Upon... is, like The Good, sheer perfection.I have heard people describe Leone's work as ""operatic,"" which is not a description that I came up with on my own, but it sure does describe the films, especially this one.This film is a true masterpiece and a shining example of Leone's brilliance. It is beautiful throughout and the plot is fascinating and developed superbly(as one should expect from Leone). Although I think that a couple scenes are a little longer than they should be, overall the slow pace of the film is one of its beauties, as always with Leone. It builds the tension and emotion incredibly well and allows the viewer to be absorbed in the film. The characters are wonderful. Bronson is at his absolute best here as the taciturn, calm, man of action while Henry Fonda superbly plays what I think to be his greatest role. His face and eyes are perfect for it. Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale are great,too. The constant theme of the railroad and its development in the scenes as the film progresses are also incredible. Its use is not entirely original, but railroads have immense artistic, dramatic, and symbolic potential and the theme is handled flawlessly. As a result, the railroad theme fully realizes its potential in all three aspects. The images of the railroad progressing are themselves thematically powerful and visually stunning.There are so many wonderful Leone elements throughout this film, giving it extreme dramatic power, grittiness, and atmosphere. A key one is the use of music, such as the haunting harmonica music, acting as a soundtrack and theme song for Harmonica while at the same time heralding the arrival of his character as he plays it, and adding a mournful, haunting feel to the scenes, perfectly fitting Bronson's character. It's wonderful to hear the music as if it's just a soundtrack just before noticing the characters react to it, showing that they hear it, too. Another is the images, with the beautiful long shots of the scenery with close ups of characters' faces or items like guns, sometimes together in the same shot, and sometimes with the items in obscure positions in the picture, so that their very closeness and appearance emphasises them and obscures them at the same time. The beginning scene at the station deserves its own special praise. This scene is absolutely incredible and is Leone at his artistic best. Everything about it is utter perfection, with the slow build-up of tension as the viewer for some time wonders what exactly is going on but can feel the tension; the quick, sharp spot of violence (another Leone trademark); the use of the sounds of the windmill, etc.; the things with which the three gunmen occupy their time whilst waiting; the images, especially the view with the close-up of the windmill and long shot of the countryside and tracks as Woody Strode casts a shadow whilst traversing the makeshift platform; every detail of the station and the characters; the references to other westerns; the arrival of the man for whom they are waiting; the image of them turning to face him. That's a long list, but this scene alone is worth the price of the film. It could stand on its own as a short film.In sum, this what everything that a ""classic"" western should have been.",Once Upon a Time in the West

This film is a Spaghetti Western film which has nothing special in its story actually but, but, but, it is an epic of melodrama in its different sense.

Maybe I saw a version that was missing a few scenes - I don't think so however.Basically the scene where Frank and Cardinale are in bed together bothered me a hell of a lot. There's no build up to this scene. We don't see him beat her or force her at gun point. It seems to be she likes this guy. This guy who ruthlessly murdered her husband and his family. What the hell. I was beginning to wonder if she was in on it from the start. She doesn't seem to be bothered by sleeping with this scumbag at all. A strong female lead like her would have stashed guns and set traps to kill this guy. Would have made a hell of a better film (also pleasantly shorter). Also why does Bronson and co leave her unguarded for such a long time? They clearly know she's in danger but leave her to be molested or murdered or both.Sure, maybe she had no choice but to sleep with frank - but why didn't they show these scenes? Also why did she seem so comfortable with it? I guess she didn't want to get murdered but in these circumstances anyone would be justified in calling the director misogynistic.

246,tonyjackie,Brilliant film making,9,18 October 2008,"Every time I watch this movie I appreciate it more and more.There are so many scenes of brilliance here,so many memorable moments.Then there is the cast which is fabulous.At first viewing,there may be a sense of disappointment that Clint Eastwood doesn't appear in the role of Harmonica.It must be said though that I don't think the role would have suited him as much as it suits Charles Bronson.He is perfect for this role as a man so obviously with a grudge against Frank whereas the role Eastwood played in the previous spaghetti westerns was of a man with no apparent grudges.I don't think the role of Harmonica would have sat comfortably with him,he was better being a man without any motives.Caludia Cardinale looks stunning as Jill McBain and shows she can act too.Jason Robards exudes charm as Cheyenne and fits the role like a glove.But the real triumph here is Henry Fonda as Frank.Playing completely against type,he gives a fabulous performance as the psychotic but intelligent villain of the piece.Yes,this is a tremendous cast.As stated earlier,there are so many scenes of brilliance.The opening ten minutes or so,Cheyenne sliding the lamp towards Harmonica,the final shoot out.All brilliantly done and scenes that linger in the memory.I like the humour in the movie such as the Barman telling his story to Jill,stopping when Cheyenne and Harmonica have their face off and then carrying on as though nothing had happened.Also,when a gun shot is heard and the scene shifts to Cheyenne who has cut himself shaving,obviously jumping because of the noise.Very clever.I can definitely understand why so many people call this the finest western ever but for me it is slightly behind the fantastic The Good,The Bad And The Ugly.Why?I think that the narrative in OUATITW does get a little confusing at times but I have to say that this movie is very close to being the best western ever.It is a great piece of work.Last but not least I must pay tribute to two legends of the cinema and only need to add simply that Sergio Leone was a brilliant director and Ennio Morricone was one of the greatest film composers of all time.Geniuses the pair of them.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Of course, the introduction scene is unforgettable in which Frank's men meet with Harmonica.Frank and Harmonica. One day a man comes to the town where no one knows this man and his name. First, this man overcomes three men who sent by Frank. At the same time, Frank kills Mr. McBain who wait for his new wife from the train. So she comes into the inheritance of McBain.

In this way, he saves Frank from death but Frank learns the reality that is Harmonica is the man whose brother is killed on Harmonica's shoulder by Frank's plan. So the harmonica sound that continues during the whole film is inspired from Harmonica which is inserted the man's mouth by Frank.As I said above, the sounds are so amazing so that it is just a reason to watch it.

251,CoastalCruiser,No Spoiler Review,9,7 August 2012,"Wow. I love the top rated reviews for this movie. Almost poetic they are. If you have not yet seen 'Once Upon a Time...' I envy you. It's probably my number 1 favorite Western of all times. So that you can weigh my opinion, I add 'Lonesome Dove', 'Tombstone', 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance', and 'My Darling Clementine' to round out a top 5 list of Westerns to have with you if trapped on a desert island and you must watch them over and over. If they gave me 5 more it would likely be the remake of 'True Grit', 'Open Range', 'Stagecoach', 'The Magnificent 7', or any of the other Wyatt Earp movies except 'Wyatt Earp's Revenge'. I suppose 'Unforgiven' should be on the list, but I have never been able to see what others see in that movie. Have patience with me... I'm also a sci-fi aficionado, yet it took many viewings of Bladerunner before I really got locked in.What you are about to see is the ultimate 'revenge movie' in a western setting. If you have ever seen Sharon Stone's revenge flick 'The Quick and the Dead', fuggedaboutit. Spaghetti Western director Sergio Leone holds court on how to properly serve this genre in 'Once Upon a Time...'.Here are some things to know about the movie up front without spoiling it for you: 1) It's a bit slow. This is NOT Short Attention Span Theater. The pace of the movie is deliberately slow. It's more like eating a simmered roast than a minute steak. Have a beer or a bowl or whatever to let your self synch down to the pace of the film.2) Every character in 'Once Upon a Time...' has their own music. Famous composer Ennio Marricone scores this epic film and endows every character with the exact right music to set the appropriate mood. Much of this film is about the score, so tune in and enjoy the ride.3) If you get confused as to what the hell is going on the movie don't worry. It's not atypical on the first time through. To help with that don't assume all the apparent bad guys are in fact all bad, and don't worry if there appear to be NO good guys for quite some time. It all works out most deliciously.4) There is an early scene where the Italian beauty Claudia Cardinale walks into the railroad station. A crane shot follows her into the station and then seamlessly tracks up above the station to reveal the town she has arrived in. It is a breathtaking single shot with Claudia's character music blaring out. An unforgettable moment! 5) The DVD has one of the best commentary tracks I've ever heard.Enjoy!",Once Upon a Time in the West
252,joker-scar,"A great lip-synced, shoot-em-up western fable from a Master",9,17 September 2018,"The first time I saw this film a buddy hyped it up and when I saw it I was...meh. But on the 2nd viewing a year later I got what he meant and it keeps getting better every time. I'm not a Western fan per say but the Leone revisionist westerns hit home with me and this is more of a bittersweet fable than a straight cowboy story as most, as far as I'm concerned anyway. Stunning photography and landscapes abound in this retro western.
Fonda takes a stunning turn as a pure evil gunslinger leader. Cardinale rivals any of the sex kittens of the day like Raquel Welch, Jane Fonda and Bardot with her beehive wig and sparse flowing wardrobe. She commands the lead as a strong willed, intelligent, independent woman not afraid to let her casual feminine wiles loose in an age where being seen and not heard was the norm. Bronson's is at his hard faced and subtle best, rivalling only Eastwood in cool & dangerous attitude. Robards is a much welcome calm relief in all the stare down confrontations within the film. 
Morricone's score is breath taking in scope and infusing the film with a strong fable-like theme as well as separate and memorable scores for each of the four lead characters.
Few directors can use long, slow scenes and successfully build up the tension rather than bore the audience. Leone is but the few who succeeds at this and it is this technique which became his trade mark.",Once Upon a Time in the West
253,veganflimgeek,I don't think hollywood could ever have a western this good,9,2 May 2004,"Leave to the Italians... This is Sergio Leone's finest western if not the best ever. What some people might find boring is what makes Once upon a time in the west filled with more tension than most suspense films.  The first 12 minutes is a amazing sequence built around a sound scape that gives you the feeling that you are there at the train station in flagstone.The story revolves around several characters and outside of Henry Fonda's Frank(who is a truly nasty villain) I think there is a lot of grey area at . No clear cut good guys.but who am I kidding this is a Sergio Leone film of course everyone is bad. Leone was a true pessimist and I suppose that is one reason I like his westerns. There is no idealism in how he portrays the old west.Here is the bottom line of the review. This movie is not for everyone. I think requires the ability of the viewer to appreciate grim, dark tone, moments of baddass violence and at the same time a patience cinema as art. Yes this movie is a werid but awesome mongrel of many breeds. All of which add up to a great film.The score is amazing. The sound is designed in a way that I don't think can be compared to any other movies. The performances are all pitch perfect. Henry Fonda plays such a perfect asshole to totally wigged me out as I think of him as the sweet old man in `on golden pond.'. Bronson gives a humble yet perfect performance and Jason Robards is also fun to watch.******Spoilers*******The only thing I didn't think was good was the widow. I realize it is part of the story that she was a hooker in New Orleans but the sexuality in the film seemed misplaced. I don't understand her getting with Frank.
The part with Harmonica flashing back to his brother's death is powerful and an amazing pay-off for all the build up. Great movie",Once Upon a Time in the West

255,ptsj-music,A film any actor would just die to be in.,10,5 September 2016,"The opening scene in this masterpiece from Sergio Leone is alone worth the 10 points. I would add another 10 if I could. To think that the three main actors from another work by the great master, ""The Good And The Bad And The Ugly"", Clint Eastwood, Eddie Wallach and Lee Van Cleef, said NO to appear as the three bad guys in the film's beginning, is just hilarious. Any actor would die just to be in this film. But these three guys were all thinking to highly of themselves, and didn't consider such a ""small role"" to be a great honor. It's not hard to understand Leone's meta intention to ask the three heroes to appear like that, but perhaps we all should thank them for refusing, because how much more epic didn't Jack Elam, Woody Strode and Al Mulock become after acting in this famous scene. They are simply perfect for it. Even more incredible is that Mulock committed suicide with his costume still on, and this way actually died, if not for playing a part in the film. His reason will forever be untold. One person getting too little credit is Leone's co-screenwriter, another Sergio by the surname Donati, who together with Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci really must have inspired Leone to get at top level. Every single actor in the film are at their top level too and make appearances so perfect that the audience forget that this is fiction. Personally I have seen it again and again only to see the beautiful and great acting Claudia Cardinale appear. But I believe Charles Bronson got the part mainly because he had the perfect looks and the most amazing eyes. Also, Bronson pretending to play the harmonica is THE ONLY just a little annoying thing about the film, even though the character's name is Harmonica. I am certain that the master behind the fantastic music score, Ennio Morricone, had little or no saying in this, the one place where music and picture don't fit together. There are so many to mention and give the very best credits. Tonino Delli Colli, director of photography, has caught the actor's faces, in particular Henry Fonda's and Charles Bronson's, but also the grand landscape and every important and non important detail in such an amazing way, it's totally stunning, and all the way. Nino Baragli is the master of editing. The total is so well composed that it just can't be made better. We can smell the air, taste the dust and feel every part of the setting. This is not Spaghetti Western, this is Italian epic film art at its very, very best!",Once Upon a Time in the West

257,markymark70,a little disjointed for me,7,7 April 2008,"I love Leone's films - the Dollars trilogy in particular - and love the way he fuses film and music together with his long time co-worker - Morricone. I purchased this 2-disc DVD for the princely sum of 6 Euro, having wanted to see it for a long time. I was a little surprised to see it on the IMDb's top 250 list at number 18. A very high placing indeed. The opening scene at the railway station is great. A little slow for some people but I loved it. The creaking of the windmill, the fly on Elam's face, the inevitable shoot-out are all fantastically done. Nobody but Leone would have got away with that amount of time seemingly wasted on the introduction. If any other filmmaker had tried it - they would be slapped down as a pretentious showboater. The next big set-piece is good also - Henry Fonda's character gunning down an entire family as they prepared a banquet celebration. But - for me - the downward spiral starts from here onwards.The music is good, the characters are okay and Cardinale is certainly easy on the eye. But the plot, storyline and general story-telling is so muddled and disjointed that I was left very unsatisfied. Also, the character of Jason Robards is a strange one and to me, unneeded. What value did he bring to the story? None as far as I can see. Sure, Fonda used his trademark long duster coats as cover for the murders - but other than that - I cannot see what his role is. And as for his relationship with Harmonica, whom he meets in a bar, saves from a train and then ends up dying next to him, it is puzzling in the extreme. Harmonica and Cheyenne seem to have no connection to each other but yet Cheyenne goes out of his way to help him??? Curious???Also - there are some scenes which I could not comprehend. Cardinale's bedroom scene with Frank? What? Also Frank meeting Morton in a desert hideaway? What? And both of these scenes practically follow each other. Makes no sense at all.The final showdown is okay - but lacks a bit of tension for me. However, the extreme close-up of Bronson's eyes adds a point to the film's score on it's own. Very impressive.To me the film suffered from having too many main characters and not enough for any of them to do. You had Cardinale, Fonda, Bronson and Robards all vying for story-time when in reality one (or possibly two) of them needed to be culled. Too muddled and too confusing. And there is a lot of posturing going on too - people staring at each other wordlessly - must have happened 10 times throughout the movie. But the style and the music win it a 7/10 score for me. Good - but certainly should not be in the top 20 films of all time.",Once Upon a Time in the West
258,LBytes,A modern work of art,10,26 January 2004,"After many years, I recently saw this movie again on the fantastic DVD they've released. There are very few westerns, maybe very few movies of any kind that can match the artistry of this picture. From the opening sequence to the climactic ending it has a gliding, almost still-life pace that might throw a contemporary viewer off. In stark contrast to the action-junkie flicks so common today, the contemplative approach to the sweeping vistas and powerful but short-lived violence elevates this ultimate spaghetti western to an opera. As they say in one of the commentaries, the actors sing with their eyes.All the acting is good if not great; the cast seems to be perfect for the mostly laconic personalities they portray. Even the bit parts flesh out the fairly simple plot. The magnificent setting and scenery play up the timelessness of the human struggle.I knew that this movie has tributes to previous westerns, but until you watch the movie with commentary I don't think anyone except true movie western fanatics would know just how many westerns have had a little of their imagery and plot entwined with Once Upon a Time in the West. If you like this movie, get the DVD and you'll be amazed how well it still works today.",Once Upon a Time in the West
259,johnmschofield,A marvellous visual experience,10,6 September 2009,"When I saw this film for the first time I have got to admit I did not like it at all. Maybe I was too young or maybe I was just not interested because my attention span was limited who knows but a lot of years later I probably grew up a little and the time I sat down and properly watched this film I came to appreciate it for what it is. It is a masterpiece and in order for anybody to fully understand why, I think the watcher needs to pay attention because the subtleties and the detail are not always obvious and there are very small body movements and shifts of position which if missed can render the scene you are watching confusing. Naturally if you start being confused you can tend to lose interest and I think thats where I made my mistakes. Please if you haven't watched it rent, buy or borrow this film and at least judge for yourself. Looking at the top 20 films in the IMDb top 250 list this film has the lowest votes and there could be all sorts of reasons why but to simply watch it is the starting point.

The languid pacing, demanding patience from the viewer, revealing the story slowly. The artistic shooting and framing of everything. The stylization. Somehow getting A-list hollywood talent into a film by a foreign, b-movie filmmaker. It simply couldn't be done today, and it will forever amaze me that it was done at all. This was Leone's best film, the one where everything came together. The acting, the music, the cinematography, the sets, the landscapes, and the story. It's all there.

262,EyeDunno,Excellent DVD,10,17 December 2003,"I may have commented on the movie, but I was compelled to write after watching the wonderfully- prepared feature DVD. The video quality is absolutely excellent, IMO, with hardly any foreign artifacts (specks). Every now and then there was some digitizing in some dark scenes, but overall, the picture quality was outstanding, considering the age of the film. I wasn't so impressed with the enhanced stereo (5.1 mix) that was used. Sounds from things like the train in the opening sequence didn't follow the subject consistently, but the mono track is also included and it was enhanced to make the audio range more spatial. I urge those OUTW fans to access the optional commentary track that gives viewers a sharp insight into the making of this classic. Things that are discussed include the fact that Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) is actually the hub for the principal characters  who weave their paths towards the climax. Also, watch for the use of water, which is vitally important to the story. It comes up so often and in so very many ways. Strange, since the very first frame shows such a parched and desolate land. The discussions also yield more about how director Sergio Leone was deeply influenced by many other filmmakers in his film that pays homage in so many obvious and even subtle ways (like using the song ""Danny Boy"" -- regarded as a ""goof"" in imdb -- sung by Maureen McBain [Marilu Carteny], which pays homage to a film that has a similar scene). It's ironic how so many filmmakers now pay homage to  OUTW. And one other interesting note in the commentary was how the decision was made to use amplified ambient sounds in the opening scene instead of the music of Ennio Morricone. Those who have patience and are well- rested should thoroughly enjoy OUTW. Those who just want to see stuff blown up and have the patience of Indiana Jones with a gun may grow restless with this movie, which really takes its time to develop the story. Even Harmonica (Charles Bronson) urges Frank (Henry Fonda) not to rush things. Once Upon a Time in the West allows you to take a close look into the faces of all the characters in ways that no other filmmaker has ever succeeded in accomplishing so well. So get plenty of rest, cancel all your plans, pop the DVD in, crank up the volume.... and watch those false notes.",Once Upon a Time in the West
263,enmussak,most overrated film on list,7,24 December 2002,"With the exception of Toy Story 2 being in the 60's on the imdb user list, this one could be the most overrated film.  The story and characters were poorly introduced.  Upon watching this film, and I wasn't distracted or intoxicated, and I couldn't follow what was going on.  Actually, I was distracted by Claudia Cardinale's beauty and her several close-call rape scenes.  Other than that, the story was a joke.  I don't know if anyone will agree with me on this, but I think Henry Ford was miscast.  All I could think about with him was 12 Angry Men and him being intensely moral.  He does have a moral, good-guy vibe coming off of him as a villain... just look at the difference between him and Bronson when you watch the movie.  The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly was a masterpiece with a great (well laid out) story and never a dull moment.

266,NpMoviez,Yet another masterpiece by Sergio Leone.,10,22 April 2021,"If I am to speak about the goods in this movie, I can easily end it by saying ""the entire film"". The character introductions in this film are some of the best character introductions of all times. Especially those of ""Harmonica"" and Frank. The intros don't have a dialogue or an exposition to introduce them. All the movie does is that they show you some characters, clearly indicating that they're up to something. Even what they do is quite interesting. Had they been the main characters of this film - that would've never been a problem. Then they introduce one of the characters. A brief set of dialogues between them, and that's all. We get the characterization of one of them, in a brief time. The script might probably indicate some filler characters doing some random stuff, and the character gets introduced with some dialogues. What makes it so interesting? Leone uses the ridiculously great score by Morricone and silences (by which I don't mean completely void of sound) throughout the sequence. But within that silence, there's a feeling of something about to explode. That particular thing is one of Leone's greatest tropes when it comes to his Spaghetti Westerns. And, everything that was supposed to explode, explodes with the loudest of sounds. Even the character that got introduced in the scene has a particular tune associated with him, which gives a perception of there's something that's about that character, we still don't know about. In short, Leone says indirectly that ""You don't know all about him. Wait. I will tell you. You're gonna be satisfied."" and he keeps up with his promise and in the final act, we get the answer to that. Leone builds up the suspense without a single confusing word that needs our thought, and that has worked almost everytime. With all the silences indicating the upcoming explosion, he introduces the other character - in a same and quite a bit different way. One of those characters was played by Charles Bronson and the other by the great Henry Fonda. I was convinced that even if I am watching a Spaghetti Western where the protagonist can be someone like The Man with no Name, who is characterized as someone slightly better than the villains, a character like the one portrayed by Fonda can never be a protagonist.The characters are very interesting in their own right - every main character - Jill, Frank, Harmonica and Cheyenne. Harmonica has that mysterious origin sort of a vibe, just like that of Eastwood's character in Dollars films. The only exception was that Harmonica was not so mysterious but is still a Man with no Name. He resembles a lot to Eastwood's iconic character, but is quite a lot different at the same time. Cheyenne is a sort of a comedic anti hero, who will do some crazy things and will also make you laugh. Jill - probably the most complex character of them all. When I watched it for the first time, I thought that she was getting mood swings for no reason and was kind of selfish at times. Watching it again, it's very clear why she has so much of apparent mood swings while talking to people she knows and she is getting genuinely helped by. And the part that I thought was portraying her selfishness was actually her sorrow. I don't know what mood I was in, when I first watched this film. It feels so obvious the second time. Anyway, my point is the character of Jill is realistic and - I won't say it's relatable, but is very reasonable and understandable. Frank, on paper, is just a bad guy who wants money and property and luxury and whatever that a generic bad guy in a movie wants. But he has a menacing presence. He is calm and focused. He does the generic things that a bad guy does in a movie, but Fonda and Leone make it too iconic to resist. Even the secondary character - Morton - is good.Coming to the story aspect, I admit that there's not much a complexity to the story or a shocking twist in the end. But, that doesn't even seem necessary. It has some kind of mystery in it. As the movie progresses, the mystery unfolds slowly and in a very interesting way. Leone builds the anticipation, and when he delivers the scene the anticipation leads up to, it comes with a great satisfaction. Nothing seems like ""mehh"" or something like that, which happens a lot in the ""modern"" movies. There are three major plotlines going on, forming a complete plot of this movie. And even though they feel really connected, each of them have their own focus, and they never divert from that. In the end, you will get what you were supposedly promised in the beginning.Leone is a master of visual storytelling. Whatever we need to know about the story is told to us by the non-expositionary dialogues, the expressions of characters and their portrayal. There may be some three or four minutes of exposition in the film, which are just the backstories. Some scenes are introduced vaguely, but are addressed in a satisfactory manner, later on. Ennio Morricone's scores are epic. It fits the situation perfectly. And, they are the reason why Leone's films are so intense. Apart from these, there are very witty dialogues here and there. There are some great character interactions. Cheyenne and Harmonica's interactions are the best ones. The way they get along, and the dynamic the characters share with each other literally puts a smile on your face. Charles Bronson has never given such an intense performance, either. One of Jason Robard's best works till date. Definitely the most memorable performance by Claudia Cardinale. She was perfect for the role of Jill.Some words about Fonda's performance. I haven't seen too many films starring Henry Fonda, but the ones I have seen suggest that he can be a really good ""messiah""-ish character on the screen (Check out ""12 Angry Men"" if you don't believe me). But this role proved that not only he was a great actor, but a versatile one too. One of his greatest performance I have ever seen. I don't know if this was the first time Fonda played such a character, but I was blown away by seeing him in a role like that. Right after Fonda appeared, it felt like this man is gonna be some kind of messiah, he always is so. So, I thought, isn't the man he's playing a bit too notorious? He is everyone's hero right? And a few seconds later I got terrified by Fonda (for the first time). Fonda being cast against type in this movie is perhaps the most mind blowing example of casting against type. And Fonda doesn't even remind me of his ""messiah"" characters at all.I highly recommend you to watch this film. You're missing one great film if you haven't seen it.Rating : absolute 10/10, Grade : golden A+",Once Upon a Time in the West

Both Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone are the peak of their creative craft. The story and characters are not the most original but the style of this film is what it's all about. While Leone is portraying his view of how America was built and how the ones such as Harmonica and Chayenne are bound to vanish, Morricone accompanies the story with his lamenting score. Whenever his tunes kick in, it is almost practically impossible not to get one's soul rushed by it.There are so many unforgettable scenes to choose from that have since shaped many moviemakers. My personal favorite is when Chayenne -brilliant Jason Robards- enters the big shop and finds the iconic Harmonica -always great Charles Bronson- at the end of the bar and the two start to get to know each other in their unique way.One of the greatest achievements made in cinema history and a classic that will never get outfashioned.",Once Upon a Time in the West

I mean Bronson can't have more than twenty line throughout the movie, and all of them a remarkable.The shooting is superb, I can almost remember every single shot in this movie, the blend of extreme close-ups and wide shots is just perfect and creates a wonderful result.An awesome score written by Morricone makes this movie even better. Every one of the main characters have their own score and every score is great.Fantastic performances by everyone is the final reason why you should stop read this now and go and by the movie instead. Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale are all playing on the top of their abilities.Now some people may have trouble with the slow pace of it but for me it actually adds to the atmosphere, you can almost smell the dust and death in the air when you watch this movie.Just go and buy it.

The framework Leone creates establishes: the mythic super hero/villains with clever dialogue and snappy editing (how many Hollywood directors would have NOT had the guts; to film Jason Robards entrance in a way that showed his arrival instead of hearing the chaos he creates outside the trading post - a very understated funny scene). This movie is crammed with so much wit, I'm restrained to reprint any of the one (or two) liners at the expense of leaving out any of the others. The cast for the most part is brilliant with Robards, Fonda and yes, even Bronson standing out.And this was all before I finally caught the wide screen version which is outstandingg; (Criminal to show the pan & scan version).The dying West as it was? Ambition coupled with ruthlessness! Good guys don't always win...and the good girls don't either. But whoever said that Claudia Cardinal's 'Jill' was good! She was at the right place at the right time and according to Leone, the seeds of civilization are built on her foundation. A more truthful rendition than other glossed over western tales.And the music is terribly funny...loved it!9 out of 10",Once Upon a Time in the West
272,loogenhausen,Harmonicas At High Noon...,10,9 November 2011,"OUATITW takes place in a weird part of American history. With that said, it's not even a bit ironic that a visionary Italian filmmaker orchestrated it all. Director Sergio Leone had done it before, of course, with the classic ""Man With No Name trilogy"" featuring western vet Clint Eastwood. But OUATITW is a completely different animal compared to the Eastwood series. While that pulpy, hard-boiled trilogy feels raw and uncontrollable at every turn, OUATITW is much more epic and somber in feeling. The best parts here are Ennio Morricone's terrific score and cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli's rich and haunting capture of the red and dusty Wyoming landscape. The story revolves around five characters who cross paths with each other throughout the film: Harmonica (Charles Bronson) is a wandering vigilante, playing his harmonica more than he talks and on the hunt for Frank (Henry Fonda). Frank's a cruel, heartless monster of a man that kills without any feeling or remorse and just so happens to be in league with railroad tycoon Morton (Gabrielle Ferzetti) in a land-snatching plot involving the inheritance of Jill (Claudia Cardinale), a big-city girl thrust into the wild west, now alone and struggling to simply stay alive. Last but not least, there's the dangerous but lovable bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards), fresh out of captivity and ready to swing things his way, whatever the cost. The expansion of the railroad is the key element of this story. The ghosts of westerns past haunt the proceedings as the money of the railroad barons and thirst of the land developers evaporate the mystery and beauty of the frontier. Morricone cleverly composed a distinct score for each of the five main characters, with Harmonica's being the most intimidating, Frank's the most conflicted, Jill's the most tender, Morton's the saddest and Cheyenne's the most deviously playful. It adds a whole new level to the film and will leave you humming Cheyenne's theme long after the movie is over.",Once Upon a Time in the West
273,dukeb0y,I saw the restored 4.5 version........Slow as molasses.,3,10 February 2017,"First of all, this is a 45 minute short story, stretched way out to four and a half hours. First, the good. The atmosphere, although slow, is effective. We can see how people really lived. The money was well spent on buildings, costumes, trains. It rates highly, there.Story, a simple story really. Which I won't give away, but the pace is ..as many have said, slow. We really don't get to know the characters, but maybe that's the way the director wanted it. After a while, we do find out who wants the land, and why.You could look at it like this, when you first meet someone, you really don't know them. Takes a while. That is how I would describe this movie. Takes a while to get to the bottom of it.Maybe the director wanted it that way. To slow for my taste.

274,gkbazalo,Music and symbolism,10,2 May 2002,"What's left to say about this incredible western?  As usual, each character have his or her own musical theme, but--not as usual-- the themes combine in ways that indicate the interactions and symbolism of each character. Harmonica and Frank are emotionally and thematically joined at the hip. Their themes intertwine just as their life lines do.  Cheyenne's theme, which can be, at different times, either comical or threatening, reflects his outmoded lifestyle, which we see being replaced by the lifestyle of the town folk.  Jill is the whore who becomes the mother (or midwife) of the emerging civilization being born in the desert with the coming of the railroad.  Her theme is also the theme of that civilization.  Watch the scene where she leaves the railroad station, hires a driver and rides through the railroad town.  This is not the archetypal western town of Hollywood with a saloon and a few horses tied up at the hitching post.  It is a bustling, living entity, with shops, public transportation, respectable women and men going about their business.  And Jill, although  she comes from the ""big city""--New Orleans--, is quite pleased by it all.  By the end of the film, she will be the founder of the next town on the railroad's path.   Relax, get to know each of the four major characters, listen to the music, and don't rush through it. This is an epic!",Once Upon a Time in the West
275,Ismaninb,"Leone's worst, as far as I have seem them",4,7 January 2007,"In my opinion Sergio Leone is one of the best directors ever. But Once upon a time in the West is his failure. Whenever I watch a Leone movie, I am prepared for a slow pace - and am surprised that it is actually steady. OutW really is too slow. There is no typical Leone tension build up. The final shoot out is a meager copy of the two previous ones with Lee van Cleef involved. Henry Fonda is not a convincing villain like Van Cleef and Volonte (Fonda - and Leone - took revenge though with My name is Nobody). Charles Bronson is not underacting like Clint Eastwood - Bronson is simply not acting. Wallach is missing - I cannot even remember what kind of character Cheyenne is. There is no character development. There are no tricks, black humour, double and triple crosses. In fact there is hardly a story. I am happy to learn, that I am not the only one to prefer the Dollar movies. I also prefer all the movies Leone directed after this on, as far as I have seen them (the most). In fact I have been thinking of rating OutW with a 1. But that is not fair. The opening scene with the three hit men waiting for the train is absolutely brilliant, with Leone's typical eye for the detail.",Once Upon a Time in the West
276,AppleBlossom,Poetry on celluloid,8,11 June 2006,"I finally watched Once Upon A Time In The West almost a year after buying the DVD...yeah I know; how could I...SHAME ON ME!!! What a 'Western' though...after hearing so much about it my expectation was very high and it accomplished to capture me with its slow alluring magnetism. Such is this film from Sergio Leone...a definite classic, one that will be in your memory long after you see it. The visuals and the music go hand in hand and what can I say about the cast; gees Fonda is outstanding. He gambled with going against type and portrays a rather evil character) which undoubtedly pays off and his performance (I would say) is absolutely mesmerizing. I read from the pamphlet included inside the DVD cover that Sergio concentrates a lot on facial expression close-ups....every detail is visible. Looking at the characters faces we see so much, far more than mere words can divulge; they say, ""through a man's eyes is the window to his soul"". I want to quote what Sergio himself said about the film which is stated on the inside of the DVD cover; - ""The rhythm of the film was intended to create the sensation of the last gasps that a person takes just before dying. Once Upon A Time In The West was, FROM START TO FINISH, A DANCE OF DEATH. There have only been a handful of films which can boast the phrase ' poetry on celluloid ' and 'West' is one of them. The storyline isn't new (although a good one nonetheless), certainly for a Western, but there's so much going for it...the entire production is so detailed and the cast outstanding you won't worry about it. There are several main characters throughout, although Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) attracts all of them to her from one incident which occurs in the beginning of the film. The ramifications from this one single act propels the entire plot to the inevitable conclusion of a showdown between good and evil. The music score heightens the atmosphere and also the predominant background sound effects. I noticed in the first instance those attributes played a major part enveloping the surrounding story together...Ennio Morricone sure did his homework on this aspect. Who could ask for more from the creator of such haunting and catchy themes as 'The Good, the Bad And The Ugly', A Fistful of Dollars' and 'For a Few Dollars More'. There's no doubt in my mind 'Once Upon A Time In The West' should be seen at least once, it is a remarkable Western. 8.5/10",Once Upon a Time in the West
277,ruffinelli_ro,Great movie!,9,7 June 2010,"I am not a big fan of westerns. The good guys were plain old good guys and the bad ones were bad just for the sake of being evil. That is precisely what the ""spagheti western"" genre is against. I feel more involved in a story if either the main character or one of the supporting roles is authentic (Of course, it will be better if both are). That's why I like most of Leone's work.This case is not the exception. The characters were really great. I think that the great actors were an excellent choice. The plot was complicated and smart (Which I look for in a movie). The script was pretty good. The photography was great also, even for a movie this old.Despite its long runtime (I'm not precisely a big fan of long movies), it felt all well focused. The plot unraveled in a really interesting way until we see one of the most tense scenes in westerns (The climax of this film).Overall, this film is definitely a masterpiece. It's one of those movies that let you thinking about them long after the credits rolled. If you liked this title, then you should check out other Leone's films.",Once Upon a Time in the West
278,berberian00-276-69085,Sergio Leone was anathema to film audience,10,15 October 2013,"Imagine yourself living in the 1970s and watching ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (1968). Then go live in 2003 to watch a 2-Disc ""Special Collector's Edition"" released by Paramount, with a running time of 165 minutes. Finally, let's dwell in a world of 2013 and try to watch the legendary film again - obviously the threads of a long story should stitch together, but does it? I may seem stupid but Sergio Leone's work has always stupefied me and thus while he made only 6 full feature movies. Those are the ""Man With No Name"" saga (3 gunslinger movies with actor Clint Eastwood) and the ""Once Upon a Time"" saga (3 historical movies about America's past from end of 19th and first half of 20th cc.) He didn't learn to speak English in his lifetime and communicated with his American actors by broken attempts at English, Italian or French. That is the reason, I reckon, why it is sometime impossible to recognize the plot in his working and these are quizzes that the titular took with him in grave.On summary Sergio Leone spent his whole life living and working at Cinecittà Studios in Rome. That was the European equivalent to Hollywood Studios in America. Amazing as it is, Leone never made shooting in America - the most he did were some exterior scenes in New York for his last movie, everything else was shot in Italy and Spain. People that knew him remember how he always walked around in a long robe like Roman senator. I saw him alive only once in a 6 min. documentary from the bonus disk at hand, this with additional material on ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" directed by Lancelot Narayan.On to the movie. I don't underestimate anything written or said about this western which undoubtfully sticks at top 10 westerns for all times. The issue here lies elsewhere and I am not asking the simpleton to tell me what's the story about. Now, I spent whole day watching the movie and looking through the documentaries - one thing that is not clear starts in the beginning and that is why a gang of three are waiting for Charles Bronson (Harmonica) in the opening scene. If Frank knew Harmonica, which he doesn't, why should he send men to kill a foreigner. I think here that the opening scene should be sequence to the second scene - where Frank kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne. The third scene is easy to fabricate - Jill McBain, Brett's illegal wife who married him previously, arrives as owner of the land with intention to sell (but she is a prostitute and why should she move elsewhere except if she doesn't go into business).I continue with the illogical plot as if we are in Agatha Christie's thriller. Appears Morton (a Hercule Poirot type that moves in shackles because he is crippled, played by Italian stooge Gabriele Ferzetti). He is supposed to be a rich railway Baron that hires henchmen to work against each other. He wants to buy land before government regulators arrive at the district and then resell with profit. The sheriff in local dust town works for him and administers an auction for McBain's land that is precious because lies on railway and have water holes. So at the auction proper Harmonica takes the highest bid at 5000$ which he receive as premium for Cheyenne. The latter is taken prisoner by train (which train is unclear, whether Morton's coach or a regular to dust town) but subsequently he escapes with two accomplices and kills Morton and his henchmen. Simultaneously, Frank arranges a duel with Harmonica after the rest of the henchmen are killed in skirmish gunfight. Harmonica draws faster in a final duel and kills Frank (because in flashback shot it becomes evident he is seeking revenge for his hanged brother). Final scene is where Harmonica and Cheyenne say ""Good-bye"" to Mrs. McBain and while they can't share her love it is evident that she is happy with so many men around. Post finale, Cheyenne dies from wound in the guts made by Mr. Choo Choo (Morton).This is it. I think Sergio Leone was Neanderthal in cinema and his stories should remain unsurpassed art phenomenon for generation to come. Take care!",Once Upon a Time in the West
279,K_Todorov,Immortal,10,16 March 2007,"""Once Upon A Time In The West"" IS the tale of the West. It is the ultimate tribute to every movie of the genre. Sergio Leone's masterpiece captures all the themes that were recurrent in westerns during that time: love, revenge, money, the railroad, the frontier and converges them into an epic, poetic representation of the ideal West, the one we've all heard and read about. The opening scene is a slow gut-crushing build up of tension as three gunman sit and wait at a run-down train station in the desert. We are not given an explanation why, all we do know is that when that train comes something's going to happen. During these minutes of anticipation barely a word is spoken, it is as if time has stopped. Yet Leone like an artist, paints this moment with stunning detail. Every move, every expression a character makes is so carefully choreographed that it makes these three men shine, it makes them memorable even if their participation in the movie extends to this scene only. The camera shots range from extreme close ups to breathtaking shots of the landscape creating an epic and yet personal feel. The traditional introduction with a musical theme is thrown away instead Morricone employs a different kind of music, one that relies entirely on environmental sounds (the drops of water, the fly, the windmill's creaking) to create a proper mood to these minutes of anticipation. The culmination of that music is the sound of the train coming. Signaling the end of the three gunmen's wait. The train stops at the station to refill, they gather and await, anticipating that their target will get off it. No one does. The train refilled starts it's engine once again, preparing to leave the run-down station. The three men decide to do the same but as soon they turn their backs and head to the horses the environmental sounds are disrupted by something unnatural, something not made by machines or wind, but by man. It is the sound of the harmonica, playing a dark, bitter tune. The gunmen turn around trying to figure out where the sound is coming from, they watch the train wagons slowly move away revealing the man with the harmonica. He gazes them and continues playing for awhile. The end of the tune marks the final moments of the scene as the man with the harmonica exchanges a few lines of dialogue with the gunmen. Finding their answer unsatisfying a new type of silence begins, accompanied by a new musical piece by Morricone. Simple in it's composition and straight forward in it's increasingly menacing sound it helps build up the nerve-wrecking tension of these final moments of life. The high point of the entire scene, the moment of violence, lasts a little more than a second as Harmonica fires three shots, one for each gunmen. Killing them, but not before one is able to shoot back, he is hit near the shoulder and falls to the ground. Silence. Only the creaking sound of the windmill is heard. Harmonica regains conscience, he bandages his arm and leaves. End scene.The reason why I described this scene is because it serves as an overview for the entire movie. Not only because it demonstrates the directing technique Leone uses but also because in it's core it holds three of the plot elements that make ""Once Upon A Time In The West"", the train, the water used for refilling the train and the harmonica. These devices become the central objects that motivate the main characters and as the movie progresses we see how they interweave with each other, we see how they are connected. Sergio Leone has e certain philosophy when it comes to making films. His idea of entertainment doesn't come from the violence he puts in films. While most directors glamorize the on screen death, turning it into the central part of the enjoyment. Leone creates entertainment from the build up of tension, the of anticipation leading towards the violence, not the killing itself. We saw him experimenting with that idea in ""The Dollars Trilogy"" with every next film becoming more and more closer to the ideal. Here. Here is where he perfected that. Leone takes his time to introduce us to the characters, he makes them interesting, he makes them seem alive. Giving us all the more reason to care when the final confrontation takes place. He has an uncanny ability to make even the most insignificant character memorable in his own. It just makes it easy to see the level of detail, the hard work the entire cast had put into this movie. Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Claudia Cardinale, Jason Robards all put a performance of a lifetime.""Once Upon A Time In The West"" is a staggering piece of art that has withstood the test of time and it rightfully deserves it's place as one of the greatest movies ever made. Sergio Leone's tribute is an epic Opera, honoring the myths and legends of the West.An immortal movie",Once Upon a Time in the West

I was blown away by this film even after having seen it a couple of times. It is a western that I would like to believe could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their interests. The casting and acting is marvelous and the story makes you think. Of course to see Henry Fonda in one of the most evil portrayals of all time is almost worth it alone, but there is so much more. Leone displayed his unique ability for intensely powerful dramatic moments increased to the limit by Ennio Morricone's tremendous score.

Henry Fonda is without peer as the matter-of-fact, murderous Frank - his blue eyes chilling the viewer with pooling cruelty - perhaps the best performance as a villain in the history of film. Jason Robards employs his magical voice and considerable talent to fine effect. Claudia Cardinale is solidly good and good-looking. And I was surprised Charles Bronson could perform this well; I'll never sell him short again. Assisted by the soaring female vocal track, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is tinged with the poignancy of an elegy even as it strikes a note of hope.

282,garrettderose,Best introduction of any movie ever,8,11 July 2009,"The beginning of this film where the gang is waiting at the train station - is probably the most well done introduction to a movie I have seen yet.I'm just discovering Leone's westerns. This is a great example of how a western can be done right. Some of the scenes though were shocking and brutal. The ginger-family getting gunned down was horrific. When it panned up to introduce Henry Fonda as said gunman, was even more horrific. It's a shock to see such an evil character played by somebody who's usually a nice person.Charles Bronson's character is interesting, though a bit overdone. I guess that's called being ""stylized"". I know this is an Italian production. The flashback scene with him and his brother... holy crap. That was as brutal as it gets. Shocking. There's a few parts of this film where I was surprised to be so shocked.The only complaint that i have is the god-awful clash of music. The stylish single-note guitar tune that played often in the beginning was AMAZING! Very dramatic.Now... the lame 1970's Day's of our Lives 'string' symphonic composition that plays during the widow's scenes (riding through town) could be completely taken out of the film and it'd get another star out of me.So yeah, the music is my only complaint.

285,tobydale,A superb film,10,24 September 2020,"I consider this to be one of the greatest films of all time.Why is it one of the greatest films of all time? Why; because everything in and around it contribute strongly to make the experience greater than the sum of the parts.The photography is superb; Leone's use of Techniscope brings the magnificence and drama of Arizona/Utah/(Spain!) to front and centre. The landscapes and long tracking shots are stunning. Leone also uses the full-frame close ups of the faces of the characters to invite the viewer into the powerful emotions of each. We can see every pore in the faces of Harmonica (Bronson) Jill (Cardinale), Cheyenne (Robards) and Frank (Fonda); complete with his wonderful blue eyes. This device is akin to us looking at a mirror and seeing ourselves; in effect, we are invited to see ourselves as each of the characters, invited into their turmoil. It's brilliant.The music by Ennio Morricone is superb. Truly one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. Leone uses this (which was written and recorded before filming commenced) to tremendous effect - building rise and fall into the imagery and storytelling. Leone simply lets the music do the talking.Some have commented that the story is ""thin"". I don't agree. Better to look at the journey of each of the characters. I include the railway as a character too. Jill is redeemed; she comes out to the west looking to make a new start and to purify herself. It doesn't look like she will succeed - but by the very end, she does. Harmonica has been appallingly and shockingly damaged in early life. His redemption is vengence. Cheyenne is a bad guy who, in fact, is hugely improved by his contact with Jill early on in the film. Jill is his redemption. Frank is just unremittingly evil - sadistic and vicious. There is no possible redemption for him. Morton the railway baron is not redeemed either and neither should he be for his murderous sponsorship of Frank. As for the railway; it ploughs on into the west - into the future.A superb film.",Once Upon a Time in the West
286,tom-darwin,"One Plate of Western Spaghetti with Reverence, Hold the Schmaltz, Comin' Right Up!",10,13 April 2006,"If he had had Sergio Leone's access to a convincing desert, swarthy extras & a couple of affordable Yanks, Akira Kurosawa might have made ""Yojimbo"" & ""Seven Samurai"" into Westerns himself, denying Leone & others the chance to interpret him. But with a big budget and a new vision (a trilogy that would culminate in ""Once Upon A Time in America""), Leone makes a film of his very own that stands even with the best of Kurosawa's or anyone else's. New Orleans ""lady"" Jill(Cardinale, never more beautiful) inherits a patch of worthless, empty desert in the path of an approaching railroad & suddenly finds that she's of great interest to tubercular railroad baron Morton (Ferzetti), his icy hired gun Frank (Fonda), aging bandit Cheyenne (Robards) and a shadowy, harmonica-tooting drifter (Bronson). Long as a summer's day & detailed as the Cistine Chapel, the film never wavers from its sad, beautiful theme: the fall of the free, rugged, wild Old West to the inexorable onslaught of machines, finance, and Order. Despite long stretches of magnificently photographed silence & the presence of the taciturn Bronson, this Western is surprisingly talkative. It wallows a little, as when Cheyenne tells Jill about his mother (give us a break), or when Frank & the drifter discuss the inhumanity of capitalism (wanna read ""The Communist Manifesto"" 'round the campfire tonight, fellas?). Most of the dialog, though, is as colorfully illustrative as the brilliant Techniscope photography, which depicts Monument Valley better than even John Ford's best (Ford never put Claudia Cardinale in the middle of it, did he?). Lionel Stander, who gave so many fine performances in countless low-budget flicks, finally gets a movie worthy of his unique talent. The always excellent Robards sets the tone of the film as the world-weary badman who see his Old West world rapidly shrinking. Peckinpah's outlaws face the same doom in the contemporary, less lush & more thrilling ""Wild Bunch."" Ferzetti's Morton, though dying in body, represents unstoppable, industrialized civilization & the invisible but matchless might of money (""Almost like holdin' a gun,"" Frank tells us, ""only much more powerful""). In his only bad-guy role (unless you count ""On Golden Pond""), Fonda creates what might be the most chilling Western blackguard ever. It's a wonder that the greatest Western villains were played by atypical stars, including roly-poly Burl Ives in ""The Big Country"" & all-American John Wayne in ""Red River."" Fonda's Frank outdoes them both. The film's end after its magnificent, gripping climax drags on too long & descends into sappiness. But the long, nearly wordless opening scene (veteran characters Elam & Strode) is one of the best starts to any movie, using only photography, sound & minimal physical action to set a tone of both comic laziness & slowly building anticipation. Morricone's score is as impressive as any of his others, more haunting than usual & dated with a very '60s electric guitar. Even with Leone's sardonic humor (Cheyenne's comment on the rate of inflation since Judas betrayed Christ is classic), this film shares the thoughtful tone of Ford or Mann Westerns, as well as that of ""Once Upon a Time in America,"" rather than the trademark ghostly wryness of Leone's other Westerns, including the subsequent ""Duck, You Sucker."" But it's also one of those all-day, luscious escapes that Italian filmmakers (and sort-of Italians, like ""Godfather"" Coppola) seem to do better than anyone. Among Westerns or any movies, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a once-in-a-lifetime classic.",Once Upon a Time in the West
287,captnemo,This is only a good movie. Why all the hoopla?,6,13 November 2003,"I saw this at a revival house for my first viewing. I'd have to say that this was much better than the typical Italian western, which is 2 hours of people staring at each other and odd sounding gunshots. The cinematography was beautiful, as were the sets and costumes. The acting was pretty good, especially Fonda and Robards. What is missing was either a screenplay that filled 2 1/2 hours of screen time or an editor to cut out about 45 minutes of superfluous material. This is no masterpiece, but it is a film worth watching. Leone will be remembered as someone who made overlong good movies, but no masterpieces.

In this film, more than any other of his that I've seen, Leone shows the influence of Kurosawa and the Japanese tradition with extended shots and constant use of silence and immobility as devices for setting mood.  The opening sequence, for example, stretches to the point of unbearability.  Something is about to happen but we don't know what, or when, and the suspense and tension grows with every passing second of near silence.  After a brief flurry of action, all is, once again, silent.As _Casino_ is to gangster films, so _Once Upon a Time in the West_ is to Westerns - a sprawling epic on a grand scale executed with great skill.

292,wgingery,Quite a bad film,2,12 August 2019,"I saw this when it first came out and a recent viewing hasn't changed anything: I walked out then - one of the very few times when I did - and I almost didn't make it through the restored blu-ray reissue.First of all, it is not really a 'western.' A 'western' is based on frontier myth about European settlers replacing the 'savages' and transforming the American 'wilderness' into civilization. Americans lost interest in the 'western' with the growing recognition in the 1960s that Native Americans were not savages and, accordingly, the American West was not a wilderness.What it is, then, is an Italian fable in Western trappings. And in fact it has more to do with the Sicily of 'The Godfather II"" than with the American West. Many have commented, for instance, that it is 'operatic,' with Mexican-Americans standing in for peasants, railroad magnates for land holders and the outlaws for the 'banditti-for-hire.'Even so, it leaves a lot to be desired. It's an action film without much action, a character drama with 'Western' puppets, a story that is simply an elaborate excuse for a series of 'greatest hits' confrontations, a film littered with second-hand references and homages....P.S. I tried giving it a second - no, third - chance, but gave up because, when I wasn't fast-forwarding, I kept laughing in the wrong places.",Once Upon a Time in the West
293,judemcrobbie,"Not quite the Good, the Bad and the Ugly",8,2 March 2021,"It's almost a psychological thriller as opposed to the gunslinging cowboy stereotypes. There are very little set pieces compared to usual, more opting to develop character and let the plot unfold from there. What makes it a psychological thriller compared to a generic western is how every one is play 4-D chess with one another. This both helps and hinders the movie as sometimes it is so well conveyed and sometimes not so much. It does have all the generic western traits, quick draws, saloons etc but it also has a sort of godfather feel as there is one person really pulling all the strings.
The movie does kind of suffer from tonal ambiguity and inconsistencies as the editing skips from a hard hitting scene to a comedy scene with no in between.
Sergio Leone has a monopoly on western movies and awesome endings as he culminates all the plot points together in a big finale where 9 times out of 10 it will put a moment of realisation in your mind.
Jill McBain has an arc of nothing really. She doesn't grow or develop in anyway. This really interests me as her arc does not involve her at all, choosing to find out things about her that she may not want people to know.
The suspense in this movie is mortifying as it uses the silence so well. Three men standing across in long trench coats as one man appears from behind the train shouldn't make you squirm but it does, and then top it off with one of the best one liners.

This is film is just like The Good The Bad and The ugly. This one epic 2 hour 45 minute Western classic. Henry Fonda good as always gives one his best performance. Jason Robards gives a great performance and also Claudia Cardinale does a good job. Sergio Leone always does a good job and this film is no exception.

296,taikman,"A wonderful film, if you can ignore the sexism",8,3 April 2002,"I have seen some great Westerns ('Shane', 'High Noon', 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', 'Unforgiven', 'The Wild Bunch') but this may be the best of them all. There are so many memorable images: killers coming out of the dust towards a small boy, long coats swinging ominously; a crippled man crawling away into the desert; a boy with a harmonica in his mouth, his brother standing on his shoulders, a noose around his neck. All riveted to the mind by Enio Morricone's score. Except for '2001: A Space Odyssey' I have never seen a movie that uses music and silence so effectively. The cinematography, score, editing and directing are all amazing and the acting is also strong - other reviews have given them the praise they deserve, so I will skip to why I only gave this film an 8.It's SO sexist. Not that the central female character is weak; on the contrary she's tough, pragmatic and clever enough to match any of the men in the movie. The problem is that too often she acts like a typical Western woman: she seeks a strong man to protect her, and is always at the beck and call of the film's hard men. The attitude of the men is summed up when Cheyenne tells her to go out amoung the men working on the railway and, if any of them touch her backside, let it go because 'they've deserved it'. A little sexual harrassment is fine after a hard days work. This is probably a reflection of the era, but I saw nothing in the film to say that Leone didn't endorse that attitude. There is one particularly nasty scene where Harmonica seems about to rape the woman, but stops and tells her to get him some water from the well. Why is this so bad? Because our hero is shown as deliberately putting the woman in her place - basically telling her I could have had you and I could have you any time I want: remember that. Be nice and do what I say. I found that hard to stomach in a 'good guy'.The other big flaw in the version I saw was right was, and I'll try not to give away any spoilers, at the end when a central character dies. It doesn't fit the plot or the pacing of the movie, and feels totally like a scene edited out by Leone that got reinserted in the new version.All that aside, a classic.",Once Upon a Time in the West
297,talkymeat,Every Shot is a Work of Art.,10,1 August 2010,"Jill has recently married a man named Brett McBain and she is going to live with him and his family. Upon arriving at the McBain home she finds that they have all been slain by a vicious criminal named Frank, the muscle for a railroad tycoon. Frank framed a man named Cheyenne and his band of outlaws and everyone believes that they did it. Cheyenne must get his revenge on Frank, protect Jill, and work with a strange man with a harmonica who has his own score to settle.Once Upon a Time in the West is quite possibly the most expertly directed movie of all time. Every single scene is so stylistically shot that it is truly a wonder to behold. Sergio Leone uses a combination of long shots that show off the impressive western landscape with amazing facial close-ups that capture the emotions and expert acting of the wonderful cast. Leone directs with such finesse he could take a scene of someone brushing their teeth and turn it into cinematic gold. The first scene where Leone combines everyday sounds to create music is inspired as well as being an amazing example of slowly building tension to an exciting climax.Possibly just as important if not more is Ennio Morricone's beautiful score, which is the best he's every done. His music can breath such life into a character or scene that you don't even need dialog. Morricone's compositions pack such emotional weight that they can transform a scene. A happy scene could be sad, a sad scene could be frightening and all the emotions in between. If a pictures is worth a thousand words, Morricone's music is worth ten thousand words. The cast is excellent as well. Specifically Henry Fonda in his deeply haunting and extremely out of character turn as the ruthless Frank. A blue-eyed sweet talking villain is a rarity and a treasure. This detail is wielded to perfection by Leone as he will use a close-up on Fonda's face to accentuate his blue eyes. His clothes are dirty, his face is dirty and amidst all that grime shining beautifully are his two blue eyes. Like two oceans in the middle of the desert sand. The script is also amazing and it deals with so many cultural and personal battles; corruption, greed, the dying of the ""man,"" and the mechanizing of the West, and so many more. Some will complain about its length and pace, but like many great movies it gets better with multiple viewings. What can seem unnecessary and overlong oftentimes is just detailed and becomes more and more beautiful the more you see it. Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the greatest films ever made and it solidifies Morricone and Leone as some of the all time greats.",Once Upon a Time in the West
298,michaelheiser-25099,Tremendous,7,5 November 2021,"""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is the poignant chronicle of a time that has passed, a time between tradition and progress, it's the demise of the Old West and the majestic flag it raised. The pioneer family is symbolically eliminated by the corporatist world. It's all about making profit and only a ruthless and heartless person like Frank could have accepted to kill a family for greed, what no other outlaw from John Ford's movies would have done, except a Native. The child was killed as a continuation of the McBain threat and Jill's sentence wouldn't have been suspended if she didn't have some assets of her own. Claudia Cardinale is the emotional core of the film, with this mix of false strong-mindedness and wisdom to know how to use charm as a survival instinct in a dark and savage world with no place for 'little people'. The light of hope that kills off this cynical mood is incarnated by the providential help of Harmonica and Cheyenne.Cheyenne plays a significant role as the counterpart of Fonda's Frank, an outlaw with principles and heart, the good Old West, his theme sounds like a playful saloon' piano tune and in a way, he seems to exist only to provide a connection with the past, for Jill so we can know more about her, he's her link to the past. And it's tragically ironic that he is shot by the crippled Morton, not even in a spot that would have made his misery short. His agony, magnificently expressed by Jason Robards, symbolizes the agony of the Old West myth, and elevates ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" as the masterpiece of Western revisionism.",Once Upon a Time in the West
299,IMDBcinephile,Not Leone's Best but Certainly an Aesthetically Precious Movie,7,23 June 2011,"When Leone was propositioned to work on this movie, it was green lit through the lucrative funds that he would then invest on his dream picture but, however, it appeared that there could be another string of sequels that would watermark his name across another trilogy. ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" illustrated the misers enabling an ethically ambiguous Eastwood to appear in good light; the amazing thing is that with our chasm to this, he is the best character in the movie as far as moral compass is concerned and realising this consciously is weird for me as he is a swindler and ruffian and yet with those qualities, he still manages to weigh on our empathy with him; this is what really gives him that perplexity and enigma that is so grounded in these movies.Incidentally while I watched one of the segments in the movie I kept on thinking invariably about the fact that the outlaw wasn't shooting Claudette's character that it was only a shrewd attempt at keeping her either faltered or of course for his own needs. I was thinking ""god, man, stop waving that thing around! You aren't going to use it"" - then the scene after that it elapsed into Frank's carriage and we hear those really cool and cynical words - ""People scare better in death"" - that was just one of the best responses that I ever heard and felt from a movie.""Once Upon a Time in the West"" stars Henry Fonda as Frank, Claudia Cardinale as the Widow and Charles Bronson in a role that I don't think mimics Eastwoods at all which I found really refreshing. The plot - through the beginning it left you alien in the west as we establish the bad characters. One of the running ideas in these movies are the characters actions - and they are really cavalier from the beginning, lazily lying around and only letting a fly roam around until it's trapped!The nuance with that harmonica that Bronson plays is never even considered from the beginning, so I was forced to assume that what he was doing with it was singing a wavering note just before he goes in for the kill. But this is what strikes me with Leone - he never really denies the significance of any apparatus - he wants it to be grounded in. Like for example, when Claudia tries to look for the thing that looks almost like a train set thing that represents it in toy form. I digress from that though. Unfortunately, it does take some time to be accessible but perhaps that was Leone's myth that this is an atypical western. While it still plays out the revenge idea, it requires music to make it strategically orchestrated.My favourite parts in the movie are Ennio's Score, the principle photography - it marvels me how wonderful that escarpment looks and then how it is a pedestal for fighting and I also find the outlaw to be somewhat like Eli Wallach, not in counterpart but rather in culture.Another thing makes this distinctive is the decision to put a more heroine orientated character in the boots of the forlorn woman; the death of your family either impels you to retribution or it bound you in the safety of your own house; however my expectation for that anti- heroine turn of behaviour was largely downplayed.Still with the mellow words of Bronson mixed with the brazen and incorrigible manner and threat of Frank make it eventually a very engrossing film - even though you know who wins, it's the mental subjectivity of his prey that orchestrates the mood and then brings the cause to creedence with answers... It shows its influence in Kill Bill 2's use of soundtrack and the way it's choreographed in fighting manoeuvres - even the bride - in fact, the whole incarnation, as we know it, is in debt to the ingenuity of Sergio Leone.""It's not like that"" - Yes, Bronson, we need this scene to navigate into the duality of the fighting prowess and tumult to be part of either the cerebral or visceral channeling - which will it be. Bronson shows with this in mind that Frank is no business man - ""I'm Just a Man"" - Now Revelatory that he's a freeloader - his business is diminished and Frank proves that he is nothing but empty shallow bags of remorse.This movie is the forerunner to that wonderful ""Once Upon a Time in America"" and on that note, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is slightly longer then I thought was necessary, but it had so much panorama on the surface and it's a real uncompromising tail, never conforming to the John Wayne archetype (Don't get me wrong, Wayne is an icon, but he was just canon as an actor up to that point).",Once Upon a Time in the West

Most of the westerns I've seen was when I was a kid and my father saw them on tv and I found them all terribly boring, but this one stands as the best western I've seen! What made this good for me, I guess was the plot. When the climax came I thought to myself ""Goddamn, this is evil stuff! Great movie! The best old movie I've seen (except for Chaplin's ""Limelight"" of course, which is the best movie I've ever seen)!!"". What dragged it a bit down was that it dragged a bit out after that. I think it could have still maintained the ""great"" position if it had just ended after the shoot-out or when Harmonica came into the house and said he had to leave. I didn't really need to see his companion, who also had to leave, die. I didn't feel anything for that guy, so that was just a bit irrelevant. It still stands as one of the best older movies I've seen though. ""Casablanca"" still tops it though, I guess (and of course ""Limelight""). I also feel that this is one of those movies where the music and the images came together perfectly! I sat several times with goosebumps when seeing this movie, although I knew Morricone's ""The man with the harmonica"" when I saw the film (I have the song myself). I usually use a 6 point star system when rating movies and stuff and 4 is for a good movie and that translates to 6,66 on a 10-point scale, but I'll be generous and give it an 8!

305,mhoney-1,"Excellent cinematography, an intriguing story, and memorable characterizations",10,2 June 2004,"First, I have a confession to make. This is the first Sergei Leone film I have ever seen (unless you count catching part of his 1984 gangster flick on TV one time). The film takes its time getting to know the people, and it takes just about that long to figure out just what is going on. But once everything is said and done, this is one heck of an epic western. Henry Fonda stars in a rare turn as Frank, a villain so charming one could almost forget he's a cold-hearted killer. He works for a railroad baron doing his dirty work, but he's starting to move up in the world, much to the chagrin of his employer, Mr. Morton. Frank is responsible for the massacre of an Irish landholder and his family, shortly before the man's new wife, Claudia Cardinale, arrives from New Orleans. The murder was set up to look like Cheyenne, (a wise-cracking Jason Robards) a notorious outlaw, is responsible. In another story thread, a mysterious stranger who plays a harmonica (Charles Bronson) is after Frank in a revenge plot that is not revealed until the end. Harmonica and Cheyenne end up teaming together, because each of them has there own reason to want Frank or Morton dead, be it an old score or protecting a reputation.Halfway through the movie, The Widow McBain (Cardinale) loses my sympathy. She's a whore from New Orleans, and as is revealed with Frank, one willing to do anything to survive. Bronson plays an average Bronson role, while Jason Robards nearly steals the show as an outlaw who shoots his mouth off more than his gun. Fonda injects his character with a kind of sympathetic psychosis, so that while he understands guns better than he understands money, and uses them to cause great damage, he ends up not much worse than Bronson or Robards.",Once Upon a Time in the West
306,panchodh_12,"In the West time doesn't fly, only bullets do.",4,26 January 2015,"In the West men take their time. There's nothing hurrying them, as every day is the same as the other, and what cannot be done today, can be done tomorrow. So nothing presses you to answer quickly, or even talk. You can think a lot before speaking, and the other will wait for you. There are two things that do pass quickly: bullets and trains. The first one was the symbol of power (the power of disrupting the monotonous life of the West), until the latter came. As it's beautifully said by Frank: sitting behind Morton's desk feels almost like holding a gun, but more powerful. Morton's Locomotive brought, above all, History and Progress to the West. Time started to run, and bullets cannot stop time.I think that what amuses us from the Wild West is exactly that: the struggle to stop time, to conquest the unconquerable: eternity. The fight between that pre-Modern time where the most powerful ruled (like the adjective Wild said: it was the Law of the Jungle), and the unstoppable Locomotive of History; that feeling of emptiness of knowing that what was once the Reign of tough guys like Charles Bronson, today there's nothing but Highways and Casinos.Once upon a time in the West is the perfect archetype of Spaghetti Westerns, and it has all the tropes a Western should have: the tough, thoughtful good guy, the secondary good guy, ugly, that says everything the protagonist doesn't, the bad guy who's almost as good shooting as the good guy, the coward businessman who wants to build the railroad to the Pacific at any cost, the hot woman that makes the plot move forward (not quite the damsel in distress, but another as patriarchal trope: the hot woman who doesn't mind f*cking her way out of life, that seems strong and independent but that in the end is always submitted to men, just in another way). It has a final pistol gunfight where the quickest to shot wins, it has amazing trademark music that marks the appearance of the good guy across the movie.But it's slow. It's damn slow. Perhaps it just wanted to inspire the feelings I describe at the beginning about time in the West, perhaps it just owes itself to a time when going to the cinema was quite an event, and you could keep people marveled in front of a big screen for three hours. Today, however, it's not so good that after the first 30 minutes nothing has happened and only a few lines have been delivered.

Sure there are goofs but name an all-time classic that didn't have one and I am sure hundreds will be telling you where to spot them.It's long but I wouldn't have wanted it any other way, as they say pictures can say a thousand words and there were many scenes where you fully understood what was going on.It's a thinkers Movie and like my wife some people can't be bothered to watch and the scenes or the actions of each actor. Charles Bronson is at his best with his smiling face and while some believe he cant act I can see a thousand things he is saying with his Eyes, volcano face and his actions in all his movies.The scene in the bar when Robard's meets Bronson for the first time after just escaping from custody was sheer brilliance as you knew Jason could pick who is a ""Real"" man and who is a gutless back stabber and it also showed if your brave but not stupid no-one will make a fool out of you and you gain others respect. Yes that's what a lot of people miss, the words that are not said. The idea of a melody for each character was fantastic, while I have seen that in some movies I don't believe I have seen an movie before 1968 and in fact I still haven't seen a music score to come close. At the start you see this scene where all the surrounds was playing music and I felt as if i was in this lonely station for real waiting to shoot Bronson.Tarantino quoted Leone as his all-time hero and I would agree he is one of the best directors and it's a shame he made so few while others made so many.",Once Upon a Time in the West
309,TheOneManBoxOffice,"Aside from the Dollars trilogy, it's one of Leone's best spaghetti westerns.",10,9 June 2019,"After director Sergio Leone's famous ""Dollars"" trilogy (consisting of 1964's A Fistful of Dollars, 1965's For a Few Dollars More, and 1966's The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly) wrapped up, he figured that he was officially done with making spaghetti western pictures. However, as you can tell, this did not turn out to be the case, and thank god for that.Once Upon a Time in the West, released in 1968, is a spaghetti western that should not be confused with being a part of the ""Dollars"" films, in that there's no Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, or Eli Wallach in sight, and instead of United Artists, the film was released under Paramount Pictures. Still, it would be as influential and intense as Leone's prior films, and as someone who loves westerns in general, I would rank it as one of the best.The film centers around a woman named Jill (Claudia Cardinalle), who was once married to a farmhand named McBane, only to become a widow upon arrival to Sweetwater Ranch, as she finds her newlywed husband and all three of his children dead, shot by a murdurous assassin simply named Frank (Henry Fonda, in his first controversial role as the bad guy). Her life and land, which contains the only source of water for miles, are in jeopardy as the railroad gets closer to completion. A desperado named Cheyenne (Jason Robards), though notorious in the territory and accompanied by a gang, is mistakenly labeled a prime suspect. He offers his services to protect her and her land to find the real killer, which she eventually accepts upon realization that he didn't do it. Additionally, a mysterious harmonica-playing gunslinger (Charles Bronson) joins in to help Jill, as he too is hellbent on hunting Frank down for an unknown reason.This film has all of the spaghetti western traits you'd expect from Leone. Much of it is beautifully shot in Techniscope (like GBU), lots of long shots and tense moments, an epic score by Ennio Morricone, the works. It would also serve as the start of another film trilogy revolving around three time periods in history that toughened a nation. Right as the movie begins, you know you're in for something interesting, as it centers around three bandits waiting at a train station (an homage to Fred Zinneman's 1952 film High Noon), and we stay on them as the opening credits roll for about 10 minutes with no music. Just the sound of natural ambiance, trickling water, and a rhytmic squeaking windmill. Now that's good tension build-up.Leone's ""Dollars"" trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West marked not only the beginning of a new era of western pictures, but also the end of the old era, showing the true grittiness and cold-blooded nature of the wild west. On its own, West is not only one of the best westerns I've sat through, but is also one of my personal favorite films of all time.

The beginning of Once Upon a Time in the West, in which three hired guns wait wordlessly at a train station for their target to arrive, is one of the best openings in cinema history. It is every bit as tense as Sergio Leone's finale in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, which he filmed two years earlier.But good as this Western revenge saga is, it is not as accessible and a good deal slower than the other films in Sergio Leone's series of Westerns (namely A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). What many reviewers describe as its ""operatic"" and ""epic"" nature can also be read as ""occasionally mawkish"" and ""overlong"".That said, this story earns its status as a classic for combining the gun-toting fun of westerns with the grand theme of the end of the Wild West, brought about by the arrival of the railroad. The railroad is the villain here as Henry Fonda plays an unscrupulous blue-eyed bad guy paid to force landowners to sell up cheap so the rails can pass through.Charles Bronson is a darker take on Leone's man-with-no-name character, but it is debatable whether that makes him more interesting then Clint Eastwood's version.The main characters each have a theme tune, opera-style, which is an interesting motif, but quite an irritating one when you have heard the harmonica tune for the 30th time.A fine movie, but claims that it changed the western any more than Leone's previous films or that it is better than The Good, the Bad and the Ugly should be taken with a pinch of salt.",Once Upon a Time in the West

He uses extreme close up shots to express the feelings of the characters whenever it is possible. All of those scenes are silent and much more expressive. He never fails to use beautiful soundtracks in those scenes. In Sergio Leone's films soundtracks are as important as any other component, therefore his collaboration with the composer Ennio Morricone was very important. Before, they have collaborated in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly as well, and if you have seen that film, you will understand the importance of his soundtracks.The story, atmosphere, casting, performances and the set are very strong from all points of views. When I think about it, there is absolutely nothing bad in this film. The story focuses mostly on six main characters. Henry Fonda, as Frank, Claudia Cardinale, as Jill Mc Bain, Jason Robards, as Manuel 'Cheyenne' Gutierrez, Charles Bronson, as Harmonica and Gabriele Ferzetti, as the railroad Baron Morton. The story turns around these characters. They all have different backgrounds but their stories are connected with at least one of the other characters. These relations build a complex progress in the story. Most of the time nothing makes sense, you don't know the answer for a particular move. You don't know why they did that. But, the revelation of these mysteries is explained in such ways that you get to understand why this film is considered a masterpiece and why it was selected for the preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant."" Such a complex story could not be told in a better way. After seeing all Sergio Leone's films, in my opinion this one is the best of all.There is a piece of land in the middle of the desert. This place holds some water reserves that are essential for trains to continue on their journey. A guy buys this land, thinking to build a station there and get rich. However, railroad Baron Morton hires Frank to scare that man and his family to move out from there. Frank kills this guy and his three children in disguise as the bandits of Cheyenne. A couple of days later, Jill arrives in town as the dead guy's married wife and claims this land. In the meantime, Cheyenne tries to find out about the murder and who frame it on him. He meets a stranger in a bar who calls himself as Harmonica. He is also after Frank for a completely different reason. The story evolves and reveals everything towards the end. Morton, the railroad Baron, lives in a luxury train designed for him. He is a disabled man and hires people to do things for him. His death is the most iconic and the saddest part of the film. While his ultimate goal was to go on a cruise ship and see the ocean, he dies near a little muddy water. His constant sadness on his face during the film is one of the best examples of how reflection of feelings are the most important thing in Leone's films. The similar expressions are visible also on the faces of Henri Fonda and Charles Bronson. Henri Fonda is one of the most experienced actors when it comes to western. In this film his character is the bad guy. He has chosen this role of a bad guy in order to escape from his typical image. This is called casting against type. This is how Sergio Leone convinced Henry Fonda to star in his film. His cold blue eyes gave an amazing image for the character of Frank. The role of Harmonica was offered previously to Clint Eastwood but he rejected it. I don't think Clint Eastwood would have fitted for the role of Harmonica. It is nearly impossible to make a film like ""Once Upon a Time in the West."" You have a story in your head, but in order to reflect this story, you need to find the right casting who have the right amount of expressiveness in their faces and you need to create the right atmosphere for them and for the story and match them in harmony. You need to find the right soundtracks and use them in the right moments. Even if you have all of these components at your disposal, it is very hard to master them. Sergio Leone manages to do that, and this is the reason why his film is considered as one of the best films that was ever made. I have seen a lot of great stories that are wasted in the hands of untalented directors. Sergio Leone's complex style of storytelling must be shown to each and every director that wants to take place in the cinema industry.",Once Upon a Time in the West
312,YellowManReanimated,A Haunting Exploration of Masculinity and Fate,10,17 August 2021,"A western of operatic dimensions, this would be, in my view, Leone's most complete iteration of the genre. There are four characters which epitomise the film: Harmonica, the virtually nameless hero who is on a mission for revenge; Frank: the steely-eyed villain, motivated by vice and venality; Jill McBain, the beautiful, determined heroine who will do what it takes to survive, and Cheyenne, the big, rough exteriored yet warm-hearted wild card whose allegiances could swing either way. The film's plot draws these characters together as their fates and fortunes are constantly intertwined. Through these characters we are treated to a story of greed, brutality, brute politics and, ultimately, revenge.The western, by its very nature, has generally involved interpreting the past, it's a genre which draws on history, often a mythised version of it. This film revels in its mythic quality, it feels like a twisted fairy-tale (Once upon a time...), a fable in which the heroes will eventually triumph and good will conquer evil. There is a tacit acknowledgement that this film is bathed in artifice, it moves with a dream-like quality, the setting and the events serving to propel the characters toward their ultimate fates. Leone's camera work creates a visual feast from extreme close-ups to soaring bird's eye-view takes which romanticise and eulogise the beauty of the natural landscape. Morricone's soundtrack elevates the film at every turn and provides it with its operatic quality. It's a haunting spectacle of a film which creates its own world within a world making it utterly distinct.",Once Upon a Time in the West

314,koalablue_1993,The masterpiece,10,5 September 2008,"Sergio Leone was one of cinema's most instinctive visual masters, Leone used the full spectrum of CinemaScope with controlled abandon. But this is his powerful masterpiece. He will always be remembered for the awe-inspiring crane-tracking shot, To the brilliance of Ennio Morricone's music, he follows Claudia Cardinale as she alights from a train, then swoops over the station house as she enters, only to pick her up again on the far side as she stares at one of the mythical west's most convincing border towns. I truly believe that particular scene is one of the greatest moments in all of cinema.Claudia Cardinale's beauty, the breathtaking panoramas, and hard bold close ups are difficult to forget. Henry Fonda gives his best performance here playing against character (He usually plays good guys and not bad guys). Charles Bronson was equally fantastic as the vengeful Harmonica. This movie is pure art from start to finish, its beautiful to look at. And Sergio Leone when at his best form truly was...cinema",Once Upon a Time in the West
315,Michael1958,Forget this one and ride on!,1,9 September 2002,"Now I see many folks like this film, to be sure-there are some moments when this movie approaches something more than what it is-simply put-a violent saga of the Old West. Yes, Henry Fonda tackles a role far different from his normal stuff, but in reality-it was a big step down for an actor who showed far greater acting in roles like The Wrong Man, Mister Roberts and On Golden Pond. Jason Robards, one of my personal favorites has the best role of any in the story-at least his lines are interesting. Charles Bronson stands out-mainly because he has so few lines-the less said by Mr. Bronson in a movie-the better! He does makes for a stony, stoic character he portrays. Claudia Cardinale-forget her acting-she is there for beauty in what is really a very ugly film. Some of the music score is interesting, the outdoor shots are nice, but the screen play could have used a lot more work. If you are into the ultra violent western genre-go for this and watch it. This is just one person's opinion-but I have seen most of all the sound westerns-save for the ""B"" stuff-ever made.

317,paulmamak,Spectacular! Leone's climatic ending to the Spaghetti Western era.,9,4 November 2008,"Leone equals and even succeeds his Spaghetti Western trilogy predecessors to bring you Once Upon A Time In The West, one of the best Westerns in film history.Leone tells a story of a secret railway station of great value, which involves three of the most legendary film characters. Charles Bronson is harmonica, the mysterious loner, who smoothly drifts his way through each scene by means of his slick dialogue, his quick and sharp shooting and his harmonica. Jason Jobards is Cheyenne, the comical, yet philosophical, criminal, who has the more humane role. Finally you have Henry Fonda as the dirty and gritty Frank, a role that Fonda was surprisingly well suited. The entrance and interplay of each of these three characters result in one of the most thrilling films you will ever see. As well as thrill, Claudia Cardinale is based within the centre of the trio, who brings a sense of hope that separates her from many of the dark aspects that are involved within the film. Furthermore, Frank Wolff plays the tragic Brett McBain, who has very limited screen time, but uses the time he is given to portray an unforgettable character, whose death sparks off the whole plot.Ennio Morricone also provides an electrifying score, a true masterpiece, which energises every scene and knocks the film into a completely different ball park.Ultimately, Sergio Leone's directing is the reason why this is such a classic. His masterful cinematography and camera-work was the piece of the puzzle that brought all this outstanding work together. Including the shootout at the Railroad, Frank's entrance, Harmonica's brothers death and panning over Sweetwater.This is one of Leone's best films and one of the best films in cinematic history.",Once Upon a Time in the West
318,MacBalthus,Much more than a movie,10,20 December 2006,"I MUST MOST CLEARLY INSIST YOU DO NOT READ THIS COMMENT UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE! I WROTE ABOUT DETAILS YOU HAVE TO WATCH, NOT TO READ ABOUT! I consider Ennio Morricone far the best composer for film scores. Everyone who doubts that should get himself the theme from ""El Mercenario"" and listen to it with his eyes closed.And Sergio Leone knew like only few others how to create a picture, frame by frame, position by position, action by action, face by face.It is clear that when these two masterminds come together in a almost unique way, the result has to be breathtaking. The fact that Morricone wrote the music before Leone started shooting the film fortifies my opinion that this movie had two directors, working like one.But even the best painter is powerless without paint. Luckily, Henry Fonda, Claudia Cardinale and, above all others, Charles Bronson had the specific look Leone needed to create this epic.It is a simple and yet impressive way, Morricone and Leone cook up the tension in this tale. First, the main characters are presented in a breathtaking way. Cheyenne freezes with his appearance a whole cowboy stop. Frank exposes some of the most devastating cruelties ever to be carried by a villain. Jill, the flower in the wilderness. And then of course Harmonica, starting with killing three western legends and going on by mocking even scary Cheyenne.After the characters are portrayed, the interaction starts. And step by step, more relations are exposed or created. Just the first meeting of Cheyenne, Jill and Harmonica is the most thrilling moment I have experienced with a movie so far. The bouncing shadow of Bronson's hat, covering and revealing his unique face while he plays, silent and calm as a monk, his harmonica always snatches me like the freezing squall of a blizzard.One thing, everyone in the film loses just in the right moment: The mystery. You never know, why Harmonica chases Frank, just until the end. You never know, why Cheyenne becomes a noble guy, just until the end. But be aware: When the curtain falls down, thunder hits you and a storm is blowing when Frank and Harmonica finally have their showdown.This is film-making up to perfection, when the movie is an experience. An adventure. An epic.I haven't felt anything like the emotions I had in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST after or before I watched it. I'd say, this is the best motion picture I have seen so far and I'm pretty sure, nothing is gonna replace it.",Once Upon a Time in the West

320,nitratestock35,Atmosphere,9,11 April 2003,"That about sums it up. O.K. I am not unbiased. Once upon... is one of my all time favorites. There is that ""coming of age"" feel to it and that ""way larger than life"" feel. Its epic concept would easily lead to a pretentious movie but Sergio Leone just created the western that influenced all westerns after it. I like the classic American western with all ""clean shirts"" and full of ethics (for example ""Last trains from Gunhill"") but the more realistic (if we can call it that) and complex approach of the Leone westerns are more my cup of tea.Attention: spoilers ahead:I didn't read all user comments or Forum posts, maybe this is redundant: Check the harmonica in the flashback sequence during the showdown. It changes its shape from shot to shot. But back in 1968 no one was there with a laptop computer to check continuity. So it's excused.End of spoilersWell, Once upon... is one of the all time greats IMHO. Yes, the casting is perfect, so is Morricone's score. But it's that ""coming of age"" and that ""end of an era"" feel that makes is so great.

321,FranktheRabbit,Poetry on Film,10,23 December 2003,"Once Upon a Time in the West (1968/Sergio Leone) **** out of ****The beginning is legendary. Three gunmen arrive at a train station in the middle of nowhere. They wait, and they wait some more. In the background is an annoying sound, and at the same time, a fly buzzes around. Then the train arrives. They get up, but no one gets off. Then, they here the sound of a harmonica. They turn around, and standing there is Charles Bronson. He asks them where there boss is, and they say that he sent them. Bronson asks if they brought a horse for him, and one of them responds (snickering), ""Well, it looks like we're shy one horse"". Bronson shakes his head and says, ""You brought two too many"", and then he kills all three of them.""Once...."" tells two stories. One about the progression of the railroad, and one about revenge. Jill McBain(Claudia Cardinale) has just arrived out west, and when she reaches the house of her new husband and his family, she finds them all dead. Frank (Henry Fonda), a ruthless assassin, has just done the deed, and is working for a more sinister corporation. Cheyenne(Jason Robards) is a traveling desperado who helps Jill in her struggle over the property she has obtained from the recent death of her husband. And a wanderer who not only plays the harmonica, but can shoot too, secretly stalks Frank, in hopes of revenge.""Once..."" is Leone's Western Masterpiece. It is both poetic and operatic. Leone has proven with this film that he is the master of detail. With his slow pacing, long periods of silence or no dialogue, extreme close-ups, excellent score and cinematography, and close attention to detail, he has made the most artful and unconventional western of all time. The performances are great as well, and it is interesting to see Fonda play such a bad guy, when he usually plays the Jimmy Stewart-type nice guy. My favorite scene (besides the opening), is after the family is slaughtered in the beginning, and Fonda is about to finish off the little boy who is still alive. The close-up on Fonda's face is amazing. With those big blue eyes and that wicked smile, he is easily one of the scariest villains in cinematic history.Leone has done the same thing with the Western genre that he did with the Crime genre when he made ""Once Upon a Time in America"", he has made it amazing art film that ends up as poetry on screen. The film requires a lot out of you, but when you find out the twist in the end regarding Bronson's character, then you realize that it was all worth it.-30-",Once Upon a Time in the West
322,tuco73,The final western movie: the best of all times!,10,17 February 2004,"Bang...bang...bang the old west is gone! Leone's last western movie is also the first gangster one. There starts a new trilogy, the one about modern America. No more heroes with no name on horses; but landlords, capitalists and gangsters, in the train (the first link between East and West coast). America is now one and done! The epitaph on the Old West is the definitive western movie. No need to say anything more about it: it is now well dead and buried. And beautifully. The initially underrated Spaghetti Western genre ended up teaching the American directors how to make proper clever and not rhetoric westerns (boring John Wayne ones). Close ups, character psychology, music score, timing, epic, story plot, everything here is achieved at perfection. The only American director who could be compared to Seregio Leone for his innovations is Peckinpah, for his attempts to make the old western genre alive again with some originality in The Wild Bunch or Pat Garreth & Billy the Kid, nevertheless Leone is still, by large, my favourite. This is probably not as entertaining as The Good the Bad and the Ugly, but the aim and the results are broader: this is a true masterpiece, it is the portrait of an entire era which is ending and the start of a new one. it is Sergio Leone at his best (= cinema at its best!).

First off, the cinematography was simply amazing! It just captured the American West in the late 1800's time period perfectly! It was beautifully filmed and it really felt like you were in the old American West! Also the music in this movie was great. It was composed by Ennio Morricone who is known for the music in the man with no name trilogy that starred Clint Eastwood. The acting was also pretty good, especially by Henry Fonda who played a villain for the first time in this film and it had great duel scenes. Charles Brosnan played the character Harmonica ( he earned this nickname by playing the same tune on his Harmonica whenever he is about to duel with someone.) Even though this film is a bit long (175 minutes) it was well worth the time for me.

324,souther02,Mr. Morton,9,5 September 2010,"A lot of very interesting things. But in the beginning, the movie starts as a normal Western with the bad guys looking like the bad guys and everyone else moves into the picture as possibly the same. A beautiful prostitute has come clear across America to marry a man name of McBain. Who we soon find out is her husband after all, and has married Jill in New Orleans. While out hunting grouse with his son, McBain is shot and killed by Frank(James?). The bloodthirsty outlaws decide to decimate the place, and soon the whole McBain family is dead. Jill, however, is about to arrive in the town not far from McBain's outpost, and is not killed. She finally arrives. But not before going to the watering hole where she is not shocked by the accommodations, but merely amused. Amused, that is, until Cheyenne shows up. Cheyenne meets the man simply known as Harmonica, a Mexican half-breed who plays an integral part in the story. Harmonica(Charles Bronson), has already blown away four of Frank's gang at the railway station. The half-breed is disappointed. He does not see Frank there, but does a job on Frank's employees. After the funeral, Jill looks everywhere in McBain's house for money, and finds none. She does not realize what the wealth is. Cheyenne shows up at McBain's place(which now belongs to her). He shows the New Orleans entertainer how to make coffee. Frank the outlaw had a singular interest in Brett McBain's land. He rides the train owned my Mr. Morton, making himself a partner. Being a paraplegic with TB, Mr. Morton has little to say in the matter. By now, Frank knows of Harmonica's presence yet even after meeting Harmonica Frank has not put 2 and 2 together yet. Harmonica even gives the names of Frank's victims. Jill McBain throws herself at Frank for really no good reason, except possibly to save her own life from the treacherous outlaw. At the time that most of her belongings go on auction, Cheyenne shows up with Harmonica and Cheyenne is the bounty, so to speak, for Jill McBain's possessions and priceless property. Definitely a film to catch your attention. The train breathing as Morton plays his hand in a bewildering game of poker is reminiscent of the breathing of Dave Bowman as he struggles to regain control of the Discovery from HAL 9000.",Once Upon a Time in the West
325,Sonic_Ocean,The Beautiful West,9,26 May 2013,"One thing I love about Sergio Leone's style as a director is his execution of telling a story in that while there are moments that have a purpose in progressing in the story, we can appreciate the moments where not much is happening, allowing more room for reflecting, whether it is beauty of the atmosphere in the world these characters live in or how the music is given a chance to evoke the emotions and be its own character. To sum up with more clarity, Sergio Leone made me learn to appreciate films that chooses to take its time, where all the little subtleties are the ones that add the most richness to a film's quality. It made me realize that there doesn't have to be things happening every minute in a movie to truly enjoy it.If I were to describe this stylistic aspect of Leone's directing, I would say he is able to inject a feeling of richness in his stories that makes his films feel very warm in tone, all the while being stories with a lot of grit and sharp edges. With 'Once Upon a Time in the West,' this was the first time this specific quality became evident to me in movies. From all the vast landscapes filmed for specific scenes, we feel more like we are delving into a world of beauty that is rarely visited, than watching a mere movie. How Sergio Leone is able to make his films feel larger than life is an astounding achievement and inspiration for those with an artistic vision.And every acting performance is delivered with a sense of sophistication and grace in adding to this rich story. And with every performance, we are presented with characters that are memorable and pivotal to the world they exist in. The world that exists in the film is filled with dirt and grit, and how these characters behave are evident of the world they live in.And this world that we see is the death of the west and the ushering in of a new era. These characters all play a pivotal point in that, but what plays out in the end is a revelation that brings out the full picture of what lurks underneath the motives that fuels each event that occurs, to bring everything full circle. And the way the movie ends on this note is moving.'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a dark western filled with a lot of melancholy, but still possessing a quality of rich beauty. Underneath all the scenes of violence, there is an emotionally undercurrent that manages to seep through and how Sergio Leone is able to convey those emotions with so much subtlety shows the true mark of a great director. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a classic not only due to its ambition, but also in how grand it feels in every sense of the word.",Once Upon a Time in the West

I came out of it, glad that I had finally seen it but puzzled why so many people loved it and why the Sky critics had rated it so highly. Alas, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST proves to be one of those great cinematic letdowns...I find it difficult to believe that the genius behind the Dollars Trilogy could come up with a movie this dull. I'm all for character development, but do I really need to stare at the fly on Jack Elam's cheek for what feels like half an hour? THE WILD BUNCH was about growing old and losing your touch with reality; SHANE was about the unspoilt innocence of youth and the eternal difference between right and wrong; THE ALAMO was about the price of freedom and the cost of war; and THE SEARCHERS was about redemption and love conquering hate... but after sitting through the 2:45 runtime of ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST (that, by the movie's end, felt more like 5:45), I still can't tell you what it was really all about. Leone tries to be all things to all people and ends up completely losing the message of his film. There are moments of genuine movie magic, but they are broken up by long periods of the most unimaginable boredom. At the end of the day, I had to ask myself if it really was about anything at all?A loveably roguish Jason Robards and a truly reptilian Henry Fonda shine in their roles along with the rest of this all-star cast, but there's not a grain of charisma to be found amongst any of them. Their monotonous speeches end up blending together, polarising their both their characters and the pace of the movie. And all the heavenly choirs and the breathtaking shots of Monument Valley can't save it from feeling bloated and more than a little pointless...It was the best of films, it was the worst of films...

In a brief flashback near the end, we're finally shown why Bronson's enigmatic harmonica player wants revenge - indeed, this is central to the whole dreary plot - but the flashback shows him completely surrounded by Fonda & his bad guys while being strung up by the neck. Guess we aren't supposed to ask how the hell he survived, eh?Leone did his best work, his classic spaghetti westerns, when he was operating on a shoestring budget. It's like what happens to some musical bands who've produced one or two successful albums & can suddenly afford orchestral background.

The film gets successfully enlisted among one of the most terrific performances ever by the ensemble cast.The movie opens up with a deadly gun duel between a harmonica playing bloke (Charles Bronson) and three men dressed in a cowboy outfit. Bronson plays the enigmatic nameless person (called 'Harmonica' in the film because of his ability to play harmonica in an eerie fashion even when things appear to look serious ) being the only good guy in the film. He helms the task of protecting Brett McBain's widow Jill McBain against Frank and his fellow gangsters after the villains mercilessly massacre McBain and his children. Joining Harmonica in his mission to kill Frank is Cheyenne , the bearded bandit who is falsely framed by Frank in murder of Brett McBain. Thus, Harmonica along with the ruffian Cheyenne set out to bring down the most dreaded assassin Frank. However retribution remains their sole purpose.The film is slow-paced and the viewer is clueless about the real reason behind McBain's murder even after the half time of the movie has passed. There are bloodless fights, revenge, intimate scenes, land rights, shootouts, trains and you are only required to eat what Leone gives you, simply without questioning the plot. Things perfectly fall in place in the latter half of the movie as you get to know that Leone exhibits complete veracity while directing the Western drama. The action scenes are carefully designed and they can surely put the modern day jumbled action to utter shame. The film was bankrolled with plenty of money as it had elaborate sets, brilliant casting and fantastically executed duels.One of the most amazing western dramas I have ever seen, Once Upon A Time In The West is as distilled, refined and clear as it appears to be.9 on 10 stars",Once Upon a Time in the West
332,Dave-430,The best western. One of the ten best movies ever.,10,23 September 1999,"I rate Once Upon a Time in The West among my ten favorite movies of all time. The masterful way Sergio Leone conducts  mood, atmosphere and pace is without equal, and his presentation of the main characters is brilliant. Thus Charles Bronson delivers the performance of his life as the man with the harmonica, Jason Robards is a pleasure to watch as the anti-hero Cheyenne and Henry Fonda is brilliantly cast as perhaps the most evil villain in movie history. What can I say? I just love this movie.",Once Upon a Time in the West
333,satin-48250,A masterpiece,10,7 February 2021,"The actors are at their peak. Most notably, the radiating Claudia Cardinale and the chilling Henry Fonda.
The music is among the best ever created for a movie.
The camera work is amazing, epecially the close-ups.
The slowness is of the essence. Interrupted by bursts of violence. Inexorable fate.
Those words poorly convey how extraordinary this movie is.
My Western favorite, just before The Unforgiven.
One of the very best movies I have ever seen.

334,SandeepLoyalka,Once Upon A Time...There Were Westerns!,8,14 August 2008,"I first saw this film as a 20 year old in the late 80's on VHS & ended up thoroughly disappointed. Every scene seemed to stretch to near-infinity and the action was too sporadic for what I normally expected from a western. Now, however, things are different! I saw it again a few days ago after reading so many positive reviews & I must admit to pretty much being bowled over! 'Once Upon A Time In The West' is not your traditional shoot-em-up western. Its an acquired taste and I wouldn't be too far off the mark if I say that it resembles a dish with near-perfect proportions of ingredients, slow cooked over an intense fire. Director Leone doffs his hat to several classic westerns and ends up with a film thats greater than the sum of its parts. The lovely Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) arrives in the old west to join her new husband & family only to find them all brutally shot dead. Clues apparently point to the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards) though the dastardly deed has in fact been perpetrated by the magnificently evil Frank (Henry Fonda). Also in this lethal mix is a mysterious harmonica-playing stranger (Charles Bronson) with his own covert agenda. From the classic opening scene to the explosive climax, 'Once Upon A Time In The West' sucks the viewer into its vortex of emotions as layers upon layers are gradually peeled away revealing each characters true motivations. Featuring a stellar cast who have probably never been better, and a haunting, evocative score by maestro Ennio Morricone, 'Once Upon A Time In The West' is mandatory viewing for all film aficionado's. My only (small) complaint is the occasional self-indulgence displayed by Leone when he tends to give style precedence over narrative.",Once Upon a Time in the West
335,louiepatti,A Sprawling Vision of Western Justice,10,1 August 2008,"This movie has so much---stunning scenery, a great cast, tight writing, economic plot, and haunting music---and it takes its time to unfold its tale of stark vengeance and redemption. This is unmistakably and indelibly a Sergio Leone vision. One could imagine that Clint Eastwood was first offered the role of Harmonica, the avenger, and then it went to Charles Bronson. Perhaps he wasn't, as Bronson was superb as the Everyman hero/possible avenging angel character; he projected a subtle sorrow in his piercing eyes, even his body language, that made him perfect for the role.The plot is multilayered, revolving around a lovely widow (Claudia Cardinale) of a shrewd man named Brett McBain, who is brutally murdered along with his family by the railroad's hired guns while she is enroute to join them at their home in Sweetwater. Her property is what is coveted and it becomes Harmonica's bait to settle an old score with the railroad's chief hired gun, Frank, who is shockingly revealed to be played by wholesome Henry Fonda. His clear blue eyes, so apparently innocent-looking, become frightening in their lack of human emotions. Frank kills without remorse whatever it befalls him to kill as casually as flicking a leaf off his sleeve. Human life is meaningless to him, even more so than to his tubercular cancer-ridden boss Morton. At least he has a motive (greed) to explain his hubris; Frank evidently needs no such excuse and kills because it's what he was born to do.Another character is brought into the tense mix, a bountied outlaw named Cheyenne, appealingly played by Jason Robards. He is also a killer, but one with a sense of humor and a kind streak, as well as a soft spot in his heart for pretty women. He and Harmonica form a strange alliance against Frank and the railroad, which Cheyenne sees as a threat to his way of outlaw life. At the same time, he becomes friendly with the widow Jill, who in turn is oddly drawn to Harmonica. When Cheyenne realizes this, he utters his famous line: ""There's something inside a man like that... something about death."" It is discovered that McBain bought a substantial amount of property and had planned to build a railroad station. He had everything legally in place to build the station but if it isn't finished by the time the railroad reaches Sweetwater, his heir forfeits the right to build it and even to keep the land. Harmonica uncovers the motive for McBain's murder and finds the means to prevent McBain's dream from failing by making Cheyenne's gang build it.Frank, who is usually so icily carefree about death and those who stalk him, grows more obsessed with finding out who Harmonica is, since every time he asks him, the enigmatic drifter keeps answering by naming off men that Frank has killed. Everything comes apart for Morton and Frank as the killer begins to slowly but relentlessly unravel, with vague flashbacks rising as to who Harmonica might be. They, however, keep his past shrouded sufficiently so that Frank cannot quite close this maddening chapter in his life by just gunning down Harmonica and being done with him.At last, Frank is mortally wounded in the climatic gun duel by Harmonica, who mysteriously is less fazed by what should also be a mortal wound, leading to the speculation that Harmonica is more than he appears to be. Placing his harmonica to Frank's dying lips where his weakening breath wheezes out a few ragged discordant notes, Harmonica watches as recognition dawns and his past is finally realized by Frank. He had sadistically stood a man upon his younger brother's shoulders with a noose around his victim's neck, then shoved a harmonica into the boy's lips. Easing back to watch for the moment when the younger man's legs would finally give out and his brother would hang, Frank is smiling with cold pleasure at his handiwork. It is at that point that the older brother cursed his killer and kicked the boy out from under him, thus alleviating the responsibility placed on Harmonica to keep him alive.But this sequence, though gratifying from a vengeance point, does not answer the question about Harmonica's mysterious knowledge about Frank's victims or his apparent ability to shake off a serious wound with little effect. That combined with Harmonica's penchant to be in the right place at the right time, to stand outside of events while at times controlling them, gives his character a dimension that disconnects him from temporal events. He becomes at those moments like a mysterious angel of death.Every actor was wonderful in his role, from Claudia Cardinale to Jason Robards, but the two principals were outstanding. Fonda, renowned for playing good guys, turned his reputation as an actor completely around with his flawless portrayal of the vicious and heartless killer, Frank. His foil, played to understated perfection by Charles Bronson, was the reluctant vigilante, the man consumed with revenge for his brother's murder, and yet not merely that. Bronson projected from Harmonica a deep and inexplicable sadness that permeated his words, appearance and actions.This was not Leone's choice for a movie. He had abandoned the spaghetti Western concept after the Clint Eastwood films, but was persuaded to take on this project. It did not fare well at the box office, which is no surprise considering its length of almost three hours. A great pity, as it is often overlooked by fans of the spaghetti Western genre for both its lack of commercial success, and for committing the unforgivable sin of not having Eastwood in the lead. It is a great film and works on many levels; in some ways, it is the distillation and the perfection of the SW genre even as it closed it out for good.",Once Upon a Time in the West
336,cribyn44,Vastly overrated - totally inferior to The Searchers,1,8 April 2009,"As has happened so many times before, I am quite sure that the film I watched under discussion is most certainly NOT the same film as seen by other commentators. Or rather, and maybe, it is the basic film nous of the other commentators which really needs commenting upon! I have tried to watch this film several times on television. Mostly, I can never last beyond the first 20 minutes, but last evening I managed up to about the last half an hour before falling asleep. It was only by reading the excellent and first-class Synopsis provided on the IMDb web-site that I finally understood what the film was supposed to be about.Unfortunately for any judgement on this film, only a few days ago I watched John Ford's ""The Searchers"" once again. Now, there, you have a true western masterpiece! The story is told in a straightforward, concise, and economical manner, without any of the so-called modern tricks of slow meandering camera movements and/or long and supposedly pregnant moments of silence. I found ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" totally pretentious and often rather silly and ""posing"". During its first hour virtually nothing of the story was ever spelt out or even got going. As to calling this a ""masterpiece"" and other such nonsense terms, some people really need to educate themselves about what is good and bad cinema. ""The Searchers"" - the absolute best! ""Once Upon a Time""? - awful and hopeless.",Once Upon a Time in the West
337,jerk1483,Not one wasted frame in this masterpiece,10,30 September 2001,"From Sergio Leone's quirky directing, to Ennio Morricone's vibrant score (you know, that one song the lady sings throughout the film), and somewhere inbetween a glorious script that shows us many characters, connected by circumstance and goodness, written by horror auteur Dario Argento, Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the finest films ever made.It's timelessness is overwhelming, considering it was shot in the sixties, and I saw it for the first time in the new millenium.  The story is told with acting, not recitation.  Each character is totally fleshed out to the end, every close up showing another outlook on things.  Henry Fonda as a bad guy, sure, but we never really grasp how bad.  Why Not?  Because Fonda is so good in this brilliant role that it takes an entire film to actually not like his character.Jason Robards and Charles Bronson give some of the best performances of their lives, particularly Bronson.  His face is so unaffected in one shot, and then utterly emotive the next.  Bronson utterly emobodies ""Harmonica"" as he's known.  His motives are unclear.  Is he a just outlaw, or a marshall with a vendetta?  Just who is he?  Fonda's character wants to know as badly as we do.Robards provides the good man from a bad past story line.  Sure, Cheyenne is a criminal, but deep down, he means well.  He really does.  So much to say about this film, where do I end it?  I guess all I can say is that it is an extremely absorbing tale which will have you thinking for weeks to come. And for those film buffs out there who have actually taken a film course, this film is the perfect example of the Show don't Tell rule of cinema.",Once Upon a Time in the West
338,openeyes,A truly great western,10,18 December 2003,"A railroad magnate named Morton, Gabriele Ferzetti, hires a cruel gunman named Frank, Henry Fonda, to ""remove obstacles from the track.""  One of the obstacles is Brett McBain, who owns some water rich land the railroad must pass through.  Frank massacres McBain and his family, framing a local bandit named Cheyenne, Jason Robards, in the process.  Unbeknownst to Frank, McBain married Jill, Claudia Cardinale, on a recent trip to New Orleans.  Jill arrives to find her new family dead and herself in possession of the land Frank will certainly kill again to obtain.  Jill's survival depends on Cheyenne, who wants to find out who framed him, and a mysterious stranger called Harmonica, Charles Bronson, who has his own business to conduct with Frank.""Once Upon A Time In The West"" is perhaps the most beautiful western ever filmed.  Employing his signature style, director Sergio Leone uses the wide screen format with the skill of  a master painter, alternating breath-taking vistas with stunning close-ups against the magnificent score by Ennio Morricone.  Leone lets the story unfold slowly.  Characters surrender their motivations only grudgingly, all the while slowly building to a powerful conclusion.  The pace of the film, which I credit as one of its strengths, may also be its main drawback today.  Many members of the post-MTV generation accustomed to quick editing may not have the patience to let themselves be swept up by this film.  That is a pity.""Once Upon A Time In The West"" stands as Leone's homage to the great, and not so great, western films that came before him.  ""Johnny Guitar"" certainly springs to mind and the opening sequence makes an undeniable nod toward ""High Noon.""   However, unlike Quentin Tarantino's recent homage to his roots, ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1,"" this film not only stands on its own two feet, it expands the genre.  These characters are more than a group of archetypes wandering about under the western sun.  Jill isn't your traditional victimized widow.  A New Orleans prostitute taking a chance on a new life on the frontier, she's an independent woman who knows men.  If sleeping with Frank is the only way to save her life, she will, knowing that after a hot bath she'll be the same as she was before.  Frank, in a brilliant performance against type by Henry Fonda, is also a man in transition.  He envies the power flowing from Morton's money.  He would like to become more like Morton, but his propensity toward baser evil deprives him of the discipline he needs to become a businessman. Cheyenne seeks revenge for being framed and pretends to interested in the wealth the McBain land will bring, but he is mainly motivated by growing feelings for Jill.  He's the most sentimental character in the film.  He's a bandit with a heart of gold, which is more than can be said for Harmonica.  Harmonica, the man with no name, develops a liking for both Jill and Cheyenne, but one gets the feeling he would sacrifice either or both of them if there was no other way to get Frank.  He is not the classic, selfless western hero of old.When I originally saw this film, I was disappointed by Bronson.  I didn't think he made the most of a role obviously tailor-made for Clint Eastwood. I was mistaken.  Bronson brought nuance to the role I doubt Eastwood would have at that stage of his career.  In his three films with Leone, Eastwood's ""Man with No Name"" character tended toward smug amorality motivated only by self-interest.  Harmonica has a little more depth and introspection than Eastwood's characters.  He plays him with a certain sadness in his eyes; a doomed self-awareness.  Harmonica realizes when he kills Frank the remainder of his life will be devoid of meaning or purpose.  He doesn't speak much, but he tellingly attempts to wax philosophically with Frank about the nature of men of like themselves and the changing West.  In a sense, he knows Frank is the only person who could understand him, since he had to become a gunman like Frank in order to achieve his well- deserved revenge.  The characters Eastwood played for Leone were less troubled about their place in the universe than Bronson's Harmonica.  This might be Bronson's best performance.""Once Upon A Time In The West"" deserves an esteemed place among the canon of great westerns.",Once Upon a Time in the West

340,maue-19674,Leone's Western Masterpiece - one for the ages,10,7 July 2020,"There are some films that simply leave you stunned the first time you watch them - that is EXACTLY how I felt when I first viewed Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West'. I had seen his 'Dollars Trilogy' with Eastwood - and loved his 'style' languid story-telling, massive close-ups and (of course) Morricone's timeless music. So when I approached this Film I was expecting something similar but - in many ways - THIS is Leone's greatest work. Everything about the Film evokes a melancholy nostalgia for a lost 'West'. Ennio Morricone's peerless score underpins this and drives your emotions through the film - indeed the Music was written FIRST - Leone played it on the sets so that the Actors could hear the atmosphere he was looking for. The fantastic set-pieces - the massacre of the McBain Family to reveal Henry Fonda's soulless gun 'Frank', the arrival of Harmonica at the train stop to face three adversaries, Jill's arrival at Sweetwater - all had me utterly spellbound.
The performances are simply perfect - Bronson was never better, with superb support from Fonda and Robards as Cheyenne but it is Claudia Cardinale's Jill that is the heart and centre of this story. We see this through her eyes and recognise that this 'West' - with the coming of the railroad - will not last long.
Leone and his fellow writers - Donati, Argento and Bertolucci - could have simply delivered a basic Western screenplay but, to his undying credit, Leone wanted to tell a story of not only the Myth of the West but it's passing. In doing so, he crafted a Film so unique and cinematic that it repays repeated viewings and just improves every time a see it.
I remember my first viewing of this masterpiece - as the credits rolled up to Morricone's beautiful music I simply stared at the screen stunned and said to myself ""did I just see that?"" And I longed to watch it again.....this is one for the ages and one of my absolute favourite films.",Once Upon a Time in the West
341,afdiazr,This is the difference between a movie and a film,10,13 August 2008,"People before me have said it all and way better than I could ever do. This film is not mere entertainment. It's a powerful piece about individuals trying to find a meaning for their lives. It's about people with enough guts to start over again or fade out with breathtaking dignity. Leone and Morricone, Bertolucci and Argento. It's not a dream team with nothing to deliver. This film is what you would expect from such big names undertaking a massive and epic masterpiece. This thing will pierce your heart and your senses. It's cinematography is intoxicating, and the soundtrack delivers a full punch of emotions to your stomach. For me sometimes it's really hard to take without feeling a teardrop trying to escape my eye. It's sad when film viewers fail to feel the brutal embrace of one of these classic films. Few directors from this age can take such an endeavor and turn it into something this fantastic (Paul Thomas Anderson is one of them).",Once Upon a Time in the West

343,TheDragonTrader,More Western than 'The Western' itself,10,24 April 2019,"In full silence, three mysterious men in long trench coats wait in a remote train station. Their faces have anticipation written all over them, even while the most interesting things they can find to do are toying with a fly, drinking water from a hat and cracking their fingers. A dog runs past. The windmill squeaks. The ticket vendor is locked away. The heath bounces off the wooden platform. The men sweat.Are you bored yet? Then this movie is probably not for you.But are you dying to know what the three men are waiting for? Does a light anxiety creep onto you whilst reading that description? Can't you wait for the tension to resolve? Then this movie is all you ever wanted.The almost lawless world where outlaws and bandits roam the country with ease that is the setting of the story, is shown by Tonino Delli Colli (director of photography) in all its splendorous grandeur and it's uncountable little details. The set pieces, the costumes and the real life locations in Arizona and Utah make everything believable. And together with the characters and figurants, everything creates a vibrant and utterly believable Western civilisation.Charles Bronson plays the man with the harmonica: a lone wolf looking for something that he chooses not to reveal to anyone until he gets it. A character with no name roaming the endless fields under the sun, announcing his presence at all times with the same melody he plays on his harmonica that echo's in an unsettling way. Bronson does this brilliantly, with a face that overflows with held back emotions and a determination that is downright scary.In a tavern the man meets Manuel 'Cheyenne' Gutiérrez (Jason Robards), a bandit that recently escaped being hung by the neck, re-joining his band of outlaws. With already greying hair, he takes on the situation that arises in the area, trying his part to be the hero that saves the day. Robards portrays a character that, by only one look at him, we can see how the years have shaped him. His performance is outstanding; we want to grab a drink with Cheyenne, but we also get the feeling that being on your guard around him wouldn't be an overrated luxury.The 'damsel in distress' (although she isn't in the original meaning of the word) Jill McBain (played by Claudia Cardinale) turns into a toy of Fate itself. Without any warning she gets involved in something quite over her head, but she handles it masterfully; she refuses to return to New Orleans with her tail between her legs and stays to face the difficulties put before her. Cardinale playing Jill is both an erotic marvel and a woman you wouldn't want to cross.They are all opposed by Frank (Henry Fonda): the local gang leader with a heart of stone and a business proposal at the ready at all times. With his ruthless blue eyes and his gun at the ready he keeps the town quiet. Fonda gives you the creeps with just one gaze at the camera and every sentence leaves the bitter taste of malfeasance.And finally, Gabriele Ferzetti finishes the line of main characters with his deliciously sickening portrayal of the crippled railroad baron Morton. A character that you'd like to slap in the face, but one you feel pity for as well. Outstandingly brought!The soundtrack is composed by the never beaten maestro of film scoring himself: Ennio Morricone. His genius lies in the creation of themes and melodies that will haunt your dreams forever for better or worse. The melancholic main theme that is brought with a heavenly choir draws tears from your eyes after hearing only a couple of chords. The theme of the man with the harmonica is as unsettling as it is epic and Cheyennes' theme creates the lighter counter points in the movie. Morricone uses these motifs ingeniously, hinting at plot points, character motifs and feelings and giving you a sense of the world the movie takes place in. If I could give twelve out of ten stars for the score, I'd do it.Sergio Leone was a masterful director, no need to prove that. He manages to turn even a scene of seven minutes, where three men are merely waiting for a train, into an epic storyline. Two hours and three quarters the tension builds and then resolves... partially, always building towards the end. And that finale! That finale! That finale chilled me to the bone! Throughout the film, question after question is raised, and when one question is answered, another one pops up. So when all pieces of the puzzle fall into place to the score of Ennio Morricone, how can one not be moved by it?For Leone, there was no better way to reach the top of the Western genre.And for us, there never will be a film that is more Western than 'Once Upon a Time in the West'.",Once Upon a Time in the West

345,Freddy_Levit,Once Upon A Time.......................There was Sergio Leone,10,28 November 2004,"No other films in the world have produced such sharp, raw, gritty and atmospheric yet absolutely beautiful cinematography as those directed by the Italian director, the great Sergio Leone. Audiences around the world saw first hand the power and influence ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" bought to the world. It made a director famous, a young Clint Eastwood a household name and the Western more popular than it had ever hoped to be since the master works of John Ford. However, Sergio Leone bought with him a whole new sub-genre - a whole new style - and the Western had never looked darker and grittier. 'The Man With No Name' bought with it a whole new meaning to a heroic protagonist. There was no more good guy/bad guy, but only a survivalist type - ignorant and self indulgent, yet still moral and fair, tough and smart and damn good with a gun. The world fell in love with him and anticipated its sequels which only became more violent, atmospheric and realistic and gave the authentic true feeling of the West.It is why I consider 'Once Upon A Time In The West' to be Sergio's definitive masterpiece. He took everything that he ever felt about the West and made some of the most intriguing 3 hours of film ever produced. The budget had never been bigger. The plot had never been more riveting. The music and setting had never been more epic and the cinematography had never been more powerful. This film is perfect, start to finish!This time our premise intersects the stories of five people - yes five people - and it is brilliantly crafted. And this time it isn't a chain smoking son of a gun without a name that carries the film, but rather a female prostitute. This isn't the 'Rocky Horror Picture Show', so please continue reading. The plot revolves around a certain family and its moist establishment in the middle of a desert with hopes for it to one day be a thriving town with a railway station. It is this future town that brings our five protagonists into relation. The family is murdered by a gang led by Frank (Henry Fonda) who works the hit-man for a corrupt railway boss who wants the town out of the way so he can reach the coast and view the sea before he dies. However, unaware of her arrival, Jill (Claudia Cardinale) - the family's patriarch's fiancée - comes to claim her property and therefore possesses a threat to the railway boss. Meanwhile a man with no name nicknamed 'Harmonica' (he always plays a Harmonica before making a kill) has come to town looking for Frank for personal reasons. Charles Bronson nails the role with extreme prejudice. Also a fugitive going by the name of Cheyenne (Jason Robards) assists in his journey to prove his innocence regarding being the wrongly accused murderer.No spoilers, but just an assurance that this film will blow you away. It is impossible to comprehend the overwhelming powerful epic experience in one sitting. This is what motion pictures are meant to be. Masterful storytelling, a larger than life score by the brilliant Ennio Morricone, cinematography yet unmatched and a cast made in heaven. Performances from all the actors are some of the best you will ever see.It is films like these that redefine genres and that honorable of all words, a 'classic'. Prove me wrong. For those who experienced it, I hope it has impacted you in much the same way it has me. Upon its release, this film was unsuccessful, because the world wanted another Clint Eastwood picture. But they couldn't see for a mile what was coming. Sergio Leone is platinum. May the force be with him...........always!",Once Upon a Time in the West
346,vinnieboards,Not the best Spaghetti Western - the best Western of all time!!,10,29 July 2010,"I came to this film quite late in life - I was born in the 60's and only since hitting middle age have a I regressed into older films before my time.I'm so glad I did - the genius of Sergio Leone is there to see and Once Upon a Time in the West tops them all. Mr Leone is a not a director but more a walking art form. Like a Picasso for the silver screen. The way he uses breathtaking landscapes with a complete absence of dialogue is simply awe inspiring. I can't recall how long the film plays before there is a spoken word but it is definitely a long time.Some people argue that Leone's style is overblown, it is too slow and laborious. Such impatience detracts from what is a visual feast served up with top notch acting performances. If there was ever a formula for the perfect Western this is it. The harmonica player with the hidden agenda, the villainous hit-man with a vulnerable edge, the bandit with a surprisingly good heart.Casting Henry Fonda against type as a villain must have raised some critical eyebrows at the time and yet it is a masterstroke. Leone wanted Fonda to wear contact lenses because a villain 'can't have blue eyes' and yet those same blue eyes somehow add to the insanity of Fonda's character. Bronson hardly talks in the film and yet he always seems to be there (or is that just his harmonica). Jason Robards also puts in a vintage turn with the audience never quite sure whether he is good or bad.Best bit for me - the scene where Bronson protects Fonda from assassins, in essence keeping him alive for that final, inevitable and glorious showdown. Ennio Moriconne's quirky but lavish scoring adds the luxury topping to what is one of the finest cakes ever baked.I love the tales of the Old Wild West and have watched lots of Westerns in my time.

Mr Morton is building a railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific. He is physically crumbling and dying from tuberculosis of the bones. He directs the construction from a sumptuous and unbelievably wide private carriage that follows the ever-extending track in the wake of an old-fashioned steam locomotive (whose driver is never seen) complete with the obligatory cow-catcher.To cope with little local difficulties he turns to Frank (Henry Fonda) and his murderous gang. McBain, a pioneering Irishman, widower-ed and with three red-haired children still sporting Irish accents, has bought the only land for miles around with a source of water, essential to the railway.Does Frank negotiate with them for future use of the water? Does Morton even know where the water is? None of this matters. Frank and his gang slaughter the McBain family. Henry Fonda, previously so familiar in upright roles, callously shoots the youngest child, the only survivor of the first assault. The viewer gasps as much at the unexpected perpetrator as at the brutality itself.But this scene is not how the film starts. The opening sequence, according to the viewer's taste, is either gripping, or a ludicrously slow-paced director's indulgence. We have no idea what is happening. Three obvious baddies wait at an isolated station for a train. They bully the elderly station-master. One catches dripping water in his hat and later drinks it. Another cracks his knuckles. The third is pestered by a fly that crawls over his sweaty, stubbly chin. Very few words are spoken.The train arrives. The gruesome threesome awake from their lethargy, fingering their guns. Nobody steps down. The train sets off and the men turn their backs on it.A harmonica sounds. One passenger has alighted on the opposite side. He has arrived to meet Frank, but Frank isn't there. He asks if there is a horse for him. The spokesman of the baddies says that they seem to have brought one horse too few. The harmonica player (Charles Bronson) , fixing the others with a flinty stare, says that it seems they've brought two horses too many. Guns explode. Everybody falls down. 'Harmonica' picks himself up, winged but not badly wounded. The other three are not so lucky.This sequence takes about 14 minutes. It sets the scene and the tone. If you're not mesmerized, switch off, even though nothing is quite as slow from then on. The viewer is deliberately challenged. So many 'western' conventions are present, but all have been distorted. The film belongs to the genre, but it breaks all the rules.From the opening sequence, we switch to the almost unconnected McBain massacre. The only link is Frank. 'Once upon a time in the west' is so carefully and cleverly structured that it should be watched several times, despite its length. The story can be followed reasonably well at a first sitting, but a second is almost obligatory.Nothing is accidental in the early scenes. Musical themes are set. The Ennio Morricone soundtrack is haunting and brilliant. Huge facial close-ups are introduced. The camera is often stationary. Every shot is considered. Dialogue is crisp and laconic.After appearing in a uniquely brutal role, Frank (Fonda) disappears for almost an hour while other elements of the story are developed. Jill (Claudia Cardinale) arrives, a New Orleans whore who has already married the already dead McBain. Frank's murderous but slaughtered threesome were, by their ankle length 'dusters', pretending to be in the pay of Cheyenne (Jason Robards). Mr Morton appears, determined to complete the railway but sickened by Frank's brutality.The developing story revolves around 'Harmonica', Frank, Cheyenne, Jill and Morton. There are some blurry flashbacks, becoming progressively clearer, hinting at the otherwise unexplained connection between 'Harmonica' and Frank. 'Who are you?' asks Frank. Bronson reels off a list of names of men Frank has killed.Although the film is exceptionally long, it never drags. Leone directs with supreme confidence. He lets things slow down and stop, even the music. Leone and Morricone indulge in cheerful conventional, clip-clop sounds at times, but the underlying musical motif is the sound of dying, plaintively expressed by the harmonica.By the end of the film, three of the main characters are dead. There is an extraordinary final showdown between Frank and 'Harmonica', interrupted by a flashback continuation of the earlier blurred scenes, explaining who 'Harmonica' is.Much of 'Once upon a time in the west' is tush. Everything is highly stylized. All the characters are caricatures, as was obvious from the earliest shots.But the film is a masterpiece. It may have restricted all film-making that followed it. Everything about it is brilliant: the acting, the script, the music, the sets, the locations, the cinematography, the story, the structure.Above all, 'Once upon a time in the west' is an exercise in style. A hackneyed genre is re- examined. Reflective viewers will realize later that everything about the film is unbelievable and either a dutiful reinforcement or deliberate refutation of the traditional western.To say this detracts nothing. The film was, is and forever will be a landmark in cinematographic achievement. If you haven't seen it, make sure you do. If you have seen it, watch it again, and again, and again.",Once Upon a Time in the West
350,jeroennouwens,One of My All-Time Favorites,10,15 December 2020,"As there are already 719 reviews of this title, I will keep my two cents brief. I personally wanted to leave a little mark here, because Once Upon a Time in the West is one of my favorite films. I have watched and immensely enjoyed it glued to the (small) screen numerous times, from a young boy onward to me now being close to 40. I did watch it again earlier this year (2020). The year isn't all that great going, so I had to brighten it up by watching this classic one evening again and it immediately was an evening to remember. I don't know off the top of my head how lengthy this film is (definitely longer than 90 minutes), but not one minute feels wasted or overly long. From the classic opening scene to all the scenes that follow, it's an epic ride. I love the themes in the film and I also love the music.I often listen to Morricone's soundtrack and on occasion watch the finale again. Everything about this masterpiece is amazing. I also think it's Bronson's best role and perhaps Leone's best film.Go watch it, if you haven't already. It's timeless. I will watch the Finale once again. I want this played at my funeral.",Once Upon a Time in the West
351,Krippler,Greatest western ever?,10,27 November 2003,"...perhaps. I can say, however, that Henry Fonda is a great bad ass bad guy, Jason Robarbs is solid as always, and Charles Bronson is the coolest dude to ever walk the face of the earth. ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" features some of the greatest visuals ever put on screen and Leone blends them perfectly with Morricone's excellent score. This movie is much better than ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" in my opinion. The difference is that the acting here is almost all top notch with Bronson, Fonda and Robarbs acting circles around Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef (Eli Wallach was good though). If you haven't seen ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", see it now. Classic film! 10 out of 10.",Once Upon a Time in the West
352,niceguy68,Sergio's masterpiece,10,6 June 2003,"Even though the good, the bad and the ugly is the best known spaghetti western, this one is I believe the most achieved work. Also, it is aging well, still fantastic to watch (it's missing the 5.1 sound though :).If you decide to watch this movie, get ready in the first scene to see time stop... waiting for the train... and the beginning of the story. If you're still restless after the 1st scene, stop right there and only return to this movie a day when you're mellow and ready to enjoy it. Don't rush that one...It's less of a farce and more a beautiful story with carefully crafted characters than the other westerns. It actually makes me feel somehow melancolic and nostalgic. There is of course some self derision in all characters but they're not as clownesque as in the other Sergio westerns. The characters all have simple dreams making them weak. Those often end-up shattered, making you feel for them, even the bad guys.There's a slew of fantastic actors with fantastic parts (Fonda, Claudia Cardinale, Bronson, Jason Robards) Even actors that get little air time have amazing characters developments, and they all act very well.The music is awesome, even the silences are grandiose.The cinematography is beautiful, and exploit the sets shots and the (usual) unusual face/body shots typical of Sergio's westerns very well.The movie's suspense is very typical; with the famous flashbacks activated by a recurring music. The heroes are desillusioned making them the strongest characters. They also have qualities like being ice cold, cunning or sharp, and very similar to the bad guys. Gunfighters with a code of ethics.
Other Sergio Leones: Once upon a time in America with DeNiro, even though I prefer the 1st part of that movie where he doesn't play. Other westerns: My Name Is Nobody is cool though more trivial...",Once Upon a Time in the West
353,joecoby45,Overrated but not bad,6,11 October 2017,"Its not a bad movie, not at all, but not a masterpiece and not worth sitting and watching for almost 3 hours. The movie is too long and should have been cut down in length. There are a lot of scenes that dragged out for what seems like forever at times. The story is not deep enough to justify its long length, nor is it all that interesting. Same goes for the characters.

Clearly there is something to these Italian made spaghetti westerns that I am not getting.  I still am undecided as to whether or not this is supposed to have been a send-up of western movies, and if so then maybe I can understand the atrocious acting.

358,Lt Wolf Maker,"""Once Upon A Time"" is to the western as what ""2001"" is to sci-fi",7,9 September 2001,"Sergio Leone.  What more is there to say?  Don't be fooled by the context: Charles Bronson, Henry Ford, the end of the 1960's, a ""western""...no, no, my friend -- this movie is liquid style that transcends its own time period. Not even a ""western"" anymore, but a cool Leonefied experience.The best soundtrack ever (Ennio Morricone's famous thrusting ballad was composed first, and then Leone wrote it into the script).  Beautiful to listen to, fascinating to watch.  Claudia Cardinale (a delicious Italian beauty) plays the part of lead woman, which is the largest difference between this and the ""Trilogy"" Leone made prior.  Those had no women in them, except in small roles as the hostage and/or mother and/or rape victim and/or food fetcher.  Here Miss Cardinale is magnified under the Sergio Leone patented spotlight and transformed into the pouty grieving widow, in all her false eyelashed, holier-than-thou attitude and spicy comeback glory.And then people die.  Lust for revenge boils blood.  Threats are made. Threats are carried out.  Harmonicas play.  A beautiful, dusty, long, dangerously deliberate masterpiece plays out that curls your lips into an amused little smile by the time Jill serves the water to the men, and then the great opera finally ends.Leone was a great director.  Rumor has it he was in line to direct The Godfather.  All of his trademarks are in this one, including some surprisingly deeper poetic touches [the sound of the ocean as the cripple looks at the painting, which foreshadows his fate] and classic irony [the cripple on the train has enough money to afford everything, except his own health].  As usual, the sound effects are exquisite -- everyone's voice seems amplified, and the detail of smaller elements are emphasized, like the buzz of a fly in a gun barrel, or dripping water, or doors opening.Leone wanted Angel Eyes, Tuco and Blondie to make cameos as the 3 wanderers in the opening sequence, but Eastwood backed out so it never happened. Actually it turned out better this way.  Some have said that ""Once"" is too slow.  There is an obvious difference between ""Once"" and the ""Trilogy,"" which was much more commercial.  This looks more minimalistic, and is moodier than the Trilogy.  Perhaps this difference in starkness and stubborn pretension via Leone is why it never became a huge hit.Italian directors are masters of this genre.  If you're starved for more, try to find ""A Fistful of Dynamite (Duck, You Sucker)"" -- it's another great, yet often overlooked Leone film.",Once Upon a Time in the West

I thought it was a classic western that featured Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson. I thought this classic western could be compared to some of those that have followed like The Unforgiven, The Good, The Bad And The Ugly and Hang 'Em High. I really liked how Sergio Leone weaved this tale of the classic bad man versus the good man. The good man has to go through so many trials and tribulations in order to achieve the final goal to bring the bad man down to his knees. I think that Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson gave fantastic performances and I would definitely recommend it to other friends that respect this genre.

361,ChoiceCuts,A cinematic masterpiece.,10,7 February 2004,"This is definitively the best western I've ever seen. It might even be the best film I've ever seen. The reasons why I think so are many. Firstly the casting is great. Claudia Cardinale is perfect as Jill and Henry Fonda is one of the best bad guys I've ever witnessed. The wide camera shots are just amazing, it's like you can see the entire wild west when you look at the horizon, wich is a bit ironic since most of the film was shot in Spain. The closeups at the eyes, Leone's trademark, are also to be found here, better and closer than ever. Ennio Morricone has also contributed to the experience by making what I think is the greatest score ever. Every character has it's own song. Some are beautiful (Jill's song) others are truly chilling (like Frank's song), every song is terrific though.Some people might feel that this film is too slow to be great, but I can't really understand why. The slow tempo is what makes this film what it is, it gives the whole film an arty, wonderful touch to it.This is what I wish to see everytime I watch a movie, Once Upon a Time in the West is not just film.

It builds and builds to the most amazing climax.  The duel between Bronson and Fonda is the BEST!  Those flashbacks and the look in Fonda's eyes when he gets that mouthful of harmonica makes the hair on the back of my neck stand on end just by thinking about it!

363,basemnt-dwellr,One of the greatest westerns of all time,10,8 April 2003,"This weekend I got the chance to watch this movie (again) on tv after not having seen it for so many years. And in my opinion it is still a fantastic movie. Although if you've got the chance, you should watch it on the big screen, not on tv.Best of all is the cinematography. How shall I explain it? The movie starts with three men waiting for a train at a train station in the middle of nowhere. Apart from the station master who wants to sell these men tickets, not a single word is spoken. You don't know anything about these men, you can only guess that the person they are waiting for must be on the next train. The scene is thirteen minutes (!) long, but it never gets boring. The whole film is made like that: many scenes are extremely long, and there is not much talking throughout the whole film, but it never gets boring. Despite its slow pacing the film manages to draw you in completely and despite its 165 minutes the film is not one minute too long.The characters are portrayed as real people, not 100% good, not 100% bad. The actors are really great. During the movie I was thinking: 'who else could play that role?' and I came up with no answers. Best of all was Jason Robards as Cheyenne and Henry Fonda as the villain (Frank). Charles Bronson as Harmonica is also excellent. But I also liked Claudia Cardinale's character (Jill). She plays a strong woman, quite untypical for a western and for the time in which this film was made (1968).This film focuses more on the dark side of the west, and the dark side of human nature as well. Contrary to ""The Good The Bad And The Ugly"" this film is not funny. As a matter of fact it is deadly earnest.
Ennio Morricone's score is just great. It fits perfectly into the scenes and the main characters all have their own theme.All in all a brilliant film, a must see.",Once Upon a Time in the West
364,Jim-499,"""You brought two too many!""",10,8 June 2001,"Excellent, from the always-underrated, unique Sergio Leone direction, to the acting, to the story, to the always-excellent, passionate, haunting Ennio Morriconne (SP) music.I always liked this movie, first viewing it on television sometime before 1971 as a young lad.We also studied it in film class at Cal State Chico, 1981, myself writing the quiz.  According to the highly-respectable instructor, the story goes that the three Clint Eastwood ""Spaghetti Westerns"" were so popular, that the movie studio gave Sergio Leone a blank check for what was considered a lot of money in those days, and said, essentially, ""Go make the movie you want,"" and he made ""Once Upon A Time In The West.""

Leone's previous westerns to this one are good, especially the masterful Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, but this one really is his true masterwork and pretty much the final word in westerns. Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven was a superb sort of ""send off"" for the genre, in terms of fairly traditional westerns, OUATITW is simply the towering achievement of what feels like lifetimes of work. An amazing film. One of those ""you must see this before you die"" type of thing. It also showcases the brilliance of Ennio Morricone, yet again. All the talent involved just really came together for a colossal project..something that really humbles all that came before it and, as many have said, you will never see this again. Tarantino's Kill Bill comes close in terms of being an homage to past cinema (which this film was intended to be, to a certain degree), but the sharp dramatics and stunning originality are just impossible to imitate.

367,sapblatt,"Well-made, classic Western epic from Sergio Leone",9,22 December 2003,"Sergio Leone's epic 1968 (1969 USA release) western masterpiece `Once Upon A Time in the West' is a visually and emotionally stunning film from start to finish. The location shots filmed in Utah and Arizona are wide and bright to the eye. Leone and his cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli have complete grasp on what they are seeing and how they want it to appear on the big screen. Beyond the stunning visual aspects of this film one should not lose sight of the high-quality acting that is going on all around. As someone who is under of the age of 40 (in 2003) I mainly know Henry Fonda as a grandfather figure in `On Golden Pond.' Fonda's depiction of the gang leader Frank is one of the most harrowing and evil characters you will ever come across. Fonda's steely blue eyes and lack of any moral sense at all are played beautifully. Frank is as scary as Michael Madsen (`Mr. Blonde') in Tarantino's `Reservoir Dogs.'Jason Robards, as usual is great as another `bad guy,' Cheyenne Gutierrez. However for my money, Charles Bronson steals this movie. I usually enjoy Bronson, and have seen most of his classics (`The Dirty Dozen,' `The Mechanic,' `Mr. Majestyk,' `Death Wish') and have never seen him act this well. He is truly a gifted actor when under the capable direction of Leone. Claudia Cardinale (a Tunisian born Italian actress that has had few roles in US films) also does an admirable job as the widow/prostitute Jill McBain.Some directors have a great deal of difficulty retaining complete artistic control of their projects. Leone is perhaps the greatest example of this. Two of his best films (this one and `Once Upon a time in America') were originally released in the United States only after being edited down by about 35 % from their originally intended length. Needless to say, both edited versions are impossible to follow and not worth following. After fifteen years `Once Upon a Time in the West' was re-released in the United States in 1984 to rave reviews and it is now regarded as one of the best westerns of all time. Other directors like Francis Ford Coppola (`Apocalypse Now') and Quentin Tarantino `Kill Bill, Volume I') have had similar fates with their projects. Perhaps someday studio heads will understand when they are working with genius, or at least cut a little slack to directors who have made them plenty of money and have a good track record as was the case with Paramount and Miramax with the aforementioned films. Of course, the more likely scenario is that things will remain the same and artists who make studios millions will be asked `what have you done for us lately?'",Once Upon a Time in the West

Leone's masterful storytelling and Morricone's crazy, beautiful, epic soundtrack; desperate, haunted faces that look like the barren landscapes the story is set in and a plot that unfolds with impeccable pacing to culminate in THE ultimate western finale. As in Leone's previous films, music isn't just used to add to the atmosphere but is essential to the story, or perhaps even more: Morricone's main musical theme plays the actual role of a (or rather: the) protagonist in the film. Anyone who thought that the so called ""Spaghetti Westerns"" were nothing but cheap, violent B-movies had to reconsider after seeing this film.

370,cwkenreich,"Painful, tedious first watch, but appreciated it more 2nd time",9,28 July 2021,"It's been widely agreed that protagonist Jill McBain represents progress and civilization to tame the chaotic, lawless frontier. Actress Claudia Cardinale played a strong-willed soul unfazed by the abuse she endures around her.The film repeatedly depicts a train, whether arriving the station, or track being built. In the opening, film historians would mostly agree the train's presence foreshadows an action scene, but subsequent appearances suggest that capitalism and industry are arriving to modernize this primitive society. On a superficial level, one can't help but feel awestruck by the stunning cinematography when Jill McBain is riding through town. The sweeping music and the majestic scope convey liveliness as well as future prosperity, suggesting that expanding trade is invigorating the town. However, any auspicious assumptions are shattered by the following scenes, where McBain enters a bar with foliage, dim lighting and numerous structural beams that resembled a thick jungle or a prison. It is here that she encounters the outlaws and the rogues for the first time. Also, The first scene of Frank and mr Morton is ironically inside a train car. Both of which reveal the underbelly of the West. This facade of progress and visual appeal overshadowing the corruption underneath could be a microcosm for America itself in it's gilded age.The juxtaposition of nearly static scenes that drag and blink-and-you'll-miss-it gunshots is a symbiotic relationship frequently employed by Leone. The former immerses viewers in the emotions, the atmosphere, the grandeur and fear of the American West while the latter sets the plot in motion, adding another layer of complexity with each gunshot.The final scene of Cheyenne dying and Harmonica riding off into the wilderness represents the belief that it was inevitable for their kind of dandy gunslingers of the Wild West to die out amongst the arrival of a new societal order. ""I'm not your kind, and neither is he"" says Cheyenne to Jill. It would only be appropriate for her final appearance to be bring out her water to nourish the workers of progress.Some final words: while westerns are some of the most atmospheric and sensory experiences, Leone tests the audience's patience with as many visual descriptions as possible. Various scenes of characters simply staring convey the notion that they are mind reading one another. Just the expressions on their close-up faces allow viewers to fill in the blanks with superfluous conversations, saving only the most crucial dialogue to be read verbally. Besides facial communication, the editing was phenomenal, particularly during the climactic duel where only one line of dialogue and parallel imagery allows viewers to finally uncover Harmonica's backstory. The thrill of this revelation, combined with the dramatic music and Frank's glorious defeat makes it my favorite scene in the movie.",Once Upon a Time in the West

While the storyline itself isn't complex, it's characters are compelling, rich and intriguing as Sergio Leone delivers what most western's do without, suspense. Jill Mcbain(Claudia Cardinale)a prostitute travelling from New Orleans to start a fresh life on the frontier with her awaiting husband, arrives only to find him slain, as locals gather to offer their condolences. Leoni's greatest weapon in this movie is his foresight to cast against type. Henry Fonda, not known for villainous streak, plays Frank, the muscle used by the railroad to enforce it's dominance across the desolate wastelands of America's West. As good as Fonda is, it's Charles Bronson's movie. He may prefer the sound of a harmonica over his own voice, but what he lacks in dialect, he more than makes up for with a quick draw. This is more than a movie, it's an experience in my mind, a piece of history, as the west is portrayed as a haunting brutal land that discriminates against absolutely no-one. 10 outta 10 guaranteed!!!",Once Upon a Time in the West
372,hanvl,Beautiful score and great film,10,17 March 2011,"Perhaps the most famous of Leone's western with unforgettable music score. The story of lone hit-man Harmonica (Charles Bronson) going for his revenge is a classic. Leone in this move hired Bronson for his hero with no name instead of his usual Eastwood. Instead of Eastwood here are another actor heavyweights as Fonda, Cardinalle and Robarts. This story is very good; it follows more plot line for them to cross at the end. Also until the final shootout it is not clear why does Harmonica seeks revenge. Acting is overall very good, weakest links is Bronson who was the worst of main actors, but as he is not required to act much he is good. Fonda is great as villain and is clearly enjoying playing main antagonist. Robarts is very convincing as good natured bandit. Cardinale is very beautiful and also very good as prostitute trying to get a new life. Score is amazing as in all three preceding Leones westerns.",Once Upon a Time in the West
373,cruizca,One of the greatest movies of history,9,18 November 2020,"The form before the plot, the aesthetics before the American myth and music as a common thread. Sergio Leone grew up watching westerns and he teaches us about it in Until His Time Has Come. Leone plays with us like he did with the Ford movies. Frank (Henry Fonda) as a wonderful antagonist and an outstanding soundtrack. Symbolic, contemplative and fascinating. Once upon a time there was the most famous simmered revenge in Spaghetti western.The beggining; hypnotic and elongated wonder. That nod to Solo in the face of danger (Fred Zinnemann, 1952), faces, music stops, boots, hats, revolver and the fly. An unbalanced duel with the air of a fableHarmonica: And Frank?Snaky: Frank sent us.Harmonica: Did you bring a horse for me?Snaky: Well ... looks like we're ...
... looks like we're shy one horse.Harmonica: You brought two too many.Music is one of the most important elements of the film. Ennio Morricone composed one of the most iconic soundtracks in the history of cinema. It was created before the shoot, and Leone liked it so much that he used it to set the stage for performances on the set. In addition, he came to rewrite the script for greater text-music harmony. The harmonica leitmotif and the main theme (which was covered by Dire Straits), take on a special meaning in each shot.One of the things that most caught my attention in this movie are the characters. None is exemplary. Jill (Claudia Cardinale) is a prostitute from New Orleans who gets to sleep with her husband's murderer; Chayenne (Jason Robards) is a criminal who resists the passage of time; Frank is ambitious, but he only knows how to use guns, so he is destined to die; Harmonica (Charles Bronson) is the product of Frank's atrocities, a man flooded with revenge, and that is why he ignores that Jill ends up falling in love with him.Despite fleeing from the conventions of ""classic western"" (in the scene of the murder of the McBains, it was unthinkable not to show the back shot of the child), Leone could not avoid the final duel. Harmonica saves the man with whom she will fight to the death later. The ending is more beautiful, if possible, than the beginning of the film. A duel in The Last Sunset (Robert Aldrich, 1961), crane shots, slow-motion flashbacks ... And faces, more faces.Until its time it is beautiful and moving. It is a fable that reinvents the western, brings it closer and charges it with emotions and memories. The outcome is a different and prosperous future, symbolized by the model that Jill holds in her hands, in which she can live together.The film works perfectly, and among all its successes, I prefer the soundtrack by Ennio Morricone and the eyes of Henry Fonda. Probably one of the best casting hits I've seen and will ever see.""How can you trust a man that wears both a belt and suspenders?"" ""Man can't even trust his own pants"".",Once Upon a Time in the West
374,bobdude-2,Wow - why did it take me so long to see this movie?,10,21 June 2012,"Once Upon a Time in the West - This was the first time I ever saw this flick. Wow. It is so great to sit down with a movie that you know nothing about and have it turn into a real gem. This movie was beautifully filmed. A real master at work. The story starts with a brutal attack that had me wondering why? I wanted to know right away. However, Sergio was on his own schedule as slowly, but surely, the layers of the story are revealed. The pacing reminded me a bit of Kill Bill. I figured Tarantino was a fan, and it turns out he is. Henry Fonda usually plays the good guy, but I really didn't know if his Frank or Charles Bronson's character was the good guy. Of course, good and bad are especially relative in cases like this! Charles Bronson doesn't have a name and IMDb lists him as Harmonica. He was played as a real mystery. A man with his own agenda, who didn't have problems killing anyone. He also played the harmonica with a wild tone that was pretty sweet. Due to the deliberate pacing of the movie there were a few times where I was on the edge of my seat. Waiting for what I thought should happen to hurry up and happen! Ultimately, the whole thing worked. The reveal of Harmonica's back story was a surprise. It left me wondering, now that his goal in life was finished would he stick with the girl?Speaking of the girl, that whole thing was relative too! The more I learned about her, the more I wondered would living with her really be a happily ever after? Early on, I was a little perplexed by her behavior. Even wondering if she was just acting poorly. I suppose after learning all about her, it is possible that is how her character would behave. That was a great watching experience. According to IMDb, Once Upon a Time in the West is number 23 all time. Certainly better than any of the Oscar nominees that year. No surprise there.",Once Upon a Time in the West
375,Irate_Tyrant,Once Upon A Time Is The Best,10,21 July 2006,"""My weapons might look simple to you, Mr. Morton, but they can still shoot holes big enough for our little problems.""Leone gets a budget that's proportional to his expertise, and now we want to complain about length. Shoot, the more the merrier, in my case. It could be speculated that Al Mulock would have postponed his unfortunate suicide for a chance to survive the first showdown. But at 164 minutes, this is hardly overkill.""Get the costume! We need the costume!""Dario Argento, one of my personal favorites, takes writing credit alongside the usual suspects; Bernardo Bertolucci and Sergio Leone. Call it the good, bad, and ugly of Italian screenwriters. Ennio Morriccone returns for the soundtrack, and once again composes a masterpiece. The cinematographer was the man who masterminded the spinning graveyard scene that enthralled us at the end of ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly"", so expect this one to up the ante. The actors, though, is where the credibility of Leone's previous work is really evident. Henry Fonda plays a villain named Frank, need I say more? Well, yes I need, because that tasty, zesty widow is quite easily one of my top picks for hottest women to lead a role in a film, Claudia Cardinale. So hot, in fact, that I have to admit I didn't know whether to cheer or cry for her during the softcore sex scene. I mean, for real, John Landis of all people has credits in the film. As a stunt double.Well enough credit-talk, let's get to the plot. If money is indeed the root of all evil, it must have been intentional that for once, after the ""Fistful Of Dollars"" series, that the green bill doesn't enter much into the scene of the film. These guys are just plain bad. Most of the fighting goes on over an empty, unwanted plot of land. Prospects can be almost as important as respect, the story seems to tell us. No, really. We see money only a handful of times in the duration of the film. It's probably used most effectively here, when it's refused. But as the body count rises, and rises, and rises, it reminds us that where there is a serious power struggle, emotions fly just as often as bullets. Revenge, it must be, yet we don't ever truly know why.So, if we accept that Frank is indeed one of the toughest sons of a gun in film making history, which he is, then it only leads to reason that lone gunners won't stand a chance. Enter Jason Robarbs, and the resulting factor of breaking typecast will bring a smile to your face. It sure better. Because the heroic Harmonica, played by Charles Bronson, couldn't play a harmonica to save his life. But who is going to deny a protagonist who doesn't stop smiling while being tied to a train and smacked around by an angry, angry man with a gun.In another turn of events, Leone finally writes a piece where the ending will leave you reeling back when you see who the final profiteer is. Well I suppose that's the way these types of triangles work.If you don't like westerns in general, don't expect that this will change your mind that much. It probably will, anyway, because the epic proportions of the storyline are undeniable. But as usual in Sergio Leone's films, you might have no idea why there are so many people getting shot until about midway through the film. Remember, this is an intelligent western from an intelligent man. It's his prerogative to create something sort of like a good Italian spaghetti bowl; lots of long strands, that when twisted around each other just right, make for a delicious bite.""He not only plays. He can shoot too.""""Once Upon A Time In The West"" (1968) 10/10",Once Upon a Time in the West
376,thegreatshonen,Beautiful Masterpiece From the Master of Westerners,9,12 November 2012,"This is the definition of the western. The loner antihero, the damsel in need of help, and an overarching villain. This film is one of the greatest works of cinema from the 60's, an under appreciated gem in its time, finally given its respect. And respect it deserves. The film starts off with a dazzling sequence, which the protagonist, harmonica, kills three would-be assassins sent to kill him by Frank. The it shifts to the paralleling story of how the west has grown, and the frontier is dying. Our hero is caught on a revenge trip to avenge the death of his family, and the death of his lovers family. Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda give reverse roles and are outstanding in them. It all leads up to one of my favorite confrontations in a movie, between Harmonica and Frank. The cinematography and setting is beautiful. The pacing is good also and compliments a great story written by Sergio Leone. This is 2 hours and 45 minutes worth sitting through. This film is like a traditional western and is not for everyone. But if u can overlook a few cliques, you can experience and epic piece of cinema that is probably Sergio Leone's finest. Beautiful, simply that. 9/10",Once Upon a Time in the West
377,chrisart7,lumbering and interminable,3,17 February 2015,"I recently purchased a double DVD package of ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and re-watched this film after having revisited the ""Dollars"" trilogy...and what a comedown. First the positives: a lovely score from Ennio Morricone (especially the ""Jill""/Claudia Cardinale theme), gorgeous photography, sets, locations, lighting, and some decent (but not terribly great) acting - Gabriele Ferzetti probably comes off best in his role. You know you're in trouble when the very last bit in the documentary extras is a quotation of Sergio Leone worriedly admitting to co-scripter Bernardo Bertolucci that he had set the pace far too slow when filming the opening sequences, and that the ensuing film would probably be five hours long as a result. It was almost three, and it barely moves along at all. The plot is paper thin and could have easily been filmed in 90 minutes. Perhaps then the much-needed forward momentum and suspense would be in place. As it is, the film has far too protracted silences which do not advance it at all.Henry Fonda's villain Frank is rather drab and one dimensional, especially in comparison to Gian Maria Volonté's romanticized villains Ramon and Indio in the first two ""Dollars"" films. Fonda is also not even remotely formidable as a physical opponent for Charles Bronson. I'm not certain why Jason Robards' Cheyenne character is even in the film---perhaps as comic relief, but he does not ever really seem to belong in the Old West, despite his grizzled appearance. He and Bronson have none of the chemistry and camaraderie that Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef had in ""For a Few Dollars More."" Claudia Cardinale is beautiful and beautifully photographed, but even her character is rather one dimensional.Back to the music: for this film Ennio Morricone recorded the score in advance (unlike the ""Dollars"" films), and some of the soaring themes arrive early in the film and are far too stridently emotional for characters and situations which have not yet won the viewers' hearts. He should have subdued some of his orchestration of the same themes earlier in the film, then revisited them in full intensity after some of the drama had likewise escalated. As such it is a bad marriage of sound and celluloid at the outset.In the end it is director Sergio Leone's fault for not shooting this film so that the story would unfold at a much faster pace. It seems he didn't learn his lesson, though, as his next film ""A Fistful of Dynamite"" (1972) suffered from the very same problems. I donated the ""West"" DVD set to my local library just before writing this review; perhaps someone else will enjoy it.",Once Upon a Time in the West
378,waynec50,"Great Movie, Acting, Direction and Music",9,18 March 2008,"""Once Upon a Time in the West"" has been recently released in a special 2 disc set, and it's about time. The movie gets better every time you watch it. Sergio Leone's directing is incredible, the pacing and suspense are unparalleled. He squeezes every speck out of every scene without dragging them out. His choice of Henry Fonda as the bad guy and his sales pitch to get him are well worth it. At the time, nobody could imagine Fonda as a bad guy. Charles Bronson is perfect as the enigmatic ""Harmonica"", bringing his craggy face, economical delivery and a sense of decency to the role that's hard to imagine anyone else could bring. Jason Robards portrays Cheyenne with dash and layers of larceny, chivalry, humor and ruthlessness that bring this complicated character to life. Claudia Cardinale is, of course, beautiful, and gives Jill McBain different aspects, former lady of the night, apparent gold-digger, disappointed and too soon widow, clever seeker of the truth of her husband's dream, used and abused woman and finally friendly hostess for Cheyenne and the railroad workers. The supporting cast is terrific. Paolo Stoppa is sarcastic, crusty but also concerned for Jill when they find her new family murdered. Lionel Stander is great as a saloon keeper who engages Jill in conversation, and when it's interrupted, picks up as if only seconds had elapsed rather than several tense minutes. Jack Elam and Woody Strode are cold eyed killers. Keenan Wynn has a nice cameo as the sheriff and auctioneer. The score is majestic, gritty and perfect, the individual themes convey more than dialogue could. The final showdown resolves a mystery surrounding ""Harmonica"" and Frank. The final scene as Cheyenne dies and Jill brings water to the rail gangs is a neat summation of the West that will never be the same again. Harmonica's observation that man is a vanishing race being replaced by soulless machines and corporations is an apt eulogy for the men living on the edge of the law. Just about a perfect movie.",Once Upon a Time in the West

In fact this movie is worse than From Justin to Kelly, and to believe that was bad.If you want a good western go and rent out THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY.

380,ed_zeppelin,The death of the west maybe-but a noble death indeed,10,3 July 2004,"In 'The Good, The Bad And The Ugly', Sergio Leone made what is generally known as the quintessential spaghetti western. All the more remarkable then that his follow up has won even more acclaim from fans of the genre-in fact, fans of great films in general.With the trademark close up/long shot style of shooting, the dollars trilogy can be easily classed as arty. At a dramatic level, however, they are still for the most part (albeit excellent) pulpy shoot-em-outs, a fact all the more obvious when compared to 'Once Upon A Time In The West'. Here, serious art mixes with ultra-cool gunslingers and filters through all parts of the film, to create one of the most stylistic and visually gorgeous films ever made.To review the film itself, the best place to start would be the beginning. The Virgin Film Guide argues that this film's title sequence is the most famous in cinema history. I'm not sure if I agree with that totally-my vote would go to 'Reservoir Dogs', although doubtless there are many others that I am entirely ignorant of-but while maybe not being as famous as made out, it still ranks as one of the best title sequences ever. This is all the more remarkable given that nothing happens: three men wait for a train at a station. That's it. The ten minute scene is dialogue free (apart from a few lines uttered by a doddery old ticket collector at the very beginning) and totally without incident, yet it is taught, nerve-tugging and hypnotic. The tension is carried by the natural menace of Woody Strode, Jack Elam and Al Mulock as they collect water, shoo flies and crack their knuckles, while in the background the sounds of the breeze and a creaking windmill bypass the ears completely and go straight to the brain. Then, suddenly, the train arrives, Charles Bronson gets off, blows his harmonica, and BOOM...The film then cuts to a devastating massacre scene in which a family of innocents (for added poignancy) are wiped out by the bad guy to end all bad guys. The scene is dramatic, shocking (really) and totally perfect, in terms of drama, acting, cinematography and score, thus usefully leading me into several other points that can be applies to the film in general.
In dramatic terms, the film is too slow for some in this modern age of films that look more like music videos (I'm talking to you, McG) but what Leone is doing here is cranking up the tension. Take the scene where Cheyenne arrives at the bar and has his handcuffs shot off-the ""action"" is so low key that it is not sufficient to relieve the tension, and by the end the viewer is about ready to explode. There is only one proper action scene-where Frank is attacked by his own band of treacherous mercenaries-in the entire film. A far cry from the wall-to-wall gunfights of other westerns, but no bad thing. The drama ties in with the music to create an emotional effect to make us sad even when the baddies die, let alone the goodies.Next: the cast. Charles Bronson's role is one that suits him perfectly, a stoic mystery man with little to say. Jason Robards's Cheyenne is charming to watch. Gabriele Ferzetti, although he plays a villain, gives the role such emotion that the viewer is compelled to like him, however pathetic he may be. By general consensus though, the real tour-de-force is Henry Fonda as the ice-cold murderer Frank. Although the whole typecasting issue is probably lost on modern audiences, he still makes a terrific bad guy all the same-so frightening he makes the crickets stop chirping.The film is beautifully shot. The McBain massacre, where the gunmen stride menacingly out of the bushes...and especially the flashback, where we learn the motivations of Harmonica. I won't give it away, but wow. The flashback is probably the best-shot scene of the film, which is really saying something.It's late at night now as I write this, so I'll give the final word to the music. THE music-Ennio Morricone does it again. This is an extremely varied score, ranging from a sweeping, love theme to electric guitar that sounds like it is being plucked with a razor blade. And given that it was all written before shooting started, it is given an added mystique for fans of scores. Beautiful.That's it. I have only scratched the surface-no review could cover everything without hugely exceeding IMDB's word limit-and I have not even touched on the whole ""death of the west"" theme, or mentioned Claudia Cardinale. But it's all there for you to find out. Ladies and gentlemen: the perfect western.",Once Upon a Time in the West

What could go wrong with this movie? judging from the IMDb rating, nothing. But since I liked very much the Dollars trilogy and Once Upon a Time in America, I am writing this review to warn others that they might, possibly, be as disappointed as I was.So, once again, what can go wrong with this movie? for starters, one can figure out, very early on, that it is going to end with a gunfight between the two main characters, and therefore that they are not in any danger at any point in the movie. That is true of many other westerns, but I cannot think of any other western where the entire plot consists of a series of diversions with the sole purpose of delaying the final gunfight -- for nearly three hours. Good westerns, and good action movies in general, build up the tension, which is not the case here: the final gunfight might as well have happened in the first scene, if both of the main characters had shown up at the train station. Apart from that, there were other excellent opportunities which the main characters let go to waste. They should have seized their chances and saved us a lot of time, part of which could have been used in finding images of Ms. Cardinale on the web.On the positive side, the final gunfight is worth fast-forwarding to.As is often the case, my rating is lower than it would have been without high expectations.",Once Upon a Time in the West

390,Arriflex1,The West: Still Wild And In Wonderful Widescreen,10,11 November 2013,"The plaintive wail of an harmonica echoes across a dusty landscape flattened by a merciless sun. Soon, the savage, ringing chords of an electric guitar answer in explosive dissonance. In front of this aural disruption a weatherbeaten humanity scrambles in and out of buildings and across walkways hacked from trees and thrown together too roughly. A fearsome lust to own the land draws the righteous and the corrupt alike. There is greed aplenty. Murder is no stranger. And vengeance hangs in the air. Sergio Leone's undying love for the Western reached its zenith in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. The film is a sprawling tapestry come to life, teeming with energy, highly stylized in its look and tempo. Like SHANE before it, Leone's unqualified masterpiece has influenced every Western in its wake. The film is complemented greatly by the magnificence of Ennio Morricone's music and Tonino Delli Colli's breathtaking widescreen photography. The performances are seminal works. Though Henry Fonda had played it hard and mean before (see John Ford's FORT APACHE and MY DARLING CLEMENTINE), he knocked the audience for a loop with his grizzled bad guy. Robards gives his world-weary rogue irresistible charm. Bronson is galvanizing as the man on a mission (he's SHANE gone slightly maniacal). And the graceful determinism of Cardinale adds a much needed civility to the surrounding upheaval. This is Leone's greatest film and ONCE is absolutely essential viewing.

Even if you show this to a kid, who has very rigid views on cowboys-and-indians (if kids still play that?), although the child will be bored by many parts of the film, some images, puzzle and intrigue it, as they did me when I was 10 years of age.The appeal lies in its iconic and archetypal characters. They all are strong, independent and awe-inspiring; even a prosaic character like Morton has a nobility and an tragedy that makes loathing him impossible. And the Tragedy of the film, the great melancholy expressed by its cinematography and score, is loneliness. Every character is lonely,a solitary person, who by fate and failure created a desire for survival that can only be described as epic. As a man, the three main men in the film all appeal to some deep masculine part in me. Frank, the will to power. Cheyenne, the opportunist and Harmonica the absolute unwavering unification of justice and revenge. And most women, will deeply feel for Jill McBain's character, who's female fortitude even impresses a misogynist as myself.But don't waste yer time reading reviews that say how brilliant this film is!

Cross him off the list. Its all just cash-in time, now."" And for almost 40 years, I never saw Once Upon A Time In The West. Oh sure, there were those late night TV airings where I saw the first excruciatingly exquisite scene and dug the music and the mood and then fell asleep. But, a couple of Ennio Morricone CDs always kept the theme music to Once Upon A Time in my immediate memory. I vowed to sit through the whole thing the next time it came on late night TV. Last night was the night I came to realize what a fool I'd been all those years. Wow, what a film. Every scene is a delight to behold, especially now that I have a 46"" LCD to enjoy it all the more. The shots of Monument Valley (reminiscent of How The West Was Won-another personal fave) are incredible as are all the trademark Leone close-ups. Everything in the movie is just perfect. Fonda is the ultimate villain (WHO KNEW!), Robards is excellent, as usual, even Claudia Cardinale provides more than the de rigeur eye candy.

It was clear that Sergio Leone now thought of himself as a sort of Fellini of westerns.I think he must have created this whole project with the sole purpose of providing material for film history courses in universities. Every sight, sound and character has a flashing neon sign reading ""Symbolism"" complete with pointing arrow in case you're missing it. It is mostly baffling, and I don't have the patience or respect for movies that you supposedly have to work hard at to unravel like I used to have when I was eager to prove to everybody how intellectual I was. In the end, once you get to the bottom line statement of such films, I can usually think of about half a dozen slightly more mainstream ""Hollywood"" films that say the same thing more effectively, engagingly, and forcefully. There's nothing new under the sun--there isn't anything new to be said about man's virtues, vices, struggles and triumphs. It's all there in Shakespeare, so to speak.In sum, this movie is completely self-conscious about how profound and deep it supposedly is, and that's why I say its mannered. It's a real dinosaur from the late 60s, and truly stuck there.That said, there are some standout scenes in between all the showing off. The famous opening train depot sequence does indeed deserve its reputation. The final revelations between Henry Fonda's character and Clint East...er, I mean Charles Bronson's character were supremely handled, I must say. That was a great scene, beginning to end.",Once Upon a Time in the West
398,casstevens-43612,Just too slow for my taste,6,24 January 2021,"I had pretty high hopes for this movie . I had already seen Leone's ""the good , the bad & the ugly "" , which was imo a great movie . However imo "" Once upon a time in the West "" doesnt come close to it . It starts off with an incredibly long scene with hardly any dialogue . Next , more of that , but with some very nice shots of the town and the landscapes with some western music played over it , which I like . But after a while , I really had a hard time focusing , since everything was simply too slow paced . I give it a 6 for the beautiful cinematography .",Once Upon a Time in the West
399,braco,IT IS SOOOOO GREAT,10,31 July 1999,"This movie is perfect in every single detail. Rarely a movie leaves such a tremendous impact on me. IT IS SOOOOOOO GREAT. The acting is marvelous (Fonda was really a genius) and Claudia is.... ah, what can I say? This ranks absolutely among the all-time greatest westerns and I recommend it warmly. 11 out of 10.",Once Upon a Time in the West
400,Eddie C.,Who cares that Clint Eastwood isn't in this film?,10,8 January 1999,"It has been said many times that the role of ""Harmonica"" was intended for Clint Eastwood. But I think it's enormously unfair to Charles Bronson to endlessly speculate on what Eastwood may or may not had done. Who cares? Eastwood had his chance and turned it down. Bronson seized it and made the most of it. Not only do I think that ""West"" is Bronson's best movie, I think Bronson does a better job in this film than Eastwood in the ""spaghetti trilogy"".If you think about it, all three leads in this film are cast against type. Charles Bronson is not the type of actor you'd think of for a lead as a hero (although he did a great job in ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Great Escape."") The average person thinks of Jason Robards as a crotchety grandfather, certainly not a cunning outlaw a la ""Tuco"" in ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly."" And was there ever a more unlikely villain in screen history than Henry Fonda, who build a career on playing sincere, kind protagonists? (By the way, Fonda's role was originally intended for John Wayne, who turned it down.) And yet all of these great actors make you forget their other personnas and suck you into Sergio Leone's world...",Once Upon a Time in the West

402,morlock9,Almost great but for the miscasting,7,8 November 2013,"The amazing cinematographic touch of Leone is there, and his flawless capture of the grit and grandeur that MUST have been the west of 150 years ago is worth the price of admission alone. But amidst this visual feast are flaws that prevented a higher score from me. The first is the plot itself, which revolves around a woman, a ""former"" prostitute, and her three lovers- all of whom are major characters in the film who battle each other in some form or another. Actually, I read this afterward on IMDb. You could have fooled me on that one. Women have no place in a Leone western to begin with, and Claudia simply did not have the acting range to pull it off. She was in a lot of scenes but I never thought of her as the focus of the film. Sophia Loren cast in the role might have brought a magnetic quality to the woman, perhaps, but not Claudia. Which comes to the miscasting. With Leone's star firmly in the ascendant, it is clear that all of Hollywood wanted in on this one, and Sergio obliged, to the detriment of the movie. Jason Robards, as a commenter already noted, is dreadful as Cheyenne. He brings nothing to the movie and his hang-dog acting style is irritating and tiresome. Bronson as the protagonist Harmonica is too short and ethnic looking to be convincing as a tough guy. And the harmonica playing ""hook"" of the movie is laughable, though it makes some convoluted sense at the end of the movie. Hey, a tough guy has to be ready to draw his gun at ALL times. If you play a harmonica, not only do you use two hands, but you must concentrate on the melody. Just didn't work for me. The main theme was superb, but the secondary theme- where the banjo is being plucked in a jaunty tune- was out of place and WAY overused. Other plot holes are where the heck did McBain get the money to build a big house and purchase lumber and supplies to build an entire town? And if he had money, why would he marry a New Orleans prostitute? So a great movie, for it is a Leone, but with many, many flaws.",Once Upon a Time in the West
403,Madhu-Van-Paare,"A Masterpiece, by the master Sergio Leone. A movie that stood the tooth of time, and the inspiration of Star Wars",10,12 November 2016,"This movie is arguably even better then The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. It is slow paced, but this is due to an amazing score by life time collaborator and friend Ennio Morricone. Claudia Cardinale steals the show, and gives the performance of a lifetime. In fact the shot after Claudia Cardinal comes in the train station, was made after the music was made, and when the camera pans up, the music accompanies it in perfect harmony (this was duly noted by Brian De Palma, who could not figure out that the shot was made after the music was made, until Leone told him). Best performance of Charles Bronson, and the casting of Henry Fonda as the bad guy is simply genius, and arguably also his best performance ever. It describes the industrial revolution, symbolized by the train, the train tracks, and the train station. And lest we forget, Jason Robards' best performance ever, as Cheyenne. ""Hey Mr. Choo Choo?!"". This movie is arguably the inspiration for Star Wars and many, many movies.",Once Upon a Time in the West
404,saywell-206-518541,Overhyped Oldie,3,12 April 2018,"Bronson looks so dumb that you wont think there is a brain inside that cowboy. He was just lucky at that time era to get into this. Just staring around was the greatest acting required..Making things go really slow, stare a lot, increase surrounding noises a lot and you have a western? no. Watch Eastwood movies and you really get a feel for style. Not just unwashed people staring around, talking little andpretending to be in a movie..what an overhyped oldie. i love eastwood movies, or many other westerns, but this god, i sat through frame by frame just incase i missed what others might have missed. i can only imagine that in the past when there wasnt much else to call entertainment , this would have been great.. i always say that newer movies have scifi and no good story..but to have a soty and drag it out like this ...waste of my time!!",Once Upon a Time in the West

I have shown this to film students in a film class I have taught and I noticed many of the class members were getting a little fidgety throughout and a little bored. But during the last 30 minutes they were on the edge of their seats, shouting at the screen and clapping when it ended. They were all blown away. Even the young girl who thought she was sure to hate it and complained throughout the film, by the end became its most vocal admirer.This film may be a tad slow but that's only because the brilliant grande finale is build up slowly throughout and the mounting tension is released explosively at the end.

406,steenvreter29,Better than 'The Good..' Better than any western!,10,5 September 2000,"Once upon a time there was a bad guy named Henry Fonda... Anything is possible!From the very beginning of 'Once upon a time...', I realized that Leone was going to show us a lot more than he did in his 'dollar'-trilogy. That very first scene: how long does it last? Ten minutes? Fifteen? And nothing really happened (until Charles Bronson showed up of course)!But that's Sergio Leone: although he has a very slow style, his movies are so entertaining that you adore them. And why? Because he is a director who is an expert in casting, cinematography, editing, sounds and so on. In contribution of that, he just happens to be a good friend of the greatest western composer, Ennio Morricone of course. And this is his masterpiece, beyond doubt.'The movie is about a railroad', I once read in a newspaper. Nonsense! This movie is about 'THE' WEST. I mean, Sergio Leone's WEST. That kind of west consist of a lot of different personalities. We have a villain named Frank (played by Henry Fonda, it seems Leone made him go bad), a beautiful woman named Jill McBain whose husband has been killed, a mysterious guy playing a harmonica, looking for revenge and an outlaw, who is wrongly accused of having murdered Jill's husband.This movie didn't have as much action as I expected. But I don't care. It's made up by the great actors, the brilliant close-ups, Leone's visual greatness and Morricone's music, which is simply unforgettable. This is the best western ever made. Buy the film, and don't forget the soundtrack!",Once Upon a Time in the West
407,aldinchova,Story about accomplishment of Universal Justice and human nature itself,10,19 September 2009,"""Once upon a time in the West"" is best and greatest western ever made,and only movie that comes close is ""Good,bad,ugly"" which is another masterpiece,but ""Once upon a time in the West"" is number one,and the question is will any western ever exceed strength and depth of this film. This is not just the best western ever made,but also one of the greatest films ever. Definitely this is the best film made by Sergio Leone and in this movie Leone has surpassed himself. Culmination of previous movies made by Leone from ""A fistful of dollars"", through ""For a few dollars more"" to ""Good,bad,ugly"", ""Once upon a time in the West"" is climax of his artistic creativity. He made other also great movies,non-westerns (like ""Once upon a time in America"") but this one stands on the top of everything he had done.Story in the middle of 19th century probably by the end of 1860s when railroads were built connecting America from east to west,from Atlantic to Pacific. We see Morton (Gabriele Perzetti) railroad tycoon. There is Frank (Henry Fonda) most dangerous local criminal working for Morton and intimidating people to sell land where railroad passes,sometimes killing them if they refuse like he did with Brett McBain and his family. There is Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) a widow of Brett McBain.There is a local outlaw Cheyenne (Jason Robards) and finally silent revenger called Harmonica (played by Charles Bronson) because he carries harmonica and plays,and nobody knows his name. He is there seeking revenge against Frank (and from his flashbacks from his childhood we know why).Telling Frank names of people killed by Frank he is there for revenge not just in his name,but also in names of those people. Harmonica and Cheyenne form alliance killing gang members that Franks sent against Harmonica. All those characters make this incredible story with lots of unpredictable reversals. Telling story from beginning to the end would be pointless-it is much better to watch the movie. Because in this film we see story about revenge in name of universal justice,story about great dreams and visions but dreamers do not live long enough to see their accomplishment. But other people benefit from them. We see real story of wild west and most of all,through this fictional characters story about great chapter in history and human nature itself.And,there comes the final scene of gunfight between Harmonica and Frank. They talk before that,Frank asks him who is he, but Harmonica tells him that he will find out that only in the moment of his death. They stand to each other on close distance and wait. Game of life and death. We see their faces and eyes and Harmonica remembers when he was a kid and forced by Frank to hold his older brother who was hanged on his shoulders. Frank puts harmonica in his mouth having fun with his gang members. Older brother curses Frank and hustles his young brother in dust which meant his instant death. Young brother falls in dust and harmonica falls off from his mouth. We quickly return in to present moment,Harmonica is faster on gun,he fires and hits Frank. Just a simple and perfect scene. Frank is on the ground and Harmonica puts harmonica in his mouth. Frank dies,his head falls in dust and harmonica falls of from his mouth. Harmonica returns to Jill, says goodbye to her,Cheyenne tells her how to behave with railroad workers on her land and he leaves with Frank. Cheyenne is wounded and Harmonica carries him on his horse.They leave. In last scene Jill serves workers on railroad that proceeds further. This film is so full of symbolics. We see most iconic scene in some solitude in wild west where a man is hanged on remnants of something that could be a church wall,and he is hanging on shoulder of his brother. This is universal symbol of every injustice and oppression,not just in wild west,but in whole human history. And when Harmonica kills Frank he delivers justice not only in name of himself and those killed by Frank,but also in name of all mankind. He is Man without name,he is everything people want to be,but they never dare to. Clint Eastwood did it one way, Charles Bronson did it the other way,and they both were excellent in that role. But different, which is good because Bronson gave more sensitivity to that character. We see dreams.Even when Morton is dead his dream lives on. Railroad proceeds further as we see in the end of movie. From one ocean to another railroads connected and built a great nation. Not only that,this is also symbol and message that after all,life goes on,because life is greater than all of us,and we are part of life itself. This is the final message of this great movie. Like in ""Good,bad,ugly"" and other films made by Leone Ennio Morricone did an excellent job in ""Once upon a time in the West"" with extraordinary soundtrack. Iconic melody from gunfight between Harmonica and Frank,melody in the end when railroad is being built or last melody in movie. Memorable. Something timeless and unforgettable. This film is something that you can watch lots of times without getting tired of it. With such complexity,strength,depth,symbolics and message ""Once upon a time in the West"" has a special place in cultural and artistic heritage of mankind.",Once Upon a Time in the West
408,greene-1,Less is more,10,2 April 2006,"This film is a masterpiece which excels in many areas. Its crowning glory is the way it handles elemental human themes like love, hate and the desire for justice. It also follows an intelligent script which doesn't patronise the audience, but leaves them to work out key points.The four main protagonists Fonda, Bronson, Robards and Cardinale each deliver outstanding performances and of course all the supporting actors are superb as well. But for me, the show stealer is Harmonica (Bronson) whose performance of a man driven by an other-worldly sense of injustice is absolutely mesmerising (the music score helps with this).In all, the performances, directing and music come together for a fantastic two plus hours, which, despite the unhurried pace of the film, keep you riveted to the screen.",Once Upon a Time in the West

410,TheAgent,"Unconventional, but very effective",10,2 April 2000,"There really aren't enough good things I can say about ""C'era una volta il West"" (aka Once Upon a Time in the West). The film seeks to be effective with unconventional techniques rather than using conventional techniques well.In many typical movies, you could remove the background music entirely, or switch the music segments around in different scenes and the effect of the movie would not be any different. In fact, the background music in many movies seems like a contrived plan to make sure that all the top 40 hits appearing on the soundtrack CD get included somehow. The music in this film was so critical to the images of its characters and scenes that the effectiveness of the film would be greatly diminished without it.In most movies, the acting is a combination of speech and personality. The irony of this film is that the best acting in it often occurs without a word being said. Long periods of silence occurred frequently, not just to build suspense, but to let the audience experience the emotions and personalities of the characters.",Once Upon a Time in the West
411,BigMan-12,Grossly Overrated Movie,5,31 May 2001,"Leone is usually stellar, but this movie is a misfire.  Perhaps its slow pace played better 30 years ago, but several moments in this movie are soooo sloooow that I couldn't stand it.  Every scene, every close-up is an opportunity for the actors to ham it up and further slow down the film. Unlike most who view this film, I found the acting to be rather ordinary for the most part.  Bronson was nothing special here; I can only surmise that people's preconceptions of Fonda led them to believe that he did a great acting job here. (Just because he was the heavy.)  Most of the characters did not appear to be more than standard cut-outs, or an opportunity for big-name stars to wear Western duds.Given the near-unanimity of opinion on this board, perhaps I need to see this again, but I doubt it.  ""Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo"" is a far superior movie to this; see that one instead.

412,seagem,Flashbacks done right - Once Upon a Time in the West,10,4 July 2011,"I agree with the other reviewers about the superlatives of this film but I haven't noticed a discussion on the use of the flashback so capably offered here. I am referring to Bronson's Harmonica recalling the incident that brought about his revenge for Fonda's Frank character: I am sure I will be corrected if this is in error but there are four total flashbacks where we get more information each time through a blurry recollection until in the final instance Fonda has the crystal clear flashback and we see Frank much younger committing his unspeakable crime. This fourth and final flashback clarifies to the villain and the film audience the motivation for the payback just as he finally ""bites the dust"". If you like Bronson here seek out the hard to find Rider on the Rain - not a Western but I think filmed in the same time period by a different director: At this time we can see Bronson is becoming this multi-national everyman hero that exploded his popularity. Truly watchable film entertainment that holds up beautifully upon repeat viewings.",Once Upon a Time in the West
413,blacktiefight,Leone approaching perfection........,10,2 September 2006,"If you are a fan of westerns, or great film-making in general, you must see this film. The film is very long, but you won't even notice. There is not one boring/mediocre shot in this movie! Leone is at the top of his craft, and everything is a visual feast. The characters are deep an unpredictable (the plot will keep you guessing). Bronson, Fonda, and Robards put on a clinic for the rest of the acting world. The film is about the railroads, and the towns and people that lived in their development. It is also about vendetta's long past. Once Upon In the Time is nothing new, as far as westerns go. It's a typical genre stuff. Vengeance, railroads and big business vs. the little guy. Yet this film is more entertaining and well made than 99% of westerns. Bronson is the mysterious stranger, Fonda is one despicable villain, and Robards is HILARIOUS.

This movie made me find Ennio Morricone online. I was shocked how many movies he scored.As I remember, I read that Henry Fonda was dubious about taking this role, casting him with his first role as villain. My favorite character is the one Jason Robards played.Someone has already said here that this is the best Western ever made, and thinking back to the scope of it, the sheer enormity of how the backgrounds and landscapes were shot, it is indeed an experience to see it, not just a pastime.",Once Upon a Time in the West

The music score provided Ennio Morricone is just amazing, its so powerful its almost chilling in nature. The character played by Henry Fonda thrills me every time I watch this film and the music that is associated to the character again chilling. The character that Henry Fonda plays is Frank and he is ice cold. Henry's eyes are such a vivid blue as the camera pans around on him.

417,antoniocenteno-87266,The greatest homage to Western of all time,10,21 March 2020,"It´s incredible to think that an Italian director played the game better than any american at directing Westerns, every Leone movie from the dollars trilogy changued the game of cinema about the wild west and by far influenced so much when it comes to how people watched that genre. Now imagine that, but is played as an hybrid between his spaghetti cinema and traditional western movies. That´s what makes this movie so amazing and great. Been honest i praise more the Good the bad and the Ugly as the ultimate western (and personal all time favorite) but Once upon a time in the west is just a different beast and was Leone´s more realistic movie at the time.This movie is a long drag but is a good one, the plot kicks in really slowly, you don´t know what the movie is about untill around 45 minutes after it started and finally is moving at around half the movie, when you see it objectivly the plot isn´t that big, other filmmakers will do a one hour and 45 minutes of film, but not Leone, there´s several long long shots with amazing cinematography and landscapes new to his movies.Leone´s close ups work here in a different way too, he was the kind of director that let face acting make the difference, but his previous movies where full of angry faces, fury and violence, here is a different story in the acting, we see concern, grief, greed and remorse, wich made Bronson, Fonda, Robards and Cardinale give a wide charachterization for their, well, charachters.The music in this movie is fantastic, Ennio Morriocne even called it the best he did in colaboration with Leone, it really puts you in the mood and is so haunting, gives the scenes so much power that is unreal.Once upon a time in the West is definetly a must see for people that love Westerns and movies, easly one of the greatest ever made and a true experience to the eyes.",Once Upon a Time in the West

The fly in the face of the bandit and the way that it killed are hilarious and strong at the same time. Harmonica (character of Bronson) reveal the duality of personality, usual in Leone's films.

Once Upon a Time in the West is a perfect film, a violent, emotional masterpiece, brandishing the shattered romanticism of the American Dream. This is the quintessential western, brimming with complex, hearty characters, each venturing to carve out a life in the brutal frontier of the American West.

What's more The Man with the Harmonica and Frank's theme are part of each others overall theme. Genius (an over used term but definitely applies to Mr. Morricone).Every frame; every shot, every sideways glance from the actors, every expression and every single pause in speech and the way the lines are delivered are totally deliberate and contribute to the unrivalled crescendo of any movie. Yes I hope you would have seen Movies such as The Usual Suspects and the original Planet of the Apes but this right here is the original 1968 ""Spoiler Alert"" FACT!.If you show this masterpiece to someone for the first time and someone else has already told them who Frank is and why Cahrles Bronson is looking for him then in the immortal words of the dearly departed Bill Paxton "",,,,I't game over man, it's game over!"" They would have robbed that person of one of THE if not THE greatest reveals of all time.Even the demise of Mr. Morton is played out with an ironic struggle to a puddle of water in the middle of the deseert with the sound of waves crashing in the background!.Fast forward to another of the greatest lines of ALL tim (spoiler Alert) ""you saved his life?!.....""I didn't let some one else kill him and that's not the same thing!"" Both of which delivered in expert tone and timing!I showed the same scene to 2 of my friends in their early 20's...Gill arriving at the train station and the camera panning over the top of the Ticket Office! both frineds totally gobsmacked and blown away. The following Friday we went for a Steak dinner together with my housemate and after the delicious Steak dinner returned to our place where we all partook in the grand first time viewing for the 3 lads in their twenties of this Cinematic Revelation/Spectcle.All 3 sat in complete silence and were toally absobed for the entirity of the 2hours 37 minutes running time and quite honestly it took them a good day or 2 to process and get to grips with what they had seen!So in semation (as I could break this movie down and lecture for hours why) simply the greatest and perfectly flawless movie ever made!",Once Upon a Time in the West

The music makes those scenes (and her) even more attractive.,Once Upon a Time in the West
422,TheUnholyPeanut,One of the Greatest Films ever made.,10,23 April 2021,"Once Upon a Time in the West is one of those films that always sticks with you. Sergio Leone really is a master, cementing himself in cinematic history with the Dollars Trilogy. Then, He made this film. While not as good as Leone's ultimate masterpiece, TGTBATU, this film is still a masterpiece and one of the greatest films of all time.First, We will have to begin with the acting. The acting in this film is basically flawless. Henry Fonda, who is normally casted as a hero, plays Frank, who is one of the most intimidating villains in cinematic history. He masterfully uses his amazing facial expressions as a actor, which makes Frank one of the most terrifying villains ever, as you can see with his pure evil smile and his blue piercing eyes. Henry Fonda's acting in of itself makes Frank basically emit a aura of Pure Evil in every scene he is in. Charles Bronson also perfectly plays Harmonica, who is a mysterious harmonica playing gunman, who is out for revenge. Charles Bronson uses his screen presence and masculinity to make Harmonica much more mysterious and Intimidating. Jason Robards also amazingly plays the confident and charismatic bandit Cheyenne. Claudia Cardinale is also great with her amazing facial acting as well, although some of her dialogue is a bit forced, but it is barely a issue since her angelic and divine facial acting makes up for all of it.Sergio Leone also uses symbolism in this film, which greatly improves the script. The main piece of symbolism is water, as dirty water is associated with death, but when Jill arrives we see references of more clean water. Also, After Frank rapes her, Jill says she needs hot water, in which she finally does. This means that water is a symbol of purification and transformation in this film.A common complaint is that Harmonica is a cheap ripoff of The Man with No Name, but I disagree since The Man with No Name is a masculine, intimidating, charismatic, and quiet bounty hunter while Harmonica is a haunted man out for revenge to kill the man who ruined his life.Once Upon a Time in the West is also a masterpiece of storytelling and directing. In the first 14 minutes, we see a mysterious harmonica wearing man appear, which gives us a huge question. Who is he? There is much more questions you ask later on like who is that blurry man walking towards us. Once Upon a Time in the West uses its amazing editing and directing to make the film an extremely complex mystery. The mystery grabs you and never let's go, as it makes you ask more questions all the time and think about every possible answer. The ending answers all your questions in probably the greatest reveal of all time (which I will not reveal.) The ending uses its tension, acting, music, and the complex mystery it has gave us to make it one of the greatest scenes ever filmed. Sergio Leone masterfully uses his skills to make this an extremely intense film. Sergio Leone also uses close ups, as always in a Sergio Leone western, which makes you see the emotional, superb facial acting from every actor. Ennio Morricone's score is genius as his score in this film sounds basically like a divine, godlike piece of music.Once Upon a Time in the West's cinematography is also incredibly beautiful. Sergio Leone uses his directing skills to perfectly make each scene beautiful, such as the scenes where they are building the railroad. You can see each worker perfectly flowing together, as if they were actual construction workers building an actual railroad in real life, and all of that is because of Sergio Leone's amazing talents as a director. The scene in which Jill rides to the Sweetwater is also an incredibly beautiful scene, as Sergio Leone uses widescreen shots so you can take in the atmosphere, very similarly to another masterpiece, The Searchers, which did indeed influence this film.Overall, Once Upon a Time in the West is an incredible stunning masterpiece. All the elements that make this film so amazing are perfect, making this film worthy of the title ""One of the Greatest Films of all time.""",Once Upon a Time in the West
423,baenos,Poor,4,22 December 2003,"Slight spoiler herein.I found this to be a very poor film.  It had plot developments that either didn't make sense or weren't explained (the widow sleeping with her husband's self-admitted murderer and enjoying it), the pacing was slow (to me this doesn't affect a good movie but makes a bad one worse), and the moods and atmospheres being set in many scenes seemed contrived rather than natural.  The story itself wasn't even very captivating either.  I've heard this described via hearsay as being the best Western ever made, and I don't understand that at all.",Once Upon a Time in the West

This movie has everything great ambient, scenes larger then life, hypnotic Morricone music and what is most important great acting. In this move Sergio Leone proved that he is one of the most unique directors in movie history. If you saw this movie you know that almost every scene is great piece of art in almost every scene you are amazed by visual style of Leone. In all other great movies (like: Godfather, Casablanca, Citizen Cane, Notorious,Big Sleep, The Third Man, etc.), you won't find these many great scenes like in this one. This is an ultimate Western and i want to say: Thank you Sergio Leone for your great vision and this masterpiece, after this one there is no need for any other western, in compare to this one John Fords westerns are movies for kids and women.",Once Upon a Time in the West
425,cybrsrch,Audio torture,2,5 February 2018,"Sergio Leone loves to keep the mood on edge by having repetitive annoying sounds, like the wind mill or insects overly loud. Not a real fan of this style, I know I am bucking the tide with all these glowing reviews, but the sound track is far to annoying to allow me to watch any longer, he would find a better use of his skills torturing audiophiles with chalk board scratching. As far as the best western ever, that I find laughable, another film firmly stuck in the time period it was filmed and it hasn't aged gracefully. This wreaks of spaghetti western, never an honest portrayal because the writing are always obtuse",Once Upon a Time in the West
426,Repoman-3,Leone's masterpiece,9,23 October 2003,"Many of the comments here draw comparisons with Leone's other westerns, namely the misnomered Dollars trilogy (the only common thread was Eastwood as lead). Once Upon A Time is actually a continuation of Leone's exploration of the American frontier. It's also his most hopeful film leaving the audience with the message that the time for gunslinging is over and where nation building must begin - Cardinale delivering water to the railway workers. The beauty of the film is in the conflicted way it tells us this; like Peckinpah's Wild Bunch, Frank and Harmonica know their time is up and there's a huge mutual respect between them in their final duel. I don't think I've ever seen a duel like it: absolutely supercharged with emotion. I do agree that the film could have used a cut here or there but I'm not sure where as there isn't a scene I can think of that doesn't push the story forward. I'd love to have seen Eastwood doing Harmonica but Bronson fills in well. As for Fonda, one of the best pieces of counter-casting I've seen. Pure cinema.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Plus, the story is so complex yet so interesting and fun, the villain is one of cinema's best. The motives of each character is clear, and while many may consider The Good, The Bad and The Ugly to be Leone's best film, I think that this is slightly above in quality due to the characters being motivated by not only external conflict, but also internal, personal conflict. I recommend that you watch this film and Sergio Leone's ""Dollars Trilogy"".",Once Upon a Time in the West
428,jsoc42,Possibly the most skillfully made western of all time,10,28 October 2002,"Sergio Leone shows again that he is at least as good as John Ford at making westerns.  This movie has a total of three real fight scenes, but the film is shot so splendidly that there is tension the entire time.  The fight scenes aren't even that long, but the anticipation of the fight is where the real feelings come from.  Also one of the best acted movie I have ever seen. Bronson, Ford, and Robards do some of the best work of their respective careers, Robards's undoubtedly best role of all time.  Ford may have done better work in other places, but if so, then not by much, and Bronson was simply magnificent.",Once Upon a Time in the West
429,cinema_forever19,My Dearest Beloved Film of them ALL!,10,19 July 2008,"I never in my life liked Westerns, in fact I almost despised the genre. But when I saw this movie for the first time, it was far different from any Western I have ever been familiar with. Although, I couldn't say that I had seen many Westerns before this one. But in fact, Once Upon a Time in the West is a lot more than just a Western. And in a way, I don't even call it a Western, it's a genre of it's own kind. But by now I've seen and respect more of the Western genre, from films like Sergio Leone's ""Dollars Trilogy: A Fistfull of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"", The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The Man Who Sho Liberty Valance and a couple others. But Once Upon a Time in the West still stands out as the most artistic one of them all, and my most personal favorite.I can't even begin to express how much I've come to ADORE this wonderful, beautiful and brilliant piece of film that I've come to know only as cinema ART. The perfect direction, the beautiful visuals, the haunting music, the genuine characters, the originality of the story and the history within it - it's not only a remarkable film, but it's a truly intimate and personal meditating experience. Once upon a time in the west - the more I watch it, the more I feel the power and history behind that phrase/title.Once Upon a Time in the West is a truly epic and iconic piece of cinema that should not ever be overlooked, and must be a little more recognized of it's brilliance by movie audiences and fanatics of all kinds. I'd like to even note that you can find this movie at a very low price for as low as $5.00 - $7.00! An incredibly low price for such an incredible movie, by all means give it a buy and hold it as one of your favorites as well!My Rating: 10/10",Once Upon a Time in the West
430,robelanator,Leone's best?,8,24 November 2003,"Though it may not be as fun and light hearted as The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, it is certainly much more artistic. Whether that's a good or a bad thing, I'm not sure. The shots and scenes sometimes seem to linger just a bit too long - the Jason Robard character's introductory scene, for example.Certainly the best things about the film are the soundtrack and the inevitable showdown at the end. Leone has few equals when it comes to the use of a soundtrack. Likewise, Ennio Morricone is one of the very few composers accomplished enough to have his own rabid fan following.Claudia Cardinale is simply breathtakingly beautiful. Henry Fonda is delightfully evil. At first I was disappointed that Eastwood wasn't in the lead role as with Leone's first three westerns, but Bronson's coldness fits the Harmonica's single-minded revenge oriented character far better than Eastwood's sly and ever-composed Man With No Name could.Personally, I think The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is a better movie, mostly because of the Tuco character adding some much needed levity to such an exhaustingly long film. Once Upon a Time in the West is certainly worth seeing, though, and is still far and away one of the best westerns ever.",Once Upon a Time in the West

I couldn't believe the aura and hype surrounding this movie after seeing it. I don't mind slow westerns that take time to develop characters. The proposition is one of my favorite movies. I get that it was made in the 60s, but the searchers was made in the 50s and is infinitely better. This was brutally slow, limited character development, and extremely predictable. I don't understand the high rating and cult following.",Once Upon a Time in the West
432,mungo39,Thirsty work,8,6 June 2005,"I guess this movie is probably thought of as Leone's masterpiece, delivering, as it does, a dose of the old west with immense style and self-assured presence. Much of the cinematic style used by Leone has entered the folklore of the west and is as much a part of that folklore as spitting, guns, dust and swinging saloon doors. I can't imagine a duel any other way than through Leone's eyes and I now expect a Western to always have a 'man with no name' character who says virtually nothing.This movie has it all...the waiting, the heat, the sweat, the dust and then the swift, deadly violence. The story is not bad either, pitting our hero and an outlaw against a murderous railway man who is seeking to get a recently widowed ex-whore out of her inheritance. But what it really has is great shots of the amazing scenery, and real, palpable tension. Leone described the film as having the rhythm of the last gasps of a dying man. It is very much like that, and this builds a very strong sense of foreboding. Everyone will not walk away intact, death is woven into the fabric of the movie. As we move from one convulsion to the next the tension is ratcheted up to extreme levels so that the eventual violence is almost a relief. The end result is an amazing movie that helped to create the legend of the old west, and that is now a part of the legend. It looks amazing, it's a rollicking good tale, and it'll leave you desperate for a beer!",Once Upon a Time in the West
433,AT-AT,Simply beautiful...,10,29 November 2006,"Following ""Fistful"" with the vastly more impressive ""For A Few Dollar's More"" and ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"" Leone thought he had left the Western behind and was planning on making the Gangster epic ""Once Upon A Time In America"". But to get the funding for ""America"" the studio's asked for another Western. Leone made ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and with that ended his 'spaghetti-cooking' career on the highest note possible. OUATITW is in my humble opinion one of the most impressive pieces of film-making ever! A meticulously crafted epic of how that west died. The story is simple. It's a brief glimpse of four obviously eventful lives, a more or less scrupulous railroad baron Mr Morton, his coldblooded henchman Frank, Cheyenne the outlaw and a mysterious gunman called 'Harmonica', as they all become intertwined with the beautiful Jill and the approaching railroad.Opening with one of the most famous sequences in cinema history as three killers wait at a dust blown railway station for a train to arrive, Leone's masterwork shows the viewer from the start that they are about to witness a very different type of film. This opening, with almost no dialogue, no music and exaggerated natural sounds (dripping water, a fly, a rusty windmill wheel), shows us the normality of these characters lives. Whereas the anonymous 'hired hands' in other Westerns are simply shapes to be shot at, here Leone gives them a brief shot of personality as they wait for their victim. It's symptomatic for this film, that when you try and tell the story, you automatically end up describing a scene. If Leone choreographed a fly or not, doesn't change the fact that every little detail in this scene well thought through, and used optimally. This sequence heralds the arrival of ""Harmonica"", and it's not the only outstanding introduction of a character. Frank is given a striking introduction as the camera moves around from the back of his head to a close up of his set, tanned face and steely blue eyes following his massacre of a whole family. Cheyenne arrives via a wonderful audio only gunfight outside of a lonesome, dust blown tavern that ends with him coming through the swinging doors, the light hitting his eyes as he glances up. Jill has a magnificently designed and filmed sequence that follows her from the train into the Station Masters Office where the camera stays outside and watches her through the window (as if it were a bystander following her with his eyes) and as she leaves through the front door it moves up the side of the building and over the roof to show the bustling, growing town beyond. All scored to one of Ennio Morricone's most powerful, moving and simply beautiful pieces of music.Leone uses the more typical Italian Western Spanish locations for most of the film, but for the first time he also uses the legendary 'Monument Valley' with it's awesome landscape of beautifully sculptured red sand stone mountains and rises. It's a landscape that came to represent the American Western due to its appearance in so many of John Ford's classic movies. Leone had dreamed of using this 'home of the Western' and in the brief scenes it appears (mostly Jill's coach ride to her Husband's homestead), due to the lush, wide screen Cinematography that Leone is such a master at using, it adds an authentic atmosphere that is obviously rare in the normal, entirely shot in Spain 'Spaghetti' Westerns. Leone is also a master of composition. Carefully, painstakingly filling the screen with perfectly arranged objects, places and people. The one-on-one finale between 'Harmonica' and Frank is a text book example of choreography, editing, lighting and character placement. As the two enemies move around each other Leone and Delli Colli carefully keep both in frame on the opposite sides of their vast canvas, editing in those trademark close-ups that actors love so much. Add the powerful music and you have one of the most gripping and emotive sequences ever committed to film and it's a sequence that can still raise a chill. Truly wonderful cinema.The beauty of this film is of course not everything. The characters are colourful and complex, and the acting is impeccable. This was Bronson's first real lead, and it was opposite a stellar cast, but he belongs there. Even though we only get a glimpse of their lives, there is no doubt all of the characters have experienced their fair share of adventures before we meet them. The genius part of this is the story is not ""going to end"". We only see the end. Jill is the only one that has a story to tell after the movie ends. She is the new age coming, and all the men becomes infatuated by her, and she changes something in them. Morton is not the industrialist he wants to be. He is a dreamer. A crippled dreamer who is, despite his money, dependent on a man like Frank, who is himself a part of a dying era.The final scene sums up very well what this movie was about. An end of an era. Not just Sergio Leone's western making period, but also the end of one world, as Frank and Cheyenne dies, but also the beginning of a new era as the train (the money, the civilization) rolls in on the newly laid tracks with more workers to keep the train going.",Once Upon a Time in the West

This is one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen, from the minute Fonda and posse arrive in town everything is shot with such style.This is more of a musical performance (without words) a masterclass in mixing score and substance. The scenes may sometimes seem overly wrong but its all part of this elaborate dance, the dance of magic of movement and stuning visuals.Dario Argento pretty much started his career here with Leone and its clear when ytou look at Plumage, Profondo Rosso and Suspiria where his vision comes from.

435,tnhelliott,Sweeping and epic.,9,9 March 2006,"A masterpiece of sound and vision. The use of shadow and music in this film to heighten emotion and character is sheer brilliance. The limited dialogue only adds to the tension of this picture. More is said with action and sound then with words. I still get goose-pimples during Chuck Bronson's first scene. The slow shots of peoples faces and their reactions to events is a nice touch. The genius of the writing is shown during the scene in the bar, where gunfighting is compared to music. Do not be mistaken, this movie is more than an ordinary western. This is movie is about the fundamental difference in good versus evil, in hate versus love, or survival versus revenge. There is more than meets the eye and this film shows that a western, or an action film, does not need to be gruesome and gory to be interesting and exciting. And it proves that an exciting film can pluck the heart-strings just as any story of star crossed lovers can. The Writing and directing and the music are all there, not too mention the action. Henry Fonda plays the darkest meanest character in his career and Charles Bronson, as his foil and opposite, is stunning to watch. It is my belief that Charles Bronson is a very underrated actor and Sergio Leone simply did not make enough Films. If you are a fan of the western and of movies that require an active part from their audience, check this one out...you won't be disappointed.",Once Upon a Time in the West
436,HotPot,Nicely shot (no pun intended) at times but surprisingly dull,3,8 May 2005,"Really not my kind of film. I thought my tastes were quite broad, but apparently not broad enough to encompass this one. The best writers and directors can make a point quickly and effectively without seeming to hurry. Sergio Leone, it seems, can't do that - at least, not in this movie. He takes his time over every scene, whether it has a point to make or not.It takes ages to get started (whatever happened to grabbing the attention of the audience to make them want to find out more?!) and ages for anything to actually happen once it has started. The word ""lean"" cannot be applied here; I suppose the best phrase I can offer is ""elegantly lumbering"".I saw the director's edition rather than the theatrical release, and as far as I could tell, the long scenes didn't achieve anything that ones half or even a tenth of the duration could have achieved (boredom aside).Yes, there were some ""pretty"" camera angles. Yes, there were one or two clever lines of dialogue. But the impression I came away with was, I'm sorry to say, that the director put his self-indulgence firmly above the audience's entertainment. The music was noticeably repetitive; the sound-effects intrusive beyond the point of distraction; and the dialogue invariably too quiet.I suppose I must be missing something given the absurdly high (IMHO) position of this film in the top 250. I really can't imagine what that might be!",Once Upon a Time in the West
437,noledge,The Forth Best Western Ever....,8,15 January 2001,".... Ranking only behind Leone's Dollars Trilogy. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' features a great cast, featuring Henry Fonda as the cold-blooded villain, Charles Bronson as the mysterious 'Harmonica' and Claudia Cardinale as the widowed Jill McBain. The direction is amazing, with Leone really taking the best bits from all westerns such as show downs, greed, and deep character development. Ennio Morricone's beautifull score is one of his best to date, even beating out his more famous 'The Good, the bad and the Ugly' theme. The film is long, but you hardly notice it, as Leone uses time and space brilliantly.All in all, this is the forth best western ever, I just prefer the Dollars trilogy to it. I have one critisism though... Leone originally wanted Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach to be killed off at the begining - (I suppose they would be the three gunmen waiting for Bronson's arrival off the train?). He wanted to pay respect to his earlier films and the three stars, but Eastwood wouldn't agree. To me, this would have been a brilliant opening sequence, but seeing the 'Invincible' Clint Eastwood die.......",Once Upon a Time in the West
438,SakowskyBrothers,Left in the dust,10,26 August 2007,"When it comes to spaghetti western movies three names come to mind Sergio Leone, Ennio Morricone and Clint Eastwood. Although this movie does not have Clint Eastwood, Henry Fondas performance well supplements the lack of the Eastwood. This movie and Buono, il brutto, il cattivo, Il (Good,bad and the ugly) are the top western movies of all time with no argument.The epic story telling grips the viewer from beginning to end with spectacular performances by Charles Brosnon, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale. The movie also presented Ennio Morricone greatest connection of track to scene. A memorable track to scene moment was the scene that launched of right as Charles Brosnon entered the scene for the final duel.The story is basically the dispute over some railroad track that connects several characters in the process of the feud. As long as it maybe the plot definitely doesn't evolve slow, it may seem that way for people who just can't stand to watch movies beyond the norm 120 mins. All the characters are given a heart in this film to some degree and have very distinguishable features.There are very little western movies that lock me to my seat but this was definitely one of them. From epic one liners like Henry Fondas ""How am I suppose to trust a man who can't even trust his pants."" said to a man who has both suspenders and a belt connected to his pants. To Charles Brosnon saying ""Can you play music with that too."" sliding the revolver down the bar towards Harmonica.The movie was one of the best western flicks of all time.

Everything is perfectly combined to make for an amazing film that you cannot take your eyes off, even through some of the slower moments early on. The acting was absolutely superb, the directing magnificent, the plot amazing. The best part of this film for me was the music though. Every second of music played is essential to the film as a whole and to the moment that it is being played at. The harmonica is sublime, every time I hear it a chill just runs through my spine waiting to see what is going to happen. As a youngster of 19 this film is quite a bit ahead of my time, but even someone who is watching it for the first time 30+ years after it was released can instantly see that this is one of the all time great films ever made. I cannot point to one second of the film where I think to myself that it is not essential to the film as a whole. Finding older movies to watch is not the easiest thing in the world, and some of the other great classics just don't fit my taste. For me though this is a new age film that is 30 years old. I cannot believe how anyone who grew up in the era of this can not put it near the top of their all time movie list.

Therefore, it is the best western ever made.",10,6 April 2003,"'I wouldn't say when you've seen one Western you've seen the lot; but when you've seen the lot you get the feeling you've seen one.' Katharine Whitehorn Sunday Best (1976) The traditional accusation is that Once upon a Time in the West offers nothing new to the genre but merely replays highlights from his previous classic Western movies. This is, however, a simple evaluation demonstrating a simple prejudice against the director or the genre. It is not a true evaluation of the film itself which is a stunning melodrama filmed in breathtaking manner, garnished with stars (including Claudia Cardinale, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards, Charles Bronson, Keenan Wynn and Western movie favourite Jack Elam) and, to top it all off perfectly, one of the greatest film scores ever written from Ennio Morricone. While it is astonishing in hindsight to note that this masterpiece from one of cinema's most talented directors was not even nominated for the Best Picture Oscar (the dreary and inexplicably popular musical [Oliver!] won), it borders on criminal that Morricone's incredible score was not nominated either (it was won by [The Lion in Winter]). As seems typical of masterpieces, they simply are not appreciated in their own time but masterpiece this is. Given that Leone also directed all three of the 'Dollars' trilogy ([A Fistful of Dollars], [For a Few Dollars More] and [The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]), it is truly remarkable that this movie proved to be even better. There are very few films that can claim to be the greatest Western of all time and this is one of the strongest contenders. I would probably shortlist [For a Few Dollars More], [The Good, the Bad and the Ugly], [High Noon], [The Magnificent Seven] and [The Shootist] in the search for the best Western of all time. Leone also directed the first two of that list and the star of this movie, Charles Bronson, also appeared in [The Magnificent Seven].

445,timeformime,THE most moving western ever,10,4 March 2008,"I have heard throughout the reviews of this movie on the web and on the extras of my $5 DVD from Walmart that Sergio Leone, the illustrious director of this and the Dollars Trilogy, was a die-hard perfectionist. He concentrated his efforts on the perfect picture to paint in the viewer's head every scene he shot, and you know what? It worked.As a result of Leone's close-up face shots (there are plenty), the tireless work put in to ensure the authenticity of every set, and the flawless acting from the entire cast (Bronson is particularly good here), this film brings together an ultimately simple story into a 3-hour masterpiece. I seriously can't think of a thing wrong with this movie, unless it's the fact that it's so good no western will ever compare to it.Ennio Morricone's score brings everything together beautifully as each piece is always appropriate for its scene. The music is one of the integral parts of the movie, and as a result watching it is an experience best had when you have plenty of time with no distractions whatsoever, and not much on your mind.

446,rwelsh_legal,Once Upon A Time........,10,17 January 2007,"It seems that today there are two kinds of films being made. Those that have huge budgets, big names, release dates that are planned to exploit box office, awards and expected weekend earnings. Then there are those that are made for a ""certain audience"". These films wear their pretensions on there sleeves and in doing so attempt to be branded as something ""daring"" or ""special"" simply because they don't have ""studio"" support. I don't mean to imply that some of these films (large or small budgets) don't have merit and are not good or even great films, as there are many that most certainly are. 30 years ago, Paramount wanted to capitalize on the ""Dollars"" being generated by the Leone/Eastwood/Morricone trilogy. With a blank check and Henry Fonda, Sergio Leone succeeded in making a western that would fail to ignite at America's box office, garner mostly negative reviews and end up being hacked up by its parent, Paramount. What Leone and Parmount could not have known at the time was that Leone's 3 hour homage to cinema would take its place in the company of films like Welles's ""Touch of Evil"", Laughton's ""Night of the Hunter"", Capra's ""It's a wonderful Life"" and Scott's ""BladeRunner"", etc. These films and others were rejected, disowned, chopped and forgotten. They would join that small group of masterpieces from all mediums of artistic expression with the magic to transcend time and find faithful and loving audiences decade after decade. Today, Leones beautiful and sad meditation on the end of an America that never was, takes its place in the pantheon of greatest films ever made. See the accolades on the ""IMDB"" top 250 films, reviews from critics coast to coast on ""Rotten Tomatoes"", film makers from Tarantino to Scorsese and most of all, those of us who have seen and been touched by this great film through the years since its creation. Today we have a beautiful representation of a great directors gift to the myth that was America. Now more than ever we need films like Once Upon A Time In The West to remind us that the nobility of the myth that gave birth to our America is worth cherishing if only through the lens and music of these pioneers of postmodern cinema. It seems that Paramount has at last done right by Leone and in a sense so has Hollywood in finally paying its respects to Ennio Morricone, Leone's cinematic soul mate and the greatest living composer we have.

Personally, I have two: Michael Lehmann's darkest of dark comedies ""Heathers"", and what may be the greatest of Sergio Leone's three masterpieces, ""Once Upon A Time in the West"".One fine Saturday afternoon in 1997, I was eagerly anticipating a family road trip, and being the first ready, switched on the television to kill some time. The station that came up was a classic movie station on cable, and ""OUATITW"" was the film that was showing, about two minutes into that beautifully staged opening credit sequence. Like so many others before me, I'm sure, I watched spellbound as the action unfolded, and being the student of film I am, made sure to take in the director credit. I watched, hypnotized and perplexed, wondering where all this was heading. I was 17 years old at the time and was used to the current film-making style of not wasting a second, and this apparent time wasting had me intrigued.And then, as the train pulled away and I heard for the first time the chilling harmonica salvo so synonymous with the film, I immediately understood. Revenge. And the simple, reply from Bronson after being told that his three seedy chaperone's didn't bring a horse for him: ""You brought two too many"", I was thinking the dude was some western superman.And then he got shot! Brilliant. Maybe this hero isn't as invincible as he thinks he is. I ran from the room and grabbed my precious Leonard Maltin Film and Video Guide and looked up the film. I was hooked.I didn't see all the film that day, but next time it was shown I taped myself a copy and have seen it may times since. It remains a film as great for it's parts as for it's whole. Charles Bronson's strong silent routine, Hank Fonda's cold villain, gradually killing his way toward a profound catharsis, Jason Robards' lovable rogue, a part he played to perfection, and the impossibly beautiful Claudia Cardinale, holding the piece together as a great female lead, although her role diminishes as the film rolls on.And then there are the set-pieces. Of course, the opening credit sequence, an extremely tense scene in a bizarre roadhouse, Robards' exciting rescue of Bronson from a train, and the final Bronson/Fonda shootout, so protracted it puts The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly to shame.Before I saw this film, I had absolutely DESPISED westerns. ""Old man movies"" I called them. After seeing it, I began actively researching them, trying to watch only the best, the most classic, and the most influential. Of all the westerns I have now seen, only Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch, and Leone's own The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly come close to this remarkable masterpiece.",Once Upon a Time in the West
448,rossrjensen,Quite the achievement in cinema,10,16 December 2003,"I watched this movie on DVD after overwhelming recommendations by people on this site and because I have always had a fondness for Sergio Leone.  Once Upon a Time in the West is a terrific film.  In fact, I would go as far as saying it is one of the greatest of all time.  Each frame seems to have a beautiful feel to it.  Leone said he lost 5 years of his life on every film he created and it is apparent as to why with the attention paid to every scene.  I love Once Upon a Time in America and the Dollar trilogy, but this is, in my opinion, Leone's greatest work.  I would recommend that any fan of the genre, especially the Dollar trilogy, to check this film out.  I found it to be much more moving.  I loved the showdown in For a Few Dollars More, but I think the final gunfight between Harmonica and Frank is the best in any film of this kind.  Fonda is a terrific villain, with his bright blue eyes and cold stare.  Eastwood is the man and will never be topped when it comes to an unafraid, fast-drawing western hero, but I think Bronson was well cast instead of him in this film.It takes the greatest aspects of the Dollar films and creates one film that almost brings me to tears, not because it emotionally moves me, but because its craftsmanship is so splendid.",Once Upon a Time in the West

But if I did, I'm sure this would be one of the top ones.It is slow and intense, the story is thrilling, and you capture the whole feeling of the old American ways.Think younger generations, can't appreciate the movie on a higher level, like the people that were alive when it came out.I'm sure this was what people wanted back then, and the movie delivered.Just like there is a ""superhero"" era right now, westerns were just as hyped in their own day.This is actually a decent movie, even if you are not fan of the genre.8 out of 10",Once Upon a Time in the West

It is a movie about the West. I mean, hello, what was there, in the West? There was the railroad. There was the railroad connecting the East and the West. The Atlantic and the Pacific. On its way, the railroad met characters, various people, and it did not stop. It had a life of its own. Never mind the people, the railroad went westwards (and back). Now, on its way, various dramas were happening. People were dying, people were living. People were killing, people were surviving. The movie catches it all. The railway is unstoppable. And on its way, it met Charles Bronson, and Henry Fonda (their characters, I mean). They were not the main actors in this railroad trip, but they left their mark on it. And the railway went on.",Once Upon a Time in the West
451,SeaHorseMafia,The greatest western ever!,10,27 February 2013,"Sergio Leone is one of my favorite directors ever, his style, his pacing and use of music is perfect. I also think he was a great story-teller, not using much dialog, but still creating a wonderful atmosphere and conflicts. And Once Upon A Time In The West shows all that talent. It's my favorite western of all time (I also consider it the best) and my favorite Leone film, and it's one of my top 5 favorite films. Or maybe it's tied with the Dollar's Trilogy and Once Upon A Time in America, but I notice myself coming back to this film the most. While I think this is a superior movie to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (often regarded as his best), I think that has one thing better. Clint Eastwood, he is a better actor than Charles Bronson. While Bronson gives a pretty good performance, he's essentially playing the Man With No Name, Eastwood does do it better. Rest of the performances are excellent. From Woody Strode's cameo to Henry Fonda's evil antagonist, all are great. Jason Robards is probably the best one, as Cheynne. He's fun, smart and a bit of a badass. But Fonda gives a great performance as well, he plays the villain. Which is bizarre seeing Fonda killing a whole family and being so goddamn evil, but it works. He as cast as him, because of his reputation of being the good guy. Also Claudia Cardinale is very beautiful and is pretty good, though cliché...But we all know the performances don't make a Leone film. What makes it is the direction, cinematography and music. All are absolutely masterful. Let's start with the direction.. Like most of Leone's film, this is a slow moving film. So if you don't like westerns in general, I wouldn't recommend this. You will be probably bored, or maybe you will like the style. And me saying this is a slow movie is not an insult. It's a fact. The slow pace gives it's mood and atmosphere is has. The tension is high and the gun fights are more exciting. BTW, there are not that much gun play going on. If you want gun crazy violence in west, watch Django (1966) or The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. This is more intelligent than those movie though. It focuses on a period in the west, when the railroads came, capitalism came as well. The end of the bandits and beginning a new evil. The films main theme is death, actually Leone said that the pace of the film supposed to be like the last moments before you die. Like most of Italian westerns, this movie is operatic, but Leone preferred to say ""ballet of violence"". Everything is huge and dramatical, it makes it an very epic movie. This was also about you knowledge of previous westerns. Leone makes a lot of references/homages to old westerns. It even has Leone trademark, typical western characters, almost showing them as mythical creatures. The first 10 minutes are incredible, direction-wise. It's 10 minutes of no dialog, no music, just atmosphere and expecting something. That's one thing people miss about Leone, he knew when to inform the audience and when keep a secret. In the first 10 minutes you don't know what or who are they waiting for and why are they there. And that gunfight is excellent BTW. My favorite moment is the Saltwater massacre. No I'm not a sadist, but how that scene is handled is beyond perfect. There is weird tension in that moments, then when the gun men start killing the family, the music doesn't start, you don't even see who is doing it and where. When the kid runs outside, with that tracking camera shot, the music comes, fast and epic. That moment always gives me goosebumps. It's just so well shot and directed. The cinematography is as excellent as everything else in this. Mixing close-ups and John Ford like wide-shots together, creating a almost surreal, yet beautiful feel. You can see that Leone was influenced by Ford, when Jill goes through the Valley, it's just like a John Ford film.I love the film, one of my favorite. Shame it wasn't liked too much when it was released, it truly is a masterpiece. If you love westerns, you are probably going to love this. 10/10",Once Upon a Time in the West
452,verovalera1976,One of the greatest western spaghettis of all,10,30 December 2016,"When I first saw this movie, not even at the start, only the McBain sequence, I thought that it would be really violent so I turned off the TV. I then watched it on its entire length a while ago and let me tell you that finally found the story very good. A bit long but I didn't care.The story of a man, called Harmonica because he always wears that instrument around the neck, who arrives in the town of Flagstone looking for a man named Frank. During this time, not far from there, a family is savagely assassinated as they were preparing for the arrival of Jill, the future wife of the patriarch. When she arrives at the station, nobody comes to take her to the McBain house. While en route, she meets Cheyenne, an outlaw.Frank, who works for Morton, a crippled railroad tycoon, tries to eliminate everything that is on the path of the future train. But Harmonica will have to confront him in a duel to refresh Frank's memory.Great performance for great actors like Bronson, Cardinale and especially Fonda, who plays for the first time of his long and successful career as the villain Frank.",Once Upon a Time in the West

If you have never seen this film, or have been put off by its extraordinary length, don't be, watch it and understand why it provokes such a reaction. The bottom line? If you like westerns, then watch this, afterwards try and convince me that it isn't the best of all time, bar none.Don't get me wrong, I am from an age where we saw nothing BUT westerns, we played westerns, TV was full of western series, so I have seen them all. Yes, there are many other fabulous 10 out of 10 westerns, but, even acknowledged classics like High Noon, The Wild Bunch, even Sergios other two (!) do not quite reach the level that Once Upon a Time in the West has.Knee jerk reaction perhaps, but any time someone asks me my thoughts on what the greatest film of all time (let alone westerns), I blurt out Once Upon a Time....Fonda, Robards, Cardinale, Strode, Elam, and above all, Bronson, who would have belived that such a mix of stars would result in the absolute perfection you see in this film.And the music, a tune for each character, what a superbly simple and effective idea.Wonderful, it blew me away when it came out (I sat through it twice on the trot - you could do that then!)

Watching it, it's almost amazing how perfectly everything comes together. The four main characters each have their own theme music, all of which are haunting tunes that stay in your mind after the movie. All of the performances are excellent- Claudia Cardinale as a world-weary former prostitute, Jason Robards as a romantic ""half-breed"" bandit, Charles Bronson as a quiet, vengeful vigilante, and Henry Fonda as a sadistic hit man. Each of them are more then they seem, and whether they ultimately prove to be good or bad, they affect everything around them.

459,stenlis,Enjoy the essence of a western,9,1 August 2003,"Would you like some western?Well, let's take some wild west small town sceneries, a bad guy with his gang, a greedy businessman looking only for his own goals, a defenceless beauty, an unnamed invincible hero with mysterious past and a tough but good-hearted rogue buddy. Mix it with a revenge motive, add a dramatic stand-off in the end and that should do it.I almost heard you saying ""What a crap!"". There were times when I thought the same about westerns full of cliches and a thin plot. But it has all changed when I saw Once Upon a Time In the Wild West. Sergio Leone appereantly decided to put all western cliches into one movie in such a way that it makes sense. And it makes more than that. This movie leaves one hell of an impression!Leone doesn't narrate. He exerts a slow pace motion picture and lets you think about all the implications and explanations of what is being showed. From every single motive and scene he makes a special encounter for the viewer. Instead of words he lets the actor's faces and the musical score to tell the story. He gives additional dimensions to the characters - suddenly you feel sorry for the businessman, respect to the bad guy and understanding for the beauty. You catch yourself looking two minutes into a man's face without being bored or annoyed. And you don't want this movie to end.
It's not just a boring art film for weirdos. In fact, I know a lot of guys who like only action packed block-busters and still were amazed by this movie. It's the essence of it - somehow all the things needed for a good film crossed in one point. Everything fitts in its place. The music by Morricone has already become legendary and the few harmonica tones have become an expression so often cited in other movies. Henry Fonda looks like he should have only played bad guys from the beginning of his career, Bronson is simple and accurate as the revenge itself and Claudia Cardinale shows how a struggle-to-survive look like with a sense of virtuosity.Leone shows respect to the viewer - he doesn't think the viewer is dumb. He lets the story to unravel in an intricate, almost a detective-story like way. He will let you wonder what drives the characters to their actions and he explains some events only after a considerable time in a stylish Leone(TM)way. I firstly saw this movie as a child and I didn't understand everything that happened there but still I was thrilled and charmed. I always get annoyed by the exaggerated pause when the moderator says ""And the academy award goes to..."" But here Leone lets you enjoy the thrill. The final stand-off scene lasts 8 minutes - it merely consists of two man watching each other, impressive music and a final shot. And it tastes like enjoying a glass of good wine for a wonderfully extended moment instead of dipping it in all at once. Like, in fact, all the rest of this movie.
Go see it - no matter if you have seen it before or not.",Once Upon a Time in the West
460,arhiippa,West at it's best,9,14 October 2003,"One of the best westerns ever made in my opinion. The slow tempo might be offputting to some, but I myself enjoyed it. Sergio Leone's use of rhytm is unique and works so well with Morricone's soundtrack, that the result is close to perfect.However westerns as a genre are not the most fulfilling of movies for me. Still, my hat off to Sergio Leone. The only name that I can associate with such quality in this genre is, not surprisingly, Clint Eastwood. That is not to say there are no other great westerns, but for some reason my favourites all feature either or the other in some capacity.However much I might admire the work of Eastwood, I'm no less impressed by the lead performances in this movie.

In the beginning, you are not able to understand why each character is motivated to do what they do. Mysteries are revealed throughout the piece, when four main characters are completely developed in a very simple screenplay. Frank is a murder of an entire family, Cheyenne is a gangster with a conscience (chasing Frank by what he had done), Jill is the widow which survived since she was in New Orleans, and Harmonica is a mysterious outsider in town with incredible shooting abilities and guess what!

However, it is soon revealed that the true killer is the sadistic hit-man Frank (Henry Fonda - 12 Angry Men, On Golden Pond),working for Mr. Morton of the Railroad company, who wants the land Jill's husband owns, and plans to have Frank kill Jill as well. However, she falls into the help of two outlaws, Chyenne - who is in love with Jill - and Harmoncia (Charles Bronson, The Great Escape), who has a mysterious history, and an obsession with Frank.This film is my favourite Westerns in the world. While I don't agree that it is the best (that title belongs to The Searchers, a film that has influenced so much cinema that without it, no Lawrence of Arabia, Taxi Driver, or indeed Once Upon a Time in the West), it is certainly the 2nd best, if just for the shear homage it pays to the genre. Made by Sergio Leone right after the masterful Dollars Trilogy, he instead set out to make a more thoughtful, mature and intelligent Western, and while the result may be less entertaining than The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, the film is his best, and really shows him at the height of his film-making abilities.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Why, oh why, wasn't Frank played by Lee Van Cleef?But casting of the other lead roles played by Robards, classic stage actor, and Bronson, the ultimate screen heavy, was perfect. As for Cardinale, well, could Loren or Taylor have done it better, perhaps? I'll give Claudia nine out of ten for this one. She was good and above all she was gorgeous.But ultimately the film belongs to Bronson with Robards hard on his heels.The enigmatic character of Harmonica, who slides in and out of shots like a ghost (which perhaps he was), entrances the audience. Never more so than when he makes the hero's one allowed mistake and is taken prisoner on the train. Here he becomes our guide while Robards shoots up Frank's henchmen in stylistic and semi-amusing fashion.The showdown is actually not as good as the one in The Good the Bad and the Ugly, but that is only one scene. Even so the sheer horror of Harmonica's reason for revenge is unsurpassed.If Frank had been the defendant in Twelve Angry Men, I don't think Mr Fonda would have voted ""not guilty"".Eleven out of ten for this masterpiece.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Henry Fonda's character has a menacing and jarring score which chills and thrills me every time I hear it (I bought the soundtrack too!). Fonda as Frank is the ""coldest villain in screen history"" as I have read in other reviews and was cast against type in this film. When the camera pans up into his passionless blue eyes early in the movie, one sees what a brilliant piece of casting it was to have him as the villain.

So thick they look like brushes. I do like makeup on actresses. I always complain about most ""realistic,"" washed-out faces in today's films. But the MU in this film is so 60s it's ridiculous. Sure, some women wore MU in those days (mainly prostitutes). But it consisted of white powder, black-rimmed eyes (they used charcoal bits), and crimson lips. It might not be a terribly important point, but it's SO obvious.IAC, this film is unbearable.

The European audience, however, was enthralled and charmed by this unique artistic work. In German, Leone's Italo-Western has a much more appropriate title which would translate as ""Play me the tune of death"". Indeed, the storyline is quite capturing: A lonesome harmonica player (Charles Bronson) ends up in a final showdown with his arch-enemy Frank, who shot down a woman's (Claudia Cardinale) family to make profit in the Mid-West. The spectator is thrilled right from the first moment - not only by the powerful dialogs and gunfights, but by the poetic scenery and imagery. One has to admit that the movie would only have turned out half as good without Ennio Morricone's beautiful music which imparts a somehow romantic and epic touch. Along with that, Claudia Cardinale plays the amazing part of an unbreakable, totally intrepid widow. Leone's directing style consists of ellipses which he applied perfectly to enhance suspense and to allow silent dialog and emotion through eye contact. It is a style that is very characteristic of that era and evokes feelings of nostalgia for all fans of neo-realist Italian cinema.",Once Upon a Time in the West
475,bxuzabc,A taste of classic hollywood,9,30 July 2021,"This movie is an absolute masterpiece. The director Sergio Leone does a brilliant job with this film, its a shame he didn't receive the recognition for his works until after he died. This film has absolutely stunning visuals that could be a high class painting. The soundtrack fits so brilliantly with the movie and its near perfect pacing. The dedication by actors Harry Fonda frank and Charles Bronson as well as everyone else in the film is absolute brilliant. The facial expressions, tones of voice and sheer movements are on point, its hard to find anything wrong with this stunning work of cinematic art.",Once Upon a Time in the West
476,malisp,A western for everyone,10,25 March 2005,"There is no shortage of reviews here proclaiming Once Upon a Time in the West as the greatest western ever. They may very well be right. The beauty of this film is its almost universal appeal. The cinematography and musical score alone would allow this film to stand even without a plot. But there are enough reviews here that read like film class dissertations, let me just hit on a few of my favorite aspects of the movie and offer a general recommendation.As I mentioned before, the visual aspect of this film is so rich that it risks overpowering the film's other aspects. If you've seen other Leone films (then I can't imagine you not having seen this one), then you will recognize many of his characteristic camera angles and close-up shots. The two most striking examples of this for me was the revelation of Fonda's character (Frank) and the close-up zoom on Harmonica's (Bronson) eyes before the final showdown. Sure it sounds like stock Leone camera work, but I think that in this movie he incorporates set and scenery much more fluidly and completely with his camera tricks than compared with the Dollars trilogy. And while writing about the opening scene seems like a spoiler to me, let me just say that if you have any patience at all, you will be rewarded well to sit through it quietly with the sound set at the loudest bearable level.I've mentioned Leone's Dollars trilogy multiple times already. For those who don't know, it consists of his first three (and genre-creating) Spaghetti Westerns: ""Fistful of Dollars"", ""For a Few Dollars More"", and ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"". My recommendation is to watch these movies, if you haven't already, before seeing Once Upon a Time in the West. This isn't necessary of course, the movie easily stands on its own. But the Dolars movies seem to build off the previous ones in a way that enhances each sequential viewing. The first three movies will condition you towards Leone's film making and style, which, while totally groundbreaking and rewarding, may be a bit of an overload to the uninitiated trying to sit down and view all 2hrs 45mins of Once Upon a Time. Viewing the other movies first will also allow you to appreciate what this film is not: another Dollars movie. Oh, and speaking of running time, I don't know if it's even possible to find the studio-butchered original American release running, but do yourself a favor and make sure you rent or buy the full-length, letterboxed DVD with 5.1 Dolby Surround.",Once Upon a Time in the West
477,Sebastia-2,My story,9,18 March 1999,"OK, this is the best western ever made, we all agree. Let me tell you my personal story: I heard the music as a little child, my parents had bought the LP. I loved the mysterious music and was struck by the cover (showing a still of the hanging-scene) as I didn't understand what was going on there. Many years later I happened to see the film, recognized the music, and loved it at first sight! I've seen it four times now and each time I'm impressed by seeing the final duel..., in my opinion the best minutes of film ever shot. Maybe seeing isn't the right word. The music lets you experience the duel. (this can't be called a shoot-out!)",Once Upon a Time in the West
478,tomgoodman1,Extraordinarily overrated,2,1 November 2002,"Sergio Leone understood mannerism better than any director who ever lived and employed it to extraordinary effect in his spaghetti westerns.  In addition, his superb use of sound, detail and the closeup were rarely equaled in the history of the cinema. That said, his Once Upon a Time in The West is by and large a dismal, overblown failure of equally titanic proportions.  The acting is self-conscious not mannered, the details other than the opening sequence at the train station (brilliant in absolutely every regard, he should have quit when Charles Bronson says, ""You've brought two too many."")are largely uninspired and the music is nothing short of grating.  Both of Leone's Once Upon a Time films (in America and in the West) were creative and box office failures as he bit off far more than he could chew.",Once Upon a Time in the West

You won't like it.Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the greatest westerns because instead of showing us unrealistic hero-type characters (um, Clint Eastwood, anyone?) it gives us regular people living their lives in realistic situations.This film proves Roger Ebert's saying ""no good film is too long"" -- yes, it unfolds at a snails pace, but, like Leone's wonderful shot of Monument Valley, you have to pull back and look at the big picture. If you're expecting a Jerry Bruckheimer ""film"", this movie will drive you nuts. But if you like good long movies, you can't do better than this. After 165 minutes, I could go back to the beginning and watch it all over again. How many movies can you say that about?",Once Upon a Time in the West

I loved the story, the acting, the music. If you love A Fistfull of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More, and The Good The Bad and The Ugly, you will love this. I liked it better than those 3, but I won't argue with anyone if they liked any of those better, they are all good too. You can tell that Leone had a way larger budget for this movie, and it helps to bring the entire atmosphere to life. Charles Bronson's character is superb. Jason Robards character was funny/badass(My favorite character, and Henry Fonda...wow. Fonda was awesome! If you like movies that aren't all flash and dazzle actions like Face/Off or the Bad Boys series (This is no knock on those movies cause I like those too) then you will like this movie. Leone shows how he is one of the best directors in history with this movie. It is definitely worth picking up to own; I found it at a local store for 12 dollars. One of the best buys I ever made. See this movie!!",Once Upon a Time in the West
481,four_star_diva,Worthy of Fellini,10,24 August 2002,"There is so much about this film that is great, one hardly knows where to begin.  Fonda's performance as perhaps the vilest villain to grace the screen went far beyond Oscar caliber, Claudia Cardinale removed forever the stigma of being known as a B Italian actress with the remainder of the cast comprised of no less than the finest character actors of the time.
Leone in a grand style put forth a nitty gritty daily existence giving a sense of how the real West must truly have been.  Yet throughout maintained a mythical quality so necessary to the telling of these stories.  For the opening and settling of the West is the stuff of legend.
That it was an instant classic is not the case, as it was not lauded in the United States at first, although Europeans loved it.  It was considered too long and probably too wordy for the average American moviegoer.  However, there were many, myself included, who knew upon leaving the theater that they had seen a masterpiece.Dario Argnto's script was unexpected and quite simply remarkable.  And what could we say about this film if Ennio Marricone's exquisite score was not mentioned - music so haunting it brings you to tears when heard.",Once Upon a Time in the West
482,jamesbutterford,Don't be discouraged if it didn't click with you the first time!,10,28 February 2010,"Here is a movie that you will hear people call ""The Spaghetti Western to end all Spaghetti Westerns"" or even ""The Movie to end all Movies."" Much to my surprise, the latter claim isn't even all that ridiculous.Here's how I know it's a great movie that I will never tire of: I didn't like it the first time I saw it. I didn't dislike it either, but I felt confused and underwhelmed. I wasn't expecting what the director had served me, and it took me out of my comfort zone. Where's the dialogue? What's going on with this plot? What's with the anti-climactic ending? But coming to appreciate a movie after initially disliking it is often indicative of a great movie -- one that doesn't rely on plot twists or cheap tricks to entertain.It was a similar feeling to when I watched Pulp Fiction for the first time, which instantly became my favourite movie upon a second viewing. But for me, this movie was even harder to follow the first time. I was so disappointed when the movie ended because I had so many unanswered questions regarding plot, character relationships, etc. I then read a detailed summary that cleared things up and watched the film again a few days later, and it blew me away. When you can watch it without trying to figure out what is going on, it is one of the best film experiences out there. Now, just because I found it hard to follow the first time doesn't mean it's a confusing movie; everything is, in fact, explained and makes sense once you get it (unlike so many movies that try to be too complex for their own good). In some ways, the movie is so good that it distracts from itself; I found myself so caught up in the music and astounding visuals at times that I would not pay attention to the sparse but clever dialogue.I'm glad I bought this without having seen it, because I felt compelled to give it a second chance after the unsatisfying first viewing. All I can do is urge you: watch it, and watch it again. You will be rewarded with something unlike any other movie.",Once Upon a Time in the West

484,mibyph,Visual Poetry,9,5 July 2018,"There is so much to like here. I must admit there are also flaws. The spare dialogue is sometimes apt but also on occasion obvious or crude. Because there is so little, with ambient noise and music soundtrack so beautiful that the contrast is jarring.
Several of the character actors, besides those in the opening sequence, are so little used that many of their scenes must have bee cut due to the length of the film. 
The sound was all recorded independently of the filming, standard procedure in many Italian films. Claudia Cardinale's voice was dubbed which is such a shame since for an actor, their voice is an important part of their craft. View ""The Professionals"" from about the same period to hear her real voice. 
Henry Fonda is indeed a real villain here but was nearly as bad in ""Firecreek"" made around the same time. The opening sequence was either inspired by or inspired that of ""The Train Robbers"".
My main enjoyment of this film is purely visual. Near the end there is a telephoto shot of the train arriving at Sweetwater with all the railroad workers gathering, to the music of Morricone. This is truly an emotional moment as are many others.

485,Dreammamachineprod,You're Kidding me right?,4,18 March 2013,"I rarely leave reviews and I certainly don't like leaving negative ones, but I can't believe that there is anyone who thinks that this is a great move, non-the-less a great one. And yet, this film (if you want to call it that) is on the top 250. You're kidding me right? If you think that a movie is great just because of cinematography and production design then maybe you will like this movie, because both of these are excellent. But if you want to actually be involved in the story, then this is a dreadful film. You don't know who characters are or what they want until you reach a running time when most films are over, and if you can get involved with them or the story, (because you can't have a story with out any characters) then how is this engaging? The pacing is bad. The cartoon characters, pregnant pauses and most goofy music are laughable. I actually normally love Ennio Morricone in some of his later work and is actually one of my favorite composers, so the decisions come down to Leone to use comical music as well as heartfelt music during a rape scene! (Which isn't meant to be ironic, or if it is, it doesn't work) Nothing in this movie makes the remotest bit of sense, and is really just an exercise in creating a reality that never existed. People have gotten colder not warmer than in history because they have been desensitized, and this concept that everyone in the west was in a free-for-all of unbridled violence is just rubbish.Ultimately, I think that some people watch movies and others get involved in the movie. And this movie clearly caters to the former, because there is nothing here to get involved in. Leone has done some decent work in his other fable ONCE UPON A TIME IN America which is a great film in terms of characters, but ultimately disappointing in terms of story. So to me, the problem here is that Leone is a better directer than writer and you can't fake writing.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Three hours of epicosity later, I'm not impressed.The only reason you could give this a rating higher than a six or seven, in my opinion, would be based on its historical significance.

You, however, will.I'm not trying to contradict all the people that say this is the first time X or Y was done, I'm just saying that whatever fancy cool amazingly before-their-time techniques were employed, they weren't done in a way that made the film enjoyable. So, by all means, as part of a class, and with the historical context firmly in your grasp so you can stay awake looking for the right stuff, watch it.

So little conversation, and so much information, emotion and action at the same time, also thanks to the marvelous soundtrack.

491,mike-970,The best Western Ever,10,7 October 1999,"""Once Upon A Time In The West"" towers above all other westerns and stands as Sergio Leone's ultimate masterpiece, which is weighty considering the canon of his work. Though I'm partial to Rutger Hauer in ""Bladerunner"" I give complete respect to Henry Fonda as the greatest villian in the movies for his portrayal of Frank. Villianny is easy, but this sort of cold, ruthless, calculating character is a once in a career opportunity. Take particular note of his entrance the first time he appears. Some of you may notice a similarity to this scene in 1977 by George Lucas when we are first introduced to Darth Vader. Whether it was intentional or not, you should be reminded of it. One of the truly brilliant aspects of this film is the interaction between the characters. No one completely trusts anyone. This is particularly strong is the relationship of Cheyanne (Jason Robards) and Harmonica (Charles Bronson). The first time they meet is tense, almost frightening. The greatest contribution this film made to the movies is the score by Ennio Morricone. It is his best, and unquestionably one fo the best scores ever. You will see how music adds to the action, how symbolic it can be. Without spoiling the movie you'll find out the the harmonica music we hear throughout the film is a lot more important than just setting the mood. The heading sums up all I have to say about it: ""Once Upon a Time In the West"" is the best western ever and one of my top ten favorite films of all time.",Once Upon a Time in the West

At the time, I could have described it as some of the coolest movie gunfight scenes separated by long stretches of ... nothing! I recently had the chance to see director's cut of Once upon a time in the West, and how different it seemed through the eyes of an adult. I was struck by how this was truly a movie about the most powerful and primal emotions: hate, lust, greed and revenge - mostly revenge. It' s the more like a Greek tragedy. Watching the movie, I felt that whatever the reasons why Leone had chosen a western genre (aesthetic, practical who knows?), the story was so universal it could have taken place anytime or anywhere. We feel we are in a universe much closer to Kurosawa's than John Wayne's. The violence in Once upon a time caused a sensation when the movie was first released. At the time, it was denounced as gratuitous, yet on viewing, one becomes aware of how fundamental it is to the movie. Sergio Leone displayed the themes with a brutality and raw energy which was only emerging in the movie mainstream (think Easy Rider, etc).

Every scene, every word, every musical note is magnificent.  For scale and pure cinema it is on par with Lawrence of Arabia, another of my ""10s"".

I personally think it's pretty darned close if they're not actually equal. Everything is here, the tension, the soundtrack, the epic story and the contrasting characters, and what separates this brilliant western from good and average ones, as Sergio Leone knows, is the mystical element that tends to make its self known quite often. In my personal opinion, a great western ( and I am a huge fan of the perticular jenre ) is not just about robbing trains, or cowboys versus indians, you have to feel a world is about to die, and watching this movie I have felt just that. Of course, much of the credit must also go to the cast, and I think everyone was at their best in the roles they were given.

Sergio Leone seized the traditional western and, helped by his scriptwriter Dario Argento, the future reference of giallo and baroque slaughter on large screens, enriched it with emphatic approach and humorous disenchantment. In fact, he builds a myth with modest elements - an organ mouth, a blue-eyed glance, long coats - and introduces lyricism and immoderation, to sublimate the manners of this specific spectacle. The daring of realization - inverted or encircling shot - and artistic choice (Henry Fonda becomes a tough guy) express an authentic will to break the common rules, in order to confer sensible density on his characters and an aesthetic energy on his scenery. Paradoxically, this glittering vision of Redemption, which was hesitating between homage and parody, belongs now to the classics.

498,daniken,No western has ever come close to this one....and no western ever will.,10,23 June 2002,"I can't quite find the words to even come close to describing the pure brilliance of this movie. When this movie was made, the western genre was dominated by the big hollywood studios. The western was taken by these studios and transformed into an opportunity to portray classic superheroes like John Wayne and Burt Lancaster in their fight against all sorts of smalltime crooks and outlaws in smalltime stories and smalltime towns. It was a genuine effort to portray 'Americanism', the American Way, along with a romanticised view of the west as 'Frontier country' where good always triumphed over bad and where the life was hard but honest. It was the American Way.And then came this film. The title, 'Once Upon A Time In The West' must have seemed to mean nothing more than 'just another western' to the unexpecting viewers at the time. Oh boy were they wrong. With this movie, Sergio Leone singlehandedly redefined the western genre and no American western would ever match the brilliant spirit in which it was made. While the story is basically the same as in any other western, it is the WAY in which it is presented that so clearly distances this western from others. Whereas other westerns are simply stories that are designed to entertain, this movie is an emotional masterpiece that will move your heart. Sergio Leone takes the ordinary western and replaces words with looks, and conversations with feelings and emotions. With his brutal but honest portrayal of the sheer hardness of life and death in those times he thoroughly destroys the old romantic idea of the west as a 'generally-hunky-dory-kind-of-scene with the occasional bad guy and indian' and replaces it with an eerie, dark, hot and dry place where life is cheap and only the strongest will survive.I cannot adequately convey in words the way in which Sergio Leone deepens and defines the characters by pure means of visual persuasion. It starts with the three gunman in the beginning of the movie, waiting for some reason at a train station for someone or something that obviously is going to be on the next train. No explanation, no conversation; not a word is said. Even the stationmaster is ushered into captivity without a single audible threat. Then comes the waiting... Any other director would have skipped directly to the moment of arrival, but Sergio Leone takes minutes of boredom and translates it into a visual feast, deepening the characters that are portrayed and making them more human, more real to the viewer, while at the same time encompassing us with a deep dark sense of foreboding. This way in which the story is not just augmented but in times completely replaced by the sheer visual drama, is perfected by the absolute fantastic music, directed by Ennio Morricone. Who needs words and explanations when the combined forces of cinematic mastery and heart-tearing music are not just able to carry the story, but pick it up and push it up to such heights of excellence that it has no equal in it's genre?Another great feat that adds to the power of this movie is the minimalistic way of portrayal of the characters as real, emotional people. Not a single word is said that isn't required for the understanding of the story, yet the characters feel more true than those in movies where whole conversations are added merely to explain their motives. Instead of words, the camera focuses on the characters...so that you can simply read the emotion off their faces. Often no explanation is given other than than a mere facial expression. No superheroes or supercriminals, just real, desire-laden, traumatised, obsessed people that act upon motives inherently understood by the viewer.All in all this is without a single doubt in my mind the greatest western of all times, and even though Sergio Leone has made many more mindblowing, heart-shattering westerns like this one, like 'A Fistful of Dynamite', 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly', and 'For a Few Dollars More', none could equal 'Once Upon A Time In The West' in sheer magnitude of perfection. Western has never been the same since....I only wish I'd have been there in 1969 when the movie was new and see it, for the first time with fresh innocent eyes and an unexpecting mind..just like 2001: A Space Odyssey (also of 1969, a year of legends).A tip for those who have never seen this movie: Bribe, beg, borrow, or steal yourself into possession of a Videobeam and Hifi-audio equipment if you can't find a cinema that is showing this movie. Turn the audio up WAY HIGH (never mind the neighbors) and prepare never to be the same again.........I (obviously) gave this movie a 10 because no matter how hard I try I can't find anything less than perfect about it.",Once Upon a Time in the West

502,john_m_05,Sergio Leone. Change The Face Of Westerns & Cinema Forever.,9,14 March 2009,"Sergio Leone's Masterpiece Once Upon A Time In The West Like in most of Sergio Leone's films, sound and music play a major roll, the noise of the harmonica, symbolising the last gasping breathe of the characters. The long lasting silences broken by the click of a barrel and the shot of a gun.Franks gang enter with a bloody slaughter, and a riveting cold stare from Henry Fonda's deep blue eyes striking uncertainty, menace and evil into the hearts of the audience. This brutal scene puts the story into play. Harmonica also has many incredible and unforgettable lines which is the icing on the cake for me, that and his cool calculated actions on his road to revenge.The amazing cinematography of John Fords iconic scenery is spectacular at least. The old and the new clashing as one period of America ends and the next rises up out of the old, is brilliantly executed by Leone within the town and the railroad.From start to finish I was on the edge of my seat, everything about this film merging together to create a very atmospheric and gripping film. in the words of Leone ""The Rhythm of the film was intended to create the sensation of the gasps that a person takes just before dying. From start to finish, A dance of death.

Each of which represent the quintessential Western, albeit from a slightly different perspectives.Awesome talent, Claudia works the same magic on C'era una volta il West that Ursula Andress does for Dr. No. The cameo with Woody Strode and Jack Elam is sheer genius.Jason, Charles and Henry couldn't have done a better job. While Sergio Leone mentored Clint in his early Westerns (big screen days), he wisely didn't cast him this time (Clint was doing Hang 'em High at the same time).This movie, like those it's tied with, stands the test of time supremely well. It's a shame that the Western has had its run, given how much enjoyment most of us got out of them, but then I can't imagine too many actors and directors who could pull it off these days anyway.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Well, I can count them on one hand- and this one has style to burn. The acting and the photography were sublime. And the faces!  What glorious faces!  I so enjoyed this cast. Henry Fonda was just delicious in an atypical role.  Claudia Cardinale was at her most beautiful. Jason Robards and Charles Bronson were just wonderful- and I am not a Bronson fan, by any means.  I've heard that the opening sequence of this film is ""too long"" with ""nothing going on.""  Nonsense- it sets up the entire film.  And who can forget the sweeping score- one of my favorites.

508,ragarf,"Best ""Western"" ever filmed",10,2 May 2004,I have always enjoyed this movie from the first time that I saw it back in 1969. You can almost feel the dust fly and the long close-up shots of the actors' faces tell what they are thinking (kind of a throw-back to the silent era). This is possibly the first western to show the wild west of the 19th century as a dirty and dusty place. The musical score is also tops! The opening 10 minutes or so of almost no dialogue and the creaking of the windmill at the train station set the stage for the rest of the movie. It's a great opening scene. Good triumphs over the evil Henry Fonda (one of the few movies in which he plays the bad guy and he did a great job.,Once Upon a Time in the West
509,Hdny42,Quite frankly the greatest movie ever made,10,14 October 2006,"Sergio Leone may have wanted to go ahead with the great Once Upon a Time in America after he'd finished his Dollars trilogy (which included the FANTASTIC The Good, the Bad and the Ugly), but the studios wouldn't let him go on without doing another western. The result is the magnum opus of Leone's career (though many others may debate if that title should go to Once Upon a Time in America, or TGTBATU), and it is not to be missed for any reason. The movie is worth seeing alone for the performance of Henry Fonda as the merciless villain Frank. Pile on top of that the great Jason Robards, a marvellous Claudia Cardinale, and a solid Charles Bronson, and this just can't be missed.Today so many people seem skeptical of older westerns, but that skepticism is unfounded and could keep them from so many gems, especially this one. I would recommend that this not be the FIRST Western, or first Sergio Leone film that one views. Leone's style and pacing take a film or two to get used to, but to know the style is to love it. It is very dramatic, and while the unexperienced may read that as ""Slow"" they would be making a GRAVE error to do such a thing.From the camera work, to the acting, to the BEAUTIFUL score from Ennio Morricone, this is a legendary film that will leave you with a new standard as the best.

510,amathubagoldhq,Shakespearean Poetry in the Wild West,10,3 January 2013,"In true poetic form Sergio Leone combines all the basic characteristics of classical theater into the dusty, sandy desert of the Wild West. We have tragedy, romance, revenge, comedy and mankind's eternal fight between good and evil. The good guys, despite their suffering always win and the bad guys always get punished or gunned down in bloody gun battle! While sweat runs down each opponent's brow and eyes are twitching; coarse fingers reach for loaded pistols in the sweltering desert sun. Leone has chosen the perfect bad guy in Henry Fonda as he plays the uncouth villain who has lost his soul and staggers through life leaving pain wherever he leaves. Charles Bronson on the other hand the good guy, with a heart of stone, never flinching always standing up against the evil which he has been chasing since his childhood. Protecting all those in his path including the beautiful Claudia Cardinale Bronson plays a superb role, right until the final climatic challenge between him and Fonda. The background music keeps you on the edge of your seat feeling each emotion with each actor; the acting is superb from both villain and hero and the emotions of each and every scene is portrait by Leone to perfection, the scenery and the cinematography are captivating from the drop of sweat which falls into the desert sand to horses chasing into the sunset. This film is the birth place of all modern Westerns.",Once Upon a Time in the West
511,aidancoyl,Not my favourite Leone film,6,28 September 2020,"I can see why people love Once Upon a Time in the West. It has all Leone's hallmarks. It looks fantastic. The cinematogrophy is stunning and you get a real feel for the vastness and wildness of the landscape. The wide shots also contrast so well with the intense close-ups. The soundtrack from the late Ennio Morricone is predictably great. It's not as outlandish as some of his others but runs beautifully throughout the film. The cast are all good. Henry Fonda plays a great, dead-eyed villian. I also really liked Jason Robards as the colourful ""Cheyenne"".However, that's where it stopped for me. The first hour/hour and a half is painstakingly slow. I understand the attempt to create mood and atmosphere but I just found it a slog. When the story does get going it's fine but still lacks the verve of some of Leone's other pictures.Once Upon a Time in the West wasn't really for me. It has a great rating here and I know it's on loads of best film lists so maybe I'm just missing something but I don't think I'll sit through it all again to find out what that is.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Comments like ""bad acting"" and ""bad direction"". Honestly these people don't know what they're talking about. This film is a film about death. Death isn't always a clean one shot in the head or billion dollar special effects extravaganza. Sometimes it is small, sometimes not always instant. The film is slowly dying as are the main characters and it is beautiful to behold. It does move slowly. It need do nothing else, that is its style and it would work no other way. The film works on many levels philosophical and political. I think the people who didn't like this film suffer from extreme cases of desensitisation and lack of empathy. The direction is flawless, i find myself every time i watch it, in awe of the beauty of the landscapes the discomfort of the extreme close-up. All the acting is excellent. For all those people who complained about the acting in this film I say this. Acting is living truthfully under imaginary circumstances. That is how one should judge acting. All actors portrayed perfectly the emotional journey all were one. Bronson, saying little thought-out the film, but in his eyes we see his pain and his cold calculated plan of assassination. This film could not be overrated. The only argument with this film is which is better: this, or the good, the bad, and the ugly. Personally I think this is the better. Both are incredible, hands down. But for me, the title sequence and Henry Fonda's performance tip the scales in once upon a time's favour. Watch this film and be blown away. Oh one last thing, a reviewer said that the western is an American style of movie. Well, I'm not a big fan of the john Wayne stuff personally. But fair enough, he and john ford have made their mark, but the dollars trilogy and this have made at least an equal contribution to the western AND to film.",Once Upon a Time in the West

The actors cast for each role are absolutely stellar and really pull you into the wild west. The cinematography is also outstanding. Closeups of faces coupled with dramatic lighting and atmosphere make every scene a treat. The action sequences are intense and the story is very well written. That being said I do not believe it ranks more than an eight. As a disclaimer, I am not a western aficionado so this might be par for the course. I found many sequences of the film boring. The opening scene is 10 minutes long and nothing is really happening, just a creaky old windmill. I understand that sequences like this build atmosphere, but this movie could have been 15-30 minutes shorter. Also some entire sequences were not shown which would have reduced a lot of confusion later in the storyline. A few really small things stood out to me also. Like Cheyenne cuts his face shaving and then minutes later there is no cut. Sometimes the audio is out of sync ( I was watching the 2011 remastered version ) when people are talking.Overall the positives really outweighed the negatives.

The pacing is deliberate, and for me, adds to the overall effect. Operatic? Yes, as in the ""grande gesture"". Operatic, as was Stravinsky's ""Oedipus Rex"", and just as timeless. Morricone's theme for Harmonica is based on Mozart's ""Don Giovanni"", and this plays out much like that tragedy. Things are set in motion, before the film starts, that can only reach one end - death, for most of the characters. Delli Colli's lensing is so beautiful, like paintings from a master. The final showdown between Frank and Harmonica is only rivaled by Leone's other showdowns for it's ballet like quality: truly breath taking.All in all, probably the finest ""western"" ever made. 10/10. if i could award it more, i certainly would.",Once Upon a Time in the West
519,axelhansson-84896,The work of a maestro,10,6 August 2019,"After completing the ""Dollars"" trilogy, Sergio Leone was initially reluctant to direct another western. But when Paramount tabled an offer he couldn't refuse, he went on to make this poetic, utterly compelling tale that still stands out as one of the most elaborate movies the genre has derived. Themes of greed, vengeance and haunted pasts all intertwine to form a grand and poignant homage to the whole western genre.
While the ""Dollars"" trilogy and most prominently ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" remain the quintessential western movies, OUATITW takes the genre one step further, into a less exploited territory. Whereas Leone's previous work has more of an adventurous feeling to it, OUATITW is pervaded by a more dooming atmosphere. Unlike most other Westerns it doesn't have the typical hero, but relies more on a sentimental basis, personified by the tormented Harmonica. Overall this movie is less extravagant than the ""Dollars"" films, and more subtle and subdued, which in the end results in a more mature and realistic approach to the genre. Equipping the characters with different backgrounds also benefits the story's depth and intricacy.
The cast I superb, led by a chilling Henry Fonda. Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale also provide memorable performances, as well as Charles Bronson as the vindictive, harmonica-playing stranger whose incentive is a mystery to everyone but himself. Everything about the movie, how the shots are executed, how the sets are devised, how light affects the scenes: everything is done with the outmost meticulosity.
One of the film's most salient features is it's astonishing direction. Leone employs the same camera techniques as in his earlier films, only even more extensively. The shots are even longer, the close-ups even more extreme. Simultaneously he refrains from any attempt of moving forward too promptly. On the contrary, he uses the slow build-up to create tension that surges the viewer into the happenings. This is particularly notable in the opening scene of the movie. We see three men coming into view at a railway station, and apart from the squeaking cry from a windmill it is completely silent. For minutes nothing of importance happens, and without any music and without any dialogue the tension increases as it becomes evident that the men are waiting for something. Without any words being uttered we know something is about to happen. After minutes of shots between the three men and the station, the viewer is completely absorbed into the movie. This type of storytelling is a rare, if not nonexistent instance in movies of today.
The final essential piece of the movie is the music. Composer Ennio Morricone, the man behind the famous ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" soundtrack, produces yet again a haunting, perfectly adequate score. Probably it was his ability to compose iconic western music that mad Leone use him over and over again. Morricone utilizes different soundtracks depending on which character currently occupies the center of the stage. Bronson's eerie, desolate cry of a harmonica greatly reflects his lonely and reserved personality, while Robards' more upbeat, clever tune perfectly suits the coarse and cunning gunslinger.
After watching this you can do nothing but conclude that this is one big, immaculate masterpiece. If you haven't watched it, watch it. It is definitely worth the time.",Once Upon a Time in the West
520,mpcurtis-72830,Did we see the same film?,2,29 March 2021,"I've had a CD of Ennio Morricone's music for the last 30 years and love listening to it.

Long, long closeups of the stars saying nothing. It actually looks like a silent with some hasty dialog thrown in. The screenplay must run to all of three pages.

There is another reference to a musical theme from one of the dollar trilogy. Can't place which one right now. It's the famous one. Also when ""Harmonica"" plays the ""bad notes"", I'm sure it's not from the harmonica. Sounds much more like the strings of the piano played directly - like a ""prepared"" piano. Might even be a zither. Many use of the major seventh chord which seems to be out of favour for last 30 years. Rarely heard in pop tunes today. Still a beautiful chord.

That was my first encountered with whom his now one of my favorite actors. At the time OUATITW was released, many people disliked it only because Fonda was so brutal (according to his biography ""My Life""). That contrasted with most of the roles he had previously. I think that with OUATITW one can appreciate the extent of his talent.The rest of the cast is also very good and the choice of Bronson over Eastwood is all right for this movie. I can't imagine Eastwood in the role of an old victim of Frank.Just about everything is good in that movie: the western countryside and ambiance, the acting, the close-ups, the humor and of course, Morricone's music.

525,gjc123,The ultimate Western - Once Upon a Time in the West (1968),10,10 May 2001,"The movie opens.  Three men are waiting at a deserted train stop appropriately located in the desert. They're hot, they're nasty, they're restless and bored.  There's minimal action on the screen: one rocks a chair; another hunts a fly.  For 15 minutes this continues:  the tumbleweed rolls and they wait;  the credits roll and you wait.  Trying to imagine what will eventually happen, you look into the eyes on their hardened faces, trying to find some sign of a soul.  Frustrated, you too become restless with anticipation, their anticipation.Suddenly, in the distance, you hear a train.  As it stops, you examine the screen for the reason they're waiting.  Are you looking for something good or something bad?  You don't know.  Then the train starts to move. Silently you yell at the train ""Wait, I haven't found it yet!As the train exits stage right and out of view, you see a man on the other side of the tracks.  He speaks to the three men:""Did you bring a horse for me?""""Err... looks like we're shy of one horse..."" comes the reply.Not at all surprised by the response, this kind and gentle man teaches the three some simple addition.  ""No. You brought two too many!""Sounds like something Mr. Eastwood might say, doesn't it?  (""Get three coffins ready."")  It should since this film is directed by Sergio Leone, the man who gave us Clint in  ""A Fistful of Dollars"", ""For a Few Dollars More"", and ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" - the biggest hit film in the trilogy.
With such an impressive portfolio, why did ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" fail to attract the attention it deserved when it hit theaters?   Can the studio be blamed for mutilating the masterpiece?  (It is a masterpiece, but how good was it before it was hacked?)  Did audiences pass like Clint passing up the lead?  (What about the drawing power of the stars?)  Was America too full of spaghetti already?  Who knows?  Who cares?
Sergio Leone created some of the most memorable westerns ever to hit the screen.  He sparred us the whiskey drinkin', Injun killin', white-is-right sanitized version of the Duke's west (sans ""The Shootist"") and gave us the stubble and squint of Clint.  Did he spend all his creativity on the opening scene?  Had he taken the genre as far as it could go?No way!  Think about his casting decisions, the haunting, soulful notes of the harmonica, the dialogue:* Henry Fonda playing the evil villain:  ""People scare easier when they're dyin'.""* Jason Robards playing the good villian:  ""You remind me of my mother. She was the biggest whore in Alameda.""* Charles Bronson as ""The Man"": ""I saw three of these dusters today. Inside the dusters there were three men. Inside the men there were three bullets.""Let's face it, you either like this stuff or you don't.  If you like it, you won't find anything better.

526,flozone,The Western to end all Westerns,10,9 September 2006,"I first saw this movie when I was about 12, my father had it on video. I watched it a few times right away and it immediately became my favorite movie. The first time the amazing atmosphere from the cinematography and music by Morecone which give this dark western story a great home. Every time I watched it after that more of the depth of the characters and story became clear, as it masterfully unfolds bit by bit through every scene. As you switch from character to character their motivation and connection to the plot is revealed more by expressions than action or words and only in the very end it all falls into place.This was made to be the Western to end all Westerns, Leone did not want to make another western but was strongly urged after the success of his earlier budget trilogy and promised a budget much bigger than those combined. In the end he agreed and made every detail in the picture to signal towards the end of Westerns and the wild west. Every ""cowboy"" character in the picture dies eventually. Leone even wanted to have the stars from his previous 3 movies to be included as the gang who gets shot in the very first scene, but unfortunately this wasn't possible. The whole story is themed around the disappearing of the ""Wild west"" symbolized by the laying out of train track and the growing influence of big business vs. small gangs.I don't like westerns in general but this is still one of my favorite movies of all time. It won't be for everyone as it is slow-paced and atmospheric and you will probably need to watch it a couple of times to understand everything, but if you watch the beginning and it grips you then you know you are in for a real cinematic treat. For those who like Radiohead it will also be obvious how Thom York was inspired by the music from Morecone and the guitar will sound especially familiar.

532,TCManiacs,Once Upon a Time in The West: Love Poem to the American Western,10,31 December 2010,"Once Upon a Time in The West is my all time favorite film as well as my favorite movie score. Bernardo Bertolucci, the co-writer of Once Upon a Time in The West, later directs The Last Emperor, which is my second all time favorite film as well as my second favorite movie score. Beware this is not your usual western. It is epic poetry. It is opera. It is a perfectly crafted art film that expresses Sergio Leone's true love for the great American Westerns. Leone doesn't necessarily romanticize the American West, he romanticizes American Western films. He makes references to High Noon, 3:10 to Yuma, The Comancheros, Shane, The Searchers, My Darling Clementine and many other great American Westerns very much the way Quentin Tarrantino has made films that pay homage to the gangster film genre. BTW Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds pays tribute to this film with an opening sequence entitled Once Upon a Time in Nazi-Occupied France.Although most of the film was shot in Spain & Italy like most spaghetti westerns, Leone traveled to John Ford's Monument Valley to capture the authentic Western United States panorama. Like Nicholas Ray's Johnny Guitar, it has a poetic quality that uses strong symbolism; but instead of symbolic words and lyrical phrases in the dialog, Leone relies on the alliteration of sights and sounds to formulate poetic stanzas out of every scene. The length of the film is a result of Leone's choice to direct in a sometimes painstakingly slow pace that builds up incredible tension before key action scenes. He allows us time to imbibe the majestic landscapes, and appreciate the details of the authentic sets and costume design documenting this pivotal period in American history. Instead of cluttering the beauty of his carefully photographed frames with dialog, close shots of these actor's iconic faces express all that needs to be said.Ennio Morricone, also my favorite movie composer, scored five distinct musical themes that embody each of the main characters: widowed new bride Jill (Claudia Cardinale), mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards), hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) and railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti). Instead of a musical prelude, the movie opens with a symphony of natural sounds using a screeching windmill, a buzzing fly, dropping water and a ticking telegraph. Meticulous sound editors maintain continuity throughout this mostly visual narrative, composing a perfect harmony between each of the main character's musical motifs along side the multitude of natural sounds mostly inspired by the two major symbols, the railroad and the water. An impressive lengthy tracking shot introduces the ""anti-heroine"" Jill as well as the beginnings of a bustling railroad town. Don't miss the first few minutes of this movie. Without music nor dialog, Leone creates one of the most suspenseful thrilling first few minutes of a movie whilst still rolling the opening credits. For all 168 minutes I was captivated by each and every frame! Once Upon a Time in the West is the finest example of Sergio Leone's creativity and perfectionism as a director, but most of all it is his greatest testament of love for the American Western.",Once Upon a Time in the West
533,mean_drunk,"""looks like we're shy one horse"" ....",10,16 December 2006,"This is Leones best movie.The man with no name trilogy was great,and good,bad and ugly a deserved classic,but this is a masterpiece and ACCURATE depiction of the old west. Ten years before ""Heaven's Gate"" explored the ""death list"" and big business as a willing participant in murder,Leone exposed it and gave it a crippled railroad baron and a murderous hired gun in Frank.One of the most accurate depictions of an old west tavern/watering hole/rest stop shows what it really was like as the west was settled. The soundtrack ranks among the very best,if not the best in film history,and the cinematography is beautiful.Anyone who doesn't appreciate this movie needs to examine truthfully why.Is it because they disagree with the violence?Hate a good original score by a brilliant composer? None of the 4 leads out acts any of the others...so it wouldn't have been a good Clint vehicle,IMO.At the end of Unforgiven,Clint dedicates the film to Don (the Dirty Harry director) and Sergio,who apparently taught him everything he needed to know to be the primo film-maker he has become.",Once Upon a Time in the West

There are very few filmmakers that can create a moving painting, a film that feels like you are reading a good novel, a film you can literally smell! This film will take you into the dreams of Leone, and while you're watching it, you wont bother pinching yourself to wake up because the dream is so damn cool. I think people who don't understand this film want more pop art, that's the reason they keep bringing up Leone's earlier works, but this film is all about mood.

There are even leitmotifs in the score,as well; music that is associated with each of the main characters: Jill, Harmonica, Cheyenne, and Frank. The scope and breadth of this film is undeniable. The pace is slow and deliberate, building the tension through close-ups of faces through which the story is communicated without the use of words. But, Leone can pull back into wide-shots of panoramas and vistas of great beauty. Sound is extremely important in creating and conveying the tension as well: the sudden silence of crickets, the monotony of a turning windmill, the crash of waves of an imagined ocean. And, lastly, the film is about America: its violence, its expansion, its robustness, its desire for a better future.

536,sim_zeppelin,The King of Westerns !,8,7 March 2007,"Many people have written about this movie over the years, therefore this is just another positive comment about probably the closest to perfect movie you will ever see.My collection of Western movies is endless, from Alan Ladd to the master of the cowboy Clint Eastwood. But this movie leads the pack just ahead of the Good the Bad and the Ugly.The story is simple and complicated at the same time.. if that makes sense. It is constructed in such a way that you become deeply entrenched into each characters persona, and the story as it unfolds slowly. Sergio Leone is the master of turning a standard scene into a small story in its self. He describes a character not with words but with actions. The scene with Snaky (Jack Elam)and the fly is classical Leone as are many other scenes with no dialog...brilliant! Dialogue is not plentiful but it is perfect. Its Quality rather than Quantity in this movie!The settings around the movie capitulate the whole story and is probably the closest you would get to reality in the West.If you want to watch a classic film that you will never forget, then Once Upon a Time in the West is it.You really cannot call yourself a fan of the Western if you do not love and appreciate this movie!",Once Upon a Time in the West

I don't need to look at a tumbleweed for 2 minutes or a ""bad guy's"" face for that long either without dialog to add anything. I felt like yelling at the TV something like ""GET ON WITH IT""! I find that a good rule of thumb for movie watching is the ""20 minute Rule"". If after 20 minutes the movie doesn't do anything for you there's a very good chance it won't after 2 hours. Sort of like going on a blind date, you sorta know after the first 5 minutes if it's a bust or not, then the best thing to do is to be polite until you can gracefully exit. Good luck to anyone else watching it, maybe it gets better after the first hour but I didn't want to risk wasting any more of my life watching paint dry.",Once Upon a Time in the West
538,southernmissfan,A Western Masterpiece,10,10 April 2005,"In 1964, a small time director named Sergio Leone, unknown in America, directed A Fistful of Dollars and would subsequently change the way the world looked at 'westerns' forever. Up until this time, westerns consisted of the perfect hero, who was invincible and always did the right thing; a knight who traded in his shining armor for cowboy boots. It was the duty of this morally outstanding superman to take on the despicable villain, complete with a black hat, save the girl, and ride off into the sunset. Then came Leone, who gave us stories and characters that were not black and white, good and evil, but rather a grey reality. Leone's protagonist, the so-called 'man with no name' (as played by Clint Eastwood), did not always do the right thing. He was not the noble sheriff or marshal, but instead a mysterious stranger looking for a buck. In fact, in the third film The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, there is only a thin line separating the 'good' from the 'bad' and 'ugly'. Leone's revolutionary westerns did not stop there. His cinematography would become his calling card- beautiful panoramic shots of big country combined with extreme close-ups, what has been described as using the faces of the characters as second landscapes. Throughout his career, Sergio Leone would work with one of the greatest composers of the 20th century, Ennio Morricone. Morricone's use of harmonicas, chimes, and amplified guitars (just to name a few) along with natural sounds, such as the creaks of a windmill, would become a trademark of not just Leone, but the entire Italian 'spaghetti' western sub-genre. It is in 1968 that Leone would direct a new project, leaving the ""man with no name' series behind. This new project, Once Upon a Time in the West, would combine the traditional western with the groundbreaking work in his previous three films to create an epic masterpiece, true cinematic art.Story Once Upon a Time in the West tells the story of five characters, all intertwined by property just made valuable by the railroad. A mysterious drifter called Harmonica (Bronson) comes to the town of Flagstone, but this time not for the allure of money. Harmonica is after revenge, and a central element of the film is Harmonica's past. In one of the boldest, most brilliant casting moves ever, Henry Fonda plays Frank, an emotionless killer working for the crippled railroad baron Morton (Ferzetti). Frank and Morton plan to take the newly valuable McBain property, and blame it on the notorious criminal Cheyenne (Robards). But the true star is Claudia Cardinale, playing Jill McBain, the beautiful prostitute who marries Brett McBain, owner of the property. The casting works perfectly. Bronson gives a distinct feel to the 'drifter' character. Ferzetti has this aristocratic look to him, perfect for the power player Morton. Robards is both rugged and comedic, the type of guy who can crack a joke one minute and wipeout a gang of lawmen the next. Cardinale is beyond gorgeous. And then we have Henry Fonda, who destroyed his beloved, wholesome image and portrayed one of the top villains in movie history.Cinematography In OUATITW, we see the evolution of Leone. The cinematography is perfect. This truly is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, ranking right up there with 2001: A Space Odyssey. Wide shots of the beautiful, open country side lends to the epic, opera-like feel. To portray emotion, Leone used close-ups of the actors' faces rather than dialogue. His style takes the old saying 'a picture is worth a 1000 words' and uses it in the most brilliant way. Often times we need only to see the expression on the character's face to understand the situation, not forced dialogue. Once Upon is a masterpiece of pacing. The film progresses slowly, but in a dramatic, epic way. The opening scene is an example of his genius. We are introduced to three gunfighters waiting at the train station, with only noises in the background, such as the creaking of a windmill. The three men are silently waiting for the looming confrontation with whatever or whoever is on the next train. The camera zooms in on the men's faces, and WAM, the train comes in with a deafening screech. One could never guess that a 12-minute opening, with almost no dialogue, could be so powerful and tension building.Sound You cannot discuss a Leone film without discussing the sound. Ennio Morricone composed all of the film's music before a single scene was shot. The actors act to the music, scenes are shot to the music. Unlike the Eastwood trilogy where there would many pieces and themes, there are only a few themes for the central characters and they are used repeatedly. Bronson's harmonica theme is haunting; Fonda's theme featuring amplified guitar is the definition of amazing; Robard's humorous banjo theme is a refreshing break between the intensity; and Cardinale's romantic theme is just as beautiful as she is. Morricone's music definitely surpasses the previous trilogy in its ability to set the mood, and become like an additional character, an additional setting. The use of natural sound is superb, from the flight of birds to the trotting of horses.Overall The camera work is perfect, the music and sound is incredible, the acting is excellent, and the pacing is genius. As you can so obviously tell, this is one those classics that you will never forget in your lifetime. The opening scene, Frank's introduction, the image of a blurry Frank walking behind a desert background, the showdown, all are imbedded into my brain. There are movies, meant to make money and entertain, and then there are films, art. Once Upon A Time in the West is art in its purest form.",Once Upon a Time in the West
539,Chinese_Paradox,"Groundbreaking, riveting, exquisite.",8,18 April 2005,"This is Leone at his best, absolute genius. I don't even know how to begin to describe it. In the beginning, it is all just sounds. There's nary a single word of dialogue. Three figures, their identity unknown, walk into the foreground. They wait for a train. One tries to rub off an annoying fly on his face. Another has a problem with water droplets on his head and catches them with his hat. At last the train comes and no one gets off. The three men turn to leave, but at the last moment, the notes on a harmonica start to play. A man appears from behind the train. 'Did you bring a horse for me?' 'Looks like we're shy one horse.' 'You brought two too many.' Seconds later, all three of the killers are down, and the man (being dubbed Harmonica) is shot in the shoulder.Thus, Once Upon a Time in the West begins. The acting is absolutely marvelous. Claudia Cardinale is absolutely perfect as Jill. Her eyes show all the emotion, making her face the story of the shot. Charles Bronson plays the silent and mysterious character. He is a reincarnation of the Man With No Name and is perfect for the part. Silent and distant. Who could ever forget Jason Robards? He plays Cheyenne with an amazing silliness that it just seems natural for him. Of course, they're Henry Fonda as Frank. He plays the coolest villain, so seemingly natural that he seems almost good. He plays it with smoothness to the role, like a prince. Thus, the four roles become the great centerpiece of the story.The plot itself is complex, taking time to build up. There are many minute sub-plots that all tie into the motives of the characters, specifically Harmonica's past, that along with smooth editing, keep you guessing until the end. The focal point in the story concerns the woman called Jill, and her attempts to try and keep living after the massacre of her husband and his entire family. The man behind the massacre, Frank, learns all too well that there is a surviving member of the McBain's, and attempts to go after Jill. Cheyenne is the outlaw wrongfully accused of the murders of the McBain's, but tries as best he can to protect Jill. And of course, Harmonica is the loner, the Man with No Name, out to destroy the evil of Frank.The direction is perfect, as are the cinematography and editing. However, a great triumph here is Morricone's score. Fantastic. Each individual character is assigned his or her own theme that, as the relations grow between characters, interplays and combines to form truly fantastic cues. Just listen to the music at the final showdown, or the part when Jill first arrives at the station. It is truly beautiful. This whole movie is truly beautiful.",Once Upon a Time in the West
540,Risasi,"Excellent, but for one detail",9,18 March 2006,"Excellent plot, the story line moves quite well for a longer movie. It seems anything beyond 2 hours now just drag out far too long. (Anything by Peter Jackson comes to mind) And the acting is superb, especially Hank's acting. There are very few who would have played his part better, especially at the time this movie was made. And quite frankly none of them immediately come to mind. And as the storyline progresses Fonda's portrayal of the desperation in his character is flawless. Almost as if he were the personification of the devil himself, and he knows his time is short. Another note on Fonda, his other main movie that year I believe was ""Yours, Mine and Ours"" with Lucille Ball. He played two very distinct characters in these movies. It just goes to show the quality of his acting ability.As for the other characters they revealed depth. Save for Bronson's character. Which is how he should be. Because of his experiences he is left changed. As if he is no longer human, nobody can appeal to him any longer. Except for justice and cynicism. He becomes almost as if he were a law of nature rather than a person. Morricone's music score was again ingenious. But this is one item that absolutely drives me insane. In the latest release on DVD it seems that they actually increased the music score volume to the point where it detracts from the movie. And it seems there are a few songs that are overplayed. I believe this detracts from the overall experience. I found I would constantly be adjusting the volume up and down depending upon whether or not we are listening to dialog or music. It seems like if they had first introduced the music loud, then let it fade into the background as the movie progresses it would have been perfect. I know I would buy a new copy if someone would smack the sound editor around and re-release this DVD.",Once Upon a Time in the West
541,CihanY,"A Good Story, Well Written and Directed",8,20 October 2016,"What I did not like about this film is the ""Harmonica"" character. His way of acting is not realistic and usually repulsive. The scenes he is playing the harmonica have no point at all probably because: Charles Bronson's poor acting or the unrealistic sound coming from the instrument. I do not enjoy watching characters seem to be knowing everything and omnipotent or too heroic, in other words. Sergio Leone is well at reflecting the atmosphere of times and and locations of his films to audience. He does it by making us hear the sounds nearby and by slow- motion filming for minutes and minutes mostly in the beginning of the films. Remember the 10 minutes telephone ring at the beginning of the 'Once Upon a Time in America' and now the the sound of winds, signboards and the fly. I enjoy it. I like the story of a family founding a new town and a station at all. 'Cheyenne', Jason Robards is the most colorful character traveling on the thin line of goodness and evilness. Mrs. McBain by Claudia Cardinale is also well played and making us wonder and think what a lonely woman can do after losing his future family. Is she that lonely to sleep with her family's murderer? I did not know Henry Fonda up to this film but I understand that Leone has made a big surprise to the fans by making Fonda a bad character for the first time he appears on the films.

So often older films seem to receive a ratings cushion based on when they were made. Some films are ""groundbreaking"" or ""ahead of their time."" While these statements could be used to describe Once Upon a Time in the West, they are not the only reasons to appreciate it. The casting and acting are superb. Claudia Cardinale is gorgeous. The cinematography is incredible. The music is perfect. If Sergio Leone were alive and making this movie in the 21st century I don't think he would have changed a thing (except maybe the voice dubbing). Westerns were so formulaic and non-artistic before the Italians came and started writing and directing. This movie is the ultimate timeless example of the potential of this genre.

I love the part when you get a flashback when he met Frank for the first time. I always get the chills whenever I see that part. Because there is so much meaning in that scene. And when Frank puts the harmonica in his mouth and the music starts playing.... Just perfect!Speeking of the music let's not forget the amazing soundtrack of this movie. Thanks to Ennio Morricone.

I guess it is cool that Henry Fonda is an evil piece of work, but other than that this movie really has nothing going for it, except Claudia Cardinale and her legendary beauty. The pacing was way too slow, the scenes were unnecessarily long and dragged often, and the acting left much to be desired.

554,ccockrell-11643,"""Sergio Leone and his crew of film-making delivers an amazing representation of the Old West, while Charles Bronson and the cast deliver classic performances!""",9,14 October 2018,"Sergio Leone comes to one of his last Western films involving the topics of revenge and love in Once Upon a Time in the West. Directed by Leone (Who also directed the Man with no Name Trilogy, Once Upon a Time in America), Once Upon a Time in the West involves around three Western individuals (Charles Bronson as ""Harmonica"", Jason Robards as ""Cheyenne"", and Henry Fonda as ""Frank"") who come across Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale). As she loses the people in her life, Frank is the killer. ""Cheyenne"" and ""Harmonica"" now work with each other to protect Mrs. McBain from this terrible man.Some people consider Once Upon a Time in the West one of the best Westerns of all time. In fact, it eventually makes it to one of the top films on the IMDb list. However, this specific Western contains some slow and confusing sequences. I pretty much had to think about a scene before knowing what was going on. Other than that, I think that Sergio Leone gathered up one of the best representations of the Old West. With his famous close-up shots and sequences of Western civilization involving train tracks, a great Western movie can go many ways with these details. I give credit to the accurate performances by the cast (Especially Charles Bronson who is like the ""Clint Eastwood"" in this film). I also give credit to Ennio Morricone for his emotional and complex soundtrack throughout the film. However, I prefer that Sergio Leone should receive the most credit. His direction leads this wonderful Western and his experience in the depiction of the Western Era changes everything. Once Upon a Time in the West should definitely be one of the greatest Western movies of all time!As my preference of the slow and confusing sequences in the movie, it really kind of downfalls a little bit in my rating for this movie. I loved it though! Maybe it's not confusing for some other people, but there was some scenes that confused me a little bit. However, it was fantastic! I give Once Upon a Time in the West a 9/10 for its brilliant direction, score, and performances. The 9/10 is also for the confusing and slow sequences.

It's Henry Fonda, however, who almost carries the film away - his villain totally unscrupulous and stomach-churningly nasty.One of the few films to make me cry - the soundtrack alone will bring a tear to your eye - this is the definitive spaghetti western and a film not to be missed.",Once Upon a Time in the West

I'd place him in the top 10 of All-Time Greatest Movie Villains because of his role as Frank. I'm not a big fan of Charles Bronson but he does a pretty good job in this film as well. This is one Western movie (with the exception of Leone's other films) that has both great story, action, characters, scenery, etc...

The dialouge, while minimal, is amazing, with a lot of memorable lines (""He plays when he should talk, he talks when he should play"" and ""You brought 2 too many"" are some of my favorites). The story is also very good and I like how at the final shootout Frank and the audience finds out what Harmonica wants with Frank. Charles Bronson, Claudia Cardinale, Henry Fonda and the rest of the actors did a great job. In the movie you can see that modern times are ending the quiet old west, and Leone captures it perfectly.Overall a great movie and one of my favorites.

568,gmanpackerfan,A brilliant masterpiece,10,27 March 2008,"Having seen all of the Dollars Trilogy and recently this one, I have come to the conclusion that although The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a great movie, it is not even in the league of Once Upon a Time in the West. Here is a brief review:Directing: The filming of this movie is the best I have ever seen, even better than the Godfather. The minor sepia tone and the desert colors make this film just beautiful to watch. 11/10Writing: With only 3 words said in the first 15 minutes, you may think Leone is crazy. But Leone, instead of using words most of the time in this movie, used closeups and music to display emotions. 10/10Music: At times very wild and loud, it fits the movie perfectly and is very well done by Morricone. 10/10Acting: Henry Fonda: although the character he plays sometimes seems misguided, he does a great job. 9/10 Claudia Cardinale: Looks amazing on screen, and fits extremely well with movie. 10/10 Jason Robards: He plays a bandit, who turns out to be a philosopher. You'll see what I mean. Great, just great. 10/10 Charles Bronson: WOW, JUST WOW. Some of the best acting ever on screen, way more complex than Eastwood.( which is okay because Eastwood was not supposed to be to that complex.) Anyhow, Charles was just outstanding, and nothing more can really be said. 100000000000/10In the end, this movie deserves its spot on IMDb; deserves even higher. Great movie that will take your breath away. Overall: 10/10P.S if you think I am just giving this a ten because I liked it, thats not true. I think hard about my ratings. Heck, I gave the Godfather a 9. This movie was better, plain and simple.",Once Upon a Time in the West
569,ace41095,The Greatest Western Of All Time.,10,2 April 2010,"Sergio Leone is one of the greatest directors of all time that does need to be repeated, because it has been known now for decades. When it comes down too which of his films is the best. I would normally say ""The Good The Bad And The Ugly"" is his best film. But his best western is no doubt ""Once Upon A Time In The West"". The film opens with a man with no name, but he's often called in this film ""Harmonica"". Charles Bronson one of the toughest true men to ever grace Hollywood pictures plays harmonica. He actually doesn't speak as often as you would think, but I personally think that's his style. Always quiet, with that serious look on his face. Opposite Charles Bronson is Jason Robarts as Cheyenne. I love his personality. He just has a fun time messing with people especially Harmonica never taking him seriously, but as the film continues on, his relationship with Harmonica improves, and he even saves his life, ""In one of the best train scenes ever captured on film"". But my personal favorite is Henry Fonda as Frank the main villain of the film. Frank is ruthless; he doesn't care about anyone except himself. He also hates Harmonica, he has the opportunity to kill him many times through out the film but he doesn't, Frank always keeps you guessing. And in turn Harmonica even saves his life. The final scene is one of the most epic scenes ever. Harmonica and Frank stand off against one another. I don't have a lot of time to mention much more of the cast but I will say they are all perfect. The soundtrack is also fantastic, but you can be the judge of that for yourself. Just to sum it up, with an amazing cast, beautiful soundtrack, and a great director, this is my pick for the greatest western of all time.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Or what kind of wagon traces are seen behind the three dusters and their horses waiting for Bronson - looks like tractor-traces? A lot more of the maybe traces of cars or tractors are seen in the scene when Frank is arriving on the set of the crime with the train standing still and the dead bodies lies around on the ground? Also a strange trace of cars or tractors is seen when Morton looks out of the window after he has been looking on the painted impression of the sea ....Besides - the movie is still after 40 years a monument in film history.I have seen the movie on screen more than 10 times and as DVD as said tens of times - and every time there is something new to discover.,Once Upon a Time in the West

Henry Fonda is the perfect bad guy, Charles Bronson the reluctant hero, Jason Robards the renegade and misunderstood outlaw, and Claudia Cardinale the sexy, but strong heroine. Leone's musical score is so original and so penetrating that it sticks like plaster. He infuses each characters score with their appearance on screen.

Perhaps this has some sort of literary value, but its just too slow for me.The Good the Bad and the Ugly is one of my favorite westerns, but just can't get through Once Upon a Time in the West, as there is always something better I can do with my time, such as watch on old John Wayne movie that I've seen 100 times.I think the director gets way too caught up in impressing the viewers with with slick camera work (which there is, by the way), but drags out each scene to the point its difficult to remember sometimes whats actually going on in the plot.I am clearly in the minority here, and I attribute that to the fact that I am perhaps a more shallow movie viewer than most who post here.

He can shoot""). Unlike most westerns, this film actually has a plot, and only really lets you get a handle on it near the end.Finally, there's the soundtrack. This is definitely Ennio Morricone's finest work.

Littered with wonderful symbolism and aided by possibly the greatest score ever written by the genius that is Ennio Morricone. Henry Fonda portrays a formidable bad-guy with other great turns all round by the cast. The brilliance for me is in each main character's story and the wider picture of America's birth through the importance about the rail network - there are just so many levels to it. Not to mention (without wishing to give anything away) the finale and the way violence itself is portrayed. The enigma of Harmonica and the underlying linear suspense that takes us to the end also should be merited.

I shan't repeat the many eloquent reviews on here which wax lyrically about Leone's beautiful direction, Morricone's sublime score, and the four perfect lead performances.....there would be no point as i agree wholeheartedly. I will instead just list some of the many small moments in this incredible film, moments which make the experience of viewing Leone's epic even greater than the sum of those aforementioned parts:The expression on Henry Fonda's face as he confronts little Timmy McBain, and the sneer in his voice as he tells Morton ""People scare better when they're dying!""....has there ever been a more coldblooded villain in movie history?Claudia Cardinale's brown eyes.Charles Bronson and Jason Robards' putdowns. ""You know music- and you can count. All the way up to two!"" ""Do you know a man with a harmonica? He's someone you'd remember. Instead of talking he plays- and when he'd better play, he talks.""THAT opening sequence....THAT shot as Jill arrives at the station, the camera swooping up and over the building to reveal the entire town.And finally, a heartfelt conversation between the film's two most pitiless characters,and bitterest enemies, before their final showdown about how there's no place for their kind anymore in the new civilized America.Leone's previous 3 westerns, particularly his celebrated The Good The Bad & The Ugly, were remarkable movies in their own right.

As the villain Frank, Henry Fonda gives Lee Van Cleef a run for his money as the most ominous Leone villain.Charles Bronson's Harmonica could take the man with no name anyday, while Claudia Cardinale plays one of cinemas great female characters in Jill McBain. The real star in my opinion is Jason Robards ""Cheyenne"" a character with a real sense of longing for the love of Jill McBain.

The story, the music, the gritty realism all make for one of the best movies ever made.The snippets of Harmonica's memories brings the audience closer and closer just as Frank is brought closer and closer to the final realization of how the past has finally caught up to the present in order for justice to be served.

I had already seen and loved Once upon a time in America and the Dollars trilogy and was hoping for another superb Leone film. To some extent this is what I got. There are some scenes in this movie that are sublime. The opening scene as they wait for the train is close to perfection as the deadly quiet is only interrupted by the small quirks of the environment it leaves you on tenterhooks. The same is true of the later scene at the house when all seems well but occasionally we see McBain's uneasy glances when he hears small noises. The score is by Ennio Morricone so it goes without saying that it is superb.The plot is also interesting and complex, it twists and turns as we attempt to decipher what the big game is that all these men are fighting over and yet the final twist (as to the nature of Harmonica and Frank's relationship) feels contrived and forced and comes too late in the movie for the animosity which has been present throughout to have meaning. If we had understood their relationship earlier on it would have lent more weight to their interactions (particularly where Harmonica saves Frank's life). It would also have had the effect of making the characters less bland. Blondie worked in the fistful trilogy because although he displayed few emotions, he was able to be sarcastic and fun too. Here it seems Leone wanted the next Blondie but Harmonica's character is boring, he sullenly fails to emote throughout the whole film even in scenes that should be of real emotion for the character (when he is facing off against the man who did so much to him at a younger age) he remains in his bored expression. If he doesn't seem to care about anything why should we. The other characters are not much stronger, their motives seeming to change on a dime (as with Cheyenne who is at one moment intimidating and hostile and the next best friends with Harmonica and Claudia.) Claudia's character is the worst though. The writer seems to have made an effort for her to be a strong character, but she becomes a tedious damsel in distress and has a confusing relationship with Harmonica (who is at one minute trying to rape her then the next protecting her from Frank's thugs???) All this adds up to a film that could have been brilliant but squandered this through its characters and it's failure to make its big plot twist at the end count for anything by deploying it in a way that doesn't feel token and forced.",Once Upon a Time in the West

It has one: great actors. Two: great screenplay. And three: one of the best directors, in my mind. Sergio Leone.When you see the film ""C'era una volta il West"". You'll notice that the intro of the film is excellent work that needs to be practiced more often. The fact that there is no music in the beginning of the film for at least twelve minutes, is sign of sure brilliance. Sergio didn't go out and try to be like all the other films out there and have a epic intro with crazy gun fights, he decided to have an intro with no music only sound effects of a windmill and footsteps walking around. In my opinion, I think it's one of the best intro's I've ever seen.Yes, it is 15 minutes shy of three hours.

By the end I had more questions than answers (only because the story is full of plot holes). There were very few action scenes (not that a good western needs them), the characters were boring, unrelatable, unrealistic, clichés, and the dialogue was few, far between, and didn't even relate to what was happening on screen. They would spend 10 minutes talking about random things, just to fill in time for a conversation that could have been said in a few sentences. The acting was terrible to mediocre at best and I can't really blame the stars for them not having a good script to read. Like I said, this movie was LONG (over three hours) and most of that time was just close ups of peoples faces and stylistic camera angles. When the action did happen, it was as clichéd and fake as it gets; I really can't believe that people act like this film is so unique when it did the same things as most other westerns of the time only in a more boring fashion. The only good things about it were that it had an awesome soundtrack (reminded me of Red Dead Redemption), but it was forced in at odd moments, the scenery was beautiful, and the sets were put together well.

611,m-brostrom,One of the best westerns ever made,10,26 April 2006,"Sergio Leone's C'era Una Volta il West belongs to those rare kind of cinematic experiences which one may experience only once in a lifetime. Everything works brilliantly in the film and there's no single fault to be found. It's massive, long, epic western milestone.Acting in the film is fantastic and what makes it eternal is the charisma surrounding the main characters. Charles Bronson has maybe the role of his lifetime as Harmonica, extremely witty and dangerous character seeking revenge. Claudia Cardinale is in her prime and has maybe the most unforgettable woman role in history of western. As the main villain in movie appears Henry Fonda, whose character seems to be the meanest and the most malicious western villain ever controversial to the fact that Fonda had earlier in his career become famous from his roles as a character fulfilling the rules of justice.When above mentioned acting capacity is combined with Leone's virtuosic skills in film-making and astonishing cinematography the result can't really get anymore unique and superb. Every scene in the film is well captured and the overwhelming epic music of Leone's long-term collaborator Ennio Morricone fits perfectly itself on those scenes.C'era Una Volta il West reveals Leone's view of American West in monumental and cinematically fascinating way emphasizing the themes of greed, revenge and maybe the slightly evolving matriarchity as the main elements of the whole film.

Some very bad macaroni-westerns have also reached our country by that time, so I had mixed feelings when I have bought form a ticket tout my 200% price ticket for a Sergo Leone  so another macaroni western  movie.

Good story, good characters, famous ""capitalist"" actors and e real actress (Fod, Bronsosn, Robard and the amazing FEMALE star, C.C.).Even the opening screen was more interesting, than whole films before.

616,jaymesko,Three heavies getting killed as the movie started..........,10,30 December 2006,"Once Upon a Time in the West is my pick for the number one movie ever and especially a western. I have seen all the most popular western movies down through the years and would say there are about 50 that I would watch over and over again. BUT this movie is the best. I will never forget the first time I saw this movie. It was in 1971. A friend mine, Doug and I had been out and about during the day and we ended up back at his house. It was about 3 in the afternoon after a great party the night before at his house. We had just finished cleaning up the whole house from the party and were sitting down with a beer and flipping the channel to see what was on television. We were in the basement recreation room sipping a brew as we watched a western that we had found already in progress. We had missed the first 20 to 30 minutes of some ""western"" and were watching the railroad station scene with the three men who were sent to meet ""Harmonica"".We were only five minutes into this scene,with no dialogue and just some strange music, with our beers forgotten and sitting on the edge of our chairs leaning forward in order to miss nothing on the screen. My buddies roommate had walked down the stairs and started talking to us and proceeded to lift weights behind us in the recreation room. We both stood up turned around to face him and at the same time both yelled something to the effect that if he didn't cease and desist making all that noise, ( Just a clink or two of the weights bumping as he was moving them... ) we were going to either beat the crap out of him or kill him! Couldn't he see that we were really into a movie and he was really upsetting our concentration!!!!! :<)Before I continue you must know that I am and have been a western nut since I was 10 or 12. I have read books and watched movies of westerns religiously whenever I could find them. My buddy Doug on the other hand had seen some westerns, and as a reader had probably read a western book or two but was not really too interested. He would rather watch a football game than watch a western for the 14 th time. I could and did talk circles around him about westerns. So he was watching this movie with me just to kick back and relax with a beer after an all night party at his house.Later I told him how surprised I was at his reaction, like mine, to his roommates lifting weights behind us while we were trying to watch some western that we did not even know the name of and that we had only been watching for five minutes.It was at this time as we had just finished yelling at that guy to stop that we both looked at each other, smiled, sat down and moved our chairs closer to the television and continued to watch the scene unfold before us. You could hear a pin drop when the scene was over. We knew that this movie was going to be either the worst western ever because of what just happened, or that we were really going to have a good afternoon and see the best western to come down the pike in the last 20 years.It was a great afternoon and even Doug agreed that we had to see this one again and again in the future. Which we did. Thirty years later, married with three kids who are almost 30 themselves they would agree with me. They all know that dad's favorite movie of all time is ""Once Upon a Time in the West""! I made them watch it with me until their eyes fell out! Today I will have to say that ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Open Range"" are a close number two and three. Waiting for more good westerns ................. Jay",Once Upon a Time in the West

618,rob_the_gent,"The Greatest Western , if not Film, of all Time",10,22 January 2007,"In 1968, in the wake of completing the Dollars Trilogy, Sergio Leone wanted to wash his hands of the Western and begin work on the gangster film that would one day become Once Upon A Time In America. Fortunately (for us viewers), in 1968 nobody wanted Leone to do anything but Westerns. So he agreed to do one more. But this would not be just another western, no. This would be the film to summarise all his feelings about the Western - the death of the Western from the man who gave it new life. It would be Once Upon A Time In The West.West is an incredible triumph. A picture of such rare perfection that the viewer can only watch in awe as the master of the Western composes a dance of death. Ennio Morricone's scores and ingenious use of natural sound (Leone said that sound was 40% of a film) add an operatic feel to the goings on. One feels that they are watching a legend, and they are, as only the greatest storyteller of the genre knows how. Every performance, particularly Claudia Cardinale's, is pitch perfect. Every shot is like a painting. Every moment is as mythic as it is magnificent. Leone also paid tribute to Westerns he loved. Watch out for homages to Johnny Guitar, Shane and the Searchers. This is what makes Leone, perhaps, the first postmodern director.West is Leone's underrated masterpiece. If it is not the greatest film of all time then it is certainly the greatest Western.",Once Upon a Time in the West

But this film, ""Once Upon A Time In The West,"" is one of my favorite films of all genres.It is deep and rich; the film takes its sweet time to develop the interrelationships of the four major characters. Amazingly, the film's dialogue is quite economical and the actors use a variety of non-verbal forms of communication to set tones for the story.One of the major hooks for the audience is to understand Harmonica's (Harmonica is the character portrayed by Charles Bronson) motive to pursue Frank, played deftly by Henry Fonda. We are shown blurred images from his thoughts that become clearer as the film progresses. And when the truth is revealed near the film's most climatic scene, the audience is ""blown away.""

622,ledflooyd,The End of The West,10,30 October 2021,"Set at the end of the 19th century , Once Upon a Time in The West tells the story of the End of one era , And the Beginning of another one.It's about Civilization and It's infancy in America. The Law is quickly gaining power , Towns and Railroads are beginning to show up and The Gunslinging Outlaw is a dying breed.Right at the start of the film , We see Frank and his gang massacring an entire family, Which at first glance might seem contradictory to the movie's general mood. But later on , In another scene Frank is talking to his employer , a wealthy capitalist by the name of Morton , Who ordered him to "" Scare the family. "" Here one might assume The Capitalist's intentions were purely Wealth oriented. But when it comes to a vicious killer like Frank and a situation involving guns , There can be only one outcome. He was a capitalist's errand boy and there was nothing he could do about it.There was another scene involving Frank and Morton where Frank kicked the Wealthy man's canes off and threw him on the ground. Again , It might seem like that in this scene in particular he was the person in power, But if he was so powerful why did he keep on doing Morton's dirty work and went to the auction ? And even if he wanted to buy the land for himself why did he say ""None of it matters "" to Harmonica ?It just shows that even a mean outlaw like Frank is powerless when It comes to battling civilization.There is also the "" Indian Question "" posed in this movie. Throughout movie history and particularly the Western genre , Indians were often the ""Vanilla Villains."" In Once Upon a Time in The West however , They are the innocent bystanders who are just trying to go about their business in peace and It is the incoming ""Modernity"" That's not leaving them be. This has been summed up perfectly in the "" Arrival Scene."" Where in one Train coach there are cattle coming out and in another there are Indians. For a ""Civilized Man"" an Indian's life is no more valuable than that of the cattle's.There is also the running Indian in the opening scene, Where instead of running towards ""Civilization"" , She is running away from it.Just like the ""Indian Question"" , Once Upon a Time In the West has a lot to say about women as well. In it, one of the four main characters , and Arguably the most important one ( If it wasn't for Jill , None of the events in the movie would have occured) is a woman. And unlike traditional westerns , She is more than simply a mother or a love interest. She is a human. And with all her imperfections we feel for her. Jill's first scene is still among the saddest in the entire movie.In this film , There's a strong presence felt by women. They are involved in the daily life,They bid in auctions , They own lands and We see them working besides men. ( and sometimes without them. )
But as much as the times moved on , The people in Once Upon a Time in The West's universe are seen as stuck in a dying time. The Infamous ""Grab and Pretend"" scene at the end is about that.If we look at Leone's own work in the Western genre , Women were never a topic of great importance. Even in ""a Fistful of Dynamite"" that came after this one , a woman never was the cause of any chaos. But to be fair , Progress and Civilization weren't topics previously explored by him neither.Cheyenne , Which I would argue is the Main Character in this movie , is also a Person of much interest. Throughout the entirety of the film, the only Character going through real meaningful change is Cheyenne. We can see this particularly through his interactions with Jill.The First one was tense and one would get the feeling bullets and blood would come out at any second. Cheyenne threatened to kill her and she also made some ""Moves"" against him.At the end however , Jill was smiling at him , Gave him a razor to shave and told him to stay with her. Cheyenne was also quite warm and joked around.He also took a bullet and died for harmonica right at the end. To see a Murderer become this Selfless and Loyal companion was an amazing sight to behold.Harmonica and what he represents is also quite debatable. In the opening scene , We see him getting off a train -a symbol for Modernity and Progress- killing three gang members , In an era in which they are being hunted by the hundreds. Harmonica is Time. His supernatural qualities is seen early on when he walks unscathed after being shot. He is Civilization chasing the older and the weaker Outlaw who just doesn't care anymore.Being released one year after Bonnie & Clyde , Once Upon a Time in The West certainly was brutal in it's depiction of Violence.While it is true that there were a lot of Guns and Bullets in the Dollars Trilogy , None was as brutal as seen this Movie.In the Trilogy , We seldom see any blood and the Rock & Roll style score by The Master Ennio Morricone helped glorify the violence. ( Except for the bridge scene in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly of course. )
In this film however , Even a single punch can cause a person to bleed. There are brutal Tortures , Bad Languages and even a long scene involving Rape, None seen to this extent in any prior Leone film.Once Upon a Time in The West is one the greatest westerns of all time. A Western, Which ironically killed the genre.Do yourself a favour and watch it right now.",Once Upon a Time in the West

633,fredericlabarre,Cinematic quality,10,30 January 2007,"Sergio Leone once said in an interview to Italian television that John Ford westerns were probably the farthest from reality. As cinematic genre very rapidly evolved in the 1960s to reflect better real ""human behaviour"", this allowed Leone to produce characters that were the embodiment of the West. Neither black, nor white, neither good, nor bad, just a mix of both. This typifies heroes such as ""Harmonica"" who is really after a personal vendetta, and Cheyenne, who is really after some sort of ill-rewarded redemption. The American west was gray, like its characters, with stories of heroism and moral decadence. No other movie presents this dilemma better as Once Upon a Time.This is an exercise in sobriety and restraint, certainly in the script, where only a few lines are sufficient to convey the full weight of the story. It is also an exercise in excess (for the time). For 1969, the amount of violence (and I don't mean gun-related violence) was outrageous for its quality. It is really difficult for the public of the time to comprehend how someone, let alone a movie director, could compose such death scenes as the hanging.All in all, a movie of relentless and gritty beauty, an aesthetics study of human nature, and perfection embodied in the notion of simplicity.Some examples from the script: Harmonica shoots Frank's accomplices who had turned on him.Mrs. McBain, surprised: ""You saved his life!"" Harmonica: ""I didn't let THEM kill him, and there's the difference."" At the end of the movie, Cheyenne to Mrs. McBain, about the railroad workers: Cheyenne: ""Why don't you bring these men some water. You have no idea what the sight of a woman like you does to men like these... And if one of them should pat your behind... Just do as if it was nothing.""

The tense silence which is the hallmark of Sergio Leone's movies, has been most perfectly executed in this movie's opening.The acting is top-notch, and the sweeping landscapes are yet again majestically captured as in all of Sergio Leone's classic westerns. The expressions on the character's faces and the intense silences between them add to the mysterious air of the movie. The haunting harmonica score is very appropriate with the theme of the movie: mysterious at first, sounding haunting later on, and finally, oozing heartening emotions. Ennio Morricone is quite possibly the greatest of all the film score composers.The storyline has quite a few twists and turns, and the characters are well crafted.The camera angles are simply breathtaking. One minor point that impressed me, was the way Cheyenne's men dressed: their flowing dusters are inspiring, and nearly the best western costume I have ever seen.This movie is an instant classic. It is different from Sergio Leone's Dollar Trilogy (which includes The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) in quite a few ways, but it has a charm of its own. I would absolutely recommend it!",Once Upon a Time in the West

It's as close an example of cinematic opera you will find - the music, the characters, the direction all works together with such harmony and heartening substance. As with all great films it has a point of view and things to say about the role of men and the influence of money & the threat of violence. There are so many moments of pure genius - the opening scene, the introduction of Henry Fonda, the inevitable reason for revenge; all played out with such languid, confident style.I can't recommend this film highly enough.",Once Upon a Time in the West
640,petteri-airaksinen,"If you want to watch a a western, Leone's style is the way to go",10,10 February 2008,"Once Upon a Time in the West is a spaghetti western about three man, who all want one woman. The film tells about the relationships of these four people and the revolution of the railroads. Directed by legendary Sergio Leone in 1968, and starring Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale, it was a big disappointment in theaters, but today the film is a big classic.This film has a certain kind of a rhythm, which was very important to the director. It starts when three crooks come to a railroad station to meet Harmonica (Charles Bronson). Then we go to the McBain's farm, where all the family members are killed by Frank (Henry Fonda) and his crew. After that, Jill (Claudia Cardinale) comes to the railroad station. Cheyenne (Jason Robards) we meet at the bar in the middle of desert.Sergio Leone said that he tried ""to create, with the pacing of the film, an impression of a human being's last breaths before his death"". He succeeded in it. Four leading characters all have their own goals that they're trying to achieve. After the battles they fight for their goals, some of them end up being dead and some of them have to move on in their lives.I think this is the best of Leone's. Ennio Morricone's music is amazing. Morricone won an Oscar for his life-long work in scoring music to movies. If you want to travel to the Wild West, Leone's stylized and rough version of it is the way to go.",Once Upon a Time in the West

I was in love with Claudia Cardinale ""the whore with a heart of gold"".The movie itself is excellent, but what gives just that little more, is, in my humble opinion, Claudia Cardinale's corrupt uncorruptable character. She is the quintessential westernwoman; the woman every man who would ever intentionally watch a western, didn't know it was possible to dream of. Sometimes I may forget her for a day or two, but I have a picture of her on my refrigerator and she's been with me for 3-4 years now. And such is the entire movie; as Nietzsche ended western metaphysics, Sergio Leone effectively ended the western genre. 9/10 for the movie - plus that 1 extra just for Claudia = 10/10",Once Upon a Time in the West

644,spiritualfields,Transcendent,10,21 December 2008,"The visual beauty of this movie, the superb acting, the universal themes, and the accompanying score underpin its greatness, but what makes it a truly great movie is the pacing. 'Slow' is how many reviewers describe the pace, but 'slow' implies that the pace could have been improved by a speeding up of the scenes. However, the pace is perfect. Rather than 'slow', I like to describe the scenes as being 'extended' (as opposed to exaggerated, extreme, or protracted, which, like 'slow', are words that imply imperfection). In Once Upon A Time In The West the action is extended over time intervals that allow the viewer to think and reflect and ponder on what is being observed. It's as if Leone has slowed down time, and what we reflect and ponder about is more than just the scene, which reflect an America that we never knew. But we know the themes of greed, lust, revenge, anger, despair, savage cruelty, regret, and loss, and those of us who have reached maturity and have decades of experience under our belt, also have memories of experiences that reflect those fundamental themes. And THAT is what tugs at our heartstrings (at least mine). The scenes are metaphors that stand in for own lives.You have to grow into this realization. Twenty years ago, when I first saw this movie, it was just a good movie, and If I had written a review about it then, I'd probably be comparing it to The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, just like many other reviewers do. Hell, I might even have suggested that it was a little slow in some areas. But the experiences have caught up with me, and I understand now what Leone had tried (and succeeded) in doing. I have not found another movie that affects me as much as this one. As much as a movie can be interactive, can involve the viewer, can make them reflect on the past and ponder the future, can bring up emotions that arise from those reflections, Once Upon A Time In The West takes the crown. This movie is in a class by itself.",Once Upon a Time in the West

This movie is a special western because you see a dark side of the west, actually this movie comes close to a dramatic thriller and that makes it different than many other westerns. In this one there are no more words spoken than necessary. In place of using long speeches the story of this movie is mainly told by music and impressions of the face of the actors.The music of once upon a time in the west is one of the best music scores a movie ever has.

Not all movies should be over in 90 minutes, while others are already boring from the first minute. It is clear that this movie is of the first category. Sergio Leone really took time for beautiful shots. Watch the scene in which Claudia Cardinale gets out of the train carefully. The shot starts when she gets out, and continues when she walks over the platform, through the railway station building, and out of it on the other side. All in one shot!!! The MTV-ation of the cinema is not always a good thing. It sometimes makes it more exciting, but the truly long, good shots should never be forgotten.

The violence of several scenes may prove unnerving to some, but seem secondary, although quite in keeping with the classic mythological characters that represent the popular stereotypes of western cinema.  ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is both a tribute to western cinematic traditions and the mythology of the west that began with the dime novel matured with the rise of the adult westerns of the sixties and seventies.",Once Upon a Time in the West
655,pan675068448,very typical about frontier life,9,29 November 2011,"The movie told me a story about cowboys and west life in 19th century. The story is about a battle between a widow and a bad guy who are powerful and wealthy. The bad guy owned much railway and land meanwhile he wanted to get more land from a widow. Then a brave cowboy came to the small town where the widow lived. He helped the lady to fight with the bad guy and at last they won. This movie is about cowboy and frontier life. The life in the small town is hardly and there are few laws and rules to control people. The most important thing in the west was land and many people will even kill people for land. At the beginning of the movie I can guess what mood the movie will be. The director gave me a beautiful but cruelty scene and the whole movie was in that kind of mood. The cowboy who helped the widow is definitely macho. He was mysterious and had enough power to protect himself as well as people who needed his help like the widow. He was also very callous. At last the beautiful widow fell in love with the cowboy and asked the cowboy to stay with her. However, the callous cowboy said no. Then while the lady asked him when would you come back, he said ""someday"". His answer was cool and nothing. He was steady in mood and nothing can influence him. This movie is totally about what I learned from chapter four in American ways. In the movie we can see frontier life, self-reliance, rugged individualist, American macho heroes and can-do spirit. Especially the hero is very typical. He demonstrated his strength through physical violence in the movie. He fought against the man who controlled the small town. He was physically tough and rugged by the conditions of frontier life. He appeared and disappeared alone.

659,luukramaker,Like looking into another world,10,28 October 2013,"Once upon a time there was a European who perfected the typical and old American western genre. It was the Italian Sergio Leone who succeeded to reach this seemingly impossible perfectionism. With Once Upon a Time in the West he brought both his own career and the complete genre to the highest level. Of course that's just my opinion and there are a lot of people who would disagree with that statement, but for me this extraordinarily great movie seems currently unbeatable. Now, the last 45 years much has been said and written about this movie, but that doesn't prevent me to add my humble opinion to the increasing number of shared opinions about it. The fact that I truly love this movie was just something I didn't want to stay unmentioned.Yesterday, one of the songs of Ennio Morricone's wonderful soundtrack got stuck in my head. The characteristic sound of Cheyenne had kept me busy the whole day and because it had already been a year since I saw the movie for the last time I decided to see it once again.Almost every time there's been talked about this movie in the past there's been talked about the distinctive, sluggish, but powerful beginning. We're lucky that the three men were not half an hour early for the train, because it shouldn't have last much longer before boredom would've struck. However, right now, with only ten minutes to wait before the train comes in, the beginning is brilliant. You then approximately know what's about to come 'cause in the rest of the movie Leone also takes ample time to show what he wants to show and with the pace in which the movie continues there isn't much important you can be missing.Every character which can be found in the movie is a unique and original one, without any form of overacting or a highly overdone presence of one of them. Whether it's about the remarkable Harmonica, which attracts the most attention with the striking tune he plays, or about Cheyenne, which can be recognized by his own theme as well, all of them ensure that it's enjoyable from the beginning till the end because of their abstruse, unknown history. Furthermore, Leone succeeds to let his characters behave very human, just like he did in his previous movies. They all have both their good and their bad sides and none of those sides is hidden, let alone that one of the characters is idealized.Yet the movie feels a little unrealistic in the sense that it seems to take place in a different universe. Especially the slowness in which everything happens makes you feel like you're looking into another world. In particular, the time that is taken to say something feels unreal, while on the other hand it gives a magical feeling as well. It's Ennio Morricone who perfects the ensuing mysterious atmosphere.But a movie would be nothing without actors. Actors which are all delivering a great performance in this movie. Jason Robards perhaps got the best role. He seems to be made for the role of Cheyenne and it's wonderful to see how he slowly changes during the movie. I think Charles Bronson plays the best role in his career and just like Henry Fonda he's acting great in the interesting, mysterious conflict in which they're involved. In my view, Claudia Cardinale can do no wrong and she therefore brings along the necessary femininity in a perfect way. Finally, Jack Elam, Woody Strode and Gabriele Ferzetti deserve a special mention which they owe to their great performances, although not all of their roles had very much influence on the movie's story.After the very good beginning and the great continuation the ending is at least as admirable as the foregoing. A shootout wasn't a big innovation and there already was a foretaste of the use of flashbacks in Leone's earlier For a Few Dollars More, but the way he combines these two elements and the quality of the combination makes sure that the end is more brilliant than that of the average movie. After the first few blurry, mysterious flashbacks the flashback at the end ensures clarification. Then everything falls into place and some of the characters seem to face a happy life ever after.",Once Upon a Time in the West

I don't know of another movie that used this technique. The sound track is a classic, one of the best ever. Each character plays an important role in exemplifying human character and traits especially in the time of the old west, therefore, the title, ""Once Upon a Time In The West"" is so appropriate. The movie carries one back to that time through their actions and the theme of the ever expanding railroad that took place during that time. There is heartbreak at times followed by success or fulfillment for some of the roles. There is good brought out in the ones who are portrayed as bad, such as Cheyenne. Also, in the end there is death for some, and like in real life everything is not a fairy tale ending. It is a true microcosm of that time in the west, and of the human nature of men and women.

I concur with: ""Simply put, this movie is the most visually stimulating and engrossing movie I have ever watched."" I #1 found it to convey graphic reality in a way I have never experienced in any other film - and that came across on a crummy black and white TV that I first viewed it on when stumbling upon a late night showing in 1973. The next day in high school, I was reeling from what I had experienced - it cast a difference on plain 'ole mundane life - it is definitely an ART Flick - not mere entertainment. There are some elements that make it even more intensely valuable to us here still in 2012. It is somewhat of an overlooked legacy. The actors are nearly all dead. They truly lived and died and now very few of the current ""Sweetwater"" community knows of them what went on before we took over... The soundtrack is real- the sounds throughout the movie and the musical score is real - not sampler generated - the horns are horns, the chorus is people, the windmill is a windmill, the gunfire is amplified guns, Leone used a technique of amplifying real sound- bigger than life - for effect- works wonderfully- even the plate re-verb used on the guitar tracks is plate, a large cumbersome device, but not digital emulation...The length is perfect.. those who find it slow or long don't get it.. I would that it had been a 40-60 hour film, as it almost turned out to be before Leone got help shortening it - he captured reality with intense close ups and overextended meditation-like shots and sequences... Longer? Yes. Leone is gone now, the actors are gone now, the sets are long forgotten, the locales and even the story, is set in the unchangeable past - I would that we had all the hours of it that Leone struggled to shorten, like other extinctions, to only have available to see and hear and touch. A Bored of the Rings trilogy might have ruined it though, so OK. But sadly, there is no more. Perhaps it's like the possession of a single 200 year old bottle of wine. Of note - I am a musician; the players/singers of the score - are amazing - every contribution from the whistling to the exacting guitar passages, are perfectly executed - they set standard, that which comes after seeks to come up to the bar they set - the vocals and the musical passages are one time, one of a kind; anyone else can only hope to match - saying, you cannot surpass what they did- it was perfect as original, and any flaws are like the dust in the film and become that which others try to duplicate - they nailed it. As you live and the world you grew up in changes around you, until the people and places and events replace that which was, with only remnant artifacts, largely unrecognized or esteemed by the contemporary occupants, you will experience your own : ""Once Upon a Time in (insert your own place)"" as things move on and YOU become history. The movie extras show you what the actual scene locations look like NOW and you realize that it's that way where you live: you've been living in your own drama- all around change, but you are in it and the drama is as real.Buy it and WATCH THE FILM WITH COMMENTARY - the first commentator is wonderful - takes you into the mindset like a museum tour guide, and you'll discover that the reason you are shocked and touched and moved, and find this work of art so visceral and real,,,is because it was the masterpiece last western, by a lover himself of the genre, our USA mythical west, where as as it was stated in Judge Roy Bean, ""if it wasn't, It should have been...""",Once Upon a Time in the West

Actually i watched the movie after i watched the dollar series and this is also my second movie of Bronson and buoy what an actor he was!! He could not only kill someone with his power but silence Morricone is just like a God here with his presence in terms of music and Bronson the ultimate 'Harmonica'. Look at him in the first glance and one will find the reality in his character as portrayed by Bronson since his presence and throughout. This movie really touches heart with story, awesome direction, of course the heavenly music ( by Morricone), super negative role by Fonda and the silence of Bronson. O God! if we had him (Charles Bronson) now he would have certainly created havoc. Just unforgettable!!",Once Upon a Time in the West
669,tyrone-superman,Painfully slow and too long,5,23 January 2016,"I went into this movie with high expectations having enjoyed some of Sergio Leone's other 'classics' like 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, however this fell well short. The movie has a storyline that is not overly entertaining and one I feel could have been cut significantly shorter. I found myself many times throughout the movie just wanting it to reach some sort of climax and end because it was boring me. Obviously the scenery was epic and there were some amazing shots - which is standard with Leone's work - but this movie just did not do it for me. The movie still managed to gain a 6 star rating from me based simply upon the directing and strong performances from Fonda, Bronson and Cardinale. If the movie was 45 minutes to an hour shorter I'm sure it could still have told the story just as well - probably better because viewers would not face so many dull moments - and rated much higher for me.",Once Upon a Time in the West
670,ste_300,"A Dance Of Death, A Movie To Blow Your Mind...",10,8 August 2005,"****Contains Spoilers*** Right, where do I start? On the back of the DVD case is written 'From start to finish, a dance of death'. That's exactly where we will begin. The whole movie is similar to one big Mexican standoff. From the tension, to the quick and brutal violence that the director Sergio Leone had introduced so well by this time in the commonly called 'Spaghetti Westerns'.The story is all about three men. As the tag-line reads, 'One man to love her, one man to take her away and one man to kill her'. That's basically a short sum up of the story. Charles Bronson plays Harmonica (Labeled this because he has no name, much like Clint Eastwood in the dollars series) a 'Good Guy' role as he tries to protect Jill. Jill played by Claudia Cardinale is a ex whore who agreed to marry a man called McBain. However her new family are brutally murdered and she is left alone, with the killer wanting to kill her.The opening scene (Similar to the standoff in High Noon) is perfectly done. Charles Bronson takes three guys out in a standoff outside a train station. With one of the greatest lines ever by Bronson. In actual fact the scene was shot last and after it was done, one of the men in the standoff went back to his hotel and jumped off the roof, in full cowboy dress.As we go through we are introduced to the three men, Harmonica (The one to take her away - Played by Charles Bronson), Cheyenne (The one to love her - Played by Jason Robards) and Frank (The one to kill her - played by Henry Fonda).When is all boils down to it, the reason for all of the killings came to the plot of land that McBain had purchased. Now it was worth a great deal. Each man wanted to get there hands on some of the money it would appear. But in this case, looks can be deceptive.Top it all of with some shootouts and some famous Leone close-ups and long shots and here we have possibly one of the greatest movies ever. With an ending that will shock you. Fonda for me seals the show, but really Great acting all round **********/********** - 10/10 (If you liked The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, you will love this. A great film).",Once Upon a Time in the West

At first when I saw this film I did not think of it much because I was brought up in the typical Hollywood type of westerns of shiny cowboys and Indians but, when I saw this film again it struck me how much it resembled the real colonial old west just before the turn of the 20th century. Sergio Leone was brilliant in this regard and should be up among the top directors of the the last century. The sound track is magnificent, of-course it portrays an extension of the film in terms of creating the correct feeling for the scene but it is in my view that if Argento was not involved with the soundtrack that the film would have had a different atmosphere to the viewer.",Once Upon a Time in the West

I think LEONE to be a highly underrated filmmaker when one considers that The unforgiven (a good film) won an Oscar (although so did Rocky so I guess this cheapens the award).This really is a tour de force in the genre and is highly recommended.

The two most touching parts of the movie for me is close to the end of the movie, when Harmonica (Bronson) is staring out the door after he's killed Frank (Fonda), and Claudia Cardinale asks him if he'll be back one day -Bronson turns, stares with intensity at Cardinale for a second or two, and says ""someday"" you know he's never coming back.. it's the look on Bronson's face.. another touching moment is when Jason Robards pats Claudia Cardinale on the butt suggesting some of the railroad workers who have not seen a pretty woman in a long while might do the same, and that she should tolerate it -I got the sense of the basic decency of Robard's character, a killer & robber, but lovable in his own way.

677,miehsinarmtarn,Greatest Movie ever,10,11 November 2013,"""Once a time in the west"" (Spiel mir das Lied vom Tod in Germany - Play the song of death for me) this movie had been played in our local cinema. A waited a lot of years so that I was allowed to see this 16 rated movie. And I saw it 3 times in one week and than every time it was in cinema since then (and in the eighties it was every summer for a few days in our local cinema, and every time it was sold out). There are less movies I saw that often then ""in the West"". Every time it's a party for the eyes and the soul, even when it's in TV not as good than on cinema. As many people told before, Ennio Morricone made one of the best score ever. It's funny, that he wrote the score before Leone made the first picture of the movie. After Leone told him the story, Morricone wrote the music. And during the working on the movie Leone played the music for his actors. Now I bought the BluRay, great.",Once Upon a Time in the West

This is the best western movie ever. Charles Bronson plays the good guy Harmonica. His performance is superb. I watched his Death Wish many years ago. His performance in that movie already gave me a deep impression. I really like Mrs. McBain played by Claudia Cardinale. She is so lovable. Her facial expression is magnificent. Cheyenne played by Jason Robards is also a cool guy. This movie is like a beautiful poem.",Once Upon a Time in the West
679,drizer4real,Simply the best Western ever made,10,12 March 2005,"I was drawn to this movie perhaps simply by the feel of it, the way the movie just pours, ney gushes desert sand, bad whiskey and bad men over the viewer mixed in with the heat and the mules, the trains, the coarse curses and shouts from the railroad workers and most of all the great silences in which Leone is master.Which director do you know who can make 15 opening minutes in which absolutely nothing happens, in to great movie-art? And then out of the blue, when you're lulled in to sleep by the deserts monotone sounds ... bang there is Harmonica. With a blast.Seeing this movie for me as a kid was coming very close to walking and living in that great romantic (and probably in reality very hard) era of the West and the coming of the railroads. Maybe the scenario doesn't seem that overtly complicated or complex (ie. girl needs saving from bad guy, mysterious good guy seems willing, mysterious good guy kills bad guy, end of story), but maybe that is just great storytelling: transcending a rather simple story to a compelling and moving epic.I think the development of the story is somewhat a side show compared to the way it depicts how America got industrialized and how the robber barons/railway magnets of late 19 century America are the real powers and not the 'traditional' gunslingers Frank, Harmonica and Cheyene. It has the message that in the end money is more powerful than any Peacemaker. The way of the Colt and the West gives in to the way of director's chamber and fontainpen.The life's and dealings of common people are happening somewhat in the shadow of the great changes America goes through in the period between the end of the Civil War and the end of the 19th century.Every image of this movie is a work of art, from the ride Jill makes from the station, her meeting with Cheyene and Harmonica, the shocking and chilling moment Frank enters the movie to the end sequence with Frank and Harmonica shooting it out, and it's somewhat bittersweet ending with the leaving of Harmonica and the death of Cheyene.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Director Sergio Leone stepped out beyond his spaghetti western roots to make a giant western saga. The story is told in the lives of four different western archetypes. Claudia Cardinale, Charles Bronson,Jason Robards and a villainous Henry Fonda star. The screenplay was co-written by future Italian film giant Bernardo Bertolucci. The film is audio edited in a way that even the dubbed-in voices of the actors are never a hindrance to the pace of the story. The score is also by another Italian film giant the legendary Ennio Morricone. If you have a spare evening or afternoon(the restored film is 2hrs 45mins) be sure to watch it.

682,petrimoilanen83,Leone's west comes alive on the screen,10,27 October 2014,"So you ask, how a movie what starts with 10 minutes of menacing staring and waiting in train station can be labeled as one of the best western movies there is? Where is the big battle against the Indians or fast galloping posse following an outlaw, thats the question. The answer is simple, less is more if you know how to do it right. And that opening scene does that brilliantly, it shows the viewer exactly what to expect. Almost cartoonish characters, rough atmosphere and suspense, you just know there wont be John Wayne type hero coming to save the day.As the movies progress, the plot and questions are being answered in a slow but very rewarding way. The protagonist played by Bronson is interesting and almost mysterious character because at times you have no idea about his intentions but then again just a look in his eyes or note played from his harmonica can tell you a lot. The first time when I saw him play that harmonica instead of talking, I found it a bit ironic but as the movie went on I started to understand it, because the only purpose he is there is to have payback with frank, so he doesn't want business with anyone else.Henry Fonda is great as the antagonist and Jason Robards adds so much to the movie, his character can be liked but also disliked at times, what makes it so enjoyable to watch. Claudia Cardinale's Jill brings credibility and puts the whole story together. And Morricone's music makes the scenes come alive, its a shame that nowadays movie soundtracks doesn't support the movie the same way as they used to.As conclusion, Once Upon a Time in the West is in my opinion Leone's most complete work and a great achievement in movie making. There is only one question left, could this story really have been true or is it only a fairy tale. As the title says: Once Upon a Time...so its up to the viewers to decide that.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Before sudden, ear-shattering gunshots ring out, Leone orchestrates masterful moments of long and intense waiting. In the famous 10-minute opening credit sequence, we're left for a long, long time just listening to drips from a leak, a squeaky windmill, a door slamming open and shut, and a fly buzzing. We listen and keep listening, anticipating; anticipating violence or silence or both. And Charles Bronson appear!!!! I loved the end too, with Jason Robards on his horse (i don't spoiled, i can't tell more). And Henry Fonda make the bad guy, a very good idea (in this time Henry Fonda only play the good guy).

Bronson, Fonda, and Bobards play very interesting and likable characters that had my investment. The opening scene is the only moment in the movie that resembles the wit and style of the Dollars trilogy. Plus the soundtrack is really good. The bad part is, the plot is SO predictable, which doesn't help its three hour running time and extremely slow pace. Claudia Cardinale is just beauty.

I love this Film!!!! and can watch it over and over again! You may be turned off by the slow start of this movie but be patient while you are waiting for it to develop look at the artistic way Leone brings in his audience long spans with few words said. The way his characters always enter from the right side of the frame the close ups of they're faces so close you can see the pores in the characters faces, and many times the characters say nothing but you know what they are thinking.
