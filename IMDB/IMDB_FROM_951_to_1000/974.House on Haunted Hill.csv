0,MartinHafer,Not one of Price's better horror films,5,4 February 2007,"The movie is about a strange rich guy (Price) who pays five seemingly random people to come to a party in a haunted house where seven people were supposedly murdered. Each is told if they stay the night, they will receive $10,000 in the morning. However, soon after this, murders begin occurring and everyone is terrified for their lives. The film does have a somewhat interesting twist at the end, though otherwise it's a haunted house film. It does try very hard and William Castle threw practically everything into this film to make it entertaining--except a decent script. Sure, it's fun to watch, but also pretty brainless--with lots of dumb plot devices and holes. For example, the home that all the people are in has a vat of acid in the basement under a trap door! Huh?! And, later, someone trips into it! Pretty clumsy, huh?! As far as the acting goes, it's not especially inspiring. Price is amazingly restrained in his performance--and I really wished he'd acted with a little more energy. Most of the rest of the actors were okay, though Elisha Cook should have been a tad embarrassed for his over-acting--he really was quite silly.Overall, the film is mediocre and very skip-able unless you are a huge Price fan.",House on Haunted Hill
1,TheLittleSongbird,Spooky fun with Vincent Price,8,24 July 2012,"Okay, I do think that Vincent Price has done better overall movies(Theater of Blood, Abominable Dr Phibes and Witchfinder General). But I cannot deny that as always, coming from someone who was supreme in this film genre at this particular time, he is brilliant with a charismatic presence and great deadpan delivery that will give you chills and excitement at the same time. He is well supported by Carol Ohmart, Alan Marshal, Richard Long and especially Elisha Cook Jnr, who plays the paranoid drunk with real exuberance. There are many other joys to House on Haunted Hill than the cast. I for one love the Gothic production values, as well as the suitably creepy atmosphere, haunting music and witty script that is in perfect keeping with the tone of the horror movies of the time. The story apart from the short length and one or two meandering subplots is very clever with some memorable moments such as decapitated heads, witches and acid vats as well as a fun twist. All in all, spooky slick fun with a great atmosphere and performance from a genre icon. 8/10 Bethany Cox",House on Haunted Hill
2,bkoganbing,"Food, Drink, and Murder",5,6 September 2012,"House On Haunted Hill is a great example of a talented cast putting over something that has very little substance to it. Vincent Price is an eccentric millionaire who with his wife Carol Ohmart throws a party where five ostensible strangers are invited and offered $10,000.00 to stay the night. Not his house mind you, but a comfortable out mansion that's just a bit haunted.One of the guests Elisha Cook has a connection to the house, a couple of his relations got murdered there. In fact seven murders occurred there in the past. The other guests are Richard Long, Carolyn Craig, Julie Mitchum and Alan Marshal.It's emphasized how much of a cash flow problem these randomly selected guests have. Otherwise if someone offers you that kind of money for one night's stay in any house, most of us would know there was a bad gimmick attached and would flee from that offer.In the end though it's proved that some guests are not random and some have some really human motives for the events that take place.House On Haunted Hill was made on the cheap and does not have the gore that a lot of Vincent Price movies have. This film was made at the beginning of the horror cycle of Price's career. It's a great tribute to his talent that it could frighten as it did.",House on Haunted Hill
3,Leofwine_draca,Ghoulish fun,8,4 August 2016,"They don't make 'em like this anymore. More's the pity, as William Castle's cheap and cheerful little spine-chiller is camp entertainment all the way. The budget is low, but Castle makes the best of his small location by filling it with macabre gags: a bloody severed head in a suitcase, a wraith of an old woman who slides around, a body hanging from a noose. These shocks are all served up in the best, nostalgia-ridden time-honoured tradition, with plenty of shrieks and screams as Castle derives maximum terror from each of the slight supernatural occurrences that he builds up.As an added bonus, horror star Vincent Price is cast in the lead role of Frederick Loren, a demented joker with plenty of tricks up his sleeves. Price is at his campest, jovial best here when talking sinisterly with his ""amusing"" wife, who has thrown the party. It turns out that his darling has tried to poison him on at least one occasion - but she makes out it's the other way round to a gullible guest (then again, what red-blooded male wouldn't fall for her charms?). The role seems to have been written for Price, either that or he just naturally fits it like a glove, and I really couldn't imagine any other actor in the role.Fleshing out the cast are Carol Ohmart as the lovely but devious wife, Alan Marshal as a stern doctor who hides some terrible secrets, and Richard Long as the young dashing hero. Only Long comes off badly - but his role is a poorly-written one, with much time taken up with indecision and a lack of action. Elisha Cook Jr. (who appeared again with Price in Corman's THE HAUNTED PALACE) enjoys himself as a spaced-out drunk who regales us with stories of murder and death, and it's a role he would essentially play in most of his latter-day films. The casting directors duly noted: if you needed an old-time and comical drunk, Elisha Cook was your man.Okay, so the direction is strictly by the book and the plot rather simplistic, but Castle concentrated here on the gimmicks of which he was so fond - this was the film where his infamous 'Emergo' came into play (a rubber glow-in-the-dark skeleton sailed past cinema-goers at a vital moment in the action). The opening of the film is a spooky masterpiece - disembodied heads introduce the cast and tell tall stories while screams and chains rattle in the darkness. And the best effect of all is saved until the end, where a woman is attacked by a ghostly skeleton which pushes her into an acid bath! It all turns out to be Price's work, as he's rigged up the skeleton as a puppet - although you're required to suspend disbelief in his fantastic mechanism. This skeleton moment is the highlight of a richly entertaining film, delightfully old-fashioned and catered for the kid in all of us. A remake followed in 1999 but obviously there's no substitute for Castle or Price. Just sit back, dim the lights and enjoy!",House on Haunted Hill
4,SnoopyStyle,campy old horror,5,24 July 2018,"Wealthy Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) invites five strangers to a party for his wife Annabelle in a haunted house. He offers them $10k each to stay the night.This has both Vincent Price and a terrific B-horror premise. The first scare attempt comes from a ridiculous creepy dummy. I laughed when the dummy is rolled across the floor. The special effects are in its infancy. It's all campy done seriously. I can't really endorse this. The acting is stiff. I don't care about the character. The only actor I recognize is Price and he's a charismatic co-star. After the initial chuckle at its campiness, it becomes a bore since I don't care anybody or anything in this. It's an old classic with which I don't have anything memorable to take away.",House on Haunted Hill
5,Hitchcoc,What Fun This Was in Its Time,8,28 March 2006,"There's something to be said for a society that could be scared much more easily than they are now. These late fifties and early sixties horror movies always filled the bill. There was always a hand reaching from behind a curtain to touch a young lady's shoulder, there was always a room where we shouldn't go, there was always Vincent Price. In addition to the introductions at the beginning which I love, especially Elisha Cook, there are all the dark wonderings put forth for us to chew on. Right on cue, something would make us jump, a few minutes would pass, and there it was again. I remember when skulls and skeletons could drive anyone to hysterics. They are tame now; we want more gore, dismemberment, disfigurement. This is a nicely paced mystery story. It could be pretty average but for Price's consistently eerie presence. He is so pained all the time. I imagine he has been seen as the villain in almost every film in which he appears, but we always wonder. The young woman in this movie supplies enough screams for everyone, and well she should. She seems to be the one that is being used over and over. We have the handsome Richard Long who is consistently skeptical as his young romantic lead tells him story after story. She is being set up to shoot Vincent. And then the house, which looks from the outside like a sports museum, has the secrets. Cook keeps reminding us that seven have been killed. He is an absolute mess but we need someone to keep the ghostly element involved. Did anyone think it might be a good idea to do something about that vat of acid in the basement. Did anyone stay in their rooms when all mayhem was breaking out. It doesn't matter because this movie is what it is. A spook show for a Friday night in the late fifties.",House on Haunted Hill
6,claudio_carvalho,A Classic Horror Movie,8,10 April 2004,"In 1959, the eccentric millionaire Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) and his fifth wife Annabelle Loren (Carol Ohmart) invite five different persons to a party in a house considered haunted by evil spirits. They are locked in the house at midnight by the house keepers, and who stays alive in the next morning will share US$ 50,000.00. Along the scary night, dark secrets are revealed, in a story with a very surprising end. This classic horror movie is excellent. Although being a low budget movie with only 75 min. running time, the story is great and the sound effects and the black and white photography contribute for the fearful atmosphere. I do not recall how many times this storyline has been copied. In Brazil, there is a new distributor (London Films) specialized in horror movies. I bought many titles on DVDs, which have never been previously released, and now I am going to have the chance to watch films like `The Wicker Man', `Black Sabbath - The Three Faces of Fear', `Possession', `Black Sunday (The Mask of Satan)' and others. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil: `A Casa dos Maus Espíritos' (`The House of Bad Spirits')",House on Haunted Hill
7,mark.waltz,"Unless you're a ghost, you're toast!",7,2 March 2017,"The laughs and chills come a mile a minute in this tongue in cheek haunted house film so filled with gimmicks that you can't imagine the writers not laughing as they put it all down on paper. Vincent Price, a horror film legend, joins forces with Elisha Cook Jr., a film noir legend, along with Price's obviously gold digging wife (Carol Ohlmart), host a party at the house owned by Cook and rented by Price. Richard Long and Carolyn Craig, two of the guests, search the house, and each of them have frightening moments, but never when the other one is around. The funniest one is spotted by Craig, a floating witch like creature who appears out of nowhere at the most inopportune moments. Those of the chosen guests who make it through the night alive get $10,000 from Price, not without objection from the greedy Ohlmart. You have to watch this straight through without interruption in order to find all the thrills. They pop up unexpectedly, resulting in a sudden scream followed by laughter in response. At least that is how I rescued, certainly not the characters, especially scream queen Craig. Price takes the part seriously with a glint in his eye revealing that he's having a blast making it. Cook, insisting that there have been brutal murders even long before he was given the house, is pathetic looking and thus fantastic as the horror increases.But this is a William Castle film and thus is filled with delicious gimmicks. This was the first of his films to utilize this tactic, perfected in ""The Tingler"" and ""Thirteen Ghosts"". It's obvious from the start who the guilty party(s) are/most likely are, but certain details are dropped that will keep you guessing. While the exposition gets a little talky at times and slows it down, it's never for long. And in regards to the leading man, where there's Vincent, you know that the Price is right!",House on Haunted Hill
8,nogodnomasters,It's too late now,10,22 September 2017,"This is an old classic available on nearly every old horror film multi-pack in various restored conditioned.A ""party"" is being held and 5 strangers are invited to spend the night with a reward of $10,000 in 1959 dollars. It is hosted by Vincent Price and his wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart). Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig) is set up as the ""Final Girl"" except that formula didn't exist. Special effects include doors closing by themselves, still used today in found footage films. It also has a floating head effect using a black background, common in 50's films. The sound track would be considered over-the-top camp by today's standards, but how else can you make this stuff scary? The feature includes Elisha Cook Jr., who would later defend Capt. Kirk when he was accused of neglect in the death of Finney. He always creates a great character. TV star Richard Long had the classic slick ""Brylcreem"" hair of the era with a big part on the left side, a style I was forced to wear until adulthood...scarred for life. Worth the flashback.",House on Haunted Hill
9,classicsoncall,"""Remember the fun we had when you poisoned me?""",7,4 September 2005,"Though Vincent Price had a long and varied career, most horror film fans will know him by a trio of movies from the late 1950's - ""The Bat"" (1959), ""The Fly"" (1958), and this one - ""House on Haunted Hill"". When I first saw this film shortly after it's original release, it gave me the heebie jeebies for a week, especially having seen it alone in the dark. Today it doesn't affect the same response, but still, it's got a lot going for it and is a well written, creepy and atmospheric drama in which Price and a host of characters are given a chance to shine.The opening set up is quite classy - Elisha Cook's character Watson Pritchard is the owner of the house, and he snares the viewer with an immediate hook; seven violent murders have taken place in the house including his own brother. Price is Frederick Loren, the current resident, an eccentric millionaire who offers five people seemingly chosen at random, ten thousand dollars each if they can survive a night in the house. Pritchard, an alcoholic, doesn't let up throughout the film, he insists that dire consequences will occur - ""Only the ghosts in this house are glad we're here."" The film's first real fright catches you off guard, as Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig) examines an empty room, she suddenly turns into the haggardly face of the home's female caretaker, though we don't know that yet at this point. It's the kind of face you would make if you were trying to scare your little sister coming downstairs in the dark - funny but effective. There are other subtle events that keep you guessing, all done with an effective purpose and not just for shock value, a rarity in today's films. One of the better ones makes use of a thick rope that crawls it's way toward lead screamer Nora, but this time she's speechless, fixated on the ghostly image of Loren's wife Annabelle floating outside a window.The relationship between Loren and his wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart) makes up a key plot element in the story. It's no secret that they share a tense relationship, Loren the jealous husband, and she the one willing to stick it out for a huge inheritance once he's met his demise. As the grim party of five come to believe that Loren is out to kill her or one of them, they all agree to remain in their rooms till morning to stay safe. Yeah, right! Now wouldn't it have made more sense for all of them just to stay in one room all together? But then, no murder, mystery or mayhem.The movie is peppered with some great lines, and Price's character gets his share. Commenting on his marriage, he offers - ""What husband hasn't at one time wanted to kill his wife?"" But my personal favorite, and you'll have to see the film for it's proper context, is ""Do you really think there WAS a head in her suitcase?"" Other clever elements are inserted as well, the coffin party favors with a handgun for each guest is a neat touch. Then there's the basement, a veritable fun house replete with a floor vat filled with poison acid. It's a real treat to see how Vincent Price literally ""pulls the strings"" of this murder mystery whodonit in the film's finale.Observation: freeze frame a close up of Carol Ohmart in her role as Mrs. Loren - doesn't she resemble what a mature Paris Hilton might look like? ""House on Haunted Hill"" remains on my yearly must see list, I'm sure you'll have fun with it too. Your thoughts will echo that of Elisha Cook's closing words - ""They're coming for me now, and then they'll come for you.""",House on Haunted Hill
10,gavin6942,Castle and Price Make the Perfect Pair,8,6 October 2012,"Eccentric millionaire Fredrick Loren (Vincent Price) and his fourth wife, Annabelle (Carol Ohmart), have invited five people to the house on Haunted Hill for a ""haunted house"" party...The concept itself is rather gimmicky, as is the standard William Castle fare (and the same for his trusty script writer, Robb White). But it works -- oh it works. You might even say the plot is a variation on the ""Ten Little Indians"" story, with you never knowing who is going to survive in this isolated location.While the draw of the film as far as actors go is clearly Price, two others are worth singling out. Richard Long provides the good looks of a B-movie actor. Although forgotten today, following this film he became something of a TV star on the shows ""Big Valley"" and ""Nanny and the Professor"". Long does a fine job playing the story's hero (if there is one) and semi-romantic interest. Sadly, he had a heart attack at age 47.Watson Pritchard (played by Elisha Cook) is the strongest character, going through a broad range of fear and drunkenness. Cook was a character actor for decades, making his mark in ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941) and never slowing down. Pritchard could easily be considered among his best performances. Carol Ohmart will be familiar to horror fans from ""Spider Baby"".Historian Steve Haberman thinks this is William Castle's best film, and believes that as Castle's budgets increased, his films decreased in quality. This is a highly controversial statement, though perhaps not entirely incorrect. Haberman thinks this role was the one that made Vincent Price famous to audiences. Perhaps. He had already done ""House of Wax"" and ""The Fly"", but were either as big as this?The film has unfortunately fallen into public domain, as copies are readily available, and most of them rather blurry. The Netflix version could definitely use an improved picture and sound. This version seems to be the same one lampooned by RiffTrax. Fortunately, Scream Factory has included it in their second Vincent Price box set, looking and sounding quite nice, with plenty of supplementary features, including an audio commentary with film historian Steve Haberman (which is informative, albeit not overly insightful). As of 2014, this is easily the definitive version to own.",House on Haunted Hill
11,lee_eisenberg,I'd stay in that house,10,1 August 2005,"I guess that it's debatable whether or not Vincent Price was the greatest horror star ever, but ""House on Haunted Hill"" certainly suggests so. He plays Frederick Loren, who is offering five people $10,000 each to stay in a possibly haunted mansion overnight. Part of the deal is that no one is allowed to leave. To complicate matters, his wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart) appears to have some slimy plans up her sleeve. Meanwhile, one of the guests, Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook, Jr), is adamant about telling the other guests of the evil things that happened in the mansion (""This is where the girl was found. Whatever got her wasn't human!""). As you might imagine, things get progressively weirder and creepier for the guests as the night drags on.1959 may have been the annus mirabilis for both Vincent Price and William Castle, as they collaborated on this movie and also ""The Tingler"". Some people may classify ""House on Haunted Hill"" as another one of the horror movies that dominated '50s cinema, but I beg to differ. This movie is Americana, far more than apple pie or baseball. It's not just that these sorts of movies were a life-saving alternative to the ""family fun"". They WERE the '50s: 100% campy and 100% lovable at the same time.So are you ready to stay at this house?",House on Haunted Hill
12,jboothmillard,House on Haunted Hill,6,29 January 2013,"I had not seen many classic scary movies with the actor with the voice featuring in Michael Jackson's Thriller or an appearance in Edward Scissorhands, only Witchfinder General, so I was keen to see one, especially with a catchy title like this one, so when I got the opportunity I watched it with interest. Basically eccentric millionaire Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) has invited five strangers, who he personally knows in some way, to a party he is putting on for his wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart), he is throwing it in a secluded mansion, and he has offered each of the people $10,000 to spend one night in the house thought to be haunted. These five strangers, Lance Schroeder (Richard Long), Dr. David Trent (Alan Marshal), Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig), Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook Jr.) and Ruth Bridgers (Julie Mitchum), who all arrive in funeral cars, are all told that they can leave before the stroke of midnight, but all the doors and windows have been barred and secured, so there is no means of escape once they are locked in, and if they stay and survive the entire night they will each be paid $10,000. Loren also explains about the rumours of the ghosts that haunt the mansion, and he gives each of the people a pistol to defend themselves, but Annabelle tries to convince them all that he is psychotic, they all grow suspicious of him and are naturally very nervy about the house. Nora quickly becomes terrified and fearful for her life as she sees what looks like mysterious ghouls and the doors and walls make loud noises, and she is not interested in staying in the house, even for the money, but the people are trapped when the doors have been locked before the start time. The big shock comes though when Annabelle is found dead having hanged herself above the staircase, so everyone is told to return to their rooms until the morning and keep themselves safe, Lance wants to help Nora as much as he can, but she thinks that Loren wants to kill her and the others. It turns out though that Annabelle is not dead, and has been planning with Dr. Trent to make someone kill her husband so that she can get her hands on his fortune, obviously hysterical Nora is the obvious person that could shoot her, and sure enough she does mistaking him for one of the ghosts she thinks she is seeing. Dr. Trent tries to dispose of the body of Loren in the acid pit in the basement, where a body will melt until only the bones are left, but the lights go out, and both men disappear, and when Annabelle appears she sees a skeleton emerge from the vat, but all of the sudden thought the skeleton rises and the voice of Loren is heard, she recoils in terror and accidentally backs off and falls into the acid, and the real Loren comes out of the darkness, he was controlling the skeleton which is the body of Dr. Trent. Nora thinking she killed him takes all the guests to the basement, and Loren explains the whole night was to stop his wife killing him for his money, and all the guns were loaded with blanks, but paranoid drunk house keeper Pritchard looks terrified and announces that the ghosts are coming for them. Also starring Leona Anderson as Mrs. Slydes, Howard Hoffman as Jonas and Skeleton as Himself (LOL that is genuinely a name in the cast). Price with his indelible voice and charismatic personality gives a zesty performance as the man trying to scare his guests, Cook Jr. plays the paranoid drunk very well, and the other players are fine as well, the film is filled with obviously camp and old fashioned tactics to scare the audience, with decapitated heads, witches and an acid vat, but this only adds to the fun, and there are some genuinely spooky and jumpy moments to keep you satisfied, a terrific horror. Good!",House on Haunted Hill
13,Woodyanders,William Castle's single most delightful fright feature,9,30 April 2008,"Suave, but eccentric millionaire Frederic Loren (the great Vincent Price in peak smoothly ingratiating form) invites five complete strangers to a creepy old house for a special birthday party he's holding for his faithless and treacherous wife Annabelle (an exquisitely bitchy Carol Ohmart). If the motley quintet of folks survive the night, they will be paid $10,000 each for their troubles. Director William Castle, working from a clever and inspired script by Robb White, relates the absorbing story at a steady pace and does a sound job of creating a suitably eerie atmosphere. Moreover, Castle plays the material straight and keeps a serious tone throughout; he also adds a welcome sense of wickedly sardonic humor and adds a downright infectious feeling of pure fun to the enjoyably uncanny proceedings (you gotta love the freaky old lady on roller skates and the hokey, but cool walking skeleton). The sharp dialogue crackles with barbed wit (favorite line: ""Darling, the only ghoul in the house is you"") and the double twist surprise ending is a doozy. This film further benefits from excellent acting from a tip-top cast: Although Price clearly dominates the picture with his commanding presence, he nonetheless receives fine support from Richard Long as gallant test pilot Lance Shroeder, Alan Marshal as skeptical psychiatrist Dr. David Trent, Carolyn Craig as the sweet, fetching Nora Manning, Julie Mitchum as washed-up newspaper columnist Ruth Bridgers, and, best of all, the always terrific Elisha Cook, Jr. as the house's timid'n'twitchy scaredy cat owner Watson Pritchard. Carl E. Guthrie's crisp black and white cinematography and Von Dextor's rousing ooga-booga shivery'n'shuddery score add immensely to the macabre merriment. A total treat.",House on Haunted Hill

15,Tweekums,Who will survive a night at the 'world's most haunted house'?,8,6 October 2018,"As this film opens Watson Pritchard tells the viewer that he owns the world's most haunted house; the site of seven gruesome murders, including his wife. Then millionaire Frederick Loren tells us that he has invited five people, including Prichard, to spend the night in the house; anybody who does so will get $10,000. As the guests arrive we are introduced to each of them. Almost as soon as they get there strange things happen; a heavy door swings shut and a chandelier falls from the roof. Once Loren has introduced himself the group take a tour of the house; Prichard points out some of the sites of unpleasant murders. Also present is Loren's wife, whose idea the party was. Things escalate with Nora Manning, a young typist, appearing to be particularly targeted. At midnight the doors are locked; nobody can leave till morning. The real scares are about to begin.This is an enjoyably haunted house chiller. The opening sets the scene nicely so the viewer is ready to be scared when creepy things start to happen. The introduction to the various characters is equally effective, giving the viewer a chance to try to figure out who is likely to die first and who may survive. The scares are fairly mild by modern standards but still fun. There are plenty of possible explanations for the events; the house is really haunted, one or more of the group is behind them or there is somebody unidentified in the house. As soon as one theory seems most likely something happens suggesting something else. The actual reason isn't too obvious although one is at least likely to consider it as a possibility. The setting is suitably creepy and the cast is solid. Vincent Price stands out but there are also notable performances from Elisha Cook, as Prichard; Carol Ohmart as Annabelle Loren and Carolyn Craig as Nora Manning. The special effects obviously show their age a bit but are still quite fun. Overall I'd certainly recommend this fun little chiller even if it is unlikely to really scare anybody these days.",House on Haunted Hill

17,BA_Harrison,A fun but very far-fetched haunted house horror.,6,18 October 2010,"Director William Castle is known for the crazy gimmicks that he concocted to help promote his horror movies; for House on Haunted Hill, he devised 'Emergo', where an inflatable glow in the dark skeleton on a wire would be suspended over the audience during the film's finale. This type of ridiculous cinematic showmanship sums up the entire film for me: it's undeniably a lot of fun, but perhaps a little too preposterous for it's own good.Castle's characters are well defined, his cast is excellent (particularly Vincent Price and Carol Ohmart as the film's bickering married couple), the dialogue is witty, there are some solid scares, and the multitude of genre clichés that proliferate House on Haunted Hill are guaranteed to put a smile on the face of any fan of spooky movies—we get a secret room accessed by a sliding panel, an acid pit in the cellar, a pair of creepy caretakers who look after the house, and all manner of things that go bump in the night—but as entertaining as all of this is, it can't quite make up for the completely implausible nature of the plot, which doesn't just require its audience to suspend disbelief, but to disregard logic entirely.As amusing as it is to see a creepy old hag float silently past the film's petrified heroine, a corpse levitating outside a first floor window, or a walking skeleton slowly advancing on the villain of the piece, if it doesn't all add up by the end (which it most certainly doesn't), then I can't help but feel a little cheated.",House on Haunted Hill
18,moonspinner55,Hokey hysteria; fun if approached in the proper spirit...,6,21 October 2007,"Vincent Price, with the fabulous name of Frederick Loren, invites a disparate group of people to his spooky estate, offering each of them $10,000 if they can withstand one night of his (rather juvenile) demented tricks. Reconceived (poorly) in 1999 as a full-throttle horror show, this version was probably meant to be scary but today can be viewed as ghoulish camp, light on its feet and mindlessly enjoyable. William Castle production was originally released in ""Emergo"", a gimmick that set loose a skeleton above the theater audience. Fun for enthusiasts, and featuring a colorful supporting cast including cult-actress Carol Ohmart as Price's wife, Elisha Cook, Jr. and a very green Richard Long. **1/2 from ****",House on Haunted Hill
19,JohnHowardReid,One for Castle fans!,8,28 September 2015,"It's scary! The movie cost producer/director William Castle $150,000 to make. In its initial USA engagements, it grossed no less than $3,000,000. Admittedly, Castle spent more on advertising (over $350,000 to be exact) than he did on the movie, but it must be admitted that by his usual rather basic, humble standards, this movie is extremely well directed. Well acted too, particularly by the lovely Carolyn Craig as Nora Manning (Carolyn was very much similar to this character in real life. In fact, I liked the name, Manning, so much that I gave it to my detective character, Merryll Manning). All the players, indeed, are well cast – even Elisha Cook doesn't out-stay his welcome – and Vincent Price, of course, is absolutely priceless as both narrator and main character. Available on a superb Legend Films DVD in both its original black-and-white and a most effective colorized version.",House on Haunted Hill

Frights and thrills fill the night as nerves are put on edge and the guest's (sic) secrets start coming to light,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.Vincent Price (as Loren) wouldn't need to spend $10,000 for many overnight guests in real life; because, the man is simply too entertaining to deny. Mr. Price, and gimmickry director William Castle, make the movie enjoyable. Writer Robb White contributes some clever dialogue. Of the guests, Elisha Cook, Jr. (as Watson Pritchard) seems to be having the most fun. Carol Ohmart (as Annabelle Loren) and Richard Long (as Lance Schroeder) are in fine form.

21,BandSAboutMovies,Make your own Emergo!,4,6 February 2020,"William Castle is one of my heroes. While he isn't a world-class director, he was a top of the line showman. His book Step Right Up!...I'm Going to Scare the Pants off America is required reading. You can also check out the great documentary Spine Tingler! The William Castle story to learn more.One of his gimmicks that he used to sell his movies was called Emergo. As theaters played this movie, an elaborate pulley system released a plastic skeleton that would fly across the presumably horrified - or amused and even rancorous - audience.This movie ended up being a huge success. Alfred Hitchcock - who Castle often imitated in movies like Homicidal - took and made his own low-budget horror film. You've probably seen it. It's called Psycho.It's such a simple set up: Frederick Loren (the always awesome Vincent Price, whose line in this movie ""It's close to midnight"" starts off the Michael Jackson song ""Thriller,"" a track on which he also appears) is an eccentric millionaire - is there any better kind? - who invites five people to a party for his fourth wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart, Spider Baby) in an allegedly haunted house.If any of these people can survive one night, they get $10,000. They include test pilot Lance Schroeder (Richard Long, who was the professor on Nanny and the Professor), newspaper columnist Ruth Bridges (Julie Mitchum, yes the sister of Robert), psychiatrist Dr. David Trent (Alan Marshal in his next to last film; the actor Marshal died two years later from a heart attack while appearing in Chicago with Mae West in a production of her play Sextette. He had a heart attack on stage but finished the performance. The show, as they say, must go on...), Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig, probably best known for this movie) and Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook, Mr. Nicklas from Rosemary's Baby).The only thing that these strangers have is that they all need money. The Lorens also hate one another and are convinced that they are trying to kill one another. And for what it's worth, Watson believes that the house is genuinely haunted by the ghosts of those murdered there, including his brother. There's also a vat of acid in the basement that was used to kill the previous owner's wife.So is the house truly haunted? Is Annabelle trying to kill her husband Frederick? Who will survive? And how cool would it have been to have seen this movie in person with a giant skeleton bursting loose at the right moment?House On Haunted Hill was filmed at the Ennis House in Los Feliz California, which was designed in 1924 by Frank Lloyd Wright. It also appears in the movie Blade Runner and was the mansion that Angel, Spike, and Drusilla lived in on the TV version of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It was also used on the soap opera show within a show Invitation to Love on David Lynch's Twin Peaks.This was remade in 1999 and that film also had a 2007 sequel, Return to House on Haunted Hill.One last bit of trivia: The theme song to this movie actually has lyrics! They are:""There's a house on Haunted Hill / Where ev'rything's lonely and still / Lonely and still / And the ghost of a sigh / When we whispered good-bye / Lingers on / And each night gives a heart broken cry / There's a house on Haunted Hill / Where love walked there's a strange silent chill / Strange silent chill / There are mem'ries that yearn / For our hearts to return / And a promise we failed to fulfill / But we'll never go back / No, we'll never go back / To the house on Haunted Hill!""",House on Haunted Hill
22,Coventry,Spooky fun presented by cinema's most sinister host,8,25 January 2005,"Excellent entertainment! There's no better way to describe William Castle's campiest achievement. With as good as no budget and no groundbreaking techniques at all, he delivered the ultimate in mindless fun. An utterly simple premise, decorated with a few tricks and of course the starring of the greatest horror actor of all time suffice to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film. Like no other actor could ever pull it off, the charismatic Vincent Price stars as an unscrupulous millionaire who, seemly random, invited five people to spend the night in his haunted mansion. Each of them is promised 10.000 dollars for it, but then they have to survive the night between ghosts and ghouls in the house that previously killed seven people already. Tiny details, like Price's snappy relationship with his fourth (!) wife or the presence of a paranoid guest who already lost some family members in the house only increase the intrigue and fun charm of this timeless genre classic. The visual effects are weak (I've seen films from the 30's that had better effects) but tension and atmosphere are nevertheless created by sudden spooky appearances, morbid set pieces and a decent implementation of sound effects. Biggest reason to see this ""House on Haunted Hill"", however, remains Vincent Price. It's nearly impossible to determine the best performance from his glorious oeuvre (The Witchfinder General, The Abominable Dr. Phibes, The Pit and the Pendulum, House of Wax), but it's pretty clear that he had a great time playing this particular role. With a never before seen virtuosity, Price is showing the ickiest grimaces and firing off the most wicked one-liners (""Don't stay up all night thinking about ways to get rid of meit makes wrinkles. The plot twist near the end is somewhat lame, though. And it's too bad that the film isn't a bit longer (read: a higher body count). Still, ""House"" is a must for horror fanatics. It's unbelievably cheap and eccentric, but also at least ten times scarier than the 1999 remake.",House on Haunted Hill

24,hitchcockthelegend,There's been a murder almost every place in this house!,7,21 May 2011,"House on Haunted Hill is directed by William Castle and written by Robb White. It stars Vincent Price, Carol Ohmart, Richard Long, Alan Marshal, Carolyn Craig, Elisha Cook Jr. and Julie Mitchum. Von Dexter scores the music and Carl E. Guthrie is the cinematographer.Eccentric millionaire Fredrick Loren (Price) and his latest wife, Annabelle (Ohmart), have invited 5 people to their house on Haunted Hill for a party. They have each been dangled a financial carrot, whoever will stay in the house for one night will earn ten thousand dollars. But doing so will not be easy, because once midnight arrives they are trapped in the house, alone with each other, the ghosts and other unknown terrors.As the 1950's headed into its final straight, William Castle seized upon the idea to reinvigorate the horror genre with creepy films and cheapo gimmicks. Not all of his horror output was worthy of praise, but in the main they have a nostalgic value that's hard to ignore. There's also a few of them that are genuinely good movies, films that whilst not capable of making you shriek in terror, have a gentle disquiet about them. One such film is House on Haunted Hill, camp and at times funny, it still makes for a creepy night in by the fire with all the lights turned off. Price is great, very regal like and imposing in presence. The rest of the cast may not come up to his standard, but he alone makes the trip to see the film worth it. Dexter's music is suitably ""haunted house"" like and Guthrie's photography thrives on shadowy atmospherics. There's also a couple of genuine ""boo jump"" moments, and at its core is solid ""who is doing it"" mystery. It didn't raise the bar for 50's horror, it did, however, keep the flame alight for it. 7/10",House on Haunted Hill
25,Theo Robertson,The Icebox Effect,6,15 July 2010,"I first saw this when ITV used to broadcast their "" Don't Watch Alone "" season . This would involve an old monochrome horror film being shown at 11pm on a Friday . With hindsight they were rubbish but to a young imaginative mind they were terrifying and HOHH was the scariest one of the lot . One scene that put my hair on end was the scene where a character taps on the wall only for a blind woman to appear in the frame . My dad had to reassure me that the blind woman was in fact a dummy a fact reflected in the way the woman left the room ( Obviously pulled along on a rope ) seemed to make the scene more unearthly and petrifying not less . It's certainly a film that gave me nightmares Seeing it again it's not something that's going to give anyone the shivers . In its favour it does have atmosphere but the scary setpieces are surrounded by lots of long talkative scenes . What really let's the film down to a critical adult audience is the unlikely plot . It's effectively a film of intrigue and setting up the perfect murder but what this involves is someone doing something to someone at a certain location at a certain time also ensuring that no one else is around to witness events . It's one of these things that whilst working in cinematic convention would never EVER succeed in reality because there's too many variables and outside factors concerned . Alfred Hitchcock described this as "" The Icebox Effect "" where the audience watches a film thinking "" Wow that's clever "" , go to the fridge to get another beer out of the icebox and then as they pull the ring they suddenly get hit by realisation that things are contrived rather than complex or clever",House on Haunted Hill
26,Hey_Sweden,The party doesn't start until Price walks in.,7,23 October 2020,"One of the most famous shockers from master showman William Castle, the original ""House on Haunted Hill"" stars that wonderful Master of the Macabre, Mr. Vincent Price. He plays Frederick Loren, an eccentric millionaire who invites five people to an old spook house for an offbeat type of party. The place is infested with spirits, according to its owner Watson Pritchard (that great Old Hollywood character actor, Elisha Cook Jr.), and Frederick and his 4th wife Annabelle (lovely Carol Ohmart) are determined to show their guests a ghoulish time. Frederick even gives the guests loaded guns as party favours.While this viewer could understand how some people might find ""House on Haunted Hill"" to be disappointing, the truth is it IS a delight during its best moments. Castle and company (including frequent collaborator, screenwriter Robb White) place their tongues in their cheeks while offering some nice ""gotcha"" moments. (Leona Anderson, playing Mrs. Slydes, figures in one of the most delicious jump scares in all of horror cinema.). It can be light on horror elements part of the time, as the guests assess their situation and try to take proactive steps. That said, with a minimum of main characters, it makes the proceedings feel more intimate.The cast is rounded out by Richard Long, as affable pilot Lance Schroeder, Alan Marshal, as suspicious psychiatrist Dr. David Trent, Julie Mitchum (Roberts' older sister), as gambling addict Ruth Bridgers, and pretty Carolyn Craig as the bedevilled young Nora Manning, who's obliged to do so much hysterical screaming that it may annoy some of you. This selection of actors & actresses is very capable, but horror icon Price dominates much of the film with his effortless charisma and great line delivery. He and Ohmart have some snappy give-and-take in their early scene together.In its time, it was notable for its ""flying skeleton"" gimmick (Castle never let a good gimmick go to waste) that was dubbed ""Emergo"". This is a really fun moment to watch, and it's too bad that Castles' brand of showmanship is not seen anymore. The score (by another Castle collaborator, Von Dexter), production design, and cinematography are all first-rate.Followed by a remake 40 years later.Seven out of 10.",House on Haunted Hill

Despite the fact that it features VINCENT PRICE as an eccentric millionaire who challenges a flock of guests to spend the night in his haunted mansion (and survive), it's got all the flavor of amateur night with performances ranging from bad to really bad.Of course, the title alone is enough to encourage some viewers to think they'll get some real scares--but it's a title that never lives up to the promise of something really haunting. Instead, we have chandeliers crashing, heads turning up in boxes, and some foaming vat of acid bubbling in the cellar while the guests lurk around in such stupid fashion that they seem to deserve their grisly fates.Unworthy of Vincent Price, an actor who did do a number of good horror films.

Everybody who likes this has fond memories of seeing it AS A KID. I never saw it a kid only now as an adult so I don't have childhood memories clouding my judgment. The script makes little sense, the dialogue is boring and all the characters are clichéd.

31,Bunuel1976,"HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL (William Castle, 1959) ***",7,27 April 2014,"In view of the fact that the film under review and THE BUSY BODY (1967) were going to be the only films of centenary celebrant William Castle which I had watched but not written specifically about (since I was not yet into the habit of doing so when I did many years ago), I decided to do something I have not done in ages: revisit movies I was already familiar with! Apart from being Castle's sophomore (and far more successful) effort in his newly-found vocation as a gimmicky schlock- meister, it was also one of Horror movie icon Vincent Price's earliest stints in the genre he would soon grow to become most associated with for the rest of his prolific career.For some reason, the copyright of this popular Allied Artists production – which should have made it the exclusive property of Warner Home Video – was allowed to lapse into Public Domain and there have been dozens of DVD editions of it over the years (apart from the legitimate one from WHV, that is) including computer-colorized versions that are also available in their entirety on ""You Tube""! As for myself, my first viewing of the film came via a triple-feature DVD rental – along with the Boris Karloff vehicle THE GHOUL (1933) and Roger Corman's A BUCKET OF BLOOD (1959) – that I later managed to own a copy of, while this revisit came via a pristine, anamorphic, high-definition print courtesy of ""You Tube""Although the only other recognizable names in the cast were handsome former second lead Alan Marshal (as a shady psychiatrist) and ubiquitous diminutive character actor Elisha Cook, Jr. (as the drunken, doom-laden current owner of the titular abode), eccentric millionaire Price is matched in the acting stakes by his duplicitous on screen partner, fourth wife Carol Ohmart; the obligatory romantic second leads then are left in the shaky hands of Richard Long (who gets bumped on the head at one point) and Carolyn Craig (who gets to scream her head off when meeting all kinds of scary mischief during her tenure). Anyway, the film is perhaps the most popular of Castle's work in this vein – being a trim and fun ride, ably mixing the chills with a tongue- in-cheek attitude that really evokes the ""old dark house""-type films of long past (and which both Price and Castle would return to, much less effectively, in the disappointing 1959 and 1963 remakes of THE BAT and THE OLD DARK HOUSE respectively). Incidentally, since the central setting is supposedly haunted – which should make the title HAUNTED HOUSE ON THE HILL(!) – it renders Castle's subsequent and already lame 13 GHOSTS (1960) even more redundant!!; still, the phantoms never really show up heresince the curiously floating ""ghoul"" that does appear – which provides the film with its single biggest scare and which was imitated in last year's haunted house blockbuster THE CONJURING! – is actually the aged caretaker, while other apparitions and monstrosities emerge to be man-made creations in the long run!!Indeed, while the film plays like a campier (Castle has the 'floating heads' of Cook and Price introduce the history of the place and the party invitees respectively at the very start) retread of older, hokey ""haunted house"" properties, it also anticipates the ""dare"" factor present at the outset of Antonio Margheriti's CASTLE OF BLOOD (1964) and its colour remake WEB OF THE SPIDER (1970) – in which it was Edgar Allan Poe who was making the wager! – and the ""scientific"" aspect prevalent in Robert Wise's overrated THE HAUNTING (1963) all down the line to the aforementioned THE CONJURING itself. Needless to say, the genial director cooked up a doozy of a gimmick – dubbed ""Emergo"" in this instance – for the original theatrical screenings of his picture where a yellowish skeleton is raised and floated about above the heads of the audience during the climactic sequence in which the real villains of the piece are getting their own (somewhat unconvincing) comeuppance on screen at the hands of a similar mechanically-operated device and a conveniently opened vat of acid in the dungeons! I ought to mention, in conclusion, that I watched the film's 1999 remake before I had a chance to check out the originalas was also the case with the 2001 version of THIR13EN GHOSTS – but not, for what it is worth, THE HAUNTING (also 1999) all of which, as if it needed saying, turned out to be inferior to their prototype!",House on Haunted Hill

The could had easily turned this piece into an ordinary standard haunted house flick but luckily they didn't. For the normal genre standards this is simply one fine and above all also original entry into the '50's horror genre.But yes, the movie is still above all things a real horror flick and it also does have some good scares in it. Due to it's build up and also original approach of the genre, the horror gets made more powerful and it's moments work out better. '50's horror flick aren't exactly known for their subtlety or credibility but this movie does a great job at putting down a convincing movie with a good story and characters to enjoy.It's a movie that is more light and more enjoyable to watch than the average genre attempt from the same era, without loosing any of its strength as an horror.It's of course also true that the movie benefits from the presence of Vincent Price. This horror icon appeared in many movies like this throughout his career, also often portraying the same type of characters. Like always, he's giving away one fine performance in this movie.Some moments in the movie still feel a bit awkward.

35,kevinolzak,Seen on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater in 1964,7,2 April 2019,"1958's ""House on Haunted Hill"" was the quintessential Vincent Price vehicle (Elvira's personal favorite), and the first of two he made for producer-director William Castle, followed months later by ""The Tingler."" This Allied Artists release delivered on all its promises, though the Emergo gimmick could only be done in theaters, the movie skeleton rising from a pool of acid joined by an off screen skeleton designed to fly over the screaming audience. This was a more tangible gimmick than for Castle's first effort ""Macabre,"" which only promised a guarantee against death by fright (boredom was fortunately not covered!). The Ennis Brown house used for exteriors was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and built in 1924, and still stands today in a state of disrepair. The film opens in total darkness, followed by clanging chains, moans and shrieks, then the face of actor Elisha Cook as Watson Pritchard, current owner of the house on Haunted Hill, relating the knowledge that seven people were murdered under its roof, and that the most recent two were beheaded, the heads never found. Vincent Price announces himself as millionaire Frederick Loren, whose wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart) is hosting a party of five to spend one night in the house to earn $10,000 apiece. Apart from Watson Pritchard, who admittedly needs the money, they include test pilot Lance Schroeder (Richard Long), psychiatrist David Trent (Alan Marshal), newspaper columnist Ruth Bridgers (Julie Mitchum, Robert's elder sister), and pretty secretary Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig). Once the servants leave at midnight there will be no escape during the night, with each guest receiving a loaded pistol for protection. Poor Nora is victimized most often by the evening's events, despite ample safeguards from Lance, who agrees to do the same for Annabelle. The Lorens are no happy couple, he the jealous type, certain that she only married him for money, she the ultimate ice princess, determined to get it all, her apparent suicide a mystery leaving everyone shaken. The dawn of the 60s would find Price reinventing himself yet again, as the star of a series of color adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe stories, most agreeable to AIP since all of the author's works were in the public domain. 1953's ""House of Wax"" may have set him on the path to legendary horror star, but that mostly sympathetic role was in opposition to Frederick Loren, prime suspect in his wife's demise and the one singled out by Nora as her unseen tormenter. It's truly a gleeful field day for the actor, sardonic and witty in equal measure, with fine support from Richard Long (""Cult of the Cobra"") and Elisha Cook, whose genre credits increased over the years: ""Voodoo Island,"" ""Black Zoo,"" ""The Haunted Palace,"" ""Rosemary's Baby"" (produced by William Castle), ""Messiah of Evil,"" ""The Night Stalker,"" ""Blacula,"" ""The Phantom of Hollywood,"" ""Dead of Night,"" and ""Salem's Lot."" Castle never again achieved such a balance of showmanship and scares, his massive success inspiring no less than Alfred Hitchcock to do his own low budget item for an even greater financial windfall (the result was ""Psycho"").",House on Haunted Hill

The entire movie you are wondering if the strange events are supernatural or a hoax. I especially wondered because the movie was done in 1958 and special effects were so rudimentary.As I said, the plot was good. The acting on the other hand... ugh.

Whoever will stay in the house for one night will earn ten thousand dollars apiece. These five people are all strangers to the Lorens. One of them is the current owner of the haunted house, and he agrees to stay even though his brother was killed in the house and an attempt was made on his own life there, presumably by the ghosts that haunt the place. I guess this really is proof of inflation, because over sixty years later ten thousand dollars isn't what it used to be. You'd have to add a couple of zeroes to that check to make the offer tempting.There are decapitated heads that pop up in suitcases, one member of the group is apparently murdered, doors that slam shut and secret panels, and there are a couple of scary people that pop up out of nowhere. And yet, in the end, there is a logical explanation for all of it. Except - why on earth did the current owner, who was almost killed there - Elisha Cook Jr. As Watson Pritchard - leave this house in its current state? There are bars on all of the windows, no phone, no electricity, and the only door to the outside is solid steel and slams shut when the caretakers leave. Oh, and then there is the vat of acid in the cellar. For what reason is all of this stuff there? I'd sure like to see Pritchard trying to explain this to State Farm when he gets his homeowner's policy renewed. And there are other plot holes but I'll let you watch and find out what they are.Made by Allied Artists, a poverty row outfit, probably the one big reason this is a Halloween favorite is Vincent Price as Fredrick Loren. He is his usual charming yet macabre and mysterious self. What DID happen to his three previous wives? Not asked, never answered. And Elisha Cook Jr. As the current haunted house owner is good here, playing it wide eyed and drunk but hysterical, even though he is usually known for noir. The atmosphere is great too. Just look past the plot imperfections and enjoy.",House on Haunted Hill
38,morrison-dylan-fan,The Price is right.,6,20 April 2010,"With having seen Vincent Price as Egghead on re-runs of the Adam""Family Guy""West Batman show,and hearing his voice-over work on the fun 13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo.I,decided when i spotted that my dad was about to trade in a film the Price starred in,that i would make sure to get hold of the film,before it got traded.Happily,i found the film to be very enjoyable,with a surprisingly clever story. The plot:A millionaire and his current wife (his other wives have strangely disappeared,or have died in very weird ways.)decide to host a party in an alleged haunted house with five ""random"" guests (though some of them have connections to the millionaires business,the history of the house,and,one of them is having an affair with the wife.)When the guests arrive at the house,they are each told that,if they stay there for the whole night,they will each be given $10,000.Whilst this may sound like an easy thing to do to everyone,things start to get very disturbing,when,the millionaires wife commits suicide by hanging herself. (Though she has oddly hanged herself from a celling,which is far to tall for her to ever reach.)Some of the guests (the lover of the millionaires wife being the main one)have some horrific plans of their own,which make the ghosts not the only thing that they have to survive threw the night. View on the film:I feel that whilst William Castle is most remembered for his ""shock and awe"" publicity style(lovingly re-created in the film Matinée.)that,the screenplay by Robb White is impressively very strong and pretty original for its time.With,the wife and her secret lover setting up the haunted house as one big con job!,in order to make all the guests so nervous and spooked,that they end up killing her husband.Unsurprisingly some have the special effects have not aged to well (the shot with the older woman running across the room,looking like a card-board cut out moving across the screen)Thankfully the films aged effects are covered by a very good cast,with Vincent Price and his very fantastic voice giving a very enjoyable performance. Final view on the film:A very good film,with a great script that sadly,has some very creaky looking special effects.",House on Haunted Hill
39,kannibalcorpsegrinder,"A tad overrated, but still a good movie",7,28 October 2015,"Renting a supposed haunted house, an entrepreneur invites guests out for a party for his wife where they learn the house has is haunted by ghosts and forced to stay inside the house as they begin to suspect that the experience has nothing to do with ghosts.This is a little flawed, but there are some good points to it. The fact that the house looks pretty creepy works for it, for there's always a hallway looks creepy when blackened out or a piece of furniture that makes it gives off a feeling of dread. The big halls and huge spaces make it stand out in the creepiness factor. When it gets to working right, the film is really on. The biggest instance is the film's incredibly creepy finale, which is simply insane and one of the most creative ideas ever used to end a film. Another big moment is it's classic scene of the one character checking hollow walls, and a completely unknown character pops up unexpectedly, which is followed by the being floating down the hallway in an unearthly manner in front of the terrified witness which is a really excellent jump-scene and one of the greatest scenes in the film. There's a couple of other really great jump scenes in here where the ghosts pop out and terrorize the characters, including one really great one near the end where several individual jump scenes converge at once to throw in a really spectacular scene. This does have some great moments, but there are some problems with this one that really lowers this one. The biggest one is that film really makes no mention of the ghosts haunting the house for most of the movie. It's mentioned several times throughout that they're responsible for several past incidents in the house and it's built around them, yet they are hardly in the movie. There are only a few scenes with them involved in the film's play-out, and these don't really do much of anything to make non-believers actually believe that ghosts are behind it. Once the marital strife subplot is brought up, the ghost angle pretty much sinks into the background and is completely ignored for most of the film that winds up hurting the film's premise for the majority of the time. The other really big flaw is that there's a really drawn-out pace for this one. The constant dealings with the married couple, which take up the majority of the second half of the film, is completely dull and boring as nothing interesting happens during the entire part. Seeing them argue with each other is boring and slows down the film, offering nothing much interesting for the film as all the bickering and pretend- deaths get old fast, and even worse they take time away from the film's purpose. These are the film's biggest flaws.Today's Rating/PG: Mild Violence.",House on Haunted Hill

They receive loaded guns as party favors, since multiple murders had taken place there, and it seems more are planned...

41,Aaron1375,It really was his wife's party.,9,28 March 2004,"This movie is a very good tale of a house that may or may not be haunted. This version is better than the newer one, mainly because Vincent Price is so good here, much better than anyone in the new version made in 1999.  It is also relatively short and goes by quickly.  This movie has some of the same plot elements of the one from 1999, but thankfully the ending to this one is a lot better.  I really enjoyed it, as I was hoping the one character would come out on top.  This one is about a party being held in an old house that is supposed to be haunted.  The people were invited by Price's character and offered $10,000 dollars if they were to stay the entire night. There is tension between Price's character and his wife, there is a girl who is very nervous and wants to leave immediately, and then there is the doctor who does not believe in ghosts.  There are three others as well who are invited to stay the night.  During the night strange things happen as one of the guests is murdered and there seems to be supernatural things happening.  A very well done movie that for me ended perfectly.",House on Haunted Hill
42,Wuchakk,Lame haunted house movie highlighted by the stunning Carol Ohmart,3,22 July 2015,"Released in 1959, ""House on Haunted Hill"" stars Vincent Price as the host of a ""party"" at a mansion where several people are invited (e.g. Richard Long and Elisha Cook Jr.) and offered $10,000 to stay the night. Ghostly and spooky things start happening. Will they make it out alive?Some old horror movies stand the test of time even though they're extremely dated, like 1953's ""House of Wax,"" but ""House on Haunted Hill"" isn't one of 'em. This is just a bad movie. It has one or two effective scares, but that's about it. Thankfully, there are some positives: Price is his entertaining self, Long is a quality protagonist and Carol Ohmart is palpably sultry, but there are way too many lame elements, like parts of the dialogue and the overall script. But there's more: The corny floating heads; the overacting and over-screaming (mostly by Carolyn Craig); the fact that the house (actually a veritable castle) only has one door; and the ridiculous skeleton at the end that was shorter than Annabelle and was supposed to be the remains of Price's towering character. Then there's the obvious questions the story provokes: Since the guests were only there for the night why not just stay in one room together and wait it out, making sure you're not sitting under a dubious chandelier? What was the purpose of the well of acid in the cellar? How did they possibly pull off Annabelle appearing outside Nora's window? How about the rope encircling Nora's feet and then going back out? Why didn't Nora simply step away from the rope? I could go on and on.Still, it's worth watching for the few positives and to roll your eyes at the rest. Shot in B&W, the movie runs 75 minutes and was shot Ennis-Brown House, Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. GRADE: D",House on Haunted Hill
43,The_Void,Vincent Price is outstanding,8,25 July 2004,"Vincent Price plays Frederick Loren, an eccentric millionaire that invites five very different people to a haunted house for a party, and offers them $10,000 if they can stay the night... This film benefits emphatically from the presence of the legendary Vincent Price. As usual, Price gives a commanding performance and completely steals every scene he's in. Price is undoubtedly the star of the show, but he's not the only star in the show; Elisha Cook in particular gives excellent support playing the wimpy owner of the house; much the same character that he played in the Kubrick masterpiece; 'The Killing'. The rest of the cast is largely made up of unknowns and b-grade actors, but they also all perform to relatively high standards in their respective roles.House on Haunted Hill's best feature other than the legendary Vincent Price, is undoubtedly the atmosphere of the house. Throughout the movie, there is an abundant sense of dread that is perpetually present and it serves the film well in that it brings the house to life; at every point in the movie, the audience is made to believe that there is something unseen in the house that will cause bad things to happen; and this is obviously exactly what a haunted house film needs. The film is very creepy in that way. That's not to say that this film is without its flaws; at times, the plot meanders and as the film only has a 75 minute running time, that's not good. It can also become a little dull at times as there isn't always a lot going on. This is, however, somewhat combated by the acting performances and defined characters as they usually manage to keep it at least interesting, if not enthralling throughout. House on Haunted Hill is topped off by a brilliant double twist, and it is also given certain originality by that also, although the twists do beg the question of whether or not the film has an appropriate title. The walking skeleton is hilarious, though and worth watching film for alone.Overall, House on Haunted Hill is a lovely little b movie; it's creative, it's atmospheric and it stars Vincent Price. Highly recommended viewing, especially for horror fans. Definitely not recommended for anyone though, is the dire 1999 remake of this film, and the equally appalling remake of William Castle's other ghost story; '13 Ghosts'.",House on Haunted Hill

45,JamesHitchcock,Cheap and Nasty Little Shocker,4,10 June 2016,"Eccentric millionaire Frederick Loren and his glamorous young wife Annabelle invite five people to a house party. And not just any house party. This is a haunted house party. Loren has rented a mansion in which, over the years, seven people have been murdered and which is said to be haunted by their ghosts. The rules of the party are that whoever stays in the house for one night will earn $10,000. After midnight, however, the only door to the house will be locked until the morning, and there will be no escape. (All the windows are barred). The five, all of whom are in need of money, are a test pilot, a newspaper columnist, a psychiatrist, a secretary who works for one of Loren's companies and the brother of one of the murder victims. The plot is superficially similar to that of another horror film from a few years later, ""The Haunting"", which also concerned a disparate group of people invited to stay in a haunted house. There is, however, a major difference. Everything that happens in ""House on Haunted Hill"" can be explained in rational terms. Although Watson Pritchard (he whose brother was murdered in the house) wanders around warning his fellow guests that the ghosts are coming for them, they are threatened not by malevolent supernatural forces but by human evil. The supposed ""party"" is no more than an elaborate set-up for a complicated murder scheme- and there may be more than one person with murder in mind. When I say that everything in the film can be explained in rational terms, I was simply using the word ""rational"" to mean ""non- supernatural"". I was not implying that the plot makes a lot of sense, because it doesn't. The lack of logic starts with the house itself. It is supposed to be Victorian, and looks it from the inside, but the shots of the exterior show a building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1924 and which would still have looked strikingly modernistic in 1959. The film-makers couldn't even be bothered to look for a genuine Victorian property. It is the sort of less-than-desirable residence which still lacked electricity even in the late fifties- Loren and his guests have to make do with gas lighting- but which comes equipped with its own vat of acid in the basement for the unwary to stumble into. (As soon as this vat was mentioned I knew that at least one character would meet their death in it). And what self-respecting architect would design, and what self-respecting fire department allow, a house with only one door and bars on all the windows? The problems with the film do not end with the architecture. The plot seems full of holes. It is never, for example, explained why Pritchard has accepted Loren's invitation to spend a night in a building which obviously terrifies him and where he clearly expects to be killed. He can't have been that much in need of money. More importantly, the storyline, with its two interlinked murder plots, can be confusing and difficult to follow. Without wanting to give away too much of the ending, I can say that both schemes are so complicated, and so dependent on predicting exactly how a third person, who is not a party to the scheme, will behave, that I cannot imagine any would-be murderer ever coming up with them, especially as one of the killers does not seem to care very much about evading detection. The acting is undistinguished. Vincent Price, by far the best-known cast member, was a gifted actor, and could give good performances even in low-budget horror flicks, a genre in which he seemed to specialise. (I am thinking of films like Michael Reeves' ""Witchfinder-General"" and some of the Edgar Allen Poe series he made with Roger Corman). This, however, is one low-budget horror flick in which he failed to shine and it is not one of his better films. None of his co-stars, however, is any better, and some are considerably worse. Carol Ohmart is able to convey Annabelle's glamour, but never succeeds in conveying her essentially vicious nature. Elisha Cook's acting as Pritchard seems horribly mannered and exaggerated. Julie Mitchum (sister of the more famous Robert) as the columnist has so little to do that I wondered why the scriptwriter didn't simply write her character out and make do with four guests instead of five. Director William Castle does manage to pull a few surprises, resulting in a couple of genuinely scary moments, although these might have been more effective with a higher budget for special effects, but the film is little more than a cheap and nasty shocker which looks very dated today. There were some excellent horror films from the late fifties and early sixties- ""The Haunting"", ""The Masque of the Red Death"" and, above all, Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", but ""House on Haunted Hill"" is not one of them. I find myself quite unable to comprehend the relatively high score it enjoys on this board. 4/10",House on Haunted Hill

But questions are brought up when the wife seems pretty up on loosing her millionaire husband.The story was great and the ending was one of the first great twist endings of our time.

But when Loren's wife ends up at the wrong end of a noose, the fun's over (or is really just beginning). Is a killer loose in the house or is the House on Haunted Hill really haunted? You know what I enjoy the most about older horror movies like House on Haunted Hill – they were made at a time when horror movies could still be fun. Ridiculous looking heads could pop out of suitcases, unexplained hands could grope from behind walls, and skeletons ruled the cellar. Sure, it was all unrealistic, but was it ever a blast. And that's exactly what keeps me coming back to movies like House on Haunted Hill – that sense of fun. Today's horror movies are too realistic, try too hard to be one big gross out, and have lost most of the enjoyable elements of old.One big plus for House on Haunted Hill is the cast. Well, not all the cast, but the movie does feature a couple of outstanding, memorable performances. Horror icon Vincent Price was just getting his feet wet in the genre in 1959. He may not have been the scene-chewing, over-the-top actor that most of us remember so fondly, but he was still rock solid in the role of the wealthy Frederick Loren. Almost as good is Carol Ohmart. Whether playing the victim or the victimizer, she's equally adept. As for the rest of the cast, the less said the better. I know we're supposed to identify with and root for the characters played by Carolyn Craig and Richard Long, but they're both so annoying that I always want to see both take a swim in the acid bath.Finally, what comment about House on Haunted Hill would be complete without a mention of the scene with the old lady in the basement. The horror in most of House on Haunted Hill may have been played for laughs, but when the hag in the cellar pops up, it's one of the best jump scares in the history of horror.

The owner of the haunted house and one of those whom Frederick picked to spend the evening there Waston Prichard, Elisha Cook Jr, knows just how dangerous that place is in seven people, including his brother and sister in-law, having been murdered there over the last 100 years with their headless bodies found in different rooms!As the night begins and the house is sealed off from the outside world strange things start to happen driving some of the guests almost to the brink of insanity or nervous breakdowns. It's Nora Manning, Carolyn Craig, who ends up getting the worst of it with her seeing ghosts and severed heads pop out of the woodwork which no one else sees. Screaming her head off every five or so minutes it's a wonder that Nora didn't end up losing her voice much less her head by the time the film was finally over. It may have also been Nora's ear splitting screams that kept the ghosts or whoever it was from killing her by scrambling their brains, if they had any, before they could make a move on her!It's when Frederick's back stabbing wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart), who wasn't one of the invited guests, was found hanged on top of a stairway that it became evident that something far more sinister and deadly was going on in the house besides just an active imagination on the part of those spending the night over there! ****SPOILERS**** It's later that the real reason comes out to what all this haunted house business is really all about and it has to do with an elaborate plan to commit the perfect crime by setting Frederick himself up for elimination. It's in Frederick expecting the unexpected that causes the ""perfect crime"" to suddenly backfire on those who planned it with them both ending up not only dead but stripped,in a giant acid bath, of almost all their earthy or bodily remains!Heart pounding final with the human skeleton popping out of the acid bath and doing what looked like a new of disco or rock & roll dance step scaring the living hell out of the person, as well as the audience, who planned to do Frederick in! As for Frederick himself he in doing in those who tried to do him in he's now more then willing to face justice in that what he did, as violent and murderous as it was, was an act of self-defense on his part which no jury on earth, even in Communist Russia or China, would find him guilty of!P.S The other guest invited to Frederick's haunted house party are test pilot Lance Schroeder, Richard Long, head shrinker or psychiatrist Dr. David Trent, Alan Marshal, and newspaper columnist Ruth Bridgers, played by actor Robert Mitchum's older sister Julie Mitchum.

He offers his guests (who he has never met) $10,000 if they can stay the night and survive the night's outcomes, if they don't see the next morning, then the money goes to their heirs.Seeing the remake first, kind of disappointed me because I knew what to expect when it came to watching this, but that didn't overly take away from my enjoyment of this charming, atmospheric and outrageous schlock. It's far better than the remake, though. What you get is a well-made shocker, which is still by the numbers, but what sets it out from the rest is energetic performances throughout the feature (which, it highly benefited from), the daunting exterior of the haunted house and the real hammy LOW budget effects that don't hamper, but add more to the charm and fun. But most of Castle's films are rather out there in context and more remembered for the gimmicks and tricks, and this one is no exception. This case a skeleton was used to move above the audience's heads while watching the film in the cinema. Some of its weakness is more in the screenplay, when there are many unexplained moments, sometimes-dodgy dialogue ""one of us is guilty, and the rest of us is innocent"" and the story's outcome felt rather sudden and lacklustre, leaving me rather unsatisfied. I was hoping for more ghoulish fun! Vincent Price turns in a superb and deviously suave performance. Most of his dialogue is priceless! The rest were top-notch, although female lead Nora became a real pain listening to her screams. The b/w cinematography fits exquisitely in capturing a rather eerie feel and the house's spooky features and bone rattling score also provide to the atmosphere. But don't be expecting anything particularly frightening as I found the suppose shocks 99% more hilarious than scary. Although I said the dialogue was sometimes dodgy, but it had its gripping moments that builds on the buzz of the plot. Anyhow, you can't go wrong when a thunderstorm pops up in the film, you just know things can't get any better! This is a film that doesn't rely on special effects like the *cough* remake (which was special effects overload), but actually on the performances and also throw in some nicely added black humour.Overall, a lot of good will equals good campy fun!",House on Haunted Hill

57,clanciai,Spooky plot with many screams and a weird murdering scheme,9,11 June 2019,"The plot may seem confusing and somewhat ridiculous as nothing makes sense and nothing is credible, but it is actually a mess that ultimately makes sense. A beautiful woman (Carol Ohmart) marries multi-millionaire Vincent Price, obviously for his money, although he has been married three times before, and they all died. The marriage is not a happy one, as Vincent Price suspects her of wanting to murder him, as she apparently already tried once. On her suggestion, they rent this the most haunted house in America and give a party to some odd people who are in dire need of money, as he can only make people come to the place if they are paid for it. The offer is $10,000 each if they stay the night. The party does not really go off very well, there is not even any dinner, but instead every guest is provided with a loaded gun, just in case. Complications start mounting when Carol Ohmart is found hanged, apparently by herself, but there is no way she could have done it.It's a messy plot, and it doesn't get better by some ladies going into hysterics, but there is nothing wrong with the suspense and the effects, which are trermendous enough, especially concerning the acid pool in the cellar where bodies tend to get dissolved. And so on. The actors are good, and you will feel relieved when the end is reached, as everything in spite of all was quite natural and explainable, with only two casualties on the way, as .the incomparable Elisha Cook terms it, ""two more ghosts to the assembly"".",House on Haunted Hill
58,tomgillespie2002,"A silly, deliciously entertaining haunted house movie",7,2 November 2016,"Horror icon Vincent Price has played the role of a wealthy eccentric countless times, usually holed up in a beautiful if macabre and mysterious castle while toying with his visitors. It's a role that fits his slightly creepy yet irresistibly likable persona like a glove, and served him well throughout his extensive career. Before he became the wink-to-the-camera rogue in the films of Roger Corman and many others, he tended to play his parts more straight-faced, but always with a playful aura. One of his most enjoyable roles is in William Castle's House on Haunted Hill, a film that embraces cliché and camp, yet undoubtedly inspired countless haunted house movies that came in the years that followed.Price plays a charismatic millionaire named Frederick Loren who, at the request of his wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart), rents a supposedly haunted house to throw a party. He invites five guests - test pilot Lance Schroeder (Richard Long), psychiatrist Dr. David Trent (Alan Marshal), newspaper columnist Ruth Bridgers (Julie Mitchum), one of Loren's employees Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig), and the house's owner Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook Jr.) - to survive the night for a $10,000 reward. They are each given a small coffin containing a gun, and are offered one last chance to leave before the doors close and lock at midnight. Needing the money and believing the spooky occurrences to be the work of cheap tricks, they all stay, but regret the decision when one of the group is found hanged.It's incredibly basic stuff and only runs for 75 minutes, but Castle's ability to keep the audience guessing and Price's wonderful, brooding performance makes House on Haunted Hill stand out above its many imitators. Castle was known for his gimmicks in the theatre, and here employed 'Emergo', which involved a skeleton being dangled above its terrified audience. Watching it at home, the fun to be had back in the day is of course lost, but the film offers enough genuine jump frights and camp-yet-charming effects to make this an incredibly fun experience on its own. It's certainly not scary, and one scene in particular had me laughing out loud (if you've seen the film, you'll know which moment I mean), but Castle's finest movie makes for a nice alternative to the blood and guts that dominated the genre in the years to come. A silly, deliciously entertaining throwback.",House on Haunted Hill

This is a work by the famous director William Castle, who made several B films. In this particular case comedy, more or less evident, was always present, harmonizing with the attempts to frighten the audience (I do not know As far as they were truly successful, but for me they had no effect). In this movie, a very rich man invites a small group of people to a night party in a haunted mansion, giving money to anyone who wants to sleep there. The film spends a lot of time introducing the characters and, thereby, creates a good bond between them and the audience. The work of the cast is very competent, in particular Price. Of course, all of the special effects work is archaic today but we're watching a very old movie and we have to understand that. I particularly liked what I saw. It's not a horror movie, it scares almost anyone. But it's quite humorous at the right times, and above all, it maintains a pleasant mood of mystery from beginning to end.",House on Haunted Hill

He is offering a staggering amount of money (for 1959) to anyone who could last the night. It was his wife's idea that the guests arrive in funeral cars.This was a low budget thriller produced and directed by William Castle back in the late 1950's. This shows not only what an inspired and talented team can do on a low budget, but it demonstrates some real talent as well. The house featured in this endeavor is the Ennis-Brown House in the prestigious Los Feliz area of Los Angeles. Other films featuring this house are ""Black Rain, 1989; Blade Runner, 1982; Grand Canyon, 1991 and the Rocketeer, 1991.I will digress a moment or three to give a brief description of this house for you. Set up the atmosphere, as it will. If you know Me at all, you know that I appreciate a well-designed set. Not to mention a well designed house. This house has a history. Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, this was a masterpiece of architectural genius. Visited by architects from around the world, this house is a National Landmark house which enjoys constant restoration efforts. Mr. Wright used 16"" stone blocks to construct the home, Mayan designs throughout and fixed the window glasses, doors and framing work to be lighter at the bottom and darker at the top to invite a feeling of warmth and light to the occupants of every room. But now, back to the movie.This story was clever and full of intrigue. As a suspense, this is one of the greats. This is the movie which fathered the haunted house sub-genre, and boy, was it good. There are some scenes in this movie which still get my blood pumping. *LOL* The performances are never over the top, always professional, totally believable and extremely enjoyable and in my opinion, this is one of Price's best.When a scene hits a slow spot you can count on the character interaction between Price and Omhart to darkly lighten the mood. Their banter seems to be the comedic relief element, although the humor is dry, dark and deadly.As you watch this brilliant endeavor, you will recognize scenes, characters, even lines from the more recent renditions of this story, regardless of the title. Everything from Amityville to Stephen King's Rose Red seems to have taken a bit from this landmark horror, and it seems to have been beautifully parodied (along with about 10 other films) in Neil Simon's ""Murder By Death"" in the late 70's.As with all of Price's work, there are plot twists and elements which require thought. Those are what I love most about his movies. And as with all low budget endeavors, there are some plot holes, but rather than listing those here, I'll just let you enjoy the movie for yourself.It rates an easy 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",House on Haunted Hill

The house itself is full of hidden passages, creepy staff, and a reluctant doom-spouting owner who quickly gets full of whiskey and creeps out the other party guest, but as you might have guessed all is not as it seems. I loved the ambiguity regarding whether the house was actually haunted or not, and I'd leave it up to you what you think (although several 'clues' helped me make my mind up). There's plenty of creepy atmosphere here, from organs that play themselves, rocking chandeliers and ceilings dripping blood, and at the centre of it all you've got Price, who can convey menace with a single raised eyebrow.

The film was produced and directed by legendarily gimmicky schlock-meister William Castle (this opus featured 'Emergo', in which a skeleton would fly above theatre audiences at a key moment in the film). Price is at his suave, sinister best as the conniving host and the rest of the cast is fine (considering what they have to work with). The plot is preposterous and driven by impossible events but, for a no-brainer, light-weight, almost tongue-in-cheek 'horror' outing, the film has a goofy charm (and there are a couple of good 'boo! moments' if you're starting to doze off). The opening, featuring the disembodied head of character actor Elisha Cook Jr. 'breaking the fourth wall' to utter portentous warnings over spooky music, screams, and clanking chains, pretty much sets the mood for this Halloween staple.

65,jadavix,One of the better haunted house movies,7,15 December 2017,"""House on Haunted Hill"" is a horror movie which may have been unfairly relegated to the bargain bin of history due to the gimmickry of its infamous filmmaker, William Castle. Indeed, during its first showings in the fifties, a skeleton would be lowered down into the audience during a key scene - but allegedly this trick was resigned when cinema goers started throwing things at it.Castle, as it turns out, didn't need to resort to such things. He was a more than capable filmmaker: ""House on Haunted Hill"" features many genuinely shocking, and even frightening, moments.The plot concerns an eccentric millionaire - played by, who else? Vincent Price - who invites a group of people to stay in a supposedly haunted house. If they can last the night, he will give them $10,000.Of course, there are signs that the house may indeed be haunted, but everything is not what it seems, and the guests may have more to fear than spooks.Aside from the indelible Vincent Price, the movie also stars Elisha Cook Jr., a character actor who looks like a smaller, traumatised Jack Nicholson, and Julie Mitchum (sister of Robert) in the last film of her negligible acting career.I was a little troubled by the ending, which seems to try for an open-ended lack of resolution, but doesn't quite get there.

67,ackstasis,"""Only the ghosts in this house are glad we're here""",8,21 July 2009,"I can't say I was expecting 'House on Haunted Hill (1959)' to be anything but a generic supernatural shocker, but there's depth to this 1950s B-movie. Ghosts are an ideal device for lazy horror filmmakers: add a few sudden shocks, ghastly deaths, and leave only one or two cast members alive by morning. But William Castle doesn't stick to the rule-book. His haunted house boasts no ghosts – or, if it does, then they remain surprisingly quiet for this one night. Instead, Castle cleverly toys with the audience's genre perceptions; since we're all here to see a ""haunted house"" movie, we fully accept a plane of reality that would ordinarily send alarm bells of incredulity ringing. We're being hoodwinked. Our acceptance of a forged reality parallels the characters' acceptance. The best ghost stories – Clayton's 'The Innocents (1961)' and Wise's 'The Haunting (1963)' – are largely psychological, and here, too, Castle explores how carefully- choreographed scare tactics can wreak havoc on an unstable mind.At the request of his wife (Carol Ohmart), with whom he shares a mutual hatred, eccentric millionaire Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) invites five strangers to a ""haunted house"" party: the drunken and paranoid owner Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook, Jr.), jet pilot Lance Schroeder (Richard Long), skeptical psychiatrist Dr. David Trent (Alan Marshal), gossip columnist Ruth Bridgers (Julie Mitchum), and timid typist Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig). Each of the guests is wary of the millionaire's invitation, but finds reassurance in the sorely-needed $10,000 that will await them if they can endure a single night in the ""haunted"" dwelling. Once locked securely in the house at midnight, with no opportunity for escape until 8AM, the party guests begin to experience surreal and unexplainable happenings in the dusty mansion, including falling chandeliers, frightening apparitions, apparent suicides, and some craziness involving a cellar vat filled with acid (an OH&S hazard if I ever saw one). Central to this spook-fest is the young and pretty Nora, whose psychological condition rapidly deteriorates under the emotional strain.'House on Haunted Hill' naturally recalls the many thrilling ghost stories in cinema history, but the element of human intervention also reminded me of 'And Then There Were None (1945),' adapted from an Agatha Christie story. Since Castle consistently keeps us guessing whether or not humans or supernatural beings are responsible for the ""hauntings,"" the viewer finds it difficult to identity moments of temporary security. For example, if a ghost is responsible, then the most frightening scenario is to be left alone; if another person is responsible, then the most frightening scenario is to share the room with just one other. The film, particularly in its latter half, has several scenes of extraordinary hokeyness (only amplified, I'd imagine, by Castle's trademark gimmickry), but also a few moments of heart-stopping terror. And it didn't help that, during the film, my dog silently pushed open the bedroom door, and then backed out again, so that from my angle it looked as though the door had eased itself open.",House on Haunted Hill

Scary, suspenseful, William Castle classic with the always creepy Vincent Price hosting a cast of selfish souls who are given an opportunity to win money by staying in an alleged haunted house overnight. This is not a completely original premise, but the twists make it a little more original. Vincent's character and his wife bring five folks from different backgrounds to the house giving them until midnight to decide if they want to stay until morning and the get the 10,000 dollars. The doors surprisingly close a few minutes before the witching hour, not allowing one individual to leave and all of them must attempt this. Than, they are all given guns to defend themselves? This part doesn't make a whole lot of sense because this doesn't appear to be a psychological exercise but it adds to the suspense. There are very well staged hauntings, and a lot of intrigue as the guests try to figure out what's going on. This is definetly a tongue-in-cheek horror movie with subtle humor that is spot on. The frights are very well done also, with good performances by the entire cast making you believe their predicament. In my opinion, this is a must see classic for the genre.

HOUSE  is,in this respect, very much alike that '30s mysteries. The music enhances the emotions; the atmosphere is well done. The film does not go beyond the effects.The movie is notably trying to induce the idea that the modernist architecture is weird and frightening; much of the atmosphere depends on this (wrong) premise. I have read that the house used for the exterior shots is a '24 Wright creation. It looks rather like a _ziggurat. For me, this was the least convincing and stupidly reactionary partWright's house is not frightening at all; it is bizarre and vaguely Asian, but not frightinducing. The choice of the house was wrong to begin with.At least some of the scenes are mishandled from a dramatic and narrative point of view; the tone is several times semiserious, as the film oscillates between straight horror and goofy _divertissement. Anyway,it's not without finesse. The fright is not brutal, but welldosed.HOUSE  reminded me, at least for a time, of Bullwer Lytton's short storywhere there is the same will of effects, without resolutely achieving its goal.Horror collectors should have itas well as treasure it .",House on Haunted Hill

She's so amusing.""",10,15 March 2008,"The title of this review, spoken by the great Vincent Price in his trademark macabre voice, is one of my favorite lines in William Castle's ""House On Haunted Hill"" of 1959. An impossible-not-to-love spooky classic that no Horror fan can afford to miss, this film unites all the great qualities that my fellow fans of classic Horror love about 'Haunted House' gems of the silver screen. The film has a great, gloomy atmosphere and an immense sense of macabre wit. Vincent Price is, as always, brilliant, and the role of the eccentric millionaire Frederic Loren fits Price like a glove. This film allows Price to show his great talent of playing sinister characters with a sense of macabre humor like hardly another. This film furthermore has a special value to me personally, as Vincent Price is one of my all-time favorite actors, and a long time ago this was the first of his films that I saw, and I immediately became a fan of this brilliant horror icon. Since then, many years have passed, and I've seen almost every movie with Price, most of them more than once.The eccentric millionaire Frederick Loren (Price) invites five strangers to join him and his wife in a party. This 'Haunted House party' is to take place in an eerie mansion owned by Loren, and each guest who will stay for the entire night is to receive 10,000 Dollars. The house is not just eerie looking, however, it also has a history of violent murders...The film maintains its wonderfully eerie atmosphere throughout, and it has quite a bunch of exquisite scare moments. As mentioned above, Vincent Price is, as always, brilliant. The other performances range from very good to poor. Julie Mitchum is fantastic as Price's character's equally sinister wife, and Elisha Cook Jr., who played besides Price in quite a bunch of Horror classics including Roger Corman's ""The Haunted Palace"", is good as always. My only regret with ""House On Haunted Hill"" is that I will never be able to see the film in its complete theatrical glory. When the film was first playing in theaters, director William Castle used his trademark gimmicks for additional scares. These gimmicks included skeletons flying through the hall, directly at the audience. Unfortunately, the only way of experiencing ""House On Haunted Hill"" in an entirely perfect manner, would therefore be to either go back in time, or to find a theater-owner and a team willing to stage everything the way Castle did, both of which is very unlikely. Incomparably eerier than the 1999 remake, this original ""House On Haunted Hill"" is a magnificently spooky Classic Horror gem and an essential must-see for every fan of Horror! My high rating for this film mirrors my personal love for this movie and might be seen as exaggerated by some. However, this is probably the single movie I have seen the most often, and I still enjoy it immensely. To me, it is an absolute must-see.",House on Haunted Hill
76,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Solid Haunted House Film, or is it?",9,19 April 2019,"Now I have to admit that I saw this film for the first time after I saw the remake. The first time I did see this film, I hated it, mostly because of the ending. After a few viewings, it is definitely one I appreciate more and more. The synopsis is a millionaire offers $10,000 to five people who agree to be locked in a large, spooky, rented house overnight with him and his wife.This film kicks off with women's screams before Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook Jr.) appears. He tells us this is the only real haunted house in the world and that the ghosts are moving. Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) then appears to tell us the stakes. This is a party for his wife and that if the attendees can stay overnight in the House on Haunted Hill, they will each receive the money. The guests do not know each other, but each of them needs the money for very different reasons.We get to meet each one with Frederick giving us background on them. Lance Schroeder (Richard Long) is a pilot. Dr. David Trent (Alan Marshal) is a psychologist who wants to prove that hysteria can make people see things and there is a hint that he might be greedy. Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig), an employee of Frederick. She is supporting her whole family after an accident. Watson is the owner of the house and his family has met tragedy there. There is finally Ruth Bridgers (Julie Mitchum) who is a newspaper columnist that wants to write a piece on ghosts. She also has a bit of a gambling debt.Inside, they are given the tour and Watson tells them of the deaths that happened there. We also see Frederick speak with his wife, Annabelle (Carol Ohmart). She refuses to come down to the party, as she doesn't know the guests. We see that the banter between them is they don't get along. She won't leave him though, as she wants all of his money.Strange things start to happen and Nora starts to really think this place could be haunted. Lance is trying to help her get to the bottom of this. When Annabelle is found hanging, did she commit suicide or is there something else going on in this house?The first thing about the story that I love is that this film makes you wonder if the house is really haunted like Watson keeps carrying on or if it isn't. We get a few things that we see show that the place isn't, but there are things that still make you wonder as well. I also love that everyone is skeptical except him. It is really only Nora, who starts to come around as she keeps seeing stranger things.There is the interesting concept as well about the greed in the film. All of these characters are here for the money for completely different reasons. I won't lie, if this was offered to me, I would probably end up doing it. In most part, I don't believe in ghosts. There are some deeper issues here as well. Frederick is a highly jealous and cruel man. Annabelle married him for his money, but is cheating on him, or at least Frederick thinks she is. She won't leave him as she wants his money. The hatred between them is pretty high.One thing that I really needed to point out as I found it weird, there is a vat of acid in the basement of this place. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense that it would still be there. After the murder that occurred there, you'd think that it would be drained. That is unless the murder was never reported which is possible, but I don't see why Watson would keep that there. Now he is scared of the place so I could see him just avoiding it and never going down there until now. Just some thoughts on had on this.The film is also paced well. It doesn't waste any time getting the characters into the house and from there it builds tension all the way through. It is interesting that Dr. Trent keeps going on that being locked up here can cause hysteria, which is exactly what is happening with Nora. The tension really ramps up the more that she sees and her not knowing the truth of what is happening. I don't mind the ending as much as I did the first couple times seeing this. I still think it is a misstep to not take us all the way to morning personally.The acting in this film is amazing. I don't have much to say about Price except that he is at his best and shows why he truly is a horror film legend. Ohmart is solid as his wife that despises him, but is still coy about it. Something that really hit me here was their banter back and forth is one of the best parts of the film. Craig does a lot of screaming and she is great at it. Cook is actually very good in this film as well. He is the only believer that it is haunted at first and even though Nora starts to agree, he doesn't waiver at all in his beliefs. Leona Anderson plays a creepy woman, Mrs. Slydes, and does it very well; she might have the scariest part of the whole film. The rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed as well.Something I won't really harp on too much would be the effects of the film. They are done practically, which is really the only way at the time of this film coming out. I will say that the look of Mrs. Slydes. We see a couple moments where there is a dummy that looks like her. Other than that though, the rest of the effects are well done for me. There is a skeleton that doesn't move great, but when you see why it makes complete sense.I have to point out here the soundtrack before wrapping this up. The selections they made for the score was absolutely amazing. It makes each scene feel so creepy and I loved it. I think without this, I might not be as big a fan of the film, but whenever they need to build tension, they have the right selection of music playing.Now with that said, I would recommend this film if you are in haunted house films. Now this film makes you question if there is technically a real haunting here or something else happening here. I'm not a huge fan of the ending, but I get what they are doing. The acting in this film is amazing as well as the score of the film. The editing is well done in building tension and I thought the effects were good for the most part. I need to warn you that this is a classic coming from 1959 so it is in black and white. If you have an issue with that, avoid this film. If not, I definitely recommend this if you are into the genre.",House on Haunted Hill

I saw teen Hollywood remake of this picture last year, and that made me think this would be the same story, just made in a different decade. Yea, I was wrong. Whilst 1999's version was made to scare a young audience, this one has a different objective. This version is very classy, with good performances-- most of the time-, and too few scare scenes. In fact, it takes about 40 minutes of running to deliver a scary moment-- which made me prefer watching this in daylight. After that and some few moments, we discover there is not bad spirit, haunted house or anything, but just a farce to kill main character's wife. In my opinion, it has too much talk and too few action. I was lured in to this movie for a different reason. If you're looking for a scary movie with a good story, see the newest version.

Overall, though, it is a neatly accomplished effort to resurrect the 'old dark house' murder mystery of the 30s and 40s, a genre that pretty much came to an end after the Second World War. The house itself is something of a disappointment - the house in Castle's ""13 Ghosts"" seems more complicated and stranger than the art-deco job we've got here, and the interiors are pretty banal. But the characters are rather interesting, and for the most part believable given their biographies - and well acted throughout, especially by Cook Jr. and Vincent Price at his most sophisticated. Remembering that this is really a murder mystery, not a horror film, don't expect big shocks - pay attention to the puzzles.

82,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""House on Haunted Hill""- A William Castle classic filled with both genuine frights and a lot of camp. Great fun!",8,13 April 2017,"A melodramatic and wildly entertaining example of both fear and of camp, William Castle's 1959 release ""House on Haunted Hill"" is an indisputable classic of the horror genre. Feeling like both a loving tribute and even occasionally like a self-aware send-up to classic haunted-house tales, the film is nothing less than ghoulishly amusing and wickedly fun. With a low-budget charm, phenomenal performances from the likes of Vincent Price and some of the greatest old-school scares ever committed to film, it's still well-worth checking out for horror fans old and new alike.We follow eccentric millionaire Frederick Loren (Vincent Price), who at the urging of his spoiled wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart), throws the most peculiar of parties late one night. He rents out a supposed haunted house where seven people have been murdered, and offers a small group of guests $10,000 each if they can ""survive the night."" As the hours dwindle by, things begin to take a dark and twisted turn as doors open and close on their own, mysterious body-parts begin to appear... and death comes looking for the guests at the House on Haunted Hill...One of the more charming old-school horror releases, ""House on Haunted Hill"" is just a blast from the past. While it does have some of the greatest scares I've seen (including possibly the best jump-scare ever, which I will not spoil), it's never too frightening, and there's plenty of dark humor and fun character beats to lighten the mood. It knows when to ratchet up the tension perfectly, and I think it would make for a really great ""access"" film to show to older children who are interested in the genre. I know this spooked me half to death as a child... and I loved it for that!The film oozes some really nice atmosphere and quirky low-budget style that accents the story quite well. Without much money to play with, director Castle and writer Robb White make the most of what they have, with some really simple yet imaginative sequences that will keep the audience at the edge of their seat. There's even an acid-bath! How charming. White's script also gives each and every character their moment to shine- in particular Price and Ohmart, who are at their absolute best here. There's also a really fun, hammy performance by the delightful Elisha Cook as a wide-eyed, petrified man who had nearly been a victim of the house in the past. It's written deliciously over the top, and Cook is clearly having the time of his life in the role.A part of me wishes they still made great, old gimmick-fests like this. (A film that was notorious like many Castle productions for audience-participation gimmicks- in this case ""Emergo""... a system that would swing skeletons on wires over the audience during key moments.) While I do adore some modern horror releases, it's rare you see something that mixes classic ghostly chills with amusing camp so well. Horror films these days seem to take themselves a little too seriously (well, when they aren't just shameless cash-grab remakes that is.), with only the rare example of a film like this coming every once in a great while. We need a ""William Castle"" for the modern age.In the end, the film might not quite be perfect. It's got a few wonky moments where the tone doesn't quite jive and a few scenes feel out of place. But it's another fine example of a William Castle classic. Say what you will, but he knew how to put on a show! I give ""House on Haunted Hill"" a very good 8 out of 10.",House on Haunted Hill

Public domain from Allied Artists (Monogram Pictures). The skeleton at the end is so corny yet effective. On the ""roadshow"" attraction, a skeleton was rigged to move through the theater on overhead wires during the film. I hear the recent remake is dreadful. I haven't seen it. There is ""misinformation"" in at least one other user review. The fetching brunette actress was 24 when she made this film. She was murdered by her boyfriend at age 36. She did not kill herself.

It certainly was a good movie at it's time.  But we simply aren't watching the movie to it's fullest effect.  The best effect of course is how they did it in the theater.  Having a skeleton come out of the screen certainly would get my attention.  Seriously, the movie is hardly a haunting.  There is no ghosts in this movie.  It's totally set up by clever ol Price and dogtagged by the paranoid idiot.  At 74 minutes in length, I'm amazed how much different the 1999 version took it out.  These two movies cannot be compared.  The storyline is simply and utterly different.  One is about murder, the other is death by ghost.Still, for a $5 dvd, it certainly is a bit of fun to watch.

If you can, try to bear with it. The film pays off very nicely in its second half.Vincent Price gives one of his best performances as a seemingly deranged millionaire playboy who is giving his wife a gift she apparently does not want - a night with several strangers locked into an allegedly haunted house which has a tendency to murder its occupants. The strangers have been lured in by various promises - including $10k for anybody who survives the night. What follows is a series of highly improbable, sometimes laughable events which go on until about half way through the film - when Carolyn Craig's (somewhat over the top) female lead has been driven to the brink of insanity and is being held together only by an improbable hero - played by Richard Long. The film is well enough made, and the acting and directing are very good - especially Price and Ohmert (who I have often preferred to Marilyn Monroe)",House on Haunted Hill
89,gizmomogwai,"Ghost story, murder mystery, or both?",7,21 October 2009,"My continued viewings of horror and Halloween-themed movies and TV throughout this October have led me now to House on Haunted Hill, a 1959 movie starring Vincent Price. Price is a millionaire named Frederick Loren who offers five strangers thousands of dollars just to stay at an alleged haunted house for a night. This looks like a case of a rich man exploiting the needy for mere amusement- or is it something more? The owner is one of the five- a rare case of someone being paid simply for spending time at one of his own houses. He's not comfortable there, however, and warns that the ghosts will bring death to the group.The guest I was most interested in was Nora, and much of the movie centres on her. At one point she runs into a ghost of a freaky-looking old lady, getting a jump out of me. But then it turns out she's not a ghost, but rather a caretaker. This foreshadows how for the rest of the movie, we see no actual ghosts, and have no proof the house was really haunted. Hitchcock's Vertigo, which came out in the previous year, similarly looked like it was going to be about a woman possessed by a ghost. Then it turned out to be an act covering an elaborate murder plot. Here, too, deception and murder plots drive the story. It was good of them not to discount the possibility that the place may be haunted, though. We don't see the group surviving their stay at the house, so who knows, maybe they were attacked. This is a movie good for a mystery and for fun, but it's not as deep as Vertigo.Happy Halloween.",House on Haunted Hill

91,gftbiloxi,"Darling, The Only Ghoul In The House Is You!",8,20 May 2005,"William Castle liked to promote his films with gimmicks, and the gimmick for THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL was Emerg-O: at the peak of the action, a glowing skeleton ""emerged from the screen"" and flew out over the audience on a wire. By most accounts Emerg-O caused more laughter than chills, but fortunately Castle never relied on gimmicks alone: he also liked bona fide stars, and for HAUNTED HILL his star of choice was none other than the legendary horror star Vincent Price.Like most Castle films, HAUNTED HILL's plot reworks a well-worn theme. Millionaire Price and his wife Carol Ohmart give a ""haunted house party"" for five strangers chosen at random and promised ten thousand dollars if they last the night. The catch: the doors lock at midnight, after which there is no escape until the caretakers return in the morning. While the story itself doesn't hold many surprises, the script is unexpectedly witty, and Price plays it in a slightly prissy, very high-camp manner with a tremendous dose of the black humor for which he was so famous--and the little-known Carol Ohmart is every bit his match, snapping out memorable lines (""Darling, the only ghoul in the house is you!"") in every scene. Together they elevate the film well above what you might otherwise expect, and when combined with the largely wooden supporting cast and some of the silliest this-is-supposed-to-scare-you effects imaginable the result is a cult classic with plenty of camp appeal.In addition to Price and Ohmart, the film is also surprisingly atmospheric. Shot in and around one of Frank Lloyd Wright's more famous structures, the grainy ""late show"" look of the film (due more to accident and age than deliberate intent) is very entertaining, the cinematic devices (everything from disembodied heads, irises, and jump-cuts) are very appealing, and the sound track (which sounds like a mix of piano bass keyes, synthesizer, and soprano vocals) is exactly what you'd want for this obvious but extremely entertaining flick. Of all the Castle films, THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL is my personal favorite, and it should rate very high with fans of cult, camp, and Vincent Price. And I'll go further than that: of all his memorable appearances, I do believe this was among Price's best.

Supposedly shot by one of the guests, (the guns were loaded with blanks), Price exacts his revenge against his wife and her lover by throwing the lover into an acid vat.

94,jluis1984,Camp with class? Here it really works...,8,16 October 2006,"After a very prolific career directing B-movies and serials of genres such as Western and Crime films, director William Castle entered the rejuvenated horror genre in 1958 with ""Macabre"", a murder mystery that maybe would not be as well remembered if it hadn't started what would become Castle's trademark for the following years, the ""horror gimmick"". Castle's horror movies would become well-known for the innovative tricks it used to scare the audiences, however, his next film ""House on Haunted Hill"", showed not only an improved gimmick, but also a huge improvement in terms of the overall quality of the film. William Castle had found his style, and ""House on Haunted Hill"" was only the beginning.The story of ""House on Haunted Hill"" is at its core, a new twist to the ""old Dark House"" kind of Gothic horror tales that had existed since the literary origins of the genre. Vincent Price is Frederick Loren, an eccentric multi-millionaire that decides to give a horror-themed party for his wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart) in a very bizarre way. The strange party consist of inviting 5 strangers to an allegedly haunted house (where many murders have taken place), and to reward them with $10,000 if they manage to survive the night. As the challenge begins, strange events begin to happen and soon everyone wonders if there may be some true in the legend of the House on Haunted Hill.Written by Robb White, the story may be clichéd, but it's filled with excellent black comedy and has some very clever twists that give the film its very special charm. To expect a terrifying horror experience is to watch the film with the wrong attitude, as ""House on Haunted Hill"" moves more on the lines of subtle dark comedy with a dose of campy fun instead of graphic horror. Despite this tone, the film plays very good with the mystery that represents the House and the murders, and the ending still is one of the best surprises on film.William Castle directs this film following the conventions of the Gothic horror to the letter, but even when may had been a businessman first, he still was an artist, and shows off a very clever use of the camera to create mood an atmosphere. Castle was a huge fan of Alfred Hitchcock, and it shows as Castle's visual style in ""House on Haunted Hill"" owes a lot to Hitchcock's inventive use of the camera to tell a story (The master of suspense would ""return the favor"" a year later with his very own b-movie, ""Psycho""). Castle's elegant camera-work contrasts with the dark campy humor of the story giving the film its distinct tone, favored by the classic performances of Vincent Price and Elisha Cook.The legendary Vincent Price, who delivers an unforgettable performance with his enormous presence that makes his intentionally campy delivery even more enjoyable. Elisha Cook Jr. plays one of the guests at the party, Watson Pritchard, and his scene-stealing performance almost overshadows Price's (not an easy feat to accomplish). The surprise comes from Carol Ohmart, who plays Annabelle Loren, being a worthy counterpart to Price's character, as his character's gorgeous but treacherous wife. The rest of the cast is somewhat effective, with Carolyn Craig and Richard Long playing the ""heroes"" of the story with good results, although some other members of the cast are pretty average when compared to the previously mentioned actors.The biggest mistake one can make when watching ""House on Haunted Hill"" is to expect a fright-fest, as this is not a movie to watch for the scares (as they play along the camp humor the film has), but to enjoy with its witty written black comedy and the excellent deliver of the cast. While Castle's use of atmosphere and his camera-work do give the chills, it's never with the intention to actually scare, but simply to add to the tension and suspense the story has. I would recommend to watch the 1999 remake, as it follows the same basic plot but with no intentions to amuse, as it is a full-fledged horror film. Along with this movie it makes a nice contrast as it's always fun to check two VERY different ways to tell the same story.""House on Haunted Hill"" may look dated now, but it still packs the chills and the fun as if it had been released yesterday. One can only wonder about how it was to watch the film on the big screen and with Castle's gimmick at its peak, but still it is a nice experience for a dark rainy night.

Black and white was also perfect for this ""blast from the past"". It's really more properly labeled as ""Suspense"" or ""Thriller"", rather than ""Horror"", so don't let the supposed genre turn you away.

Whoever stays in the house for one night will earn $10,000. Those staying/surviving the nocturnal sleepover will encounter ghosts, ghouls, gunshots, corpses and more secret doors and passages than in a medieval castle. But is it a genuine spookfest, or just an elaborately staged hoax?It's Price's film and he dominates from the initial prologue where both he and house owner, Austin Pritchard (1 of the 5 guests) break the fourth wall and address the audience directly, backgrounding on why Pritchard's house was selected, as well as the choice of guests. Price effortlessly steals just about any scene he's in, ensuring we are never quite sure of whether he is a potential victim or villain. Elisha Cook in particular gives excellent support as the wimpy, drunken landlord, too fearful of the house's history to even live in it himself. Richard Long, arguably best known for his 50's/60's TV work, plays the erstwhile male hero, who Castle and writer Robb White, cleverly arrange to disappear for much of the climactic third act. On the female side of things, 2 of the 3 women scream their lungs out and Robert Mitchum's sister Julie, is around, but doesn't have an awful lot to do or say for that matter.It's classic Castle, so it's in black and white and the cinematography by Carl E.

That movie is a remake in name only, but this one is obviously more superior because it has the incredibly creepy presence of Vincent Price and the nervous tick of Elisha Cook. The ghosts aren't very scary, nor do we see anything really supernatural, but the atmosphere and uneasiness of this film makes for an incredible who done it story as you wonder who will get it. The set is intoxicating inasmuch as you never really see all of it, nor is it really explained what such a dangerous pit is doing in such a precarious spot in the basement. Such a matter isn't important. On the other side of the coin, the music and the special effects are rather hokey, but then when this was in the theaters, a lot of the teenagers would have been making out to have really bothered to pick this movie apart.

Why not, say the guests- (played by Carole Craig, Richard Long, Elisha Cook Jr, Julie Mitchum and Leona Anderson), little do they know that the eccentric Frederic has a wicked trick up his sleeve. Initially, it appears the house is haunted. There's the usual frightening scream coming from God knows where, strange noises, voices, lights coming off and on, and even a ghost. One of the guest is murdered. The mystery of whether this is real or a scheme concocted by the wicked house owner is what keeps this movie interesting. Vincent Price is doing one hell of a job in a role he is clearly at home with and when he is not chewing the scenes, he is really a noteworthy actor. The film was, for its time, successful. The original music included a Haunted Hill theme by Richard Kayne and Richard Loring (cheesy by today's standards), and the home is actually one of the many post-modern homes of famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. While ultimately there is little real horror, the cynical aspects of this film take over. Vincent Price's character is disgusting, cold and clearly having fun at the expense of people's lives and fears. The film was re-made in 1999 but is nothing like this classic.

100,Prichards12345,Full of plot holes - but so what?,7,17 June 2012,"House On Haunted Hill is one of those endearing old horror movies where it's best not to dwell too much on the details of the plot. When one starts to analyse it the movie becomes absurd; but like a ghost train, it's an entertaining ride. Indeed it even opens with a cacophony of screams!Blessed with the presence of Vincent Price, the Merchant of Menace is in his element as the suave and waspish Frederick Loren, millionaire businessman who invites a small group of strangers to his wife's birthday party. Reputedly haunted according to the nervy owner Watson Pritchard (an equally nervy Elisha Cook in fine form), 7 people have met horrible deaths in the house, and, as Pritchard states ""The ghosts are restless."" There's lots of enjoyable bickering between Price and his wife (Carol Ohmart) - it's quickly clear that these two hate each other. Has Loren secretly killed his 3 previous wives? Has Annabelle already tried to poison him? Guessing who is planning to murder who is part of the fun.The film uses shots of a famous Frank Lloyd Wright-designed house for Haunted Hill's exteriors; inside is drably Gothic. And the movie has hardly started before the unexplained events begin.It would be spoiling it to say too much, but the expert staging of some of the supernatural phenomena would have fooled Houdini - there's no way this stuff could be faked, yet that is part of the film's charm.Engagingly creaky - and cheeky to boot - House On Haunted Hill does not outstay its welcome.",House on Haunted Hill
101,Hayden-86055,Dated but enjoyable with a good premise,6,20 December 2020,"Vincent Price stars in this old black and white horror (there is a colourised version that I watched though) along with a decent line up of stars.The plot's where an eccentric millionaire invited five people to stay at a haunted house he's rented. If they survive the night they get $10,000. But, a lot of the film is just needless talk and one dimensional character development, at only 75 minutes long I feel like they didn't explore the characters enough in meaningful ways withoutScares wise it's very dated and quite funny in parts, but I did appreciate the cinematography and set work. However there's not much horror and a lot of it comes off comical or has no shock value.6/10: A good B movie but not amongst Price's best",House on Haunted Hill
102,davidcarniglia,Vincent Price Still Haunting the Hill,8,1 November 2017,"Along with many other reviewers, I first saw House on Haunted Hill as a kid. It took me a long time to shake its spooky feeling off, convinced as I was that certain elements (Price's wife appearing at Nora's window, the rope curling around Nora's feet) could not have been faked.OK, so it's just a movie, and those incidents were faked. Anyway, having seen it a few times recently, I'm intrigued by the plot. Price's character running the show; he runs two shows really: the ghost gambit with his guests,and the murder mystery. It's impossible to know what he's really up to until the last few scenes in the cellar.It's established early on that Price and his wife can't stand each other; Price mimics shooting her with a candlestick. Still, the murder mystery lurks in the background while the ghostly presences manifest themselves. We are left wondering--who/what is behind these machinations: Price? Pritchard? Price's wife? or, are they supposed to actually occur of their own volition? The revelations at the end bring both plots together. This is a great example of the murder mystery and horror genres merged in the same film.Pritchard remains an enigma. He frames the movie by introducing the characters and plot, and summing it up when it's played out. But he's really in his own world; he fits into the atmosphere of the house, even as he's repelled by it. He also establishes that none of the characters are what they seem to be. The guests are all needy/greedy. Nora has the most legitimate reason for wanting the money, but she's soon manipulated to the point that she becomes an hysterical loose cannon. When we think Loren is cornered, the clandestine couple (Loren's wife and the doctor) show their hand; suddenly Loren's let off the hook (kept out of the acid vat anyway).The movie teases us one way and then the other: will murders continue at the house? Since Pritchard owns the place, he should be the best informed. Obviously, like all the other characters, he's not a reliable witness either. This leaves the question: who's story is it? In other words, does the murder mystery explain everything else, or are we to believe that Pritchard's world of ghosts is the arbiter of fate?Even after all these years, and being a bit more skeptical than Pritchard, the caretaker's wife still scares me, and Price's genteel ghoulishness remains disarming. 8/10.",House on Haunted Hill

One such classmate invited her for a sleepover. We drove her to this home which in my opinion looked run down and downright scary. I personally would not enter this house but my daughter didn't waver and proceeding up the cracked pavement of their walkway to the front door and went inside. Millionaire Fredrick Loren (Vincent Price)has assembled a group of people from all walks of life to a rented mansion in which each guest would receive $10,000 if they stay the entire night and of course stay alive to enjoy the earnings. This unique edifice (which resembled a prison,) nestled on the Hollywood Hills has a tragic history filled with unsolved murders, carnage galore, and Ghosts? Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook) narrates his interest in this evil house of horrors as one of the returned guests. Previously Watson was found barely alive the next morning but his brother was murdered in such a grotesque way that he is coming back for a second attempt to survive the night. Pritchard, despite being drunk and paranoid claims he needs the money. Cook's narration is what sold me and grabbed my curiosity in this movie. Our distinguished questionably wealthy host Mr. Loren who coordinated this party without the help of his 4th Wife Annabel (Carol Ohmart), stays in her room with no interest in parties or guests but throws plenty of condescending remarks at her husband. There is no shortage of friction and nasty quips between them, Mr. Loren aims a Champagne bottle at her head which sets up a caveat of things to come. Annabel is wife #4 which raises the question as to what happened to the other three wives? All I know is Mr. Loren has a convenient alibi and attorneys. Besides Watson Pritchard, other guests include Actor Richard Long, Carolyn Craig (Nora Manning) hired for her fever-pitched screaming which is heard throughout the movie. Julie Mitchum plays a gambler, columnist and has a problem erasing a marked hand. Rounding out our list is Dr. David Trent (Alan Marshal). Marshal and Annabell have a secret romance brewing but our host Mr. Loren has other plans. Honorable mention to our scene-stealer the elderly, craggy Leona Anderson who plays a floating ghoul and doubles as Mrs. Slydes. When you get right down to it this movie really doesn't show any slashing or bloodshed but it does terrify you. A little Songbird described actor Vincent Price at his best. Brilliant with charismatic presents combined with a deadpan delivery. Will our guest make it through the night? Will Mr. Loren be a widower for the 4th time? Will Mrs. Loren be the merry widow with her new Doctor Boyfriend? Will Nora Stop screaming through the night? Will Miss Bridges stop rubbing her hands? Mr. Pitchard wondering will the ghosts come for you and you? As I watch this horror movie through the years I was first terrified but over time became a fan of horror/ comedy genre films. Vincent Price's lines are wry and comical in the scenes with his wife. To quote Lord Byron,"" All comedies end with marriage!"" Just one of those films that keep you wondering.

It's a grand old time. Between this and WHEN STRANGERS MARRY, Castle is growing on me quickly. The movie has the expected camp appeal, with over-the-top characters (the great Elisha Cook takes the cake in that department) and silly situations. It's also a pretty damn good thriller, one that doesn't feel too predictable. The script is compact, getting us straight into the action with minimal fuss, and contains some delightful dialogue. Good performances too, and not just from Price and Cook. It's hard not to get swept up in it, it's just a wickedly fun movie with some Gothic stylings.",House on Haunted Hill

The offer Loren makes to each individual invited guest is that if he or she will spend one night in the infamous House on Haunted Hill, where ghosts, haunting and murder has long been the norm, Loren (or his estate should he not survive the night)will pay that person $10,000 in cash! A mighty tempting offer but one which may well be at the cost of their very lives.What makes this such fun viewing time and time again is it has a wonderful, almost inescapable charm that invites you warmly in and then takes you firmly within its grasp. One of William Castle's finest efforts, this is your basic old dark house style murder mystery similar to the type so popular in films from the 1930s and 1940s where horror really isn't as much at the forefront as is suspense and intrigue. Sure there's several plot holes to be found if one examines things too closely but with scene stealing performances from our leads particularly Price, Ohmart and the disturbingly nervous Elisha Cook Jr., who really cares? This is grand fun even if the climactic effects are not pulled off as expertly as we might like. In the end, you should have had your fill of frights and fun.

106,nickenchuggets,Classic 1950s horror,10,4 October 2021,"I was a little late realizing it was October already, since I meant to review a horror film as soon as the month started. With Halloween not too far away, it's about time we begin to watch movies with an emphasis on unnerving the viewer, psychologically or otherwise. House on Haunted Hill is one of the best at doing this. It might appear dated by horror movie standards now because many more disturbing things have been released since, but many of those newer movies will be forgotten about very quickly and this one will continue to be a classic. The movie is about Vincent Price playing the part of a rich person named Frederick who wants 5 random guests to stay in his mansion in order to mark the celebration of his wife Annabelle's (Carol Ohmart) birthday. Frederick tells the guests he'll give them each 10k dollars if they manage to stay the entire night, since he has so much money he can give it away carelessly. Even though Annabelle and her husband seem like a happy couple from the guest's perspective, they actually hate each other. Frederick seems to think his wife tried to get him to ingest poison in order to claim his inheritance. Meanwhile, strange things start occurring throughout the house, and some of the guests witness paranormal activity. Later, each of the guests is given a Colt .45 handgun to protect themselves from the supposedly evil spirits. It really starts to get good once somebody discovers Annabelle's corpse, and suspicion immediately falls on Frederick. Little do they realize, Annabelle isn't actually dead. She just drugged herself to fool her husband. One of the guests shoots Frederick with one of the pistols he gave out earlier and his body is melted down in a pool of acid. Once Annabelle goes in the basement, Frederick's skeleton appears and attacks her. After it pushes her into the acid, it's revealed that Frederick is still alive and was using a batch of wires and strings to control the skeleton. He wasn't injured by the gunshot he took earlier, he just pretended to be. It turns out Frederick put blank cartridges in all the pistols. The movie ends on a disturbing note because you realize the house is definitely haunted by Annabelle's ghost now. In general, this film is not that creepy, but that's why I think it has appealed to so many people for decades on end. Only a few people can watch truly nightmarish movies like the Exorcist and remain unaffected mentally afterwards. The horror aspects in this are done in a campy style, which is more appealing in a lot of ways to genuinely creepy things that prey on your mind. Price is probably the main character, but in my opinion, the guests who are willing to step up to his challenge are the real ones we cheer for, since they must endure a whole night in a creepy house that may or may not be haunted. They are played by Richard Long, Alan Marshal, Carolyn Craig, Elisha Cook, and Julie Mitchum, sister of famed noir actor Robert Mitchum. These characters embody how the typical person would feel if they were in a similar situation to this. Not knowing what to do or when a ghost might suddenly show up. You would have to be brave to stay in a house full of violent and angry spirits who are strong enough to throw furniture. To summarize, House on Haunted Hill is (to me anyway) Vincent Price's most iconic role. He did perform in multiple genres, but horror was always his specialty. This movie cemented him as one of horror's all time best.",House on Haunted Hill

But the house is no ordinary house. This house has reputation for murder. Frederick offers them each a gun for protection. They will all arrived in a hearse and will either leave in it $10,000 richer or leave in it dead! Actors As the movie was produced in 1959, I have no knowledge on the stars what so ever, with the exception of Vincent Price. He plays a wonderful role, with even the simplest of actions seeming sinister. All the other stars seemed to portray wonderful characters which seemed so realistic. Carolyn Craig is the perfect helpless victim and her screams are so terrifying.Music Like many old horror films, the soundtrack is simply scary. The composer really knows how to add to the already creaking atmosphere of the film. It's just so perfect for this type of film.Special Effects I was quite surprised about the special effects in this film. They are well made and the make up is quite mysterious and can be considered scary. When the old lady appears looking like a ghost, I did genuinely feel freaked out by it.Conclusion Old black and white films are often a mixed bag for me. Sometimes I love them and sometimes I loath them, but 'House on Haunted Hill' was a surprise hit. I really enjoyed it and found many scenes in which I would either laugh, or sit in horror.

The only stipulation: The invitees must stay the night in the house. . . and survive! As a horror fan, it's a bit of an embarrassment not to have seen some of the great classics. Even moreso when it's a very common classic. House on Haunted Hill is one of those films that, for one reason or another, I simply never saw. Vincent Price is one of my favourite horror legends, William Castle's a helluva director, and I love haunted house movies. . . but, I just never got around to this little wonder. I'm glad that I finally did. William Castle creates a very moody and atmospheric film, perfectly exhibiting the gloom of the House on Haunted Hill. Robb White's script contains enough humour and plot movement to keep anyone entertained, young or old. While there are some cheesy moments (ah, it's William Castle!), there are plenty of creepy moments as well. Vincent Price puts forth a great performance. While not his best (I'd have to lean towards Theatre of Blood as his best), it's one of my new favourites (solely out of the entertainment I got to watch as he strutted around the house in his sinister and maniacal way. Overall, there's not much more that can be said that hasn't been said tons of times before. If you haven't seen it, please hurry to.

112,Coffee_in_the_Clink,And Then There Were ... Five?,7,23 March 2020,"I've little doubt that the bones of this eccentric and confidant haunted house film was somewhat influenced by the superb 1945 adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel ""And Then There Were None"", starring the great Irish actor Barry Fitzgerald . It's pretty much a horror version of that tale, led by the legendary Vincent Price, who plays a witty millionaire who invites five strangers to stay at a haunted house with him and his shrewd younger wife for a night. If the strangers agree to stay and survive the night they will each receive $10,000 (a rather large sum of money back in the '50s!). Amongst the group is the owner of the house, who believes the place is haunted and that they will all be killed before dawn by the ghosts of vengeful spirits of the people who have been murdered there in the past.William Castle was a very eccentric director and he well and truly leaves his mark all over this film. Running in just over seventy-minutes, it is a wild and whacky ride from start to finish, with creepy caretakers, decapitated heads turning up in random places, people hanging, all the haunted house tropes you'd find in the original Scooby Doo cartoons such as sliding doors and hidden rooms, a vat of acid in the basement and the now infamous scenes of a skeleton chasing a woman around a room. Logic is to be suspended when viewing, as the plot is fairly thin and I got the sense that Castle was not bothered at all by this. He was a showman, who just wanted to thrill and scare his audience. He didn't just leave it on the screen, either. The original showings of ""House on Haunted Hill"" featured the above-mentioned skeleton dropping down from the ceiling on a rope and frightening movie-goers. By the film's conclusion we come to learn that there are actually no ghosts haunting this place and there are in fact logical explanations for everything that goes on. This was intended to be clever and to be the movie's strong point in Robb White's script, I'd imagine, but unfortunately I think it inhibits the film by pretty much relegating the horror elements. The supernatural should have dominated. That's a minor quibble I have with this film but other than that it is brilliant and one that I have a penchant for.",House on Haunted Hill

Trust me, though, there is no really scary scene. I laughed at almost every scene, especially when the fake skeleton limply pushes Annebelle into the acid thus killing her. That looked so cheesy. By the way, yeah, this is one of those hokey and cheesy movies made in the 50's and 60's, but this is a darn good one.Here is the plot of this movie. Five strangers are invited by a millionaire to go to a mansion and have a nice little party. The only problem is that this is not a party. The five people actually have to spend the night in the house if they want $10,000. Sounds easy, right? Wrong. The house is haunted. During the night spooky things happen around the house. The millionaire's wife Annebelle is supposedly murdered, another guest Patrich is just creepy, a guest named Nora is scared of everything, and another guest named Trent does nothing. It turns out that Annebelle was never killed, and she and Trent try to kill the millionaire. They fail, and they fall in acid. Everyone else escapes.Overall, this is a cheesy and corny movie but it is very entertaining and you will get a few good laughs here and there. Some scenes are frightening, like when Nora is tapping on walls with Lance and a elderly woman on what appears to be on a skateboard comes out of nowhere and obviously frightens Nora, but you will definitely laugh at most scenes. Some scenes are overacted, and some acting is just plain weird, but a lot of characters are fun and nice, except for Patrich. He is just weird.

The ever inventive William Castle brought this exercise in chills to the screen, and on a shoestring budget at that, and shrewdly succeeded in making something out of nothing. The production values are cheap, but its the lighting, the shadows and a genuine creepy feel, a Castle trademark, that make this exercise into the macabre a winner. Of course a solid cast helps, lead by the master of horror, Vincent Price, who sets the ghoulish table by hosting a midnight ghost party, cleverly designed to expose his homicidal wife (so well played by Carol Ohmart). The film is brimming with Castle gags, taking top honors though, is Price offering his guests guns that are placed in miniature coffins. The appearance of Elisha Cook, Jr., is likewise memorable as a drunk who exchanges some good one liners and expressions with Price.

I never fancied horror as a genre because it's only out there to scare you but the way they did it in the old days was so much more than that. Naturally the scares were terrifying, and those screams, boy, I believe I haven't heard screams like that ever; practical and special effects were amazing as well. The movie plays tricks on you as it goes along, it messes with your head, making you doubt everything and everyone of those strangers involved in this little ""party"" in the haunted house.

Naturally the movie is not without mistakes, continuity errors, absence of logic, rough scene cuts but it has the most frightful soundtrack and the stellar cast to keep you company on this hell of a ride into the depths of the house and the minds of its one-time inhabitants as well as your own.

118,Catharina_Sweden,"Very dated, low budget, simple and crude special effects",5,30 March 2015,"This movie felt very dated. I think what disturbs me most, is that this haunted house-story is obviously aimed at an adult audience, and the characters/actors are also adult - a few of them even mature and elderly. Of course a haunted house-story can have adult characters as well, but the ""normal"" thing, is that the characters the audience is supposed to identify with are teenagers or young adults, and that the audience is supposed to be the same age or younger. The plot of ""House on Haunted Hill"", in my opinion, is too immature and silly for an adult audience, especially as the movie is taking itself so seriously. There is no element of irony, parody or comedy in it.Another reason that the movie seems so dated, is the very crude and simple special effects and masking. A low budget movie does not necessarily mean a bad movie, but this depends on what type of movie it is. A horror movie that relies a lot on special effects and masking, simply has to have an adequate budget for those things. In this movie they were so bad that I expected it to turn out to be a horror comedy after all - a parody on bad haunted house movies. But that was not the case...Al in all, I think this movie can be worth seeing once, just because it has become a ""cult"" horror movie.

And it doesn't disappoint. I love the house with it's sliding doors, acid bath and shadow play. Vincent Price in the lead is once again perfect casting with his trademark wryness, camp and sarcasm being demonstrated in spades. There also seems to be more understatement and, dare I say, nuance in this role.The film itself looks amazing. I wish director Castle would get the proper adoration and respect for his films and legacy. The gimmicks associated with his films seem to overshadow the actual films themselves. This is a shame. I honestly thing Castle was an auteur who seriously influenced the genre of horror for the better. The House on Haunted Hill influenced Hitchcock when he was making Psycho apparently. I'm wondering if Clouzot's Les Diaboliques influenced Castle's film with the numerous double-crossings and red herrings that keep the audience guessing until the very last frame.Emergo was the gimmick Castle used for this film. During a scene concerning a skeleton an actual skeleton on a pulley would be flown over the startled audience. Genius.This film is currently (and inexplicably) in the public domain.

120,Toronto85,House on Haunted Hill,8,5 April 2011,"This original House on Haunted Hill is an enjoyable thriller about a group of people who become forced to spend the night in a scary house. Fredrick Lauren (Vincent Price) invites five people to spend the night in a mansion with him and his wife. Once the clock strikes midnight, the gates will be closed and locked until the next morning. If they manage to stay alive by dawn, he will give each of them $10,000. The guests eventually arrive and we also learn that Fredrick's relationship with his wife Annabelle is very strained. It's revealed she even tried to poison him once before. The story behind the spook house is that a few people that lived there before were murdered and put into a vat of acid which still exists in the basement. Eventually Annabelle is found dead, hanging with a rope tied around her neck. One of the guests named Nora starts seeing her ghost and other scary things like heads appearing in her bedroom. Are all of the scares just a silly prank, or are the ghosts of the people murdered in the house haunting the living?This is a very fun and creepy little movie. I love watching these older fright films late at night, you really get a feel of how genuinely scary they were. This one has a bit of a murder mystery theme to it, as well as a supernatural feeling. There is a good twist which was copied in the 1999 remake, but not nearly as good. The vat of acid in the basement is a constant theme throughout the movie from start to the very end. The caretaker's old wife actually scared the crap out me when she appears from the darkness to scare Nora. The way she kind of floats along with that face.

Little things make this movie enjoyable: Price's casual conversation with his wife about her attempt to poison him; the quiet appearance and disappearance of the blind mother of the caretaker; the drops of blood on the back of the hand...Certainly, this film has atmosphere. The plot is rather like ""And Then There Were None"", but with a supernatural air. In fact, the movie is tight and enjoyable except for the dancing skeleton...oh and Carolyn Craig's performance as a scream-a-pillar.

A popular staple on public domain video labels, HOUSE has just recently received popularity because of a slapshod Hollywood remake that killed all atmosphere and originality from the original. Steer clear of this one AT ALL COSTS! This is the real deal.Vincent Price is Frederick Loren, a reclusive millionaire who offers 5 people $10,000 each if they can survive one night in a creepy old house with a history of murders in many of the rooms. Blood drips from ceilings, a ghostly old woman glides through walls, decapitated heads appear in the oddest places, and a vat of acid in the cellar plays a role in a secret plot to eliminate one of the guests. Superb stuff, with so much atmosphere you couldn't cut it with one of those samurai knives and great performances by the whole cast. Notable turns include Carol Ohmart as Annabelle Loren, Frederick's sexy wife; Elisha Cook, Jr. as Lawrence Pritchard, the expert on the house's history; and Carolyn Craig, the token screamer.I have loved this movie for years and always will, especially the intricate plot, the house itself being a prominent character, and the cliches that seem oddly new when presented here. HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL can still shake up a scare among the blood-and-guts crowd, myself included, so give it a try and you will be surprised how effective a film from the 50s can be.",House on Haunted Hill

Price, a ritzy wealthy bon vivant , suspects his unfaithful wife ? might be attempting an early demise for him.He invites 5 people to spend the night at his house,to flesh out the possible killer. (The Historic Ennis Brown Mansion), now in disrepair, irony. The character Watson Pritchard(Elijah Cook Jr.)is the catalyst that helps promote the spookiness of the film. The subplots provided by Richard Long and Carolyn Craig , are just filler. As fate would have it, there are ironic twists , and lessons to be learned about having vats of acids in your cellar. Newer generations may be bored by lack of violence or gore, or the fact there isn't much action, but this is just an innocent date movies from the 50,s. Something to occupy a few hours on a Fri.nite in the dark. Most people in the audience provided their own entertainment. William Castle graduated to bigger and better films such as ""Rosemary's Baby"" later in the 60's.So, in the context of the film world, this will never make the top 1000, but if you need a film to watch in the dark with your significant other, then you might look at this one...Enjoy...Even the Skeleton gets Credit...Ha..Ha...Haaaaaa..........",House on Haunted Hill

As time goes by, however, it becomes clear that something else is going on in the house. Something unnatural... or maybe not?It's a very enjoyable film, if you are a fan of the genre.

137,Kakueke,Price is right,10,19 November 2001,"I have watched my share of horror movies, altho I am not an expert on the genre, and I have seen different settings.  Of course, there can be mixed settings: a film about Dracula may take you to the Transylvanian outdoors, to streets or graveyards, as well as into the castle or mansion or whatever. But one way horror movies can be categorized is by whether most or all of the film is within a residence, or not.  Bearing this in mind, I think something special about horror films is having the victim(s) enclosed inside a mansion or home, with escape difficult or impossible, and terrorized by anything one can imagine -- moving furniture, metamorphosing paintings, spooks in the attic, odd remnants, lights on and off -- as part of the buildup for a real or expected attack, by a person or whatever.  The terror, suspense, is believing someone or something is or may be there, but where, and when, will it strike?  ""The Shining,"" ""Die! Die! My Darling,"" ""Beyond the Door,"" Behind Locked Doors,"" ""The Haunting.""   Although claustrophobia might generally be a negative for me in a movie, such as ""Rear Window"" (unlike most people, I do not really like it), in horror movies it is great, it makes the day.  If one looks at things this way, ""House on Haunted Hill"" can be seen as the quintessential horror film.Start with having Vincent Price in it, hopefully no arguments there.  He plays Frederick Loren, the affluent host of a ""party"" in which he invites five people, not including himself and his wife, to a haunted mansion on a hill in a challenge for each person to win $10,000 (at today's value, about $100,000) if that person stays in the mansion all night.  Among the five are Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook Jr.), an alcoholic, whose endemically spooked countenance sets the tone for what everyone is getting into.  Frightface or not, he bears an (eerie?) resemblance to evangelist Pat Robertson, whether or not he is actually as scary.  Altho Pritchard owns the house, he has spent little time in it, but he is nevertheless the expert on the circumstances surrounding seven deaths, including that of his brother, on the premises over many years.  Quickly, the other four get the message: they may be facing trouble.  And trouble begins quickly.  Part of the idea is that there is no escape out of the mansion after midnight, when the caretakers leave, and barricades ensure this.   Price's wife, Annabelle, is played by Carol Ohmart.  She is striking blond, gorgeous, with very fair skin.  In several scenes that I will not specify, her lightness is artfully contrasted against surrounding darkness by Director William Castle -- very beautiful, no special effects needed. Price has a jealous rage toward her and she in turn wants to get rid of him, as she has tried to do in the past.  What will happen tonight? 
Of the other four characters, the two with the stronger presences in the first half are Lance Schroeder (Richard Long), a handsome pilot, and Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig), a pretty typist for one of Loren's companies and the early lead screamer.  The other two are newspaper writer Ruth Bridgers (Julie Mitchum), who has a gambling problem, and Dr. David Trent (Alan Marshal), a psychiatrist interested in the subject of scared people.  A plot twist brings one of these latter two to greater prominence in the second half.The creaky doors, the body parts, the unexplained incidents all do their part in a movie in which black & white is such an essential.  The black & white cements the atmosphere we need for the ""house"" (mansion):  from a distance, from a close-up at the start of the movie, and then inside the mansion, everywhere.  For those who profess love for ""Casablanca"" and cry ""sacrilege"" when they see the colored version, I say, OK, the true version to me is the original, but the colorized version is just the colorized version, what's wrong with watching it too?  The movie still works in color, doesn't it, even if it is preferable in black & white?  To me, anyway.  But as to ""House on Haunted Hill"" -- even if I similarly would not cry ""sacrilege"" to a colorized version, I ask, can you think of any other movie in which black & while is so essential, in which a colorized version would lose so much?  Maybe you can, but I can't.Loren, with his ulterior motives, has a smug, rather commanding aura, knowing that each of the five needs the $10,000.  There can be skeletons in people's closets, yes.  And as Loren's plans are threatened with derailment, keep this in mind.",House on Haunted Hill

A bunch of guests invited to spend the night in the haunted house for a cash prize to whoever survives is a terrific premise for the theme. Adding in a sense of paranoia and double crossing between the guests and the hosts, though one guest having already survived the night seems to know all too well what's going on.

Not like the blood and gore in the movies in the 1970's. Most kids could see these without having nightmares. Vincent Price came across more like a highly educated creep than a real ghoul. This movie is a prime example of that.In a way though I think there was a great deal of tongue in cheek throughout the movie. Different cheesy lines and very cheesy situations. One of my favorites was someone was hanged off the stair rail, but we don't know who. The young guy is at the bottom where the rope was tied off and the doctor at the top.

Absolutely everything that occurs is laughably implausible and/or comically overdone, in particular Nora's sighting of the old lady ghost in the basement. This is a movie that sees no need to explain why, if this 'ghost' was really just the very unattractive caretaker's wife (as we see later on), she felt the need to hiss and hold out her hands in a ghostlike fashion while inexplicably in an empty cellar room. And, by the way, float and not walk. There's a lot more. Best moments: Richard Long plopping the severed head on a living room table, and Vincent Price reeling in the skeleton he used to scare his wife to death, a skeleton maneuvered by huge ropes somehow not visible earlier.

148,Snake-666,A delightfully devilish performance from Vincent Price makes for a truly wonderful and creepy experience.,7,29 March 2004,"In this chilling haunted house tale eccentric millionaire Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) offers five strangers $10,000 to stay one night in a sinister house with a murderous history. William Castle's classic haunted house flick is a testament to the quality of atmospheric, low-budget horror films that talented directors were able to produce back in the 1950's and 60's. Made for a mere two hundred thousand dollars, the movie captivates and enchants the viewer from the very beginning with truly eerie introductions from protagonists Frederick Loren and the slightly troubled Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook). Castle proficiently uses these opening monologues as the mood-setter for the film and one immediately becomes acquainted with Price's famous devilish charm. Some basic, yet wonderful visual shots of the cars approaching the ominous mansion act as the perfect catalyst for the audiences anxiety; a feeling which is managed and increased dexterously through Castle's breathtaking direction and superb use of lighting nearly all the way through the picture. Throughout House on Haunted Hill' there is a constant, unpleasant but welcome eeriness that lacks in so many modern horror films and while there are only maybe two or three truly startling moments, the continual foreboding tension of the piece is overwhelming enough to genuinely grab the viewer and absorb them into the world. How appropriate it therefore is that during Price's opening speech he essentially invites the viewer to bare witness to what unfolds during this fateful night. Of course, like all low-budget films there are flaws in the production which are rather noticeable. The storyline of the film seems to become somewhat confused and drawn out during the final third of the movie but picks up enough at the end to leave the viewer feeling satisfied. One could suggest that the virtuosity of the first half of the movie led to its own downfall during the second. With a horror movie such as this that begins with such malevolence and cunning, it is always difficult to continue to appreciate it when the movie fails to deliver later on what the early stages gave the viewer by the bucket full. Even so, the relative short running-time of the production allows for such problems in pacing and chills, and while one may start to become a little uninterested in the events periodically there is always a swift return to standard not too far away. During the sporadic moments when the story takes a minor turn for the worse, one can always be entertained by the remarkable character interaction and entertaining dialogue (as written by Robb White) and in particular, the performance of one Vincent Price. As usual, Price is commanding on-screen and convincingly portrays his calculating and baleful character. The early interaction between the character of Frederick Loren and his wife, Annabelle (Carol Ohmart) allowed Price to fully assert his character's persona into the film. These early scenes also aptly set the viewer's mind to work in figuring out just how this night will end. The two warring spouses are joined by Elisha Cook who is pleasant in his role as Watson Pritchard, despite being painfully irritating on minor occasions. Carolyn Craig also joins the cast as Nora Manning, a young woman quickly driven to apparent hysteria by the seemingly supernatural happenings in the house. It is a credit to Carolyn's acting ability that her performance was not only convincing but also commanded sympathy on occasion from the audience. The only real negative point one can give regarding the casting of the film was the inclusion of Julie Mitchum in the role of Ruth Bridgers. One has to question the point in including Julie in the production when for the vast majority of the movie it is far from obvious that her character is even there. One particular piece of dialogue towards the beginning gives the impression that she was only included to make up the numbers.
Despite some flaws, House on Haunted Hill' makes great viewing for the horror fan. While not up to the standard of amazing haunted house films like The Haunting' (1963), The Legend of Hell House' (1973) and The Changeling' (1980), there can be little doubt that House on Haunted Hill' is generally creepy with a couple of truly staggering moments. Not quite as predictable as one may expect and with a final plot-twist that displays a hint of originality, the movie is a horror-mystery which benefits from fine direction and forceful performances, especially from the legendary Vincent Price.

150,michaelgarykelley1994,Such An Awesome Flick For Halloweentime!,8,29 October 2018,"For the last few months, I've been wanting to see this film. I remember seeing a terrifying clip of it on Bravo's ""Top 100 Scariest Movie Moments Of All Time"", when I was a kid. I didn't even know Vincent Price was in it, until I started researching it. I just finished watching the film for the first time ever, and I'm so saddened. I love old, black-and-white thrillers, horrors, and just that general era of filmmaking in those genres. I'll watch anything on the planet, but that era is probably my personal favorite. But I truly wish I could've grown-up on this film. It was such an enjoyable flick. The only reason I got a chance to see this was from one of those Mill Creek 50 Movie Collections that tend to float around. I didn't even know I owned this film, even though I've had that particular box set for over five years.I'm truly happy I got to see this. It was so satisfying, for my kind of taste in films, especially for films from the 50s. It was everything I hoped it would be. A little goofy, actually a little scary, and a little like the horror films referenced in a film I DID grow-up with, called ""The Iron Giant"". This was perfect, if you like those elements in your types of movie watching. From a 23-year-old, I had a blast seeing this.The location is beautiful, and the actual building's design is so unique, on the outside. This is what iconic filmmaking is, in my opinion. The director did a magnificent job of developing the setting and tone, especially with the excellent opening of the movie, where I couldn't pull my eyes away from the monologue sequence.I'm honestly just stunned that I haven't seen this massive treat before!Even the cast is solid. Everyone plays their part well, with Vincent Price the most interesting character, as per usual with anything he's in.I genuinely found myself getting chills, at times, watching this. The atmosphere building is wonderful, and really pays-off, even though I could see people not enjoying the ending as much as I did. It's such a well-made movie, and I really wish more people gave movies like this credit, and called them outright classics. This is a film that deserves that special label.",House on Haunted Hill

It scared me so badly I nearly wet my pants and I had the screaming heebie-jeebies for a week afterward.About 20 years later, I saw it listed on a late night creature-feature show. I said, ""Oh, boy - I'm gonna stay up and watch it and get scared all over again!""  Laid in popcorn, drinks, etc., sat back, took a deep breath.... ...And said, ""What the hell?""  It's not a scary movie at all, it was one of Vincent's horror/comedy movies.

153,byrann_gowan,"Come and join the party, if you dare...",7,13 January 2012,"""House on Haunted Hill"" is about a millionaire whose wife decides to have a little night party at a so-called Haunted House. He invites 5 strangers to the party, and if they can survive until morning, then they'll all receive 10,000$. Hence the spooks begin.This is a great little horror movie that everybody should know about. It's got everything going for it, from the chills to the actors. My only complaint is that the story doesn't evolve that much, but there are some surprises in the end that I loved.First off, the acting. Let's start with the guests. Julie Mitchum is great as Ruth Bridgers, the columnist with a betting habit. Alan Grant is wonderful as the psychiatrist Dr. David Trent, who is a part of the surprise towards the end. Then, we have Elisha Cook, who does a fantastic job playing the fearful and paranoid Watson Pritchard. Richard Long plays the part of pilot Lance Schroeder, who seems to be in love with the main female character, Nora Manning, excellently portrayed by Carolyn Craig. Carol Ohmart is great as Annabelle Loren, the wife of Vincent Price in this film. She does a great job matching wits with Price's character, as the two basically hate each other in the film.But, let's not forget the main star himself, Vincent Price. When it comes to horror movies these days, you want to be compared to this guy, because he was the man of horror back in his day. With hits like this and ""House of Wax"" (both of which have had the adverse treatment known as the remake), he was a star, and this film clearly shows why. Even when he is voicing the rap on Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" (Yes, that's him), you can tell that he was made for these types of movies.This movie does not just succeed on actors, though. It also succeeds in the atmosphere and the ""jump-moments"" department. The house itself is quite spooky; every time one of the characters went off on their own, I was like ""No! Don't do it!"" Maybe I've seen too many horror movies to know that something bad is going to happen when they do that. And the moments that were supposed to be scary actually were scary. The part where one of the caretakers appear to scare crap out of Nora and then float on out of the room was actually pretty scary when I first saw it. This movie has it all.Overall, if you're a horror movie collector, then you should see this movie. Yes, it may have been made in the late 1950's, but it is a wonderfully done film. If I were you, I'd see this over the 1999 remake; I haven't seen that one, but if I know remakes, they are never as good as the original (Don't get me wrong, Geoffrey Rush is an amazing actor, but he's probably the only reason why I'd see the remake). A 9/10 for me.",House on Haunted Hill
154,IndridC0ld,The first horror film I remember seeing,9,27 October 2012,"So much has been written about this little gem of a film that I'll just add one detail. The old blind woman who ""floats"" around in the basement gives me chills 50 years later. Every now and again, when I'm wandering about in the dark, I'll think of that ""wall tapping"" scene, and find myself scrambling frantically for a light switch. I don't know what it is, but no moment in horror films has the power to scare me like that one. I remember as a kid, the worst practical joke I played on my kid sister was to wait until she had gone down into our creepy basement and play the creepy music from my old cassette recorder through the forced air heating duct. Of course, I would first turn out the lights from the switch (at the top of a rickety old staircase). She would utter screams that were not unlike those of Nora Manning. Ah...the things we do as kids.",House on Haunted Hill
155,neon47,Where's My Invitation?,7,8 June 2005,"House on Haunted Hill was a surprisingly good movie. I wasn't expecting what I got out of the movie. It kicks off with the introduction to the characters. I don't remember their names. Right from the beginning the movie reeks of conspiracy and once you get inside the room with just Vince and his wife mystery only builds. Through a tour of the house the drunk shows where all the people had died and makes the comment that no one was just simply killed in the house, all of the murders were very brutal. As the movie progresses one of the girls continues to see things in the house and becomes hysterical according to the psychiatrist. The overall movie is a great watch for Halloween, or those who just love horror movies in general. It'll keep you guessing on weather or not the ghosts are real. The ending is really good, I really don't wanna spoil any of that for you. Just watch it, you'll wish you were invited too.",House on Haunted Hill
156,manicgecko,His wife is so amusing,8,10 April 2006,"Enough horror schlock - it is time to go back to a classic. With few exceptions you cannot go wrong with Vincent Price, there is something about his deadpan deliveries, and overly stoic demeanor that can creep out a Jell-O television commercial. And this movie delivers. OK there are its share of ""what the..."" moments but the rest of the movie makes up for it.The music, atmosphere, and most of the acting (other than Goober McGhee the owner of the house) really lends itself to the ending. And for once the skeleton animation is supposed to look like a Harry Housen masterpiece. My only question - What purpose did the old lady serve? I guess we will never know. I am sure I will watch the remake - but I am afraid that the special effects and high budget will neglect the atmosphere and general feeling of paranoia that makes the original a classic.Must have for your horror collection.",House on Haunted Hill

At the time it was quite something, definitely showing Price's skills at being creepy as hell.Sadly today this movie is just dull and boring. Not a failing of the acting (though old timey screaming women is annoying) or the special effects (there was only so much they could do back then). But rather just that overall the story's pretty weak. It had a good idea, but delivery then compared to what we're used to now is simply leagues different.It's a decent enough movie to watch for reference. But not something to bother with if you want actual horror.",House on Haunted Hill
158,Kingkitsch,"""Damn you! ...and I'm not going to the party!""",9,20 September 2014,"So. William Castle made a lot of movies, but none better than his magnum opus ""House on Haunted Hill"". Not even the visceral thrills handed out in ""The Tingler"" can best HOHH for sheer deliciousness.HOHH is really the ultimate Halloween epic, a tale of five greedy strangers invited to a ""haunted house party"" by an eccentric millionaire played by the iconic Vincent Price in one of his best performances. By turns arch, angry, and amused, Price steals every scene he's in. He's matched turn for turn by the blonde bombshell playing his philandering and murderous wife, the lovely Carol Ohmart. Each guest has been promised $10,000 to stay the night. A huge sum in 1959, the cash lures the invitees (all of whom need the money for various reasons) into being locked inside the house once midnight has passed. The house, which in a clever turn by Castle, is not the Gothic wreck we associate with hauntings, but a modern style of architecture which is no less forbidding once the party gets underway. Seven murders have occurred inside the fortress-like house, supposedly by ghosts who remain at large inside. Weasel supreme, Elisha Cook Jr. owns the house, but it's driven him crazy. His brother was among the murdered who now haunt the joint. Cook's shaky performance really drives the narrative, especially in the scene where he relates the story of the house. He's a freakshow himself, a regular Cassandra who flatly tells everyone they will be dead by dawn. Without relating the entirety of the plot, several classic scenes need to be mentioned: 1.The first appearance of the caretaker's wife, scaring the living daylights out of the secretary in the cellar's hidden room. It must be mentioned that the secretary, played by Carolyn Craig, is a world champion screamer. 2. The further unhinging of the secretary in the ""hanging sequence"". 3. Price's delivery of the party favors, which are revolvers housed in their own tiny coffins. 4. The appearing heads that ""whisper to each other...and then cry"". They do get around the house, even without legs. 5. The denouement of the wandering wife via an apparently living skeleton. And so on.Filmed in crisp black and white, with an often witty script by Robb White, this spookshow has never been topped. Even the multimillion dollar remake of HOHH in 1999 couldn't best it, despite the CG generated spooks on display. Once the mayhem is over, we get one of the most disturbing lines ever uttered as the movie comes to a close, Elisha Cook's drunken assurance that the ghosts are still around ""restless...hungry. First they'll come for me - and then they'll come for you"". We hear the ghosts moving in. Door closes on the survivors. Still chilling after fifty years. Oh, and that skeleton! Castle's standard ballyhoo for HOHH was the gimmick Emerg-O, in which a glow-in-the-dark skeleton was released on a wire to glide over the heads of the audience at the film's climax. According to Castle's autobiography ""Step Right Up! I'm Gonna Scare the Pants Off America"", that poor skeleton had to be retired since kids would stay through repeated showings of the movie, armed with things to throw at the bones, ultimately making the removal of the poor thing mandatory. I should know, I was one of those kids. Highly recommended for ghost lovers and other who enjoy their spooks with a side of Price.",House on Haunted Hill
159,lucianomarzo92,Good Movie,6,21 August 2009,"This movie is a very campy and overacted, though it is well-made considering its plot, and good for a couple of cheap thrills. House on Haunted Hill is surprisingly entertaining. It is rather lame though, if you're expecting something scary. Despite the fact that it is blatantly campy, it's a very fun movie. You just can't except much, it being a mainstream horror movie from the 50's. When I saw this movie, I was really into watching Horror. I also wanted to watch something scary, and whenever something wasn't scary enough, I couldn't help but feel disappointed. But in retrospect, it's actually a pretty good movie. I did jump once in the movie, though only because of a disfigured face and a sudden loud noise. I can imagine House on Haunted Hill not being scary even the year it came out. Movies like this are probably what you would want to show your kids if they are interested in horror, and you know it's not time to show them the Night of the Living Dead. It could be used to give them a little taste of the horror genre. It is really good for something like that, or if for some reason you are in the mood for an old campy movie. It should do the trick for that too. Though it does not stand out too much as a great horror film. It has a few scenes that really scream 1959, when it was made. I wouldn't recommend it as a scary movie, but if you just want to have a good time watching an old movie, then this might be for you.",House on Haunted Hill

161,underfire35,Weird And Effective.........,7,31 July 2005,"***No Spoilers Now, Read On.*** Six people have been invited to spend one night in a haunted house (don't worry it gets better). If they do, they will each receive ten-thousand US dollars. The house is rented, and the event orchestrated by, the eccentric kagillionare Frederick Loren (Vincent Price). Or is it, in fact, his wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart)? The film keeps you guessing at the true purpose of the gathering and who is behind it. Those who accept Loren's invitation are: Lance Schroeder (Richard Long), a test-pilot, or racecar driver (I forget, something masculine and dangerous though); Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig), a ""pretty"" young thing who must provide for her family; Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook), a drunk, who has murky familial ties to the true owners of the house; Ruth Bridger (Julie Mitchum) is a society page columnist who is known to over imbibe on games of chance; Dr. David Trent (Alan Marshal) has a particular interest in the psychology of hysteria (dark humors in the bile and what not) and views the event not just as a payday, but as an opportunity to gain insight into his area of study. They all need the money, for some reason or another, and willfully follow Loren into the imposingly Gothic house. He explains, over drinks, the rules of the night and that the doors will be locked at midnight.....from the outside! Nobody can get in or out, the windows being barred like a prison or.....a tomb! Anyway, they get a guided tour of the mansion from Pritchard who points out interesting features like the ceiling that drips blood, the pit filled with flesh dissolving acid in the wine cellar, and the spacious breakfast nook. Before everyone retires to their respective rooms, Loren presents them each with a ""party favor"": a small coffin containing a handgun. As the night proceeds, strange and unexplainable things occur, causing the guests to grow suspicious of one another and their hosts. The bumps in the night draw successively closer and then, out in the hallway, there is a scream........***Be Warned, (Mild) Spoilers Start Here.*** THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL starts out as a standard ""haunted house"" picture until we realize that the only ""ghouls"" in this creaky old mansion are the people themselves. Greed, lust and betrayal are no match for ephemeral specters. However, the film never addresses whether the house is really haunted or not. Strange things do happen which defy explanation. The apparition outside of the second floor window or the rope that moves of its own volition would seem laborious to fake even for seasoned snake-oil peddlers like the Lorens. Could it be that they don't know or that perhaps they don't care, preferring another layer of confusion to mask their intentions? I have a feeling that director William Castle put these scenes in to keep people guessing, or confused, or scared, but ultimately entertained. Castle is infamous as the guy who put buzzers in the seats at movie theaters to shock people during THE TINGLER (1959) and at the end of THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL he reportedly hung a plastic skeleton from wires, sending it dancing above the audience (it was a simpler time then, when mild electrical shocks did not result in angry lawsuits). Castle was renown for such gimmicks and would become the unofficial inspiration for 1993's Matinée (which features a great performance by John Goodman). In THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, the cast and crew never take the story too seriously and the film has a kind of tongue-in-cheek camp charm. Yeah, there's holes in the plot and stuff that doesn't make sense, but it's got Vincent Price and vats of acid. What more could you want? 7/10",House on Haunted Hill

163,GeorgeSickler,A darn good flick for the era with surprise special effects at the ending,8,24 April 2019,"For 1958, this was a decent movie towards the end of the era when the movie industry was still finding ways to compete with television. They were terrified of the thought that families would stay home and watch the tube for free rather than pay money to go to the theater. They hadn't yet learned that there was a profitable aftermarket for a movie after it's theater run expired. They never believed anybody would want to see a movie again on TV, or even for the first time, by making profitable deals with the networks.So, Hollywood came up with 3-D movies, color movies during the B&W TV era, Cinnerama (sp?), Cinnmascope wise-screen, etc. (Let TV compete with THAT!)Anyway, Carol Ohmart was screaming, and screaming, and screaming in the basement in the final scenes. The TV audience today might be wondering why. In many theaters during the theatrical release, there was a wire strung from the theater balcony to the top of the screen. Someone had the job of winding-down a full-size skeleton from the balcony, across and above the audience, to the top of the screen. The spotlight went off, the skeleton got yanked up in time with the movie skeleton to appear on the screen.Sure, it's ""hokey"" by today's standards.

The 20's, 30's,40's, and 50's and some 60's were great horror decades. This movie is from that era.The story goes as follows, a rich man and his wife invite five people to his mansion. But this is not any ordinary mansion, supposedly it's haunted. He invites them for a ""Ghost Party"" and starting at midnight, whoever survives the night until the morning will win $10,000. At first everyone thinks this guys party is a joke, but then things start to get creepier and out of place. Heads appear, ghost appear, a woman kills herself (or so we think). And the night becomes a living hell for each individual person.The Five Guest 1. A Doctor 2. An old Widowed woman 3. A pilot 4. A young woman who works for the host company 5. A previous owner of the mansion, who knows it's haunted and dangerousAs things play out, we find out that some things have been a scary joke,and and some things have not. Out of these seven people the host and his wife included, three of them play major roles in the nights events. As the movie progressed I knew something was fishy about the whole event, it's not until halfway into the film I found out what was really going on, and I loved how the story play's out.

165,LobotomousMonk,Presto-Chango!,7,28 February 2013,"Send in the floating heads! Castle gets to employ one of his popular horror motifs in the opening sequence as a superfluous prologue from two of the film's main characters (Pritchard and Loren) provide some unnecessary details on the adventure to come. What do we know? There will be wretched screams and menacing moans, also that we are dealing with a haunted house, and that the characters have all been invited to this house by an elusively-motivated millionaire host. That is to say, we already know too much. This direct address prologue is on-the-nose and should have been out the window. Speaking of windows, what's up with that rope? Subjective paranoia and supernatural spooks start to blend well in this film but rely a little to heavily on contrivance and diversion. Haunted Hill is a very self-reflexive film text with only one elegant and genial introspective moment (Price's Loren character coyly glances at the camera as he passes by it just after the first real spook moment from within the house). Is Loren the mastermind of terror or hapless victim of forces beyond his control? The question was played out soundly in this original and the Malone remake. Although the story of Haunted Hill does not thrill, the directing is quite proficient. If I remain true to my own thesis (Castle directed well only the good scripts he worked with) then surely I am not valuing this story as I should. Castle compensates for my criticism through good staging/blocking (old lady spook well foregrounded in the frame) and strong use of the long take and mobile framing (creating a sense of psychological presence for the spectator). This film is more genuinely amusing than Macabre but is rife with silly contrivance which tends to disrupt the pace and tone. The highlight of the film (nope, not Emergo) is the Ohmart-Price banter (significantly better than Rush and Janssen in the remake). The Loren marriage relationship drives the narrative as it should. There are some clever moments in the story that spark questions about the nature of spook contrivance, namely that perhaps the story is told from the warped psychology of one of the characters (maybe even emanating from the 'injured head' of the seemingly most stable character). Price's own character unveils his 'Emergo' contraption near the end, which of course was accompanied by Castle's Emergo ""live"" version put right into the theatres at the time. The gimmick is far-fetched and digressive from the story itself, but I imagine it was a lot of fun for audiences at the time. Castle was now beginning to get himself a reputation as a producer-director worth supporting. He was also finding success at the box office which would bode well for the production value of later films.",House on Haunted Hill

Directed by the incomparable shock master, William Castle, it has all the elements for a good scary movie.Vincent Price portrays Frederick Loren, a wealthy businessman who has rented out a haunted house that has been the scene of several murders for an all night party for several people. He offers $10,000.00 to anyone who stays in the house overnight.Without giving too much away, there are several chilling moments in the film. Ghosts, an old woman who looks like a wicked witch, a walking skeleton, an acid pit in the dark and creepy basement and a suicide by Loren's beautiful wife Annabelle (played with frosty efficiency by Carol Ohmart) or is her death really a murder? There are several good supporting actors such as Richard Long and Carolyn Craig who help keep the movie entertaining.The 1999 remake of this classic film simply cannot hold a candle to the original.

At the time, most of the movie went over my head (and seeing it cut to pieces to fit broadcast television surely didn't help). But I find that, now that I am capable of following the twists and turns of the plot, I only love it more.All the things that drew me in years ago are still cool - the creepy caretakers, Elisha Cook, Jr.'s haunted expressions, the blood dripping from the ceiling, the head in the suitcase, the vat of acid in the basement, and a dozen other creepy visuals. ""Rich with atmosphere"" doesn't even begin to describe it.But now, on top of that, there's the complicated who's-trying-to-murder-whom plot line, presided over by Vincent Price and Carol Ohmart, both obviously reveling in the opportunity to play such vicious, spiteful, wicked people. Each believes they've set up this little party to murder the other, using the other party guests as pawns in their deadly game.

178,criticman2000,It is what it is,8,27 June 2005,"I love William Castle, and have for decades. What you never see written about him is that he obviously had an obsession with the work of Alfred Hitchock, from whom he steals liberally. This was the second in his long line of shock flicks. They just don't make them like this anymore. Incoherent, pointless, unintentionally hilarious and yet with some of the creepiest moments known to man. Castle was the master of the creep-out. Obviously the cast was aware how little sense any of this made at the time. Vincent Price, in particular, has amazing fun with his role as the rich, bored, effete host of an all night party in an honest-to-goodness haunted house (and a beaut it is, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright).What transpires next, is mayhem, and you can talk yourself into the fact that a black and white pot boiler from 1959 could not possibly get a rise out of you, but you'd be wrong, of course. Listen, nobody did it like Castle, before or since. For one thing the man understood the scare value of sound. He had to, he was very cheap. At any rate, this is a unique viewing experience, with brilliant timing, great performances and plot holes you could drive a semi through. It matters not. Suspend that rationality and enjoy. Incidentally, Castle's undervalued ""Homicidal"", is the greatest rip-off of ""Psycho"" ever, and a great film in it's own right, whereas his ""The Tingler"", may well be the greatest horror film ever made, and the most original of his schlock output. By the way, just in case you think Castle had no real talent, watch his brilliant production job on ""Rosemary's Baby"".",House on Haunted Hill

If there were such an Oscar category as a Best Scream', she'd surely be a strong contender.Haunted Hill is great Sunday afternoon fun  a light fright flick with Vincent Price superb as a dashing and deliciously wicked villain.
The film is pretty light on scares (although one little scene made me and my viewing partner nearly jump out of our skins) and the story pretty thin and silly, but there's loads to enjoy in this 75 minute feature. The house itself looks great in black and white  surreal, foreboding and sumptuousMy biggest annoyance with Haunted Hill is that it starts out with a tantalizing premise and an assortment of shifty-eyed, odd ball characters (the middle aged female columnist and gambling addict is my personal favourite), but the ensuing plot doesn't make use of the premise as much as it should and the characters aren't fleshed out anywhere near as much as they could have been. Still, we're talking William Castle here, not Stanley Kubric so one can't complain too much.Overall, Haunted Hill is great fun for a rainy weekend afternoon.

Frederick invites five random strangers and offers $10,000 to anyone who makes it through the night. my thoughts: This is a very fun Vincent Price ghost film. It has a good plot, creepy music, the characters are well casted, and I love the now stereotypical setting. The dark, creepy mansion (even though it used to be a prison).

There was another actress, Carolyn Craig, who throughout the movie was a screamer, she had some lines but did more screaming than anything else. I started to laugh, she did it so much, her lungs and voice got a good workout on this movie. There were two kind of a funny scenes, the first wasn't meant to be funny but Carolyn Craig went running down the hall past Vincent Price's bedroom screaming her head off, two or three seconds latter, Alan Marshal, who played a psychiatrist walks to Vincent Price's door and knocks, Price opens the door and says, did you hear something? The second funny scene was a skeleton floats out of the acid vat and chases Vincent Price's wife around the basement until she falls in the acid, a false wall opens and Price walks out wearing a contraption with thick string controlling the skeleton, actually he looked like he was getting tangled up in the string. Maybe the acid works on skin but not on string. Elijah Cook Jr was also in the movie, his lines basically were, the ghosts are all around us, they are getting closer, you never really see any ghosts, except a crazy looking old lady. Carolyn goes running upstairs screaming into the living room, everybody says what happened, she told them she saw a ghost in the basement and describes it, Vincent Price says, that's not a ghost,that's the caretakers wife.",House on Haunted Hill

I would go as far as to say that ""The House on Haunted Hill"" is one of the best haunted house movies I've ever seen. It's got it all. There's a unique house that locks its victims in at midnight. There's its reputation for murdering anyone who is stupid enough to remain there overnight. There's a blind female caretaker who wanders around in the dark for no reason. And there's Vicent Price, who offers the perfect mix of black comedy and genuine spookiness.The only problem I have with the picture is its ending, which suggests that it was all Price's doing and that there are no real ghosts on Haunted Hill.

Frederick invites a motley crew of guests as party attendees for his wife's party, offering each of them $10k to stay all night locked in the haunted house, scene of multiple murders in the past. One of the guests, the house owner Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook Jr.), is a survivor of a previous incident during which his brother was murdered. And seemingly two steps away from being committed himself, Pritchard has returned to warn the others of the terrors of this house and possibly meet his fate. The action revolves around the murder plot and forces test pilot Lance Schroeder (Richard Long), into an investigation of the house's secrets in order to find a way out of the house, so he can contact the authorities. Scream queen secretary/typist Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig) forces the pace along screaming the place down and jumping at shadows at every opportunity.Although this film was made in 1959, it follows the normal path of this type of haunted house movie, where a clueless group of people are frightened into taking precipitous actions while armed with guns - due to sheer terror.

However, maybe not for the reason that I usually like Castle films - to laugh at B-movie horror flicks.'House on Haunted Hill' is actually a pretty darn good movie.  Sure the special effects aren't the greatest, but it was made in 1958 for crying out loud.  Vincent Price's performance as the slightly psychotic Fredrick Loren is one of his better roles - he is absolutely believable (and a little bit scary).The movie has some great horror story elements, like the two disembodied heads that show up in the oddest places (and are said to whisper to each other at night), blood dripping from the ceiling, an old hag who 'glides' across the floor, a haunted house, creepy caretakers,... the list goes on and on.But the REAL reason this film gets a big thumbs up from me is that despite its age, despite its lack of realistic special effects...

The first thing I thought was, Wow, this sounds like a reality television show... except for with murder, special effects galore, and a lot more deceit. I think the best part about this movie was watching my eight-year old sister, a huge horror film fan, gasp and scream and react to the film, which she wholeheartedly enjoyed. Intellectually, The Last Man on Earth has a lot more to grab onto, but The House on Haunted Hill has the cheap thrills, screams, and moments of suspense that have undeniably made it a cult classic.

It's my favorite haunted house movie, although, despite Watson Pritchard's boast that he will show us ""the only truly haunted house in the world"", we never see a single ghost in this film (kind of like watching Ghost Hunters or any of those paranormal reality shows).Vincent Price is perfect as Frederick Loren, the millionaire playboy trying to get rid of his fifth wife. Carol Ohmart is his greedy, but beautiful wife. Elisha Cook steals the show as the drunken Watson Pritchard who ""lives in mortal terror of this house"". Every line Cook utters is something to the effect that they're all going to die and there's nothing they can do about it.Carolyn Craig is the cute secretary, Nora Manning.

There are certain scenes that stay in my mind and the best generally involve Price...for example, down in the cellar with the acid bath as his character dispatches his tiresome wife into the afterlife with what is supposedly his own ghostly skeleton...only it's hard not to notice that where he once towered over his wife, she now towers over his bones. It's an hilarious scene.So too is the one where the grizzled old bat of a house keeper seemingly floats along the cellar floor. In typical 50s horror fashion, the lead female (the one the evil wife and doctor are trying to drive insane) is expected to scream....a lot. This film over does that...I generally mute the TV when I know she's about to let rip! Vincent Price is his usual hammy self...he seems to be really enjoying himself...it's hard not to join him with House on Haunted Hill!

200,Madluke91,Ghosts or trickery?,7,3 April 2009,"House on Haunted Hill (1959) is a classic horror movie, that is arguably the best of the haunted mansion sub-genre films. It is almost a who/what-dunnit film. It has a mysterious, macabre feel to it throughout.The film is about a party being held at a rich couples mansion. Vincent Price, who plays the millionaire owner of the mansion, plays a rather odd, man-of-few-words character. The party entails that for whoever can stay the whole night shall win $10,000 dollars. The idea of the party is not Frederick Loren's (Price's) idea however; the idea is that of his wife. However, it is Frederick Loren who picks the participants.It is clear from the outset that the rich couple have a strange relationship, with the wife seemingly wanting Frederick Loren dead, and Frederick Loren having a shady past, with 3 other dead wives.The film has a very dark atmospheric feel, and uses noises to create scares; for example creaking doors and ghostly sounds. As such, we don't really see much in the area of ghosts throughout the movie, and what you have is a mystery; you don't quite know whether the mansion is haunted or not. There is also exquisite cinematography, and use of lighting all which vastly add to creating the macabre feel of this movie.The acting in the film is a double-sided coin. Some of the performances are particularly good. I think you can possibly guess that as usual Vincent Price puts in an awesome performance. He has a looming presence, dark and mysterious, but seeming rather charming and austere at the same time. Carolyn Craig, playing the cute, naive, rather childish Nora Manning also puts in a memborable performance. She in many ways fills in the protagonist role, as you have someone you are routing for to survive.The rest of a cast does a respectable job, but none really stand out.The film also has a cheaply made movie feel, but utilises it very well, relying on a cleverly written story that is told at a speedy pace. The film isn't action packed, but is a twisting turning tale of murder, mystery, the supernatural and the dark side of humanity.A must see for horror fans, film-noir fans, fans of who-dunnits and the like.",House on Haunted Hill

I just watched the movie again, now I'm 50. I remember that when I first watched the movie, the house looked much more terrifing, the head in the suitcase, the floating blind women and the skeleton at the acid vat, all evoked multiple screams from us and countless re-enactments in our treehouse. Now, it all looks pretty tame and with the doctor and wife plotting to kill...well, it isn't HORRIFING any more, just another murder mystery. Even though with all it's old special effects and Nora's endless blood chilling screams, It did bring back a 'house full' of memories that I will always hold dear. The remake of this movie, with all of it's new special effects and blinding color, should have been named something completely different, because the only thing these two movies have in common is the ""Stay the night and get paid"" story line. This movie goes in my ""Classics"" box with ""The Blob,The Mysterians, The Angry red Planet, The H-man and many others that are my Time machine- back to when movies like these and a good imagination ,enabled us to have endless fun.

The plot too is interesting with a group of people being offered a large amount of money ($10,000 in the 50's would probably be like $100,000 today) to try and stick it out in a supposed ""haunted"" house. To me that would be fun if offered that deal...knowing that it was a set-up and that all the ""scares"" and ghouls would be awaiting.But, then part way into the movie real murders start happening and waiting to see who is behind them is almost like a ghostly film noir.

Nobody else. The only thing the rest of the cast is good for is walking around really slowly. When somebody scans a room for threats, the camera pans at glacial speed. Who's the murderer? The characters say that they should lock themselves in their rooms, and whomever is caught not doing that is totally admitting guilt. That'll hold up in court!

Why does Price's wife always cheat on him with a doctor?(Don't believe me, watch Pit and the Pendulum.) Maybe Price just should have avoided doctors, or doctors should have avoided Price.

As I remember it, I fidgeted in my chair, giggled uncontrollably, and never for a minute took my eyes off the TV.The plot for ""House on Haunted Hill"" is kind of ingenious, but it's also kind of absurd. There are a few holes in it, and by that I mean HOLES... but the atmospherics are great, and the witty, nuanced dialogue is head and shoulders above what horror fans are accustomed to.At the center, of course, is your host, Vincent Price, at his sly, elegant best. Price said of William Castle: ""He wasn't a great filmmaker, but he knew how to make this kind of film."" His respect for the material shows, and he nails the part of the mysterious, morally ambiguous Fredrick Loren with every word that comes out of his mouth. His final soliloquay at the denouement is delivered with all the care that actors usually reserve for Shakespeare. Obviously, he's having a great time.Of course, some gorehounds and younger viewers aren't going to ""get"" this. There are not many special effects, no monsters, and the severed heads look phoney. ""The House on Haunted Hill"" is tame by today's standards, but it holds up well for its atmosphere and wit. Sophisticated and silly at once.Other highlights include Carole Ohmart as Fredrick's wife Annibelle, Elisha Cook as Watson Pritchard, the half-mad, half-visionary owner of the house, and some terrific theme music.",House on Haunted Hill
210,COLIN_GAIL,house on haunted hill 1959,10,25 November 2005,"HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL is a strange film as Vincent price is excellent in this one its where people have to spend 12 hours in a haunted house for 10 grand. they could die or survive its horrible disturbing shocker its better then its modern version which is average compared to this one. my mother saw this one at Holt picture house when she was 15 it scared her, i got it on DVD and the pilm scared her yet again cant be bad i love movies like these as carnival of souls 1962 is my all time favourite movie. HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL is a masterpiece i love it i say get it if you have never seen this one. i will say the hanging scene hurt me as a friend of mine did this so that hurts me badly i don't like that mind you, get HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL for one great movie.",House on Haunted Hill
211,von Sikken,xx,9,17 July 1999,"i gave this movie on the rating thing a, 10. probably didnt deserve it, but i love it. vincent price is great in it. it doesnt really have that great acting or great script. i think the music and vincent price make the film. i dont think the remake of this film later this year will work so well. i dont think this one would have been any good without vincent price. anyways its a great movie, it gives u an awesome haunted house feeling i guess, and the cheesy part with the skeleton is funny, as is a lot of this film, now.",House on Haunted Hill
212,sarah_howard,Groovy-for a film that old!,7,9 June 2000,"I wasn't expecting the film to be that good, what with it being made well before I was born. (but then again, so was Alien, and that's a classic). But it turned out to be really good. It can't be compared to the newer version (1999), because that one's miles better. With it starring Chris Kattan and all!",House on Haunted Hill
213,CrazyCurlsChica,First they'll come for me...,7,3 September 2011,"Oscar worthy movie, this is not, but if you are looking for a truly creepy movie, then this will suffice.Vincent Price is exquisite and encompasses his character's personality with perfection.There are some good scares in the movie as well, namely 2 that come to mind that caused me to jump out of my seat! The remake of this version is an abomination and is full of disturbing imagery that was never this film's intent.The last line of the film sends chills down my spine, and of course, it would be uttered by none other than the voice himself...Vincent Price!",House on Haunted Hill
214,GSiessel,"Much Better Than The Remake, This One Is Eerie",8,26 January 2007,"This is a very creepy film that employs all of the Haunted House tricks seen in various other movies but there is a difference. As a kid I saw this film and was terrified by two scenes in particular, the old woman in the basement and the hanging woman outside the window with the snake like hanging rope. Both of these scenes terrified me for years later.It is probably a good thing I didn't see this movie with William Castle's special Emergo effect (a skeleton would descend into the theater during an appropriate black-out section in the movie) because I would have created a new exit at the movie house.The basic plot of the movie is about a very rich man inviting several strangers to his wife's birthday party at a haunted house. Soon people start to disappear and die. Vincent Price as the host is exquisitely sinister and Elisha Cook Jr. plays his part with the utmost feeling which helps the atmosphere along.Watch this one with the lights out and get goose-pimples and shudders from a well made spooky movie.",House on Haunted Hill
215,janeywan,A horror classic,8,26 February 2006,"SPOILERS I first saw this as a child. Even then I noticed some inconsistencies in the story - how the strings on the skeleton were invisible and were apparently impervious to the acid, how Nora didn't notice the head in her suitcase was made of rubber among other things. But did we care? We thought it was wonderful! Pure camp. We watched this movie so many times that we memorized all the lines. It also features the best screaming session in horror movie history. This is one of the best Vincent Price films, although he seems somewhat bored in the role. Elisha Cook is particularly ghoulish as the narrator.Oops, I've said too much. The ghosts are coming for me now...",House on Haunted Hill
216,drod005,Terror,6,28 March 2011,"The idea for the movie was good but i feel that it could have been done with more suspense to get people on the edges of there seats. That's what real horror movies do. They tried remaking the movie in 1999 but it also didn't live up to its expectations. i liked the original (this one) better than the newer one. Knowing the technology they had in 1999 they could have most definitely done way better. Some of the older movies are scarier than movies today but that's not all the time.

219,jb_goode,The best late night viewing ever.,9,1 November 1998,"Had this movie been produced a decade later, it would have been a TV movie - perhaps a movie of the week!  It would have drawn huge ratings not only because of the cast but also the setting. The house (a Frank Lloyd Wright classic - the outside, that is) is a draw in itself.  The special effects are strictly 50s but that only adds to the nostalgia factor.

Everything about this movie is just done right, from the unsettling music, the decor, the dialogs between the characters, but especially the plottwist in the end of the movie.

222,Emil_H,A truly effective thriller,9,8 March 1999,"Among the films of William Castle, House on Haunted Hill stands as testimony to the success one can achieve with a great atmospheric theme. While the plot is somewhat lacking, the real draw is in the mood of the film: powerful storms, a maze-like haunted house, paranoid guests brandishing pistols against a menace that may or may not be real.  From the opening sequence showing the arrival of the strangers, escorted in hearses, to the final pan out the door of the house as sinister laughter fills the air, this movie manages to make the skin crawl and will undoubtedly cause the audience to look over their shoulders a few times.  To anyone looking for a good thrill to enjoy alone in the dark, this movie offers exactly what's needed.",House on Haunted Hill

224,geddesd,Good fun,7,18 October 2000,"This 1958 black and white horror flick is great fun and of course what makes it so is the over the top performance of Vincent Price.

225,Mudsharks,THE classic William Castle horror flick,8,29 July 2001,"William Castle will always hold a place in my heart for reasons two-fold.
First, he majored in horror movies when I was a boy in the fifties. Second, and more importantly, he was the master of the ""gimmick"" horror flick. The Tingler, 13 Ghosts, Mr. Sardonicus, and House on Haunted Hill all had a special gimmick to bring in the audiences.The last was his masterpiece.  A truly frightening film. Not scary due to special effects, but due to atmosphere.  In this day and age the advancements in special effects, especially CGI,  allow any director with a budget to ""show"" you the horrific.  Back in the fifties, horror had to be suggested on the screen, but created in your gut, in order to work.  On haunted hill, you could feel the house in your gut.SPOILERS AHEADBy setting up not only the characters but the house itself as a possible source of malevolence, the horror felt real.  The head in the box, the ceiling that dripped blood on the hands of the next possible victim, and the walking skeleton all trod the line between the possibilities of having been planned by someone in the house, or being actions of the house itself.
The old woman floating across the basement floor may be the scariest moment in all of the fright films of the fifties.FILM END SPOILER - GIMMICK EXPLAINEDAs to the gimmick, unfortunately you'll never get to enjoy it.  But when I saw this as a boy in 1958, it was the coolest thing I'd ever seen in a motion picture palace.  I sat in the balcony as the film's final scene unfolded.  A skeleton rises out of the acid pit in the basement and approaches Annabelle Loren (Carol Ohmart) the wife of Frederick Loren (Vincent Price).  It manouvers around her until she, retreating, walks backwards and falls into the acid pit.Then, to my utter amazement, the skeleton walked out of the frame and began to float out over the audience towards the balcony.  As it neared the top, you could then see Price on screen, operating the fake skeleton that he'd used to murder his wife. The fact that you were viewing a fake skeleton on wires in reality, while on screen Price manipulates a device consisting of wires and pulleys made the combination of cinema and live action a seamless and logical fit.Obviously, when you see the film today, you'll miss the thrill of celluloid becoming flesh.  Or lack thereof.But it represents the pinnacle of William Castles use of a gimmick to make his films stand out from the crowd.  The fact that it appears in the film that was his best regardless of gimmicks is what makes House on Haunted Hill well worth a look.BTW, in case you're wondering, I'll illuminate the gimmicks attached to the other films I mentioned.For 13 Ghosts, glasses were handed out that resembled early 3-D glasses. Made of paper with one red and one blue lens, patrons were advised to put on the glasses and cover one eye if brave enough, the other eye if frightened of ghosts.  The film was black and white, the ghosts depicted in red. So if you looked through the red lens, the ghosts dissappeared.  The blue lens allowed you to view the ghosts.For Mr. Sardonicus, the story of a man who robs a grave for a valuable ring, there were two different final reels available to the theatre management. When it was time for the story's final reel, the house lights would come up and an employee would take to the stage to conduct a vote.  Depending upon the will of the audience, Sardonicus would be saved, or meet a horrible end.The Tingler, was shot in black and white, but blood in the film was in color.  The lynchpin of the story is the concept that fear, if not alleviated by a scream, can kill.  A creature, the tingler, grows on your spine when you're frightened, and is eliminated when you scream. The gimmick?  The theatre seats were wired with a mild electrical shock. But more than that, in the final scene, a tingler would scurry down the theatre aisle.All of these followed House on Haunted Hill.  But the films themselves were just ok, or worse.  House however, stands on it's own, gimmick aside.  See it.",House on Haunted Hill
226,adamg211,Less is More,9,11 April 2011,"A lot of things have become cliché, to the point where no one uses them anymore, but this film is one of the originals that made it work; a large, wealthy house, where every room has a history. Strangers come together out of greed, with no common past, no reason to trust or distrust each other. Strange sounds and subtle touches make everyone jump, and no one knows who to believe. Throughout the film you don't know if there are ghosts, or if it's some kind of trick. There are enough coincidences to make you wonder, but that's all. ""Less is more"", and it's just right.http://www.hulu.com/watch/70582/house-on-haunted-hill",House on Haunted Hill
227,GregOM,Classic Horror,8,28 April 2011,"House on Haunted Hill (1959) is a classic horror movie that has aged remarkably well compared to most films of the time. The overacting, that often defines this genre, only occasionally appears, and even Vincent Price remains remarkably understated (by his standards, at least). The director William Castle, whom many consider the ""low-budget"" Hitchcock, keeps the audience off balance with superb pacing by alternating scares and plot twists to wonderful effect. Whether you are a fan of the genre or not, this classic movie illustrates that the strength of storytelling and acting far outweighs the power of modern special effects.

228,raesthedead,A classic 50s era horror movie,9,15 September 2018,"House on Haunted Hill (1959) is a sophisticated horror movie from the late 50s era. I can fully see why this has been said to be a classic, it gives off a Cluedo vibe with a hint of darkness. Vincent Price is a master and performed wonderfully, as did the others all gave great performances. As someone who is taking a look back at older movies, to understand the history, development & growth of the industry this still remains a must watch. Though it may come across ""cheesy"" & not aged well for modern horror we have to remember that this was back in a time where this was considered horror over blood and gore which seems to be the standard for today's audience.Overall an enjoyable watch and deserves a place in my collection.",House on Haunted Hill

Most people have stated that $10,000.00 was a great deal of money in 1958 and that is true. If you go along with the consumer price index for 1958; $10,000.00 is equal to $65,600.00 at 2005 prices. I thought I would send this in for the sticklers for detail out there. Also, I would be interested in finding out if anyone might know how many of the on screen characters were still alive? From what I have been able to figure Julie Mitchum was the only surviving one. Also the caretaker and his wife would have had to be in on it with Mrs. Loren and the Psychiatrist because they showed up to scare the young girl and ended up locking everyone in the house before they could decide to leave or not. It's too bad that was not mentioned somewhere in the finished editing.",House on Haunted Hill

Of course, ""The Haunted House on the Hill"" has none of the resonance of the true title, so I get why it is what it is, but still....And, of course, the ""hill"" has nothing to do with the movie. At the outset, we see the hearses approaching up a long, winding road -- that's good, as are the shots of the car interiors with each character clutching the long strap that (I guess) hangs on the inside of the back seats of hearses. Then there's the (hilltop) house, which looks like Prince Valiant's getaway. But it would have been nice if, somehow, the ""haunted hill"" aspect played more of a role. Ah well....",House on Haunted Hill

The top 2 scariest things was when the freaky lady came. I knew it was the caretaker's wife but I wondered how she floated. In and out of the movie.I was so scared of that part because her pupils were missing! only ghosts can remove their pupils! And the other thing. I always wondered how she floated. Did they hang her from a thick string? I always thought that was it because it seemed the most possible and because I noticed her shoulders were going up. The next scary thing was when the skeleton came out of the acid. The weird thing about all scary or horror movies (except ""The thing"" because there were no women!)is every time at least the woman is scared first. This time the host played the trick on his own wife! I was so scared I felt like I was going to faint! You might wonder what I meant by tricked. The weird thing was that even in the movie, it was all a trick. A plot. The most absolute scariest part was at the end.

After all these years, it still has the ability to cause major chills and goosebumps. Younger viewers might find it sophomoric compared to the high tech horrors in today's films, but this movie proves how effective simple techniques can be. 
One note:. This movie is NOT a film version of the equally famous, Shirley Jackson story, ""The Haunting of Hill House"". The two are frequently confused for each other.",House on Haunted Hill
