0,MartinHafer,"Possibly the greatest silent film--if not, at least one of the very best",10,23 July 2006,"I am so happy that I saw this film again recently on Turner Classic Movies. I first saw it many years ago on a cheap public domain videotape and I was not that impressed by the film. The print was of dubious quality and the story itself not overly impressive. BUT, when TCM released a newly restored version, the print was nearly pristine, the new orchestra music was fantastic and actually fit the film and, more importantly, the film was significantly longer--by about 20 minutes! It seems that over the years, so much of this film was cut here and there and the film degraded so much, that anyone watching these inferior versions is strongly recommended to see it again in its better form. Now this better form isn't 100% perfect, as there were a few tiny places where they had to insert stills to complete the scenes (a practice becoming more and more common with restored silent films and even some sound ones like LOST HORIZON).The story, now that I see it in its original form, isn't really just a sci-fi movie per se--and that is what elevates it to greatness. Instead, it's a wonderful allegory about alienation and modern society. It's talk of unions and revolution was very potent stuff in its day and considering what was going on in Germany at the time, the over-blown sci-fi aspect of the film ignores the struggle between Communism and a Fascism. Superb direction, sets and a grandeur few films of the day can come close to equaling. An absolute must-see.",Metropolis
1,TheLittleSongbird,Influential sci-fi masterpiece,10,4 March 2011,"What is to say about Metropolis that hasn't been said already? For me, probably very little. Metropolis is an awe-inspiring and influential masterpiece of the sci-fi genre, and one of the best movies I have seen in recent memory.Metropolis perfectly demonstrates the artistic vision of director Fritz Lang. Lang was a fine and intelligent director, and Metropolis shows this loud and clear as Lang's direction is superb. The film is very rarely boring to me, both the pace and length were well-judged in my view, and while the message may seem muddled to some people for others including me perhaps it is relevant and even powerful.The music is haunting, beautiful and evocative, the story really impresses with its originality and the acting is expressive, although silent the facial expressions and gestures speak volumes. The best part about Metropolis and what resonates with me are the visuals, the cinematography is fluid same with the lighting while the costumes and effects are wonderful, but the real revelations are the city landscapes and settings which are gorgeous.All in all, a brilliant film and an influential film not only of the genre but of cinema itself. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Metropolis
2,Leofwine_draca,Highly influential German futurist classic,7,23 September 2016,"METROPOLIS is perhaps the most famous film in German director Fritz Lang's long career and it's certainly an iconic movie. Who can forget the sight of the mad scientist bringing his machine to life and giving it the body of Brigitte Helm? The film as a whole is iconic and hugely influential in its depiction of a dystopian future, but what's most interesting is just how many genres are packed into one film.Don't let the lengthy running time put you off: this is one of those fast-paced epics in which you lose track of time and forget the minutes stretching out. It's a little slow to start off as it carefully depicts a futuristic world with some great surrealist moments - Freder's vision of the terrifying Moloch is straight from Bosch and completely fascinating. Later, the film draws in romance, Frankenstein-style scientific experiments and apparatus, adventure and derring-do against a master villain, and even a disaster film.The special effects are doubtlessly dated but still look absolutely great to this viewer, particularly the futuristic city set and the destructive scenes in the second half. Helm gives a tour de force performance in a dual role. Lang remembers to give his film a human heart, which is the crucial thing about it, making it accessible even to viewers watching some ninety years later.",Metropolis
3,SnoopyStyle,Silent era icon,10,26 July 2014,"In the futuristic city of Metropolis, wealthy residents live a bright easy life up in the sunshine while the poor suffer down below maintaining the machinery. The workers live in a deep underground city. Freder Fredersen is one of the privileged who live in luxury above. His father Joh Fredersen is the founder of Metropolis. Beautiful Maria leads a group of children up to the surface and is quickly sent back. Freder tries to follow but discovers the horrific working conditions. He goes to the Tower of Babel to speak to his father but he is unmoved. Freder switches place with one of the workers. Joh comes to see old fellow inventor Rotwang to find him still obsessing about their mutual love of Hel, Freder's dead mother. Rotwang has created a robot with a devious plan. There are mysterious maps that have been discovered among the workers. Freder is invited to listen to Maria as she retells the story of Babel and the need for a heart to mediate between the hands and the head. The crowd is restless for change. Freder wants to be the mediator. Joh and Rotwang followed the maps to the meeting. Joh tells Rotwang to make the robot into Maria to sow discontent with her followers. Rotwang has a different idea to destroy the city.This is the height of silent era movie-making. The story is fairly simple. The characters are clear cut icons of good and evil. The acting is definitely silent era. The images are ahead of its time. The fact that they are still influencing films of today says it all. This film will always be one of the cornerstones of silent movie-making.",Metropolis
4,Hitchcoc,It set the bar very high.,10,4 May 2006,"I first saw this in a science fiction class in college. It was an actual movie in class. Wow! I had read about Fritz Lange and his contributions to the cinema and I had seen still pictures from this film. I was astonished that it had been made in 1927. The special effects, particularly those within the city, are amazing. The basic premise, the haves and the have nots works very well. Lange turned his people into machines and had them toil darkly for little, reducing them to automatons. This is remindful of ""The City in the Clouds,"" a Star Trek episode where those in power can't fathom what the enslaved miners must do every day. Of course it's about collectivism and socialism and all those other -isms. It's also about people and how they come to see themselves as oppressors. The fun-loving lifestyle is set in the middle of the poverty and pain of those who have nothing. There are wonderful expressions in close ups of faces, both expressing their misery and being empathetic toward it. The film gathers momentum toward revolution. It's the age old story. It's presented in a masterful way. Perhaps this is the best of all the silent films because of its content and its political implications. I wonder what the capitalists of the early 20th century thought of the movie.",Metropolis
5,Horst_In_Translation,One of the silent film classics,6,11 August 2015,"""Metropolis"" is a German movie from almost 90 years ago. It's black-and-white, a silent film and information differs about its runtime, simply because there are so many versions out there. The currently relevant version runs for roughly 2.5 hours. I remember that they found new footage in Argentina that was considered lost before. Unfortunately, the possibly most important scene of the entire movie, namely the fight sequence between Fredersen and Rotwang is still missing. I really hope this one reappears at some point as well, even if chances are slim. Anyway, Fritz Lang and Thea von Harbou have come up with some of the biggest silent film classics, especially in terms of European cinema. von Harbou was married to Lang when ""Metropolis"" was made and she was married to Rudolf Klein-Rogge earlier as well, the man who plays the evil scientist in this film. It's pretty sad to see that there is an abrupt ending to Lang's and von Harbou's streak of success when Nazis took over in Germany in 1933. I mean they still made movies, but their most famous works were from before that era. Of course, this makes totally sense as ""Metropolis"" is a film about the importance of equality and tolerance, while making a statement against violence. This could not be appreciated by the Nazi Party.Alfred Abel is listed first from the cast here, but in my opinion the real star is Brigitte Helm who gives an incredible performance as a caring and loving young woman and as the exact opposite, an evil machine. But this is not supposed to discredit Abel in any way. He was good and so were Klein-Rogge, Fröhlich and everybody else. I remember liking this more when I watched it the first time, but I still enjoyed this recent viewing too, which is especially great as I am not too big on these old silent films usually and I never felt that it really started to drag which is an even bigger achievement given the runtime of 150 minutes. There is everything in terms of the story. An important lesson on society and how people should treat those who are not as wealthy as themselves, a convincing love story, an equally convincing tormented father-son relationship, some supernatural elements, truly dreadful antagonists and excellent drama. This film is a winner and everybody who enjoys silent films more than I do will definitely have a great time watching here. Thumbs up for ""Metropolis"".",Metropolis
6,Prismark10,Futuristic Babel,8,22 September 2016,"In the 1980s there were several night clubs that would use scenes from Metropolis in a loop on a television screen while music was played on the dance floor. The rock group Queen featured scenes from Fritz Lang's 1927 German expressionist science fiction film.Metropolis was the most expensive film ever made up at the time and it shows with some dazzling scenes of a towering futuristic city with skyscrapers, flying planes, elevated trains. For the thinkers who are the elites above ground, life is good. Below ground are the workers toiling away in grim slave like conditions servicing the machinery that controls the city.Joh Fredersen is the capitalist oligarch who runs Metropolis from his skyscraper with ruthlessness. His son Freder lives an idyllic life with the other elites in the pleasure garden until he clocks a beautiful working class teacher named Maria with a group of destitute kids.Maria having seen how the wealthy live rouses the workers to revolt and Freder who goes looking for Maria sees the inhuman working conditions below ground where workers are killed because of accidents.Freder tells his father of what he has seen but I get the impression that his father knows what is happening. Fredersen goes to see the mad scientist Rotwang who created the city's colossal machines but is also working in creating a man-machine (robot) which would eventually look like Maria and behave like femme fatale driving men to a frenzy. Rotwang will use the robot in an attempt to destroy Fredersen and the city.The special effects are breathtaking even to this day, it owes a lot to the art deco movement and German expressionism. It has inspired films such as Blade Runner which also dealt with human-like robots and Batman (1989) with the scale and darkness of Gotham city as well as countless other science fiction films.The acting though is on the exaggerated side even for silent cinema.",Metropolis
7,claudio_carvalho,Heart is the Mediator Between Brains and Muscles - A Futuristic View of the Fight of Classes,10,26 January 2006,"In the future, the society of Metropolis is divided in two social classes: the workers, who live in the underground below the machines level, and the dominant classes that lives on the surface. The workers are controlled by their leader Maria (Brigitte Helm), who wants to find a mediator between the upper class lords and the workers, since she believes that a heart would be necessary between brains and muscles. Maria meets Freder Fredersen (Gustav Fröhlich), the son of the Lord of Metropolis Johhan Fredersen (Alfred Abel), in a meeting of the workers, and they fall in love for each other. Meanwhile, Johhan decides that the workers are no longer necessary for Metropolis, and uses a robot pretending to be Maria to promote a revolution of the working class and eliminate them.""Metropolis"" is a fantastic futuristic view of the fight of classes. When ""Metropolis"" was shot, it was a romantic revolutionary period of mankind history, with socialist movements around the world. Fritz Lang directed and wrote the screenplay of this masterpiece certainly inspired in this historical moment and defending a position of agreement and understanding between both sides, showing that they need each other. I wonder how this great director was able to produce such special effects in 1927, with very primitive cameras and equipment. The city of Metropolis is visibly inspired in New York. The performance of Brigitte Helm is stunning in her double role, and this movie is mandatory for any person that says that like cinema as an art. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Metropolis""Note: On 05 March 2019, I saw this film again on Blu-Ray.",Metropolis
8,classicsoncall,"""Who are the slaves of the machines?""",8,31 July 2005,"""There can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator."" This is the predominant theme of ""Metropolis"", and director Fritz Lang finds numerous ways to say and visualize his message during the course of the film. The movie relies on repeated visual imagery to make it's point, and does so effectively even if tedious at times. Particularly effective is the representation of the worker society as an almost single living unit, moving trance like to their appointed time and task. The use of a ""ten hour"" clock in the workers' chamber constantly draws our attention, as does the hangdog posture of the individual slaves who grind out their workday as if in a daze.Amid this rabble, worker Maria (Brigitte Helm) is the inspirational voice of the workers, offering hope for a brighter future by a mediator yet to appear. However the Master of Metropolis John Frederson (Alfred Abel) sees in her a way to quell the underlying frustration of the workers, commissioning his scientist Rotwang to create a robot Maria to plant discord among the workers. Rotwang's laboratory would have done Frankenstein proud, and the creation of the robot is a marvel of cinematic imagery. The robot Maria's ""belly dance"" transforms into a scene of such raw energy and sexual awareness that it awakens the statues of the Seven Deadly Sins, one of the master strokes of this expressionist film.So much imagery in fact is layered into ""Metropolis"" that it's safe to say that repeat viewings will lead to even more interpretations of it's vision, and not simply for it's denunciation of a class society. Both timely and timeless, the film captures a dynamism that inspires passion even after nearly eighty years following it's original release.",Metropolis
9,gavin6942,Almost Flawless Film,9,25 May 2011,"In a futuristic city sharply divided between the working class and the city planners, the son of the city's mastermind falls in love with a working class prophet who predicts the coming of a savior to mediate their differences.Wow. Fritz Lang with history's greatest cameraman, Karl Freund, creates a world of the future that is all too present-day. The pro-labor, pro-union message is blatantly obvious, but presented in a compelling way. Almost in a socialist way, though not quite.I do not even want to write a review of this one because anything I say will not do it justice. I do want to point out the need to watch the ""complete"" version from Kino. I once tried to watch a public domain version, and it was awful. I do not think I made it twenty minutes. Kino knows what they are doing -- the picture is sharp, clear and the score is excellent. And if you are going to watch a film, you must watch it with the footage restored. Sadly, the additional footage has not been cleaned up, but as no negative exists you have to be impressed.With regard to the Giorgio Moroder version (also available from Kino), this is excellent and perhaps a good introduction for those who may not be interested in silent films. Moroder essentially created an 80-minute music video, which may not be strictly faithful to Lang's intent, but makes the film interesting to watch for the MTV generation.",Metropolis
10,jboothmillard,Metropolis,10,30 December 2008,"It was in my book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I knew it was a silent film, but when I got the opportunity to try it, I am very pleased I did, from director Fritz Lang (M, The Big Heat). I should mention the film was originally 2 hours and 23 minutes in length when it was released, much of the footage has been lost, but with what has remained, this shortened (1 hour and 59 minutes) version of the sci-fi masterpiece is still an inspiration. Anyway, set in the future (2000, or 2026, both of which far away back then) in the city of Metropolis, and the humans are divided into two groups: thinkers (who enjoy the life in the city, not knowing how anything works), and the workers (who run the city from underground, and achieve all the goals). One thinker, Freder (Gustav Fröhlich), son of the city's running man John Fredersen (Alfred Abel), dares to go below after following his love interest Maria (Brigitte Helm), and after experiencing their world for himself, he joins her cause to try and get both worlds together. Meanwhile, Freder's father discovers scientist C.A. Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) has created a robot, that will take the form of Maria, to get control of the underworld back, and get Freder out the way. The real Maria is imprisoned by Rotwang, while her copy is appearing on stage (in the city) as an exotic dancer. Unfortunately the Maria copy returns to the underworld, and plans for all the workers to rebel, and destroy the ""Heart Machine"" that powers the city. Neither Freder nor Grot (Heinrich George), the machine's foreman, can stop them, and as a result, the machine is destroyed, and the city becomes flooded with both revolting workers and water. In the end, Grot and all the workers finds Maria, who the hold responsible, and they burn her to death, thankfully, it was her copy, and her creator Rotwang also gets what he deserves, and Freder fulfils his role as the ""Mediator"". Also starring Fritz Rasp as Slim, Theodor Loos as Josaphat and Erwin Biswanger as worker 11811. The visuals are magnificent, costing back then an estimated $1,300,000 (imagine how much that would be in today's money), the cityscapes, underground caverns and little special effects are wonderful to look at, the iconic robot (which inspired the look for C-3PO in Star Wars) looks great, and the film features brilliant music by Gottfried Huppertz, one of the best influential silent films ever made. Outstanding!",Metropolis
11,ccthemovieman-1,New Restored Version Worth Checking Out,7,7 August 2008,"For its time, this movie has stunning visuals, kind of Kubrick-esqe in appearance, especially the opening scenes of workers going and coming from work. It's very strange, with the group leaving walking with their heads down like zombies.The set designs in here are also something that might draw your attention. This really has a futuristic look. I thought the visuals were fascinating. This was ""German expressionist"" filmwork at its height, I would think. Director Fritz Lang went on to become a very famous man in his profession. This wasn't his first effort but, I think this might have been the film that put him ""on the map,"" so to speak. Several years later, he gained a lot more fame with ""M."" At any rate, with the photography, sets and overall Flash Gordon-type sci-fi look, this must have been a real eye-opener to movies viewers 80 years ago. I still think they look very cool today. The music was also very dramatic, at least in this restored 5.1 surround sound restoration DVD, put out by Klino.Obviously, the eye makeup on men and the exaggerated motions by actors in silent films look a little hokey but I was mesmerized by Brigitte Helm, who plays ""Maria"" and her evil clone. She is something else! I also appreciated Klino's explanation of lost footage and how they did the best they could do to still make the story flow together. They did an outstanding job. I wouldn't attempt to watch this on anything less than this DVD, which looks pretty darn good.This is a ""worker"" story about a man wanting to trade his comfortable life to join the oppressed workers, who do their thing beneath the earth in ""Metropolis."" Workers are seen as nothing but replaceable robots. If someone gets hurt, they get carted away and replaced immediately but some other zombie-like human. Of course, people being mistreated can only take it for so long before rebellion. That's history, from the days of the Jewish slaves in Egypt to today, so that's part of this story, too. I won't say more to ruin it.I don't want to mislead people on one major point: today's audiences watching this. Few people in 2008 watch silent movies. To ask them to sit through two hours of a silent film is, obviously, asking a lot. I had to break this up into several viewings, myself, but that's okay. I still enjoyed it.....but it a silent movie this long is not easy to sit through. You have to be a student of film, or a big film buff, to watch this....but those people will be rewarded. Over 250 reviews in here show you this film has enough to offer, or at least take a look. Now that this restored version is available, check it out!",Metropolis
12,rmax304823,Monumental Pictures Presents....,8,7 November 2010,"I recognize the jumbo epic quality of Fritz Lang's movie. It's full of social comment, action, drama, and thoroughly gripping. It's a little like H. G. Wells' ""The Time Machine"", only without the Time Traveler and more of a simulacrum of certain dystopias that, as I write, we're constantly being warned of. Artistically, cripes, there is a single high-angle shot of Maria struggling to activate the flood alarm in order to save the workers from drowning. A hundred children in rags come running out of nooks and crannies and surround Maria's pedestal with their arms outstretched, begging for salvation. It out-does all of Busby Berkely's unfolding chrysanthemums and kaleidoscopic flower petals put together.The first time I saw it -- in its abbreviated form, I guess -- was in a college auditorium a generation or two ago. It gave me a rush. I've just finished watching it on Turner Movie Classics in its longer, restored form and kept nodding off.I'm trying to figure out why I hard such a hard time keeping awake. I mean, is it the movie or my atrophying brain. I think it's what's called a ""dysfunction."" You know, if you sit down at a keyboard and it's too high for you to reach comfortably, it's not your fault. Neither is it the keyboard's fault. The two things just don't match up.The new version of the silent film is almost three hours long and, though the film contains as much drama as before, it takes a certain amount of mental stamina to watch a three-hour movie, especially with subtitles. I don't mind subtitles. It's just that if you leave the room or even look away from the screen for a minute you're liable to lose some important information about the plot or characters. There is no audio to cue you in when something is happening or being said.The musical score, by the way, is splendid. It shares the film's epicness. And I don't know if Gustav Frohlich is handsome or not, though he has a great name. (I'd like to see Gustav Frohlich pitted mano a mano against Max Schreck.) But Brigitte Helm is attractive in a 1920s way, and there are a couple of scenes involving ""the False Maria"" that are rather sexy.It's impossible to predict how someone else might respond to ""Metropolis."" It would all depend on a complex of variables involving the viewer's state and the circumstances, but none of them would suggest that the film is anything other than thoughtful and well executed. It's a Monumental Picture indeed. Yet I kept falling asleep and wonder if the modern brain isn't more attuned to short silent movies rather than long ones.",Metropolis
13,Tweekums,A science fiction classic,10,7 March 2015,"This sci-fi classic is set in a future where the rich live an easy life while the workers toil in the depths to keep the city functioning. The story follows Freder, the son of the city's ruler, one day he is inspired by the sight of a beautiful working class girl named Maria so decides to see how the workers live. He is shocked to see them working till they drop from exhaustion and the lack of concern shown by the rulers. He decides to take the place of one of the workers and after a long shift attends a meeting that is led by none other than Maria. She believes that he can be the mediator between the head, the city elite, and the hands, the workers. When Freder's father finds out about her activities he comes up with a plan to destroy her. He has her kidnapped and taken to a scientist who creates a robot which looks and sounds just like her he doesn't know the scientist intends to use it to destroy both Freder and his father. The robotic Maria inflames the passions of the elite and encourages the workers to rise up and destroy the machines. They do this despite the fact that it will cause their part of the city to flood. Freder and the real Maria must save the workers and their children before mediating between the elite and the workers.At about two and a half hours this film is quite long but thankfully it doesn't drag. The story is well told and easy to follow even without hearing the actors' words. Important dialogue is subtitled but for much of it we have to rely on the actors' emoting to understand what is going one. At first this means the characters seem somewhat melodramatic but one soon gets used to it. Gustav Fröhlich does a decent job as Freder but it is Brigitte Helm who dominates the film with her performance as Maria and the robotic Maria, AKA 'The Machine Man'. The plot is a social drama at its core; focusing on the mistreated workers in a dystopia which seems like a utopia to those at the top. There is also the romance between Freder and Maria and the scientist's hatred for Freder and his father as the woman he loved chose Freder's father then died giving birth to Freda. Given the age of the film it is no surprise that it is rather grainy and scratched now but that doesn't spoil the experience. Fritz Lang's direction is great; making the film feel modern in many ways despite its age. The special effects are good too; nicely combining model work with scenes featuring real actors. This film is definitely worth watching and is a must see if you are interesting in early cinema or classic science fiction.",Metropolis
14,dbdumonteil,The finest silent movie?,10,28 August 2001,"""Metropolis"" is one of the very very few of silent movies which still finds an audience,which means a lot.But which version?The problem is that we will never be able to see ""Metropolis"" as Lang has conceived it. I saw the movie for the first time in 1968,and I remember a scene in which Maria, Rotwang's prisoner,is released by Joh Fredersen.In the versions displayed in the nineties,this scene seems to have vanished in the air.The running time is never the same,some more recent versions include hints at Rotwang's love for Freder Fredersen's mother Hel.But this character,Hel ,never appears in the restored versions:only photographs show this subplot,actually very important:before we thought that Rotwang urges his robot to destruct the machines because ...because..he was crazy:that did not satisfy us.In Thea Von Harbou's original screenplay,he did it out of jealousy,because he used to love his master's wife.For Fredersen ,the robot is first a way to replace working men,tireless slaves ;then,when it takes Maria's face,and the men go crazy and violent,it allows the boss to use violence and repression against them.In Metropolis ,two worlds coexist:the subterranean one,where human beings are in bondage (see Maria's hints at the Bible),the Yoshiwara,the Rich's paradise.Is it really a paradise anyway?It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth ,this paradise for the elite(remember Maria showing it to a group of children)Joh Fredersen,a member of the privileged understands his happiness is a fake one,when he sees first the young girl,then the terrifying underworld,this subcity where the poor sweat ,suffer and die for the sake of an idle aristocracy.The screen play has been often criticized because of its naive political ideology:Heart must be the mediator of work and capital.It has not worn well admittedly,but outside this moral,everything is great,as impressive today as it was in 1927!Do you think that,say,""close encounters of the third kinds"" will stand the test of time as good as Lang's magnum opus,and remain a classic in 2050?Dubious isn't it?The architectural genius of the German Master explodes everywhere,his masterful using of the crowds leaves us in rapture,his dreamlike sequence is at least 20 or 30 years ahead of its time.The characters (Fredersen father and son,Rotwang and Maria) are convincing and the plot is more complex that it seems to be .(the flaws are caused by missing parts of the movie,as I said before)Fritz Lang said:""I do not like Metropolis,its conclusion is wrong.I did not accept it even when I was making the movie""A black legend surrounds ""Metropolis"":Hitler enjoyed it and asked Lang to become the ""official"" director of the Third Reich;he refused,left Germany and it was Leni Riefenstahl who filmed such nazi manifestos as ""Triumph des Willems"".Besides,Hitler might have thought of concentration camps because of ""Metropolis"".Even more bewildering:building in Mauthausen a huge stair,the prisoners said:""it looks like ""Metropolis""""Metropolis is a must,see it at any cost!",Metropolis
15,Quinoa1984,a visual fable of the highest order- one of the five great future films ever made,10,18 July 2005,"Fritz Lang was constantly experimenting with ways to tell stories by way of the visual medium, and his 1927 opus Metropolis is the cream of the crop of examples of this. Perhaps it was seeing the film in the greatest possible format (a fully restored print on the KINO DVD, filled with inter-titles to keep the story complete) that had me appreciate it more, but even if I had seen the film on a scratchy print or with not very appropriate music (i.e. Giorgio Moroder's experimental cut), it would still be affecting. At the core of the story, Lang and his collaborator Thea von Harbou, the sides of good vs. evil, or at least the complete lack of understanding of the powerful over the weak, is set up so strongly that even when it has it's fairy-tale type of heaviness to it, it doesn't seem to feel compromised in strength or relevance for adults. This is the kind of film that should work for anyone, young and old, as it deals with universal themes (i.e. ""The mediator between Head and Hands must be the Heart!"")The story leaves room for the visual style to come through- Freder is the son of a kind of Imperial man over the workers who die for the machines of Metropolis, Joh Frederson. He feels the sorrow and pain of the people, and goes down to their level to be one of them. He falls in love with the most compassionate and angelic of women, Maria (played by the beautiful Brigitte Helm, in multiple roles she plays without a fault), who succumbs to capture after the jealously of Freder's father. Enter the robot, a marvel of a mad scientist, who gets transposed from Maria, and becomes the havoc-wrecker of the part of Metropolis. I won't reveal too much of the story, except to mention that as a foreshadowing for Freder for the last act, as he wakes up in one scene the Book of Revelations sits in his lap.Amidst in all of this, Metropolis is a masterpiece of visual effects, camera-tricks, and of course editing (if I wouldn't quite rank Metropolis in my all-time top ten favorites, I would rank it in terms of the editing and pacing Lang uses, which is apparent even in a permanently truncated version). It starts off with the image of the machine transposed over steam, and then soon moves to a vision of a city that was not far off from how it is in present day (cars moving on roads built to the sky, airplanes flying every-which way, and mammoth skyscrapers built in extravagant ways. But it's not just the use of the models, or the sets, or the backdrops, or even the use of space and atmosphere in most of Lang's shots (which are all spectacular), it's also the use of light that really caught my attention throughout the film. One thing I remember still days after seeing the film is the use of one spotlight on the character of Maria in a suspense scene (it also appears in other scenes I think). It's little things like that which make as big an impact as the montages, the super-impositions of faces and eyes in the dream-like shots.And, of course, Lang's greatest innovation with the film is that in telling a futuristic story, he goes beyond his time period in stylizing. As I mentioned with the pacing being unique, it was surprising (though maybe not as much from seeing his classic M) that many of the suspense sequences, mob scenes/riots, chases, I knew that this is the same kind of styling that's used today for many of the most modern of science-fiction/action films. In its own way, much like Stanley Kubrick's 2001 Space Oddysey, it breaks the mold of conventional forms of storytelling, while not completely abandoning the storytelling form. Although Metropolis has a checkered history of being cut down by countries, and it hasn't been seen in its full form in almost eighty years, what remains doesn't seem at all dated or crude. Quite the opposite, its visual expressiveness, its use of time and character and action, and its deliberate pacing, makes it ahead of its time and influential, and at the same time keeping itself unique. It's a tale we're all familiar with, being the tale of love and compassion coming into play in an industrial, cruel world- which I'm sure was even more relevant to post WW1 Germany at the time- filmed with a mix of over-the-top melodrama, mega-budget set-pieces, and designs that confound the senses.

16,JohnHowardReid,A masterpiece lovingly restored,10,7 December 2006,"There are quite a few versions of Metropolis extant in this year 2006. There never was, as might be imagined, a master print from which the various versions have been cut. At least two negatives were originally prepared because every scene was shot with two cameras, one operated by Freund, the other by Rittau. This was not an uncommon practice in silent days, the theory behind the exercise being that one negative would make prints for home consumption, the other for overseas. What usually happened, however, was that the director made a combined master cut of the best footage from whatever source for the home print, while the second-rate shots were assembled into the export negative.In this particular case, the export negative was sent to Paramount where it was re-edited by Channing Pollock. Over the years, the original Ufa negative wore out and the Paramount negative was shortened again and again. Ufa assembled another negative from off-cuts in 1934. Although one had a shorter running time than the other, it yet contained scenes and sequences not represented in the longer version.Thanks to the enterprise of the F.W. Murnau Foundation, a concerted effort was initiated to assemble as complete a version as possible. This rescue operation got underway in 1986 and has resulted in the superb print (complete with the glorious original music score by Gottfried Huppertz) now marketed by Kino Video. This version runs 124 minutes and is likely to remain the best Metropolis for all time. True, there is a rival ""restored"" version that runs 147 minutes, but this contains no extra motion picture footage (in fact, slightly less) but makes extensive use of stills and sub-titles to substitute for missing scenes. In my view, this makes Metropolis somewhat of a chore to sit through, as it breaks the viewer's attention and feeling of continuity. In the Murnau Foundation/Kino restoration, missing sequences are very briefly and succinctly summarized. They are not intrusive, but can easily be accepted simply as descriptive titles. In fact, this version is gripping, fascinating, bizarre, over-the-topeverything that will delight the sci-fi fan. True, some of the acting seems a bit exaggerated (Alfred Abel is always admirably restrained, as is Fritz Rasp, but Frolich and Klein-Rogge are inclined to let their emotions run away with them, while Miss Helm, alas, often seems to be giving a bad Lillian Gish imitation in her goody-goody role. Fortunately, she's just wonderful as the sensuously wicked robot).",Metropolis
17,wes-connors,City Lights and Shadows,9,21 March 2008,"The Future City of Metropolis has two classes of people. The ""Brains"" are the rich and powerful elite class; they enjoy sports, dances and gardening. The ""Hands"" are the throngs of lowly workers; they work 10-hour days, like slaves, and live underground. Leader of the brainy Upper Class is Alfred Abel (as Joh Fredersen). Mr. Abel's son Gustav Fröhlich (as Freder) is, initially, unaware of any discrepancy between the two classes. Lower Class lass Brigitte Helm (as Maria) catches his eye; and, Mr. Fröhlich peruses her to the bowels of the City. Fröhlich is horrified at the treatment of ""Maria"" and the workers; and, he joins their underground revolution. His father, learning of the resistance, enlists the help of scientist Rudolf Klein-Rogge (as Rotwang). Mr. Klein-Rogge is building a ""Machine-Man"" (Robot), which (rather inexplicably) winds up looking just like Ms. Helm.Can the Mechanical ""Maria"" dupe the underground workers into abandoning their plan to destroy Metropolis? While the story and performances are sometimes lacking, the superb look of ""Metropolis"" makes it a city worth seeing. Fritz Lang's direction is, indeed, futuristic.

18,Coventry,So oldand yet so futuristic!,8,25 August 2005,"Fritz Lang's groundbreaking landmark remains one of the biggest mysteries in the world of cinema. How can a movie that'll soon turn 80 years old still look so disturbingly futuristic?? The screenplay by Thea Von Harbou is still very haunting and courageously assails social issues that are of all ages. The world has been divided into two main categories: thinkers & workers! If you belong to the first category, you can lead a life of luxury above ground but if you're a worker, your life isn't worth a penny, and you're doomed to perilous labor underground. The further expansions and intrigues in the screenplay are too astonishing to spoil, so I strongly advise that you check out the film yourself. It's essential viewing, anyway! ""Metropolis"" is a very demanding film-experience and definitely not always entertaining. But, as it is often the case with silent-cinema classics, the respect and admiration you'll develop during watching it will widely excel the enjoyment-aspect. Fritz' brutal visual style still looks innovative and few directors since were able to re-create a similarly nightmarish composition of horizontal and vertical lines. Many supposedly 'restored' versions have been released over the years (in 1984 and 2002, for example) but the 1926-version is still the finest in my opinion, even though that one already isn't as detailed and punctual as Lang intended it. ""Metropolis"" perhaps is THE most important and influential movie ever made. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Star Wars"" and ""Blade Runner"" owe their existence (or at least their power) to it.",Metropolis
19,sunwarrior13,Lang's Film Remains Impressive Years Later,10,7 March 2012,"Metropolis is a German expressionist science-fiction film directed by Fritz Lang. The film was written by Lang and his wife Thea Von Harbou, and starred Brigitte Helm, Gustav Fröhlich, Alfred Abel and Rudolf Klein-Rogge. The film was produced in the Babelsberg Studios by UFA.The biggest-budgeted movie ever produced at Germany's UFA, Lang's gargantuan Metropolis consumed resources that would have yielded upwards of 20 conventional features, more than half the studio's entire annual production budget. And if it didn't make a profit at the time -- indeed, it nearly bankrupted the studio -- the film added an indelible array of images and ideas to cinema, and has endured across the many decades since its release.In the somewhat distant future (some editions say the year 2000, others place it in 2026, and, still others -- including the original Paramount U.S. release -- in 3000 A.D.) the city of Metropolis, with its huge towers and vast wealth, is a playground to a ruling class living in luxury and decadence. They, and the city, are sustained by a much larger population of workers who labor as virtual slaves in the machine halls, moving from their miserable, tenement-like homes to their grim, back- breaking ten-hour shifts and back again. The hero, Freder -- the son of Joh Fredersen, the master of Metropolis -- is oblivious to the plight of the workers, or any aspect of their lives, until one day when a a beautiful subterranean dweller named Maria visits the Eternal Gardens, where he spends his time cavorting with various ladies, with a small group of children from the workers' city far below. They are sad, hungry, and wretched looking, and he is haunted by their needy eyes -- something Freder has never seen or known among the elite of the city -- and by this strange and beautiful woman who tells all who hear her, workers' children and ruler's offspring, that they are all brothers. He follows her back down to the depths of the city and witnesses a horrible accident and explosion in the machine halls where the men toil in misery. Haunted by what he has seen, he tries to confront his father, only to find that the man he loves and respects believes that it is right for the workers to live the way they do, while he and his elite frolic in luxury. Freder decides to do something about it, but he must first learn more, and also locate Maria. With help from Josaphat, Fredersen's recently dismissed office manager, he goes below again and takes over the job of one of the workers, in order to find Maria. Meanwhile, Fredersen is concerned about the rumblings of unrest among the workers, and his son's sudden interest in their plight; he assigns ""Slim"", his investigator, to follow Freder. Meanwhile, he goes for advice to an old acquaintance, the inventor C.A. Rotwang. Rotwang once was a rival to Fredersen for the love of the woman Hel, who married Fredersen and died bearing his son, Freder. Rotwang still feels the loss, but he is a cunning and practical man, and is willing to help his old ""friend,"" but not before showing off his latest creation -- a robot that he has modeled in the image of his beloved Hel, that he may have her again. Rotwang answers Fredersen's question by taking him to the catacombs below the modern city, where they see Maria preaching the gospel and counseling patience, in the hope that a ""Mediator"" -- who will be able to reconcile the ""head"" and ""hands"" of society (i.e. the ruling and working classes) -- will come among them. Fredersen will hear none of it, and sees the need to break the workers' resistance and destroy Maria's influence among them. He arranges with Rotwang to make his robot creation into a duplicate Maria (which requires his kidnapping her), and to send her out among the workers to incite them to violence, so that Fredersen can use force against them. But he doesn't reckon with Rotwang, who despises Fredersen and his ruling class, and has commanded the robot to obey his orders and follow a plan that will destroy the city, both above and below ground. Fredersen also doesn't reckon with his own son Freder, who not only believes in what Maria is preaching but is beginning to see himself as the ""Mediator,"" and is right in the midst of the conflagration when the workers' uprising starts. Soon, fires and floods spread, threatening to doom the children of the workers, abandoned in their parents' frenzied attack on the machines, and the city of Metropolis faces an impending disaster of biblical proportions. Meanwhile, the now-mad Rotwang tries to reclaim his lost Hel, and Maria and her evil robot twin are both stalked by crowds of workers driven to a murderous rage.To see the film as the director intended, on the big screen with an original score recorded by a 60-piece orchestra, greatly enhances the reputation of a film already considered one of the icons of the silent era.This movie is certifiably nuts and naive in many ways, but it is so exciting for it is a visually awe-inspiring science fiction classic from the silent era.Most of all,The first must-see movie of 2012 is also the must-see movie of 1927. The difference is that you can actually see it now. Or most of it.And most of all,Lang's visionary visual creation remains impressive many years later.",Metropolis
20,Hey_Sweden,"Quite remarkable, and one of the landmark silent films.",9,29 July 2018,"The impressionable Freder (Gustav Fröhlich) is the son of an industrialist in a world of the future. In this world, all the upper class members live among the clouds, in luxury, while the blue collar workers who maintain the numerous machines live dreary existences. Freder, entranced by the outspoken Maria (Brigitte Helm), decides that the workers are his friends, and rebels against his tyrannical father (Alfred Abel). Meanwhile, a mad scientist / inventor (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) assists the father in his schemes by giving his robotic creation ""the machine man"" (also played by Helm) Maria's likeness, and having this fake Maria incite the workers to violence so that the dad can use violence against them.Considering that this early Fritz Lang masterpieces is over 90 years old, it's quite the stylish accomplishment. The sets, the photography, and the special effects are amazing, especially when you see how Lang is doing all of this on a grand, epic scale, leading to a destructive finale that works as an ancestor to the ""disaster film cycle"" that came along almost half a century later. The provocative screenplay (written by Thea von Harbou, based on her novel) makes one think about such things as the advent of unions, unsafe working practices, mistreatment of the lower class, and, of course, the way that people would come to rely so much on machines and technology for their continued existence. Since the film is now available in an almost-complete version (about 25 minutes worth of footage were discovered not that long ago in Brazil), it's a very long and deliberately paced fable, one that wouldn't suit viewers with shorter attention spans. It also bears the mark of many silent films, with some VERY enthusiastic acting from some of the principals.Still, it's hard to deny the absolute passion brought to this project by the filmmakers and cast. It has wonderful atmosphere, carrying a feeling of despair that ultimately climaxes with a sense of hope for the future. The big set piece of Metropolis being flooded is some genuinely exciting stuff, and will have even modern audiences marvelling at how Lang and company pulled this off.Lastly, it's a superb melding of memorable images (such as the look of The Machine Man) with the excellent music composed by Gottfried Huppertz.

There's such intensity to the surreal images on screen that it defies your ability to turn away--in other words, director Lang knows how to hook you into the story from the very start.It's not the story that's significant here. The startling special effects and costumes and images of a mechanized society are what capture the attention immediately. The main story has the young man abandoning his life of luxury to join the oppressed workers that he observes caught in a mighty explosion--and wanting to do something by joining the workers in the depths.Pretty heavy-going at times and the acting is strictly from silent screen technique--very melodramatic with broad gestures. The plot takes an interesting turn when the inventor is instructed to give the Machine-Man the image of the girl--whom the manager's son has fallen in love with. The manager is still bitter because his son has joined the oppressed workers. This leads to all sorts of mayhem among the workers climaxing in some of the most astonishing set pieces ever conceived at this time in German film-making.An extraordinary viewing experience, original in concept and dazzling in execution.

However the evil head of the city wants a revolt so he can get rid of them and put in robot workers.  He gets a mad scientist to help him. He kidnaps Maria and (in a stunning sequence) transforms the robot into her image.  However this Maria is pure evil and sets the workers off...and things go barreling out of control.The original version of this was (purportedly) 5 hours long!  It has been cut drastically over the years and much footage was lost.  Finally, 75 years later, we have a version that is complete as possible (it runs a little over 2 hours), looks incredible and has a great reconstruction of the 1927 score.
The film still holds up--the special effects are still impressive and quite obviously influenced many sci-fi films of the future (""Blade Runner"" especially).  The movie moves quickly and there is (literally) a cast of hundreds.  Great sets, special effects, a beautiful music score...a definite must-see.  Only debit--the acting.  It's VERY overdone especially by Helms.  She's OK as the sweet Maria but is hopeless doing evil Maria.  The audience I saw it with broke out laughing more than a few times at the expressions on her face.  Also the actors must have been freezing doing this--you can see their breath!Also, there's a 1984 reconstruction which cut the film to 80 minutes, added tinting and (briefly) a color sequence and put in a rock score (including Loverboy, Pat Benatar, Lyle Lovett etc etc).

24,CinemaSerf,You might think you've seen it all before - and you probably have - but you saw most of here first!,8,30 May 2020,"This has got to be the ultimate cinematic illustration of the strata of human existence. Whether it be a story of the survival of the fittest; the cleverest; the most devious; most beautiful - or a hybrid of some/all - it reflects poignantly how humanity always seeks to exist within a hierarchical structure (merited or otherwise, but perfectly epitomised here by the matriarchal, deific robot), but how much more effectively mankind can succeed if it accepts and values everyone and works together. It also clearly identifies the perennial problem of those with the brain always ending up far more successful, comfortable - and powerful than those who do the labour. Hence, this wonderful tale from Fritz Lang takes us to ""Metropolis"" - a totalitarian - though not necessarily intentionally malevolent - society, in which everyone has their place and role. Except, that is - for the son of the ""Master"". Like many a fickle youth; he has little to occupy his time and his meaningless existence leaves him ripe for new ideas. When he takes pity on a recently sacked employee of his father and shortly afterwards is exposed to a lifestyle he couldn't even have imagined, the story starts to gain a thought-provoking and unstoppable pace. The score magnificently guides us from the drudgery of day-to-day-life through the emancipating revolution that inevitably follows, with all of the ill-foreseen, largely devastating consequences - like a bottle of champagne that has been shaken, sooner or later the cork pops! It is also a story of love between the son and a woman way, way, way beneath his station. Yes, there is light on the sunlit uplands - and much like a forest fire that destroys all in it's path; this film clearly suggests at the end that hope and optimism will triumph and a green shoots of recovery starts to grow again...

26,zardoz-13,An Indisputable Masterpiece of Science Fiction Cinema!,10,30 May 2009,"As one of the earliest examples of cinematic science fiction fantasy, director Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"""" ranks as an unparalleled achievement in its size, scope, and vision. Forty years would elapse before Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) would rival Lang's epic spectacle about a troubled, dystopian society fractured along the fault lines of the economic inequality isolating the haves and the have-nots. Nevertheless, nothing could ever be said to surpass ""Metropolis"" as a film of beauty, majestic, and surrealism.The preamble encapsulates the film's timeless, universal message: ""It has a moral that grows on the pillar of understanding. The mediator between the brain and muscle must be the heart."" "" Metropolis"" inspired generations of filmmakers with its use of state-of-the-art visual effects that transformed the science fiction film. Thea Von Harbou's saga about an evil robot is designed by a vengeful inventor to impersonate a flesh & blood female Christ figure and incite anarchy can clearly be traced as a source of inspiration to many contemporary sci-fi films and television shows, such as the ""Terminator"" franchise, ""Robocop"" franchise, ""Blade Runner,"" ""Logan's Run,"" ""The Fifth Element,"" and Battlestar Galactic."" The ""Metropolis"" robot was not the first robot, but it was unmistakably the seminal one that sired a long line of cinematic robots. The famous transformation scene where the robot turns into a human foreshadows the ""Frankenstein"" franchise.Many detractors of Lang's visionary work—primarily noted sci-fi author H.G. Wells--derided it as shallow and his criticisms are not without substance. Indeed, the characters lack depth because they represent archetypes instead of individuals in a larger-than-life story. The spectacle, this Marxist chronicle of humanity at odds with itself over machinery, and the anarchy that emerges from this division makes ""Metropolis"" a memorable mediation about our flawed society, part sci-fi, part horror and a statement about the incompatibility polarity that comes about between those who control and those who are controlled. Again, von Harbou's theme re-echoes with greater intensity. The virtuous Maria would say that the head and the hands would need a mediator and the mediator would be the heart. You cannot understand and appreciate science fiction as a cinematic genre until you see that every sci-fi film owes a debt of gratitude to Lang's masterly work of genius. Actually, while Lang would make many great movies in a long career, the legendary Austrian director never made another sci-fi film that surpassed this milestone.A malevolent robot, messianic crusaders, a patriarchal titan of industry, a mad scientist with vengeance in his heart, and masses of mindless men and women enslaved by the patriarch constitute the array of characters in this milestone of German Expressionist cinema that embraces Art-Deco in his architectural designs. Scenarist Thea von Harbou and Fritz Lang assembled these protagonists and antagonists for the clash of the century with visuals that were designed to overwhelm 1920's audiences by their sheer beauty and grandeur. In the annals of science fiction film, these special effects, involving the use of mirrors to supplement shots of live action, matte paintings for sprawling cityscapes, and miniatures of the city, were singular. All the planes, trains, and automobiles in the long shots were done either with wires pulling them along or shot-action photography. Reportedly, Lang got the idea for his cityscape from a trip to Manhattan, but there are too many undocumented stories about Lang and his inspiration so you'd have to read the biographies available about his life to sort out the fiction from the facto. One thing is certain Lang was more a film dictator than a director and he toiled endlessly and made his cast and collaborators toil to forge his vision. Lang drove his actors, actresses, and technical crew like a slave driver and often exhibited a sense of perfectionism that defied civility and common sense. He amounted to a cinematic Herod.While ""Metropolis"" qualifies as sci-fi, the film also dabbles in the disaster film. The villainous father of the hero, Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel), enlists the evil inventor, C.A. Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge), to create a robot look-alike of the virginal heroine, Maria, who preaches a gospel of sorts to unit the workers. Rotwang dresses in dark colors, has wind-blown hair, and wears a black glove on his right hand. Fredersen wants Rotwang to forge a robot that can assume the identity of Marie (Brigitte Helm), mislead the masses, and get them to destroy themselves. Joh has obtained secret plans for meetings among the workers and wants to thwart them. When they learn about the meeting, Rotwang escorts Joh down into the 2000 year old catacombs to witness Marie preaching her gospel of unification and that is where Joh sees his son Freder (Gustav Fröhlich) appear and embrace Maria. Freder has been smitten by Maria since he saw her first early in the film. She entered the Club of Sons where Freder cavorted with various women. Freder was so stricken by Marie that he descended to the depths where the workers operated the machines and witnessed a meltdown. Joh is worried about his son's dalliance with the workers because it threatens to destroy everything that he has worked for so many years. Eventually, the false Maria does mislead the workers into destroying the machines and the loss of power leads to a flood that wipes out their homes.Lang deals with one of his recurring themes: mob violence. He explored mob violence in ""M"" (1931) with Peter Lorre and ""Fury"" (1936) with Spencer Tracy. Although ""Metropolis"" has been available as an inexpensive public domain film for over 40 years, Kino Video has released a splendid restored version that true movie lovers will genuinely appreciate for its clarity of picture.

Basically only reason why the movie is so long is because they need about ten hand gestures to speak one sentence. It's kind of dreadful to look at first but once you're used to it, it shouldn't trouble you anymore.In many ways this movie can be regarded as the ""Blade Runner"" of the '20's. ""Metropolis"" is set in a futuristic world that has a same kind of atmosphere as in ""Blade Runner"". The mix of '20's cars and propeller-planes with futuristic machines, highways, buildings and androids is very unusual but an absolutely awesome thing to look at. The movie was ahead of its time and in some ways also prophetic.The story is absolutely the best thing of the movie. Also the way the story is told and directed by Fritz Lang deserves credit.

This is my second exposure(the title that was the first is M, from 1931) to German expressionism and Fritz Lang, the cinematic genius, and it most definitely will not be the last of either. I could not take my eyes off this for a second. It would be a lie to claim that I could remember when I was last this engaged by a motion picture that I was watching, and I'm honestly not certain that I expected it to be as excellent in that aspect as it turned out to be. Cinematography is masterful. This is incredible for how influential, groundbreaking and unconventional it was when they made it, but not only that. The pacing is spot-on, this is never boring. It is not for everyone, and casual movie-goers may not be as captivated by this as I was. It's cut surprisingly fast, and it all goes far beyond what you'd expect them to be able to accomplish at the time. Heck, not only that, the effects are genuinely marvelous, and this holds amazing images that I've not seen anywhere before or since. This, with the futuristic city and the massive machines, has an astonishing, often bleak, look and feel, and builds atmosphere remarkably well. The moral holds up to this day, as does the commenting on industrialism(to an extent) and capitalism(much moreso). This is a silent film(for those unaware, dialog is handled by a black screen with white text on it, and in this, so were a number of stage directions), and apart from some sound-work, all of which is impeccable, the audio side is exclusively music, and this sweeping, instrumental score fits every frame of this, and probably had its role in me being so drawn into this. This is set in the aptly named Metropolis, decades from now(it was when this was made), where the working force, that keeps it all running, is living underground, while the high class spend their lives in carefree enjoyment. Until one day, where the son of the man who planned it falls for a woman trying to improve the situation for the laborers. The acting is impeccable.

30,evanston_dad,For People Who Don't Like Silent Films,10,17 November 2005,"For people who think silent films are antiquated, slow, boring (pick your adjective), I ask you to watch ""Metropolis"" and see if your opinion changes. I think too many people think of the really creaky silent films from cinema's beginnings--like ""The Great Train Robbery"" or those first experimental films by George Melies--when they think of silent film. But remember that ""Metropolis"" came out in 1927, the year the industry transitioned to sound; so really, the only thing separating this movie from some of the most beloved films of the early thirties is the absence of sound. In every other way, technologically speaking, it's just as polished.As for the movie itself, it had me on the edge of my seat. Come on, I defy anyone to not get excited by this classic underdog story; I'm a sucker for any story where the downtrodden working man revolts against the tyranny of the rich. It's difficult to discuss acting in silent films--I'll grant dissenters that--because there's such a different set of standards for it than we're used to. And this movie is as guilty as any other silent film of having melodramatic trappings. But rather than dwell on those criticisms, accept them as part of the experience and enjoy the movie for what it is.And what is it? It's the granddaddy of every sci-fi movie ever made since. There's hardly a sci-fi film I can think of that doesn't in some way conjure up images from this movie. ""Blade Runner"" and ""Dark City"" borrowed its production design; ""Dr. Strangelove"" took the crazed scientist with the black-gloved fist and made him a starring character; ""Star Wars"" used the android as a prototype for C-3PO. ""Metropolis"" is a parade of iconic images, offering one memorable set piece after another.

The workers have an existence so bleak that they trudge together in some kind of synchronized slouched shuffle as the shift changes among those tied to the giant machines. Even those getting off for the shift show no joy. It is almost prescient of concentration camp occupants a decade or so later .Freder, Joh Fredersen's son, has life change for him when Maria, a beauiful young prophetess, emerges from the depths with the children of the workers' city and mentions that these young men playing above are their brothers. He wants to learn all he can about the workers below, and does not share dad's indifference at their fate. Worried about the prophetess perhaps inciting the workers to rebel, and worried about his son's over concern for and curiosity about the workers, Joh Fredersen goes to consult the inventor Rottwang.This is his first mistake, because Rottwang hates Joh Fredersen, and he's quite open about it. Apparently ""Hel"", Fredersen's wife, once belonged to Rottwang, but married Fredersen and died giving birth to Freder. Forgive and forget are just not in Rottwang's vocabulary, and to prove it he has a giant statue, a kind of tomb erected in his home to her memory. So when Fredersen asks for Rottwang's help to destroy the faith that Freder and the workers have in Maria, he shouldn't be so sure that this isn't a plan to destroy Fredersen instead, and yet Fredersen stupidly trusts him.Let me just say that my husband likes few silent films, but he'll sit down and watch Metropolis every time because the sets are so engrossing. Such symbolism goes on here. ""Maria"" must be an analog of the Virgin Mary. There are references to one of the machines when it boils over and explodes as ""Moloch"" the god to which human beings were sacrificed by being thrown into a raging fire. When Maria appears in the catacombs below the workers' city, it appears to be some kind of makeshift chapel with three crosses on one side and two crosses in the middle. Why five crosses? Then when Maria talks about the Tower of Babel she turns it into some kind of lesson on mistreated and abused labor. And then there is a reference to ""Babylon the Great"" in such a way as I think Saint John never intended. And on it goes.With this being a little more than a decade out from WWII, I couldn't help but wonder what happened to these German actors and actresses. Brigette Helm, who played Maria, lived a long life, but the coming of sound and the take over of the German film industry by the government caused her to retreat to Switzerland, where she lived until 1996 at age 90. Alfred Abel, who played Joh Frederson, died in Berlin in 1937. Gustav Frohlich, who played Freder, lived until age 85 in 1987. He served in the German army during the war, and he was banned from acting from 1941-1943 because of a dust up he had with Joseph Goebbels over Frohlich's girlfriend at the time.I'd highly recommend this for a bewildering plot and eye popping art design.",Metropolis
32,morrison-dylan-fan,Metropolis:The Reconstructed and Restored Cut.,10,9 August 2011,"Ever since I've decided to become introduced to silent cinema,with Alfred Hitchcock's outline- setting film The Manxman and John Ford's industrial revaluation western The Iron Horse,the name Fritz Lang has had an almost magnetic grip of being at the very top of my list,of directors whose work I have been eagerly wanting to view.When I heard a few years ago,about a ""holy grail"" being struck for film history,with a worn out copy of Langs silent epic Metropolis being pulled out of oblivion,and leading to the huge discovery of twenty five minutes of missing scenes/moments being found in the print.After reading that the film was going to be kept safely in a preservation society,due to the understandably fragile nature of the film,my expectations of this cut of the film coming out on home video gradually disappeared.Years later,I decided to search on Amazon UK to see what titles had been realised from The Masters Of Cinema DVD company. (the UK's version of Criterion) To my amazement,right at the very top of the page,was a very sophisticated looking DVD of the reconstructed/restored edition of Metropolis!.With having just started to discover the world of silent cinema,and looking at one of the most tempting DVDs which I have seen in years,I felt that it was the perfect time for me to see the full creation of Fritz Lang's futuristic city.The plot: Being the son of arguably the biggest titan/philanthropist of a very advance industrial city called Metropolis,Freder has lived a life of complete bliss,where anything he has desired to achieve,has been reached to a level of success, that most of the residents of the city will never reach.Whilst out walking one day,Freder catches a quick glimpse of a girl who he instantly becomes obsessed with seeing again.As Freder is attempting to build the courage to go up to the girl,the girl is suddenly griped by security guards,who drag her down to the second level of Metropolis, where the workers who keep this huge city alive are kept,whilst the rich people in Metropolis live in mansions/villas on the ""Top"" level.Not being deterred one bit,Freder decides to secretly travel to the second level for the first time in his life.Getting deeper and deeper into the second level,Freder starts to become extremely sicken at the level of depravity and hopelessness that the lives of the workers have become engulfed in,with some of them even being thrown into a machine to die,just to ""help"" keep the cites electricity going. Horrififed by his discovery's,,Freder goes to tell his father Jon about what he has seen in the workers section of the city.To his complete surprise Jon dismisses everything that his son has told him,due to him feeling that the city must stay ""alive"" in anyway possible.Fearing that Freder might attempt to help an uprising begin,and finding out that some workers have gotten hold of secret documents which show the inside stricter to Metropolis's power supply,Jon decides to hire a spy called The Thin man to keep an eye on his son and the workers.Following him,The Thin man gets hold of the inventor of Metropolis:C.A Wotwang to guide him around the city.With there eyes all on him,Freder is eventually found to be attending a secret meeting,where him and a huge number of workers are getting told about a new philosophy from a woman called Maria (who Freder has been crazy about,since catching a quick glimpse of her on the top level of Metropolis)Attempting to accept for the first time in his life that a fall from power might be upon them,Jon and C.A. take the most drastic measures possible to destroy the bubbling uprising,by inventing a robot.Quickly getting hold of Maria,C.A. transfers her appearance to the robot (who he will be controlling).Having succeeded in the transfer of Maria's appearance,C.A. and Jon begin to pray that their fake Maria will stop the up rising dead in its tracks,although none of them have any idea about how much (the real) Maria's philosophy is affecting the workers,who are starting to build up into something that none of them may be able to topple... View on the film: The first people who deserve a huge round of applause are The Master Of Cinema makers,who have created a obviously lovingly made DVD/Blu- Ray.Although the ""new"" 25 minutes of extra footage does contain a good amount of grain, (which is understandable,due to the reels of film being left to gather dust) the footage which has been used in previous editions of the film,has now been given a mesmerising remastering,with the quality of the picture being one that could beat a huge number of films made today!.For the adaptation of her own novel,screenwriter Thea Von Harbou, (who Lang would later divorce,shortly after she had become a member of the Nazi's)interestingly shows that during the workers revolt against the ""higher-ups"",they all struggle to become distinct individuals.With the first part of the film, showing the workers being used as puppets to keep the city alive,who are also hidden away as an embarrassing,necessary ""evil"" for the higher-ups,to the second half of the film,where the workers turn into a mass tidal-wave,whose destructive nature,leads them to even (temporally) forgetting about their children!.Along with the brilliantly tense screenplay of his then- wife,Fritz Lang delivers the film with masterful directing.For the two levels of Metropolis Lang creates two extremely different ""worlds"",With the workers level having a menacing foggy Noirish look,which helps to give a sense that anyone could jump out and attack you,to the top level,which is filled with mind-blowing technology,and packed with stunning housing.For the excellent characters of The Thin Man and C.A. Wotwang,Lang gives the film an amazing,creepy Gothic feel,with The Thin Man looking like Dracular working undercover as a spy!.Looking at the structure of the film,Lang seems to have created two distinct parts,which combined to make one unforgettable whole,due to Lang delivering an astonishing film,which mixes gripping Noirish moments,and still-stunningly executed special effects.",Metropolis
33,anaconda-40658,The Future of Sci-Fi!,10,24 April 2015,"Metropolis (1927): Dir: Fritz Lang / Cast: Gustay Frohlich, Brigitte Helm, Alfred Abel, Rudolf Klein-Rogge, Heinrich George: Absolute masterpiece by director Fritz Lang about man's slavery to machines. Workers file onto an elevator in a haunting manner overseen by their boss who is angered when his son Fleder passes through the gate to observe the operation. Fleder is transfixed on Maria who is a Christ-like figure instructing peace. The boss turns to a mad scientist who constructs a robot in Maria's image. She will lead the people to destruction by destroying the machines. By doing this the operation floods putting workers out of homes. Meanwhile the mad scientist kidnaps Maria thus placing Fleder in a position of heroism. Extraordinary vision of mechanics and magnificent production that put Lang ahead of his time. The machinery is detailed and visualized paving the road to an onslaught of clones that mostly never measure up. Alfred Abel plays the boss who symbolizes man's lack of understanding as well as the portal to improvement. Rudolf Klein-Rogge plays the scientist who symbolizes corruption and defeat. Brigitte Helm as Maria symbolizes peace and the hope for a brighter future. Heinrich George as the foreman represents the common citizen or worker who is deemed an explanation when catastrophe hits. Gustay Frohlich as Fleder represents the willingness to improve. Score: 10 / 10",Metropolis
34,zetes,I wish Lang had would have followed his own maxim,8,21 September 2001,"Don't get me wrong. I do LIKE this film. I just don't LOVE it. I would never argue with its importance; it's just that I think that it doesn't rank as one of the greatest films ever made. There are at least a dozen silent feature films that I like more, including, but not limited to, The Passion of Joan of Arc (Carl Dreyer, 1928), Batteship Potemkin (Sergei Eisenstein, 1925), Sherlock Jr. (Buster Keaton, 1924), Modern Times (Charlie Chaplin, 1936), Safety Last (Harold Lloyd, 1923), Nanook of the North (Robert Flaherty, 1922), Our Hospitality (Keaton, 1923), and City Lights (Chaplin, 1931).
The maxim to which I refer is this: ""Between the head and hands there must be a heart"" (or something to that effect). In the film, Joh Frederson is figuratively the head, Grot the hands, and Freder the heart. In analogizing the film itself with that image, I would count the film's metaphoric and symbolic aspects as the head, its technical aspects the hands. The heart should be the relationship between Freder and Maria. Unfortunately, that whole piece of the film just doesn't work very well. It comes off as merely mechanical.What is left is still amazing. Hardly any film has matched its stunning sets. A few of the set pieces rank as some of the best ever created, for example, Moloch devouring the workers, Freder working the arms of the clock, the Tower of Babel story, the transformation of Rotwang's robot, Mecha-Maria's erotic dance, and a few others. However, there are a lot of segments that move as slow as molasses. There are a lot of scenes where characters stare at each other for so long that it proceeds to become silly.In fact, it can be generally silly. A lot of people were laughing at somewhat inappropriate moments at the screening that I attended tonight. It is very dated, as you probably would expect a silent sci-fi movie to be. I wonder, though, if this is a German phenomenon. All silent films are dated up to a point, but a lot are very enjoyable still in a way different than sound films. The three German UFA silents I've seen, Metropolis, The Last Man, and Nosferatu (the latter two both directed by the famed F.W. Murnau) all seem more dated than usual to me. I know all three of those films have a lot of fans, but they all seem stale to me.Tonight I saw the film in a theater with live music - a great experience if you've never had the chance to do it. The version was a brand new reconstruction which ran at 157 minutes. 157!?!?!?The version that I own is only 120, and I get kind of bored during it. Fortunately, with the live piano music, as opposed to the usual, torturous sythesizer which accompanies most versions of the film on video, it was much easier to endure. Although I haven't seen the 120 minute version for about two years, I can speculate as to what was added in this version. Rotwang's character seemed to be expanded - I had always seen him simply as a mad scientist without any real character. Here, I believe that more of a motive has been supplied. The worker whom Freder substitutes at the clock-like work station, worker 11811, has more of a story, though a lot of its elements have been lost and were told through intertitles. There was also a lot more concerning ""the thin man,"" a spy whom Joh Frederson orders to follow his son. There must have been more, but I don't really feel like watching my VHS tape of it right now. This was the third silent film I ever saw, the first I ever owned, and my rank has always been 8/10, regardless of the version.",Metropolis
35,trashgang,man machine,10,28 September 2015,"A masterpiece that's all I can say. Go figure out how they did all the effects back then. Editing wasn't what we see nowadays and CGI wasn't done of course so it had to be done all in-camera or layer on layer for special effects. German expressionism on it's best. Finally since a few years full uncut after finding the reel in Buenos Aires in really bad conditions. It shows in the full uncut but it doesn't bother. just seen it finally on Blu Ray it's worth picking up. Not only for the restoration but for the flick itself of course. Just see the settings how wonderful they were. What even surprised me was that in the beginning one dancer is showing her breasts and that for 1927! Even the main lead Brigitte Helm transformed into the robot goes dirty dancing. One of the last silent movies made, it was in the same year that The Jazz Singer came out with sound. Even clocking in way over 2 hours not one minute did it bore me. Cult classic that did stand the time and is still actual. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 5/5 Comedy 0/5",Metropolis
36,whpratt1,Great Fritz Lang Film,10,1 April 2008,"This is a great film created in the Year 1927 which was way ahead of itself in the creation of such a story that clearly showed a cast system among a society where the medium income people had to work in poor conditions way below the city with their tall buildings and fancy living conditions. There is reference to a Babel and a very high tower which is constructed and more about moral living like the Bible teaches and the possible establishment of everyone coming to a mutual understanding that the working class of people and the rich must join hands, hearts and souls and all work together. This is truly a great masterpiece from 1927 which was way beyond its years.",Metropolis
37,siderite,"The best movie of that year! :) OK, it's brilliant",8,14 January 2006,"How weird is to watch and analyze now a movie that was made 80 years ago. I think the best way to describe it is a movie that proves arts evolve to evoke the same feelings about the same problems. People haven't evolved since 100 or 1000 or 10000 years ago, they just evolved new special effects.Metropolis shows a world separated in two great social classes: the thinkers and the workers. Of course, the thinkers don't think nearly as much as they should while the workers do some thinking from time to time. This leads to a conflict in the end of the movie that ends making the point of the movie: you need to guide your actions with responsibility, not only thought or brawn. A powerful idea not only then, when capitalism was showing its ugly side to the world, but also now and in any human epoch.The film looks stunning for that era. Metropolis itself looks like the grandfather of the Total Recall 2070, Blade Runner and Batman cities. The aerial vehicles that move people look like very old The Fifth Element or Star Wars air cars. The script has the corporate villain, the idealistic youth, the mad scientist, all elements copied in movies again and again since then on.I don't think it was particularly entertaining. It is so old (and being black and white and with no sound makes it really hard to watch) that it doesn't really appeal to you the way modern films do. But if you are a movie buff, one that needs to know where it all started from, you just have to see Metropolis, the granddaddy of all cinematography now.",Metropolis
38,Smells_Like_Cheese,Disturbing how it seems like they actually predicted the future!,8,1 November 2006,"I love silent films and remember seeing a clip of Metropolis in my film appreciation class, I was so excited to pick a five dollar copy of this film from Best Buy and I was just amazed at how disturbing this movie was for not only it's time, but today. Today, 2006, times are just like this movie's plot, everyone is getting so lazy due to technology's quick advancements, that they'll do anything just so they have to work less.This movie is about a boss who is upset with the way his workers are always tired and have to go home. When he brings up to another worker that he has created the perfect worker, a robot who will never get tired, hungry, or have to go home to a family. But soon the worker has a fantasy, or as I'd say a very horrific nightmare, that the robots will turn against these humans and take over the world! Yeah, silent films have always been overacted and very cheesy to look at, but it's amazing to me to see what the times were like and what the mood was. The reason why Metropolis is so well loved and respected is not only because of the mood it captured, but how amazingly psychic it was, I think since the time that electricity was discovered, we've all feared how far we could go with technology, and Metropolis is a haunting picture that captures it so well.8/10",Metropolis
39,DKosty123,"Amazing Sets, Huge Cast & Details",10,14 February 2008,"This is Fritz Lang's silent masterpiece & still worth viewing today. It is really an amazing silent film & a true Science Fiction masterpiece that has influenced many modern filmmakers and not just the Science Fiction ones.It has become somewhat known that while Lang worked on producing this miracle, one of his students was Alfred Hitchcock. Hitch learned well from his teacher because you see Lang's silent influence in a majority of his films. The technique of telling a story with pictures was never done better than this film. Hitchcock at his most brilliant would later do the same thing in his action-suspense films. When you understand this & watch Hitchcocks films again, you realize just what I mean.An amazing testament to Lang's talent is the fact that the rest of the cast in this movie could have been anyone and it didn't really matter. The ultimate film maker made this film, and influenced the rest of film history through the rest of the 20th century & even now some into the 21st.",Metropolis
40,lasttimeisaw,Metropolis,8,19 November 2012,"Out of admiration and reverence, Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS has seized me with its utterly ""mission-impossible"" scale of a dystopian world (weighing against its time), the avant-garde structural grandeur and a stiflingly rigid and consistently overpowering score. What I watched is a 119 min DVD edition out around 2002, surely this revamped version has maximized the completeness of this allegorical chef d'oeuvre, the overt omissions of certain parts have inevitably and massively stunted the narrative arc.It's a gnawing wrestle between my conscience and my criterion on films to finalize the rating as 8 out of 10, but honestly if there will be a complete version, minimally a 9 out of 10 is without any dispute. Personally cinema's silent era is my Achilles' heel, my lack of experience has inflicted ill at ease on me while adjusting myself with the puppet-like performances (excluded the pseudo-zombie marching of the mass of workers, which is a masterly gambit) and the over-dramatic formalism (I'm much more of a methodology cinephile). Among the cast, a fearless Bridgitte Helm shines while strenuously emanating her bent through the grappling between good and evil.Also its heavy-handed political metaphor is too blatant, for example, with the over- elaborated fomentation of the workers, it might suits the ideological reality at that time, but weirdly enough, it may also prompt some irksome jitteriness and fall into a set-up as propaganda cliché (the witch-staking bluff is tiresome, why woman should always be the avatar of all the moral frailties?).So if one must select its most striking merits (historically speaking), my personal pick is the ingenious futuristic design, which miraculously has not been sullied at all by the merciless time passing by, it is still daunting and awe-inspiring to picture how Lang and his team could accomplish their work then without the assistance of CGI technology. In the Sci-Fi genre, METROPOLIS is a bona file trail blazer and keeps being the inspiration of many of its posterity almost one century later.",Metropolis
41,Red-Barracuda,A towering achievement of the silent era,8,17 September 2010,"Metropolis has just been re-released in a brand new expanded version that includes material just re-discovered in 2008. The new material has been edited into the film and constitutes many new shots and sections, ranging from the very brief to whole new plot strands. This new material is unsurprisingly not in the greatest condition seeing as its been sitting around in a can for eighty years, so it's entirely obvious where it's been added to the final film. It's grainy and old looking, unlike the rest of the film which frankly looks pristine. However, this new material is an excellent find and a fine addition to the final movie and really adds to the film hugely.Seeing the film again on the big screen is always nice. Metropolis remains a towering cinematic achievement. It stands alone in the silent era, as there really isn't anything else like it. It would be another forty years before the science fiction genre had another film of anything like the same scale and ambition (2001: A Space Odyssey). The sheer imagination and artistry are what set it apart and give it its classic status. It's not a movie without faults - it does flag at times due to its long running time – but its vision cannot be denied. From the imaginative model work, the enormous sets, the hundreds of extras, the iconic female android, the delirious dream sequence and the epic destruction scenes at the finale. Metropolis is full of quite incredible moments. It also has a social message of sorts, in it's asking for understanding between the worker class and the rulers of a society. Some of my favourite scenes involve the evil Maria android leading the denizens of Metropolis astray. Of the new material, my favourite addition is the Thin Man, a devilish character who wears a black Panama hat and leather gloves – he can best be described as an evil Man from Del Monte – he's such a great addition to the new expanded version.Metropolis is not always an entertaining watch and some viewers may very well find it a drag. This is perhaps inevitable in a silent film of this length. However, if you are an intrepid cinema-goer then it is well worth your time seeing this Fritz Lang classic. It truly is a monumentally important film.",Metropolis
42,Rainey-Dawn,Good Classic Sci-Fi Fantasy,7,7 June 2015,"I've seen this movie before and watched it quickly again recently for a review and to refresh my memory on the film. Is this movie good? Yes! Taking into context the film is from 1927: The film was and still is good for it's time era. I'm not rating this film based on the age of the film which is pushing 90 years old - I'm rating this film based on how good it is all the way around (acting, casting, script, special effects, cinematography, etc...) and the film is good.I've seen other films from around 1927 and ""Metropolis"" is one of the best films of that time era. The movie is one of the earliest films that I would call an ""Epic"" even though it might not be considered an ""Epic"".Some people are tired of dystopian types of films - and that is OK but this is one of the earliest films in that category so it's a terrible reason to knock the film. Also if one does not like dystopian films then they simply need not watch them. ""Metropolis"" is set in a dystopian futuristic world so if you do not like these types of films then don't watch ""Metropolis""; if you do like them then you might enjoy this movie.It is a silent film and one of the best silent films you will ever see. It is a top class classic movie for a reason.I am giving the film 7.5 stars because there are scenes that seem to drag on forever - very slow scenes that could have been filmed at a quicker pace.

44,ElMaruecan82,The Film We All Saw Before Seeing It...,10,26 October 2016,"If ""The Birth of a Nation"" was a first step in the history of filmmaking, ""Metropolis"" was the giant leap. It is sad that many self-pretending movie lovers never saw the film but in fact, no one can pretend to have never seen anything of it either.Everything in Fritz Lang's pioneering film has been replicated in other Sci-fi classics; the 1927 milestone is one déja vu after another. From the post-modern depiction of a dystopian future made of majestic high-rise towers and pre-apocalyptic urban chaos to the mad scientist archetypes, and the robotic duplication of human forms, ""Metropolis"" is simply the film that defined a genre, and not the least highest-grossing one. For each dollar made today, I believe there's a symbolic cent owed to the visionary genius of director Fritz Lang. Watching ""Metropolis"" is a constant invitation for marvel at the magnificent special effects, from the recreation of the city to the light visuals. It's one of these film you keep saying 'how did they do that?"", well just like King Kong, stop motion. To provide the 10 seconds that show the Metropolis town with the automobiles, the planes and the trains on the high level bridges, it took men moving the vehicles one millimeter for each take, and eight days of work. Eight days, probably thousands of dollars, for an exposition shot, no wonder it was the most expensive film of its time.But Fritz Lang was extremely self-conscious, and with Hollywood's endorsement and the help of sculptors and architects, he recreated a universe so convincingly real half the excitement was achieved. Not only that, but he set the tone for the quality control and perfectionism that allowed the Sci-fi genre to prevail. If Lang did that in 1927, we can understand why Ridley Scott and James Cameron never shied away from work. And it's precisely because the Sci-fi genre isn't just about visuals but has many statements to make, tainted with political, philosophical or religious undertones, that it must earn our suspension of disbelief first. The effects are the ends but not the means.Indeed, I mentioned ""The Birth of a Nation"", but if Griffith's epic is worth the praise on the narrative level, ""Metropolis"" is light-years ahead because it's entertaining regardless of its historical significance. You can enjoy it by following the story, which is as complex, bizarre, labyrinthine and multi-layered as the world it features. It's incredible how people were so convinced that the Great War ended them all that they could set stories in archetypal postmodern worlds, lead by capitalism, divided in two classes, one living by its working force, and one that lives with the capital earned, machinery as the new slavery, and the source of some of the film's most iconic imagery. The film opens with the kind of effects overused in propaganda films about the industrial effort, but the message is different, workers are the tools and the sheep, and the film opens with hundreds of them going to the factory, heads down, while others leave it. The parallelism is powerful; they're so many you can only visualize them as a dehumanized mass, of interchangeable tools as individually meaningless as that mechanical device formed by a 10- hour clock. Even the job is a sort of McGuffin whose only purpose is to highlight the existential entrapment of these workers; work is their misfortune and the key to the idyllic and dream-like happiness of the privileged ones. This vision of the future is scary but still vivid in our eschatological fear to be the slaves of a dominant race, in this film, the tool of domination is wealth, but later, in Germany, it would be based on race and arms. ""Metropolis"" prophetically reveals to which extremes humanity can go if, and the trigger to the action is when Maria, the saintly blonde woman coming to the upper Gardens with the children from the slums, this is where Freder, the son of Metropolis' builder realizes that there's a reality behind his wealth. ""Metropolis"" is about this very awareness and how it can be used for better, when the heart is the mediator between the mind and the hand. It is possible that the film was banned by the Soviets because it insinuated that the Communist revolution was the heartless move but the Nazi's perspective is pivotal too. Lang escaped from Germany when approached by the Nazi regime while his wife who wrote the original novel, Thea von Harbou, joined the party. It is just as if the two makers represented the two extremes of humanity. As if you could find in ""Metropolis"" both the appeal of the Nazi party and its total humanitarian antithesis. When hundreds of shaven-heads innocents are thrown in the fire of a God-like monster, you can't ignore the coming atrocities of WWII. There's no scene in ""Metropolis"" that doesn't reflect the fears of humanity. And maybe that's why, unlike many Sci-fi films that play the gloomy card to the core, it chose to have an optimistic ending. As if the best way to convey a message is to reflect what good can be brought of humanity if people put their minds and hearts into it. This is why ""Metropolis"" is relevant whatever the time-line you situate your analysis, our world can look like ""Metropolis"", for the film doesn't age, it is a timeless masterpiece. Perhaps the only aspect that 'ages' the film is the acting but this is German expressionism at its best and the laughable antics of Gustav Frohlich are acceptable if you can enjoy the expressive eyes of Brigitte Helm and her lascivious dance. Even the special effects don't age the film, on the contrary, with CGI, the amazement is gone, the best effects are those that inspire these 'how did they do that?' questions, ""Terminator 2"" did and here's again a film that borrows from ""Metropolis"".Which Sci-fi landmark doesn't?",Metropolis
45,gbill-74877,The future that looks a little like the present,9,9 May 2016,"'Metropolis' grabs you from the start, with highly stylized visions of the future and a brilliant score. It is very artistic, well ahead of its time in its filmmaking, and as is the case with a lot of science fiction, was also making commentary about life in the present.In the future, Lang says, despite many advances in technology, there are still people who subjugate and rule over others, and there is still a working class which may turn into an unruly mob. It's hard not to see the issues of today and the growing income gap in these groups! Those who control Metropolis live in a lofty utopia, while those who operate its machines live in its depths. Who can forget Lang's images of their dehumanization as they go to work, and then, almost as machines themselves, control the elaborate system of dials? Those are some truly wonderful scenes, and Lang also gives us a fantastic robot (a ""machine-man""), shots of air and car traffic in the future, and a skeleton representing death playing the flute, waiving a scythe, and causing the statues of the seven deadly sin to slowly advance. He also effectively uses large numbers of people to swarm the set at times to emphasize the grand scale of it all.Alfred Abel is very good as the cool, calculating, and cruel Joh Fredersen, one of the rulers, and Gustav Fröhlich is reasonably good as his son, who empathizes with the workers. Those who rule are the 'head' of humanity, those who are ruled are the 'hands', and Lang's point is that both sides must remember kindness, and be mediated by the 'heart'. Indeed.The acting is beyond over-the-top in places (particularly Brigitte Helm), the middle of the film drags a bit and could have been pared down, and Lang hits us over the head with his final message – and yet the film's ambition and artistry really stand out, particularly for the period in which it was made, and it is well worthy of its reputation as a classic.",Metropolis

47,F Gwynplaine MacIntyre,"My favourite film, my last review.",10,24 June 2010,"'Metropolis' is my all-time favourite movie, so I've saved this for the last review that I plan to write for this wonderful website IMDb. I've enjoyed sharing my experiences of the movies I've seen, but now I'm moving on to other passions.Although written by Fritz Lang's wife Thea von Harbou, 'Metropolis' was originally Lang's idea: he was inspired by the sight of New York's skyscrapers when he sailed to America in 1925. During his American trip, he visited the set of 'The Phantom of the Opera' and met Lon Chaney! Too bad the encounter wasn't filmed.Despite its epic power, 'Metropolis' makes very little sense. The two major male characters are a father and son named Freder and Fredersen, so why is the one named Freder*sen* the father (not son) of the one cried Freder? Why does the master of Metropolis deliberately connive to destroy the city that he built? Why is Rotwang's crude little cottage the only pre-Fredersen building that wasn't demolished during the construction of this city? (Von Harbou's very long and unwieldy novelisation of her script establishes this fact but never explains it.) How and why did Rotwang's high-tech laboratory manage to get constructed BENEATH that cottage without disturbing it?For modern viewers, some of the plot's incoherence can be blamed on missing footage, particularly in American prints. The distributors for this film's original Stateside release commissioned playwright Channing Pollock to translate the German titles. A major subplot of the backstory features a deceased woman named Hel, who was married to Rotwang but left him to marry Fredersen and give birth to Freder. This unseen woman's name could not easily be changed for the American version, due to a couple of shots of her memorial, engraved with the Teutonic name HEL. Apparently, Pollock feared that American viewers would be offended by this word's similarity to 'Hell', so he simply excised the entire subplot from this long movie.The real-life drama on the set of 'Metropolis' must've been quite interesting in itself. Mad scientist Rotwang (alias Doctor Strangeglove) is played by actor Rudolf Klein-Rogge, who had been married to scenarist von Harbou before she left him to marry Fritz Lang, the mastermind of this film. In 'Metropolis', Rotwang's wife left him to marry the master of Metropolis. I'd love to know how Klein-Rogge felt about the fact that his real-life marital (and sexual) situation was the inspiration for key plot elements of this movie ... and I wonder how Klein-Rogge felt about knowing that the entire cast and crew knew this as well.Most astonishing about this gargantuan production is the fact that nearly all of 'Metropolis' was actually built to scale, with just a couple of miniatures.Trivia tidbit: actress Brigitte Helm was cast in the dual female role largely because she was flat-chested, and therefore she could easily fit inside the mechanical suit for the Robotrix. A more busty actress would have suffered constant discomfort inside those galvanised bosoms of the metal costume. I learnt this more than 20 years ago from an eldery Austrian stagehand who worked on the film.For all its flaws, 'Metropolis' will always be my favourite movie. I've enjoyed writing all these reviews for IMDb. The joy of posting my reviews on this site has brought me many friendships and a few enemies. Well, you can't win 'em all.Nitrate film stock doesn't last forever, and all good things come to a happy ending. This is my last review here. I'll keep watching movies, but other passions are important to me as well. Thank you, IMDb, and thank you to everyone who has read my reviews. I will happily rate 'Metropolis' a full 10 out of 10.",Metropolis
48,851222,The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be The Heart,9,21 September 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Metropolis"" (1927) is a superbly visionary sci-fi tale about differences between classes with some slight religious undertones involved. It is a great movie. It is nearly impossible to objectively review film made in 1927, because the movie making and the world itself were different. But it is safe to say that ""Metropolis"" is a one great film, because it has some great ideas, which i don't think have aged that significantly. Movie making is brilliant, there some shoots in this movie that i haven't saw before (really), like the one where endless line of people goes to the mountain - how did they did this? The story itself like i said is superbly visionary - how did they even thought to film this story back in 1927? I guess if you are dying to do something in your life passionately, all obstacles are meaningless.Overall, ""Metropolis"" is a must see movie to all who loves movies in general. Great ideas, superb plot, superb craftsmanship (for that period) and just a such a visionary art - this is a great film, which i glad i saw.",Metropolis
49,Bored_Dragon,The mediator between brain and hands must be the heart!,8,7 March 2018,"In 1927, Austrian director Fritz Lang released the SF drama ""Metropolis"", movie that Hitler and Goebbels liked so much that they offered him status of a honorary Aryan, despite his Jewish origin. For its time, this film is a marvel of cinema and it's really hard to believe it's so old. It is considered one of the greatest films of all time and has had a great influence on the future of the genre. The city of Metropolis in DC Universe was named after this film, and design of C-3PO from the ""Star Wars"" is based on this robot. There are also futuristic cities from ""Blade Runner"" and ""Dark City"", Tim Barton's Gotham, as well as many crazy scientists who strongly resemble this from ""Metropolis"". After the premiere, the film was butchered by shortening and for decades it was thought that about a quarter of the film was forever lost. In 2008, a damaged but complete copy of the original film was found in Argentina, which was combined with a shortened version and the film was reconstructed in its original form. The story is a futuristic version of the biblical ""Tower of Babylon"", placed in 2026. The film was extremely high-budget for its time, and some of the special effects invented for this film are still in use. Nevertheless, in its time, this movie was failure and it almost bankrupt the studio. ""Too bad that so much really artistic work is wasted on this manufactured story"" - Variety. ""A technical marvel with feet of clay, a picture as soulless as the manufactured woman of its story"" - The New York Times. H.G. Wells called it the silliest movie he had ever seen, with a sort of malignant stupidity. ""Metropolis, in its forms and shapes, is already as a possibility a third of a century out of date."" I personally liked everything except the fact that the movie is extremely slow. Not slow in terms of lack of action and idle, but leaves the impression of slow motion. After about an hour I set the player to speed x1.5 and the movie suddenly became much better. Although scenes of chasing that way look much like Tom & Jerry cartoons, everything else looks more natural than in its original speed.8/10",Metropolis
50,briancham1994,Finally restored,7,10 August 2020,"This film has finally been rediscovered and restored to a near-complete state. In almost a hundred years, we can finally see more of the film than anyone before us and almost get the complete picture. It's a story ahead of its time and perpetually topical with its divide between the working and upper classes. The ending and resolution are a bit cheesy though - ""the mediator between the head and the the hands must be the heart!"" - what does that even mean?",Metropolis
51,didi-5,seminal German classic,6,28 November 2003,"'Metropolis' was far better than anything Fritz Lang did outside of Germany, although it wasn't quite as powerful as a whole as I thought from previous viewings.The performances in the main can't be faulted, especially Gustav Fröhlich as Freder, Rudolf Klein-Rogge as the crazed inventor Rotwang, Heinrich George as the foreman Grot, and of course the young Brigitte Helm as the two Marias (although I find her bad Maria slightly cringeworthy in places). Teetering on the side of caricature are Alfred Abel as Joh Fredersen and Theodor Loos as Josaphat.The scenes that stay with me are the ones I remembered for years - the transformation of the Machine Man to the false Maria, the Tower of Babel creation and fall, the death of the worker who Freder replaced as he is trying to save him from the mob, the slow moving lines of workers as they change shifts, the large clock, and the children clinging to the monument as their city is flooded.  It is a complex film which could be read as a defence of organised thought and mediation, but I think it is so much more.  Some of the shots, of the upper city for example, and of Maria bathed in light as she is pursued by Rotwang, are superb.",Metropolis
52,Dr_Coulardeau,The Inventor preaches rebellion,10,14 February 2007,"This film is a myth. 1925-1927 in Germany was a crucial period. The depression was going to arrive soon with its unemployment, financial catastrophe, and nazism. All that is clearly reflected in the film. There are two levels in this city, the underground level for factories and the working class, and the top level for business people, politicians and other privileged people. The latter dance, feast, do nothing but enjoy what other people under them create and produce. This vision of a world cut in two social classes is quite common in those days though today it sounds a little bit schematic. In these days everything was either black or white. The trick in the film is that the son of the ruler of this metropolis falls in love with a certain Maria from underground who preaches the coming of some kind of Messiah to establish peace and freedom for all. She preaches in the catacombs exclusively to working class people. She represents some hope and patience. But it all runs afoul when the ruler decides to get rid of his main counselor and to encourage his inventor to kidnap this Maria to use her face on the inventor's robot. This robot then goes down underground and preaches rebellion and destruction. The real Maria, with the help of the ruler's son and his fired main counselor will save all the children trapped in the underground city and will catch up on the crowd of working class people looking for vengeance in the name of their supposedly lost children. Luckily the good news will change the atmosphere, though not the fate of the false Maria who is already burning at the stake, which reveals she is nothing but a robot. Then the inventor had managed to recapture the real Maria and the ruler's son runs after them. The inventor will be defeated, Maria saved and some kind of peace reestablished between the leader/foreman of the working class and the ruler of the metropolis, thanks to the intermission of the ruler's son who appears to be the Messiah or go-between they were waiting for. The interest of the film here is that it is messianic because it foresees what is going to happen though it tries to avoid it or preach a middle way between the two extremes. We have to think of H.G. Wells and his Time Machine. The two worlds are not incompatible, just not able to communicate any more. The solution, the way out is for Fritz Lang the possibility to communicate again for these two classes, with a strong common ground which is found in some kind of Christian inspiration mainly from the Book of Revelation. But the main interest of the film is technical. It is a film that associates some kind of animation, the filming of pictures, images and objects, and the filming of real characters in the setting that these images represent. For the period it was very advanced and some of the special effects necessary for the depicting of the machines, the factories and the collapse of the underground city are extremely fascinating in spite of their rudimentary nature. It is also a mute film and the acting is extremely expressive, even if the quantity of text is rather important. The point is that the acting is probably just as expressive as Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton, but not in a comic direction, rather in a very tragic and dramatic way. These actors and actresses are able to really express feelings only with their body language. The best case is the main actress who plays both the real Maria and the false Maria. She manages to contrast the two parts perfectly and only with her body language. Some of the visions contained in this film have since been used by many other filmmakers and imitated or even copied by many fiction writers. We should also note the music which accompanies this film. It is slightly repetitive but keeps some liveliness and originality.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",Metropolis
53,eddie_baggins,A genre-defining masterpiece,10,1 October 2020,"It's incredible to think that near 100 years on from its initial release, the game changing dystopian Sci-Fi Metropolis remains such a fascinating and gripping watch.Filmed over the course of 18 grueling months for the at the time unfathomable amounts of money, famed director Fritz Lang's non-dialogue adaptation of Thea von Harbou's novel of the same name set in place a series of what would become genre cornerstones, as he and Harbou (working as the films official screenwriter) explored an eerily on point future world where the rich live a life of casual luxury and the working-class toil away on the daily grind.There's an abundance of ideas, visuals and themes here, with Metropolis overflowing with iconic imagery and concepts that have ensured it stays relevant across the number of decades that pass on since its initial cinematic run but its also the story of the well to do Freder Fredersen falling in love and experiencing the other side of a less privileged life that captivates as equally as everything else going on around it.Clocking in at two and a half hours (after original film reels were rediscovered after an extensively edited shorter version was at times shown), Lang's journey takes its time delving into the world building of its narrative and its examination of Freder's eye's being opened to a world he never understood or even knew existed.It's a fairly traditional fish out of water plot line, one that features hidden identities and love against the odds but Metropolis never gets weighed down in the slightest as its prophets, plotting evildoers and everyday blue-collar workers get caught up in the storm.Within this epic tale, while ever silent bar its sound effects and memorable score, every character within feels as utterly alive as the universe they find themselves in with the multi-tasking Brigitte Helm a standout and a trooper taking on the roles of Freder's crush Maria, her evil counterpart Maschinenmensch and also suited up as the Machine Man, its a noteworthy three-pronged performance from the silent film star and but another reason why this game-changing offering remains so revered.Final Say -Filled with tiny nuances and attention to detail, Metropolis is a big film that dared to dream even bigger and created a whole new genre while doing so. A major silent film achievement, Fritz Lang's masterpiece is an absolute necessity to view as a film fan.5 mad scientists out of 5",Metropolis
54,johnnyboyz,"The title invokes something grandeur; something magnificent, in Lang's Metropolis we have something towering over cinema in all its splendor.",8,22 May 2013,"At a time when cinema was still growing out of its foundations and into something more resembling an art form, complete with narratives and character depiction, Metropolis strikes us as a proverbial God-send. The attitudes of the time saw cinema attempt to push on from what usually consisted of meagre genres films often limited to ""trick"" or ""chase"" films, a push already synonymous with the desire to move away from early actualities designed to show off off this new invention they call ""moving images"". Both French and American film-makers were putting in the hard yards in this respect, but this silent effort from 1927 distinguished itself even further. Descending from Germany, and made by a director who was already turning heads in his ability to combine adventure with spectacle, here was somebody building on what had preceded the project only to end up combining character and story with genre on top of visual appeal and a socio-political undertone. The result is Metropolis. The film is a drama depicting form of class distinction, but told through the means of expressionist horror; a film with an agenda to depict the rich and the poor living less so in harmony as much as they do entirely ignorant of one another. It's a film about the perils of dividing a population based on their class and income; a film about how redundancy can lead to suicide and how those at the top really are, at the worst of times, fatuous capitalist-infused businesspersons who don't at all mind if a few hundred suffer if it means they themselves grow richer. What the film is about is the belief that two very specific, very segregated groups of people can live in such close proximity with another without tension or non-harmony - what it depicts is the bubbling up of an anger felt by one of these groups, the 'lesser' of the two, to an extent whereby it explodes. Tossed in for good measure is a young man from the 'right' side of the tracks whose love for a young woman based where he may not tread is depicted. Where Lang tackles class way back in the 1920s, it is not difficult to substitute said item for race and translate it to the modern day; a pseudo-belief that racial pockets of whites and various others can congregate in peace with one another as those at the very top grow rich off a lot of suffering. Certain Internet sources speak of remakes and such that have always been in the pipeline – perhaps, thematically, the race card at such a time is the ticket in.Gustav Fröhlich plays Freder, the closest we have to a kind of protagonist. A young man, Freder lives on the surface of planet Earth in a futuristic city at some point in the then-distant future. Freder is handsome and athletic, a sprinter who has a wide circle of fellow athletes whom he calls friends. Running around the track so as to keep in shape, living out days in lush gardens and enjoying the company of equally attractive young woman to an upbeat and radiant visual sensibility, young Freder has it made. All of this is of course possible through the enormous wealth of his father Joh (Abel), the very man responsible for cutting a divide between those on the surface and those who live and work below and getting rich as a result of it. Then there are those people below, a disconsolate bunch who wade on into a workplace everyday charged with pumping the pistons and hitting all the right buttons at all the right times less the titular Metropolis above lose all its flash and power. Below in this Hellish zone is Maria (Helm), a woman who snuck above to the surface on the one day Freder was in the vicinity; immediately captured by her good looks, on top of the fact she seems to slink back below to whence she came, Freder follows her down and the reality of why he's been living so well with his father pulling the strings hits him. In terms of basic set up, anything in the early portions of Metropolis is able to rival the best of what has been made in a post-Classical; post-sound era of cinema that transcends nations and languages. There is a distinction between lead role, supporting act and everybody else; character traits are established and a world for the characters within which the adventure may play out is constructed. At a time when, a mere eight years earlier, the likes of D.W. Griffith was producing Broken Blossoms with a keenness to blend the old guard of superfluous actuality in his montages of market places and public streets with grittier and harder content that involved fictional characters, Metropolis is a concentrated and elegant depiction of what needs to be established. However, the film is not necessarily committed to depicting a love story as much as it is a tale of what eventually cascades into full-on warfare between the divided masses. Opening theory gives way to a middle game built on spectacle and relationship dramas tangled up between Joh and his assistants; Freder with Maria and a whole lot of both industrial guilt and fury involving the many beneath the surface whose conditions push them to revolt. The spectacle underground is ugly and cragged, that of above the surface polished and uncanny; machines work, but they do so with a behavioural repetition designed to have us feel uneasy. Later on, both the sex and curiosity that dominated the opening in Freder's following of Maria will combine into a living entity; this will be a robotic incarnation of Maria that is introduced. Historically, one cannot deny the film its standing; as a piece of standalone cinema, we are captured by its plot and the people therein – as something which begs the question as to whether it should be seen, the answer is ""of course"".",Metropolis
55,filipemanuelneto,One of the most visually appealing silent films I know.,10,23 January 2020,"This is probably one of the greatest silent films ever made and one of the great classics of cinema before the Second World War. It is amazing how, in a sense, it is still up to date and influencing more recent films (""Elysium"" is the name that occurs to me more quickly now because I saw it recently, but there are more). Its futuristic look has influenced most of the sci-fi films, such as ""Star Wars"", ""Star Trek"", the animated series ""Futurama"" and even the cartoon ""The Jetsons"".Made with great quality, it is a film whose elegant cinematography already reminds us of the look of the first spoken films, in the thirties. There is some academic debate about whether this film belongs to the expressionist movement or not. Personally, I think there are clear expressionist influences on the story told, where paranoia and mistrust towards authority are constant, but visually, they are no longer expressionist.The story told is deeply dystopian and mixes futuristic elements with biblical allusions: Metropolis is a huge futuristic city run by one man: Johann Fredersen, who lives in the New Tower of Babel. However, it is supported by an immense number of workers who, in the depths, operate a series of machines for hours on end, in inhuman conditions. Freder, the son of Johann Fredersen, decides to try to put an end to this injustice.In the film, in addition to the good performances of actors such as Gustav Fröhlich, Alfred Abel, Rudolf Klein-Rogge and Brigitte Helm, production values stand out. The music is excellent and matches the film perfectly; the costumes are good and the sets, especially, are great. The special and visual effects are good and work very well. The scene of the creation of the Woman Machine is particularly stunning. Cinematography uses a lot of light and shadow and the film is very visually pleasing, one of the most pleasant in silent cinema, in my opinion.",Metropolis

57,leplatypus,More visionary about workers than robots (rental),10,9 June 2018,"As usual, the best movies to expand a citizen point of views are not what they are : for years, Metropolis was branded for my eyes as a Scifi movie with the 1st robot ever, a female one whose surface would inspire the future C3PO and that's all !
Now that i have seen it, i realized that the robot element is not that essential (it would have been the same with genetic clone) while all the social struggle and workers revolt that is the main subject of the movie are kept quiet in medias.That subject is so protest, so dangerous for governments that the few movies about it are cautiously put away : So while this movie is nearly 1 century old, it's the 1st time that i see in a picture a social revolt in a modern state ! The scenes are powerful because they are oppressive and this Metropolis guesses what happens today : 2 classes : one that works in pitiful housing, one that has fun in luxury appartements. This divided city is totally accurate (for example, Paris has left for the rich and right for the poor, NYC is up for riches and down for poor)). It could be a Marxist movie but conformist reviews tackles it like a Nazi one (the argument used in France to eradicate all subversive thinking, whatever it's exactly) : Anyway, as a German movie, we find the usual praise for body health and the leader thematic. As a director, Lang is really talented and uses primitive tools to new horizons : the situations are so dangerous (especially, the night pursuit) or nightmarish that it's nearly an horror movie and in no way, you could guess it's so old. At the end, it's a sort of Brazil but without any fun and the gothic ending is really similar to Burton's Batman ! So it's a must-see movie !",Metropolis
58,TheMovieDiorama,Metropolis unfolds into a mechanical masterpiece in ingenuity and expressionism.,9,25 February 2019,"The grandfather of science-fiction. The film that single-handedly pioneered a genre. Just, impressive. I've been waiting a good few years to watch this German expressionistic silent film, and the time has finally come. With 150 minutes being recovered and mostly restored from the 153 minute original runtime, this was the closest to the full cut I was ever going to get. Fritz Lang not only implanted his views on authoritarianism and capitalism, but he crafted and adapted a film revolving around the idea of social justice. Revolutionary back in 1927, and yet still thematically important today.The son of the ""head"" of Metropolis decides to switch his lifestyle and work as a ""hand"" in the underground working city, to which he quickly falls in love with an innocent woman who gives insight into faithful readings. During this time, an inventor builds a man-machine and chooses to lead the workers into revolution by destroying the very city they have been working on.Much like the film itself, the city is bustling with themes and social injustice. A class system where workers must work every day underground whilst the wealthy enjoy the endless possibilities of knowledge, entertainment and everything else the gargantuan city has to offer. Fritz Lang takes a traditional romance and develops it during a period of economic struggle and freedom deprivation. His technical prowess and inventiveness when directing all these characters is what makes Metropolis timeless (and one heck of an experience).For a silent film, there was a considerable amount of personality being shown through exaggerated arm-flailing performances. Fröhlich, with his questionable attire, commands the film through his naivety. Abel on the other hand acts as the manifestation of autocratic authority, with a frown that will haunt your dreams. But it's Helm, presenting us with a dual performance, who goes full arm-flailing. Encapsulating the fragility of Christianity when she's Maria, but quickly shifting to psychotic revolutionist when transformed to the ""Man-Machine"". What intrigued me the most was the neutral state these characters resided within. The Man-Machine, whilst attempting to create social justice through worker's revolt, did so in a method that would become a detriment to everyone. Through authoritative order, it created uncontrollable chaos. Conversely, Fredersen overlooks a futuristic cityscape deprived of a democratic system, but does so for what he believed was the best for his people.The ""head"" and ""hands"" of society must come together through a mediator that understands both parties, the ""heart"". This thematic message comes full circle during its concluding minutes, which unfortunately was my main criticism for the film. Lang conveyed this heavy-handedly, as if the audience were unable to depict this metaphor for themselves. Considering the expertise and masterclass in production design that preceded this, it was somewhat a slap in the face. Speaking of production design, this sci-fi flick features some of the best stage sets available at the time. From layered cut outs illustrating the complexity of the city's infrastructure to beastly machines that act as the heart of civilisation. Lang naturally gives grandeur to his production. He also includes gothic structures, in particular a stoic cathedral, to represent the need for history and its importance in a world advancing with technology. This goes without saying the connotations of Christianity, especially a dream-like scene involving the seven deadly sins.The restoration of the film itself was stunning, and holds up well to this day. I believe one scene involving an inventor being overthrown by Fredersen is still missing, and so consequently the film felt jarring for one moment. However I am unable to criticise this. A few plot conveniences here and there and an overall lacking of title cards, but small nitpicks.Metropolis has attained a rare achievement. It has stood the test of time, not just with its technological ingenuity, but with its coherent themes of society. This may just be Fritz Lang's masterpiece, and deservedly so.",Metropolis

61,SAMTHEBESTEST,UNBELIEVABLE ! Fritz Lang's German Masterpiece beyond cinematic knowledge and advanced thinking of Hollywood.,9,22 July 2020,"METROPOLIS (1927) :
Brief Review -UNBELIEVABLE ! Fritz Lang's German Masterpiece beyond cinematic knowledge and advanced thinking of Hollywood. I am still trying to cover myself from what i just saw. I mean how did Fritz Lang come up with this astonishing film in 20s..? We thought James Cameron's Terminator was Path-breaking in 80s and i just learnt that the idea of Machine-man came from Metropolis, like almost 6 decades gap..? Now you understand why i had to begin this review with ""UNBELIEVABLE"". People remember Metropolis for bringing science fiction genre in the World Cinema but it is disgusting that many of them overlooked such an outstanding writting. It includes Love, Friendship, Relationship, Society Classes, Injustice, Discrimination, Politics, Religious stuff, outburst, regret and Goodwill and i was like seriously? How? A film made in 1927 included so many things and used all of them accurately when 99% of all films made in the World Cinema have failed to do so. One can overlook the storyline and enjoy the Grand scale but just try and keep up to the storyline and the cumulative result becomes and Experience to Remember. The writing of the film is top-class as you can see it holds for 153 minutes which is a big achievement in Silent cinema already, and then it offers something beyond your expectations and leaves you with a strong message on Social differences, human nature and sins. It took couple of decades for Hollywood to think of something of this level and still couldn't gather all things properly therefore Metropolis doesn't just pioneers but also keeps it's high standard intact. Hats off to Fritz Lang for bringing this cinematic wonder way before audience and even filmmakers were ready. I would have gone with 10/10* but you know Sci-fi things doesn't happen in Real life and my criteria of 10/10 film includes real Life theories. Besides, it has everything beyond knowledge and expectations.RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest",Metropolis
62,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A stunning and daring achievement for a silent film.,8,27 June 2009,"Begun in 1925, Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" is probably the most ambitious film ever made. Science-Fiction ""dystopia"" films are still challenging to do in the modern era of computer generated images, let alone telling a good one in 1920s Germany. To think that the producers of this film spent the equivalent of a $200 M summer blockbuster in today's terms in a tattered post-WWI Germany makes a powerful statement about film as an art form.""Metropolis"" is a silent film set in the future about a city divided between the wealthy, elite city planners and the underground working masses that make the city operate. A hopeful but potentially dangerous link forms between the two when the son of the city leader notices a young and optimistic religious figure named Maria from the underground and his curiosity about her people heightens.The film operates from a mantra: ""there can be no understanding between the hand and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator."" It's goal is then to show us why this is true and it certainly does. It's a commentary on social class that disapproves of the disconnect between the wealthy and the newly emerged working/middle class of the time period. Lang brings us some impressive images for 1927. From a modern perspective, it's hard to call it riveting, but especially toward the end it keeps your attention. To think of what this film achieved in that time period helps keep ""Metropolis"" in perspective. It would make for an intriguing modern remake or other sort of adaptation, that's for sure.",Metropolis

64,funkyfry,The best sci-fi film of all time?,10,25 October 2002,"This is a great masterpiece of film in general -- and one of the best sci-fi films I have ever seen.  The story and ""moral"" are largely pointless or naive, but the images and direction tell another story entirely -- one that centers on man and machine, or the machine in man.  Sex and mechanics are joined in the lovely robot, played to perfection by Helm.  Strange mixture of scientific paranoia and residual ""witch"" fear in Rotwang, probably the central ""mad scientist"" all other such film villains are based on. 
This film is the cornerstone of science fiction cinema and should be seen by everyone who is a fan of sci-fi films or books.  I've heard that a nice DVD release has finally be arranged, but I haven't seen it in stores as of yet (10/02).  I'll be waiting for that, because the prints in circulation here (including DVD) are terrible except for the wack 80s version with Loverboy and all that, where the print was better done but the music has to be turned off to make taking the movie seriously possible.  In fact, one of the most entertaining things about being a fan of this movie is coming up with different songs that will work for different parts of the movie when you watch it (mine involves liberal mixes of John Coltrane, Skinny Puppy and Public Enemy, etc.).A real argument could be made that this is the greatest of sci-fi films, because just about every film of its type to this day has imitated it (the recent ""Minority Report"" is no exception, though it is of poor quality).  It is only the visual aspects of the movie which have lasted, not the story, but this is what is really original and compelling about the movie anyway; the rest is just a mix of standard bible or egypt epic melodrama plot with a religious propaganda slant.  But the images stay alive and spawn other worlds of science fiction creation, and it is for this that we must really love this movie and revere it as the classic it is.",Metropolis
65,Anonymous_Maxine,Early science fiction story that presents a pessimistic prediction of a future society.,10,16 February 2001,"Who ever heard of an epic science fiction film? Especially in the 1920s? Sure, some science fiction movies are huge today, such as George Lucas' latest goofy Star Wars movie, but in 1926, Fritz Lang came out with a brilliant film about what the future would be like if people went on living the way they were living back then. And sure enough, we went right ahead living the way we were living, the population got bigger and more crowded, and now modern society is not a whole lot different from what was presented in Metropolis. The story is about a young rich kid without a care in the world who becomes concerned about the way that society (Metropolis) was run by his father, John Frederson, the master of Metropolis. He lives in a Pleasure Garden' high above the level of the workers', and he worries about what would happen if the huge number of workers were to turn against his father, given the terrible conditions under which they live and work. Some of the best scenes in the film take place in the underground mines, showing the workers portrayed as little more than components on a gigantic, sinister looking machine. The scene where the machine overheated even contained some impressive stunts, as well as interesting cinematography as the machine transforms into a giant devil-looking monster.  After countless workers are consumed by it (no wonder this was Hitler's favorite film), they are immediately replaced by other workers, who go right to the same spots that the previous men left and resume their robotic movements. If some of these scenes, men can be seen being carried away on stretchers after having been injured, and the rest of the workers keep right on working, hardly even noticing.The way that the workers are portrayed as lifeless machines is one of the more potent elements of this film, as well as the most revealing about the directors intentions. When his son complains about the tragic things that go on in the mines, Frederson replies that such accidents are unavoidable, but his son still insists that they deserve credit for building the city. This is the kind of content that foreshadows some serious mutiny, and at the same time it shows what may very well happen when large groups of people feel mistreated. `Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups' is a saying that doesn't necessarily only apply to stupid people, as Metropolis suggests. Fritz Lang brilliantly portrays this very complex story with extremely limited dialogue, and the result is still compelling today. The special effects in this film are decades ahead of its time  it even resembles The Fifth Element in many ways (except that the two films can hardly be compared)  and the acting and especially the elaborately created sets are stunning to say the least. An excellent film, Metropolis is one of the few that should never be forgotten.",Metropolis
66,Vartiainen,Pioneer of science fiction films,6,10 February 2015,"It's strange and bizarre to find out that some ideas are way older than you originally thought. This film came out decades before science fiction really took off, and yet it contains many of the mainstays of the genre, from rebellious artificial intelligences to robots to mad scientists to a dystopian future ravaged by class divides.And yes, it's a silent film with dialogue cards and everything. And that can turn a lot of people away from it. Yet, if you can deal with subtitles, you can deal with this film, and you in fact should deal with it, because it's well worth a watch, if only because of its revolutionary scope, originality and story.Admittedly, it's not a perfect film. The story, while interesting, captivating and unlike anything seen before, is simplistic in its themes and the characters are rather black-n-white, though perhaps the term archetypical would be more descriptive. But that's only by today's standards. And even by those standards, some things have held up remarkably well. The set designs and all the visual details in general are still amazing, the acting is topnotch and as a whole the film has a phenomenal atmosphere of gloom mixed with triumph and ideals larger than man.Metropolis is heartily recommended for all fans of science fiction. It's one of the originals and its legacy is not going to be forgotten anytime soon.",Metropolis
67,robert-temple-1,"2010 final restoration version, a miracle of rediscovery of a lost masterpiece",10,13 September 2010,"The occasion of my 500th review for IMDb seems a good time to review one of the greatest masterpieces of the history of the cinema. At last! The DVD is out with the restoration which took 12 years and the combined efforts of many people and organisations, putting Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS back together again for the first time since 1927, adding half an hour of recovered footage to the length, digitally enhancing every frame, improving the titles, and with the wonderful bonus of the restoration of the original 1927 orchestral score. This may be the greatest cinematic restoration and recovery effort in history, and it gives back to us a version of one of the world's major films as last seen in Berlin in 1927, and never seen anywhere outside Berlin even then. The monstrous mutilation of this masterpiece commenced almost as soon as the premiere was over. The recovered footage was found a few years ago in Argentina, no copy having survived in Europe. Now that we can see Lang's true conception of the film, which is wholly different from the mutilated versions which have been shown for the past 83 years, the story at last makes sense. Every time we saw METROPOLIS before, it was not really METROPOLIS at all, and was not even remotely authentic. The footage had been re-edited in such a horribly distorted way that sometimes scenes were used to mean precisely the opposite of what they were originally intended to signify. The DVD contains important interviews, demonstrations, and information about all of this. What happened to this film was as if someone had taken a Rembrandt self-portrait and over-painted it as the portrait of a young girl; the over-painting has now been stripped off entirely, and we see revealed the film which Lang and his wife Thea von Harbou, the joint script writers, originally envisioned. This film was enthusiastically adopted by Goebbels and other Nazis, and von Harbou herself became a fanatical Nazi, so Lang divorced her and famously fled to America after Hitler showed too much interest in him. But that is a long story and one which is well known. One of the most unforgettable aspects of this film are the scenes where the workers march in gangs with their heads lowered in submission, and their simultaneous tread is a monotonous machine-like dragging of their exhausted bodies towards their labour. Doubtless these scenes of the masses dominated by an elite excited the Nazis, as did the visions of a future technological wonderland where speed, power, and efficiency are portrayed with rapturous awe. Of course, there are the dark forces, and there is the unspeakably evil 'Mechanical Man', who is actually female in form, having been given the likeness of the saintly Maria (who had been trying to give hope to the downtrodden workers by addressing secret mass meetings in the catacombs far below Metropolis). Both roles are played by the amazing Brigitte Helm, one of the most brilliant German film actresses ever. Helm quit the film business and moved to Switzerland in 1935 in disgust at Hitler. She must have been as scared as Lang at the combined menace of Hitler, Goebbels, and Thea von Harbou, all of whom must have had their eye on her just as they did Lang. Helm's real surname, by the way, was Schittenhelm, and it is just as well she shortened it! She lived to be 90. Alas, I was in Ascona while she was still alive, and did visit one grand dame who lived there in retirement, but had no idea Helm was there, or I would have tried to meet her as well. Anyone who has seen Helm in one of her films can never forget her. In METROPOLIS she is scintillatingly brilliant both as Jekyll and as Hyde, and she had eyes like road-drills. Alfred Abel is particularly good in this film as the oligarch Joh Fredersen. He exudes an air of such self-assured calm, the very mannered tranquility of the truly rich which drove F. Scott Fitzgerald so wild with excitement and made him think of the rich as a different species, so that he could never stop writing about them with the enthusiasm of a groupie. Rudolf Klein-Rogge is the mad inventor Rotwang, with wild hair and wilder eyes. He is slightly over-the-top, but then, METROPOLIS is as well. The budget for METROPOLIS was gigantic, and I believe the film was made over a period of 13 months. It was a true epic in both senses, its production and its result. However, it was deemed 'too long' for audiences, so like Erich von Stroheim's GREED (1924), both films being too brilliant and too disturbing, the length was used as a pretext for mediocrities to slash, cut, tear, and rend, like a pack of mad warthogs, as mediocrities above all else enjoy attacking and destroying works of genius. (The reason why mediocrities hate genius is because they are incapable of it themselves, and its very existence rubs their noses in their own inadequacy. Their only defense is to destroy that which brings their own inferiority to notice, so that they can live comfortably in their boring bubble as nonentities, undisturbed by reminders that there is anything higher or better than themselves.) The science fiction effects of this production are so far ahead of their time that their successful achievement was itself a kind of science fiction-made-reality. The 'extras' on the DVD give fascinating insights into how these effects were achieved, and anyone interested in the mechanics of illusion will be spellbound at the revelations which are given as to how Lang achieved his visions on screen. Since METROPOLIS was an attempt to envisage the future, it is highly ironical that it required the future's own arrival 83 years later before we were allowed to see what it was that Lang had actually predicted and envisaged.",Metropolis
68,drqshadow-reviews,"A Historically Important, if Thematically Dull, Sci-Fi Showcase",5,28 July 2020,"Fritz Lang's sci-fi godfather has been through several levels of re-cut hell over the past hundred years. Slashed by nearly an hour for its original western release, trimmed further by Nazi censors in 1936, color tinted and re-edited in the '80s (with a modern rock soundtrack) by Giorgio Moroder, then painstakingly restored for Blu-Ray in 2010, using lost footage from an old print in Buenos Aires. Up until now, my entire memory of the film comes from the Moroder version, which didn't make much sense from a story perspective but always wowed me with its wild, futuristic visions, ambitious special effects and expansive set designs.The restored version offers improvement in both respects. Now cast in gorgeous monochrome, as intended, the art direction is even more stunning. New scenes and high-resolution scans give us new chances to admire the sprawling city, to really soak up the vast scale of Lang's concept. And the plot, naive and airy as it may be, actually moves in sensible directions now. It's incredibly slow moving and drawn-out, sure, overloaded with long shots of talking heads (which seems unnecessary for a silent picture) but at least it's headed somewhere.As a long-time fan of the film, I'm glad to have finally seen the full thing. It's an iconic marvel, an artistic triumph that's, somehow, just as hypnotic now as it must've been in post-WWI Germany. That said, actually wading through the scenes without some sort of huge, dazzling art deco set piece, well, it can feel like work. I needed four sittings to get through this two-and-a-half hour behemoth, and I was personally invested before it hit my media shelf. First-timers will, no doubt, find it smothering. Deeply influential as a production, astounding as a purely visual showpiece, but critically flawed as a whole. Now excuse me while I revisit a few tunes from the 1984 release.",Metropolis

It has a taste of early science fiction which has never been topped. The remake with an 80's sound track does great justice to the original. The story deals with a perfect definition of what ideology is. The dividing of the classes and why are showed in this film. The religious iconography, German expressionism, and surrealistic elements are just a little of what Metropolis has to offer.

73,Steffi_P,"""Let's all watch as the world goes to the devil!""",10,27 April 2008,"Metropolis  one of cinema's many casualties to cuts, lost footage and general neglect, and yet today it has still become one of the most popular and iconic films of the silent era. Years ago, when I first saw this film in a reduced and very badly put together restoration from the 80s (with the Razzie-nominated Giorgio Moroder score!), I thought it was one of the worst silent pictures I had ever seen. Today (ironically in the then-distant 21st century when the film is supposed to be set) we at last have an adequate reconstruction, with a cleaned up negative, explanations of missing scenes and the original Gottfried Huppertz score, and we can see Metropolis for the masterpiece it is.The first thing that hits you when watching Metropolis is the powerful sense of rhythm, with an attention grabbing montage of industrial machinery. From here on the dynamic, kinetic flow of images is continuous  creating an exciting and extreme form of visual storytelling comparable to the work Eisenstein and Abel Gance. In his previous few films you can see Lang trying to perfect the rhythm and structure of the whole and here he finally manages it. The drama is even structured and labelled like a work of classical music. The ""prelude"" establishes themes and characters and is full of impressive and grandiose imagery, yet never gets too frantic in pace. The ""intermezzo"" begins slowly before building up to the frenzy of the erotic dance/nightmare sequence. Finally, the ""furioso"" section is a tour-de-force of non-stop action. Thanks to the Nibelungen films, Lang had learned by this point to direct crowds and action convincingly.The other strand in Lang's work that reached maturity with Metropolis was his architect's approach to shots and sets. He'd been using geometric patterns and massive interiors since the early 20s, but now you can tell he knows exactly what he's doing. One of the ""rules"" of cinema is the so-called line of action, which means you are supposed to keep the camera on one side only of two opposing actors, so that one is always screen-left and the other always screen-right. Lang completely ignores this rule, freely placing his camera at whichever angle he deems necessary. This technique would become harder for Lang when he moved to Hollywood, where sets were like rooms in a doll's house with three sides only. Here however, every set is a genuine space with four walls, and Lang shows these off to achieve a feeling of reality. This use of space is not just some aesthetic gimmick  it is really used to enhance the film experience. Take for example the scene in which Rotwang captures Maria in the catacombs. Lang cannot exploit fear of the unknown because we, the audience, already know what is happening. Instead, he creates a real sense of enclosure and entrapment with his 360-degree coverage of the cave.The science-fiction setting of Metropolis makes acceptable the over-the-top visual effects of German expressionist cinema (such as double-exposures and animated titles) and, fortunately Lang knew where to draw the line on these flashy techniques. The unreality of the genre also allows for more stylised acting, and the Germans really were the masters of ham. Rudolph Klein-Rogge makes a typically crazed villain. Brigitte Helm also does a good job in several contrasting roles.So long as you can ignore the occasionally daft ideas of screenwriter Thea von Harbou, Metropolis in its current restored version is Fritz Lang's best film. He would make plenty of other classics, and he would always have some level of quality even in the worst of his Hollywood potboilers, but this is his highest peak.",Metropolis
74,rbverhoef,Great silent classic,10,15 June 2003,"This is the first great science fiction film and great it is. A lot of things in this movie we have seen over the decades in other movies. The scientist, the city, the hero who discovers things he didn't knew. Considering its time the movie looks incredible. The city and the special effects are great.The story is about Freder (Gustav Fröhlich), a son of the dictator of Metropolis, who discovers how things work in the city. A woman Maria (Brigitte Helm) from the Workers' City, below the surface of the earth, shows him how the workers live. Freder goes down to help the workers. Their leader is Maria who is taken after a meeting by the scientist Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge). He keeps her imprisoned in his home. He was creating a robot and now he makes the robot like Maria. Now the workers who will follow Maria can be controlled by the dictator John Fredersen (Alfred Abel).There are so many great scenes in the movie, you have to see that for yourself.

75,Spleen,Skyscraper fantasia,10,14 April 2002,"Skyscrapers are fantastic things.  (Not GOOD things, perhaps, but fantastic in a good way.)  Our first encounter with them should leave us awestruck. It rarely does, because most of us became familiar with at least the sight of skyscrapers while still children, and children are too young to be able to feel awe or detect fantasy ... but all the same, when looking at skyscrapers it's easy to sense an echo of the awe we OUGHT to have felt when we saw them for the first time.Fritz Lang encountered skyscrapers for the first time as an adult on a trip to New York; he WASN'T prepared for the sight (obviously not, since he made the trip in the 1920s), and he DID manage to feel the appropriate sense of awe.  When he made ""Metropolis"", his depiction of a city of the future, in which EVERY building was a skyscraper, which continued below the ground as far as it extended above, turned very naturally to fantasy.  There's an evil wizard (who's a master of electricity rather than magic and who creates robots rather than animating golems or conjuring demons), and a heroine who is so much of an ideal one wonders if, even in the world of the fiction, she's really a flesh-and-blood woman.In later years Fritz Lang thought the fairytale elements ruined what might otherwise have been good science fiction.  He thought the ""moral"" at the end (something about Hands and Head being brought together by Heart) was particularly foolish - and so it is, but not for the reasons Lang thought. It's foolish because it makes no sense.  But there's nothing wrong with the fairytale elements per se; in fact, Lang may have been the first (maybe even the last) to have created a new kind of fairytale, one set in an unspecified future which stands in the same relation to us as does the unspecified past of traditional fairytales.  (And why not?  If such stories can begin ""Long ago and far away..."" why not ""In many years to come and far away...""?) ""Metropolis"" is one of the most captivating, visually convincing fantasies ever filmed, and it's not undermined at all by Lang's attempt to draw a pat, Charles Perraultish moral at the end.",Metropolis

And the cinematography is indeed a brilliant job, even for today's standards. The swinging camera in the air shafts is just pure genius, and rarely reused technique for capturing a shot.The set building and dressing is just purely a work of class; how they nicely build it in detailed precision is a marvel for the 1920s time.

78,EdgarST,Metropolis 2010,10,14 December 2011,"I recently saw the 2010 version of ""Metropolis"", with the additional 25 minutes found in a film museum of Buenos Aires. I have a long relationship with this Fritz Lang's film. I think that I have seen it more than 30 times. In the early 1980s, while working for public television in Panamá, I had to adjust its soundtrack (with a non-symphonic version of its original score by Gottfried Huppertz), and later I had to add Spanish subtitles. This edition guided by Enno Patalas, was the official version then, although it was known that there was lost footage. Then I saw the ""Paramount version"" (1928), a mutilation based on Channing Pollock's prosaic and simplistic reinterpretation of its story. After this I saw Giorgio Moroder's ""rock and roll version"" (1984), which I found only interesting for the inclusion of a few lost images. Then I had to study the film for a book published in 1995, for which I read about the lost scenes related to Hel, the mother of Freder, the young protagonist of ""Metropolis"". The reading of this subplot shed light to what I already knew about the story, making it more coherent: loved by the owner of Metropolis, Joh Fredersen, and by the scientist Rotwang, Hel died when she gave birth to Freder. This originated Rotwang's hatred for Fredersen, and his betrayal. When he creates the robot with Maria's face, Rotwang gives her orders contrary to those by Joh Fredersen: instead of encouraging discord among the workers, the robot makes them revolt against Fredersen and destroy the machines. This subplot –as well as the complicity between Freder and Josaphat, the worker his father fires, and the destiny of worker 11811 in the hands of the Thin Man, after being replaced by Freder in the machines room- was incorporated in the 2001 version, by using stills and intertitles, until 2008 when Argentinean archivists found a complete version of the film, containing moving images of those lost elements of the story, all shot by Lang. Although this version also confirmed that there were shots different in scale, angle or acting from one version to another, there was no existing footage to compare these new 25 minutes to. With the surviving intertitle lists that the distributor in Norway had submitted to the censors in late 1920s, the correct translation of the Argentinean titles could be made, and so the 2010 version appeared, which is a must for any film specialist. However the new material was in such a bad condition, that it was not possible to make a satisfactory restoration, from which we could derive complete visual or intellectual pleasure: after watching long sections of material in optimal conditions, when the ""new"", opaque and severely scratched shots are added, the hypnotic effect is lost and we are distracted from the story being told. Instead of being a cinematic trip with ideas, or a science-fiction drama, the experience is turning more and more into a freak show of the film that was, that is no longer there, full of stills and explanatory title cards, and now the dull and scratched Buenos Aires material. It is obvious that this was not the idea of any of the talents involved in this magnum opus, but as Martin Koerber (head specialist of this restoration) declares, it is important to incorporate this material (for now, hoping a better copy appears someday), because it is part of the story of ""Metropolis"", part of the vicissitudes in the history of Art, of the history of the Seventh Art, of the history of cinema in capitalist societies, where a work of art can be destroyed to make a few millions. In the end, it was registered by Unesco in the Memory of the World catalog, and the original message that was scorned and ridiculed by leftists, is still valid: the heart is the mediator between the brain and the hands. In spite of all the efforts, until all the footage of ""Metropolis"" has a minimum of visual quality, these intents to restore it will only have archival and cinéphile value, since they generate only a portion of the fluid and full cinematic pleasure sought by the original version.",Metropolis

He was definitely ahead of his time and nobody else had stories like Lang. Some of the scenes in this restored version are still so clear that they look like they were filmed recently. At least on the big screen they did. I don't think this is Lang's best film by a long shot. My favorite is one that doesn't get mentioned enough, ""M"" with Peter Lorre.

Envisioning an over the top and consistently horrifying dystopia, ""Metropolis"" is one of the very greatest science fiction films ever made, but the viewer must keep in mind that it is heavily flawed. Some moments and performances are melodramatic to the point of heavy laughter, it's way overlong, and the story is no where near as compelling as its visuals. That being said, this is still the ultimate German Expressionist classic. Crooked windows, creepy shadows, unforgettable imagery in nearly every frame. This mixture of futurism and Expressionism is what keeps ""Metropolis"" moving along at a perfect pace. There is tons of thrilling action, mind boggling surrealism, and wild editing; enough to keep even the average moviegoer at least mildly entertained. It is likely to inspire headaches or confusion, laughter and tears and shouts and so on. There are constant references to religion and some highly intelligent commentary on both the pros and cons of Marxist theory to allow one's intellect to be entertained (although the religious references are so obvious it gets a little annoying at times). And the visuals...I'm not even sure if I can muster up the energy to comment on them.

81,nycritic,The Most Influential Science Fiction Film.,10,9 June 2006,"German Expressionism at its best, science fiction that literally rises from its mechanical surroundings to embrace a higher spirituality, and one of the finest silent films and black and white films of all time. METROPOLIS will probably never be seen in its entirety as a quarter of film is still purportedly lost, but even at its 135 minutes, it packs a wallop of unforgettable imagery and powerful storytelling I've ever seen.Viewing it almost thirty years later -- I saw a version on PBS when I was seven years old in 1977 -- I can see it as an adult, and the seams certainly come apart, especially in Brigitte Helm's wild overacting, but I admit that even now, it's a visually stunning movie. Focusing on a futuristic dystopia, the story centers on two wildly different societies: the thinkers, who live in privileged bliss, and that of the workers, who (not surprisingly) maintain the city alive while working in near inhuman conditions.In the middle of these two groups is the Virgin-like (and appropriately named) Maria. She maintains secret meetings in the city's bowels where she talks about a Mediator who will intercede for them, and thus unite the city into a whole. However, events conspire against this as the city's builder, Joh Fredersen, is made aware of this. He orders the scientist Rotwang to ""humanize"" his robotic creation in order to maintain order among the workers much like every CEO would do today in order to keep his empire from crumbling. But, however, Rotwang has his own agenda.Rotwang in effect humanizes his cyborg, who not only rouses the workers into destroying the City, but also incites the men of the nightclub with her erotic dancing. It's one of the most bizarre yet powerful scenes in the movie, as is the flooding of its lower levels. Even today, for me, it's frightening to me to watch the water seep unto the upper level and begin to flood the city as the real Maria and the hero, Freder, try to rescue the children of the workers from imminent death. Also still effective was the sequence in which Rotwang chases Maria through the tunnels of the City. Illuminated only by the candle she holds in her hand, it has a stroboscopic effect which is beautiful as it is suffocating.But hands down, the parts of the movie that stand out to me are the ones in which the robot Maria gets infused with the breadth of the real Maria's life. The use of neon circles photographed against each other is still as haunting today as it must have been then. Her burning at the stake by the city's workers is a marvel of special effects -- it looks genuinely terrifying.METROPOLIS has, not surprisingly, the single most influential silent and black and white movie of all times. From its use of miniatures and overlapping techniques, its painstaking drawings that depicted the passing of time in a marvelous Babylon of a City, and its opening shot of machines working in tandem -- also seen in Madonna's ""Express Yourself"" video, which in fact is a direct rip-off of the movie in video form -- it has dictated what dystopias should look like, and it's hard not to see its long hand even in the science-fiction literature of Robert Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, and a multitude of movies ranging from DR. STRANGELOVE, VERTIGO, STAR WARS, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, SHADOWS AND FOG, BATMAN, BATMAN RETURNS, DARK CITY, SE7EN, BLADE RUNNER, and many, many more.",Metropolis
82,justin-fencsak,The 1984 version is only for younger people who love classic music from that decade!!!,9,4 March 2019,"When this movie came out 92 years ago this month, it became a worldwide success yet it was heavily edited from its premiere for the US release and cut even more when Giorgio Moroder helped restore Metropolis and colorized it to death with a synthpop rock disco soundtrack featuring the worst song of Freddie Mercury's solo career before he rejoined Queen for Live Aid years before AIDS killed him. I saw this version on VHS and thought it was fast paced. Then I saw the original version, which stays true to the theatrical cut as seen in theatres during the era along with a organ score. The design and visual effects of this movie still stand true to this day. It even inspired the 2001 hit anime Metropolis, which has no connection to the fritz lang movie. Queen would use clips from the film in the video Radio Ga Ga, the title of which Lady Gaga got her name from.",Metropolis
83,Easygoer10,Awe Inspiring,10,2 June 2020,"(William M./June, 2020). The first time I saw ""Metropolis"" was in the 1970's. It blew me away. The image of Brigitte Helm ""coming to life"" is simultaneously haunting and provocative. This film inspired thousands of (subsequent) movies and television shows. Director Fritz Lang made this in 1927 (93 years ago!). I have seen it many times since. Upon it's release, Bridgette Helm became a world-wide star in her very first movie. She never set out to be an actress. Her mother had shown her daughter's photograph to people in the movie industry. When Lang saw it, he knew she was the woman to play the starring dual roles of ""Maria: the Woman and The Machine"". I have the utmost respect for Brigitte Helm. The film typecast her. Within less than a decade (and in spite of her fame), she quit acting and did what she always wanted: To be married and have a family. Ultimately, she succeeded in both. She hated Hitler (her husband was of Jewish heritage). They moved to Switzerlandl and she had 4 children. In some ways, she remind's me of Greta Garbo. Both hated interviews. According to her son, the closest anyone ever got to an interview was ""the front door to her house"". For all fans of film, this is a must-see. Truly a classic. Don't miss the opportunity.",Metropolis
84,Takethispunch,Nice flick,10,4 August 2016,"In the futuristic city of Metropolis, wealthy industrialists reign from high-rise tower complexes, while underground-dwelling workers toil to operate the machines below. Joh Fredersen is the city's master. His son Freder idles away his time in a pleasure garden, but is interrupted by the arrival of a young woman named Maria, who has brought a group of workers' children to witness the lifestyle of the rich. Maria and the children are ushered away, but Freder, fascinated, goes to the machine rooms to find her. He witnesses the explosion of a huge machine which kills several workers. The foreman Grot brings to Fredersen secret maps found on the dead workers.Fredersen takes the maps to the inventor Rotwang to learn their meaning. Rotwang had been in love with a woman named Hel, who left him to marry Fredersen; she died giving birth to Freder. Rotwang shows Fredersen a robot he has built to ""resurrect"" Hel. The maps show a network of catacombs beneath Metropolis, and the two men go to investigate. They eavesdrop on a gathering of workers, including Freder. Maria addresses them, prophesying the arrival of a mediator who can bring the working and ruling classes together. Freder believes that he could fill the role and declares his love for Maria. Fredersen orders Rotwang to give Maria's likeness to the robot so that it can ruin her reputation among the workers. Rotwang kidnaps Maria, transfers her likeness to the robot and sends her to Fredersen. Freder finds the two embracing and, believing it is the real Maria, falls into a prolonged delirium. Intercut with his hallucinations, the false Maria unleashes chaos throughout Metropolis, driving men to murder and stirring dissent amongst the workers.",Metropolis
85,DeeNine-2,The city as nightmare,10,9 May 2008,"Fritz Lang's futuristic Metropolis is set in as it happens something like the current era. Most of the population are workers who slave underground to keep the massive machine that is the city going while the privileged stay above ground and live hedonistic lives. It is impossible not to see this in Marxian terms, the prols exploited by the capitalist class. At the time of the film's production in Germany, there was indeed a specter haunting Europe and it was indeed the specter of communism. Curiously Lang ends the film with a blatant political statement. He has labor and capital reluctantly shake hands. I find this curious because there is little doubt that for the previous two and a half hours the film depicts the capitalist class in the person of Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel) as seeing the workers as mere automations to be exploited. I think Lang wanted to dodge the political implications of his film. I think he was less interested in ideology than in showing striking visuals of man in the world of machines, of humans as machines themselves, and other humans more like brains without bodies, wet wear blind to anything but production and keeping the hive buzzing.Metropolis is like a hive or an ant colony except that the workers never get to go out and forage. Their world is dark and steamy; they are for the most part without hope as they come and go with their heads bowed in submission.In another sense (and this metaphor is directly from the film) the workers are the hands of the body and the capitalists the mind. Maria says, ""Between the mind that plans and the hands that build there must be a Mediator, and this must be the heart."" Maria is a prophet who predicts the coming of this Mediator, who one might, in all innocence, believe to be a nice stand-in for, say, Jesus Christ. Politically speaking, then, perhaps what Lang is saying is that the war between communism and capitalism will eventually be mediated by the Second Coming. Expressing this commonplace idea with striking visuals rather than speaking it in so many words, exemplified the power of the relatively new medium of the ""picture show."" This is the first silent film I've seen in many years. It's a bit over the top in terms of acting, which of course was deliberate since facial expressions and body language were used to replace words that would have to be read. Modern audiences may find this convention comical or just weird. I found the scenes showing the characters running at something like one and a half times real human speed a bit amusing. I don't know enough about silent films to know whether that was deliberate or something Lang thought effective. Gustav Frohlich, who has the male lead, in particular is a frenzy of action and contorted facial expressions. Brigitte Helm, who plays Maria and her deadly clone (and the robot and the dancing woman as well) is even more over the top in her physical gyrations, but her performance stands out because there is nothing quite like it in filmdom, at least nothing that I have ever seen. It is both the heavy makeup and her wild, demonic (and seductive) expressions that allow us to clearly see when she is the evil clone and not the demur, heroic Maria. For me she was the most memorable part of the film.There is quite a bit of trivia and film history associated with this landmark film. The film seen today is a 2001 reconstruction of the original, part of which has been lost. The missing action is explained in text before going on to the next scene. Metropolis was said to be Hitler's favorite film, which doesn't surprise me, and it was the most expensive film made up until that time, and employed a huge cast.But see this for Fritz Lang's stunning and haunting visuals, which remain even to this day as striking works of art.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",Metropolis
86,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Almost Its Own Form of Folklore in the World of Cinema.,10,16 December 2016,"Metropolis is almost 90 years old to this day. Fritz Lang gave what is arguably the most important film of the silent era with Metropolis. It was the first ever science-fiction feature film when it was made in 1927, and what's also notable is that the film remained partially lost for many years. Thanks to Kino International and film-archivists who discovered a 16mm print in Argentina, combining it with Australian and New Zealand prints of the movie (among other pre-existing positives from Germany, etc.), Metropolis was 95% restored to its original state.Now, Metropolis: The Restored Cut is a masterpiece of classic cinema that is bold, gorgeous, and very to-the-point with its man-in-the-machine subtext and premise. Its story of classicism is timeless and the set pieces, ranging from the city itself to the reveal of the maschinenmensch (machine-human) this film has many memorable moments. Its stylized landscape shows off the many beauties of German Expressionism in its purest form, and it complements the story being told.Without this film, there would be no Blade Runner, no 2001: A Space Odyssey, no Star Wars, and definitely no Terminator films. Metropolis is the genesis of modern science fiction cinema, plain and simple. It has been miraculously preserved through the ages since its release and will continue to influence future generations decades from now.Metropolis is a rich, memorable and honest science fiction film that expresses ideas of one's place in modern society perfectly; and that a little perspective is all it takes to make great changes happen.Please watch this film when you can. The science fiction genre's inheritance of this film's influence should be reason enough to give it a go.",Metropolis
87,pyrocitor,Astonishing odyssey of imagination; the quintessential science-fiction,10,28 January 2008,"Certain films will always be recognized as standing the proverbial test of time, making their mark in the pantheon of the most influential, memorable and near flawlessly crafted films in the history of the industry. Upon viewing in a contemporary context, even over 80 years after its initial release, the recognition of Metropolis, director Fritz Lang's masterpiece, among such a list proves indisputable. The catalyst for all ensuing science fiction films and tremendously influential even outside of the genre it essentially pioneered, the sheer imagination and vision behind Metropolis prove its indisputable quality decades after its time.A tremendously ambitious and controversial feat when first released, the political and thematic content riddling the film's impressively complex storyline are astounding, proving an early testament for the potential of big budget films to resonate with strong thematic content as opposed to being simply entertaining. Taking notes from Marx, among other prominent schools of thought, the revolutionary dystopian vision of a colony of workers rebelling against the alienated upper classes proves a daring and fiercely compelling watch even to this day, let alone for a film made in Germany in the 1920s. Similarly, the film makes a particularly effective science-fiction piece by proving frighteningly prophetic from grander themes of commodity culture to smaller touches, with ideas which would have seemed outlandish at the time such as video phones and ""machine men"" starting to become disconcerting realities. While parts of the original film may be lost, as they are summed up by title cards in the same way dialogue was conveyed, the occasional lapse in pacing hardly distracts from the gripping and astonishingly powerful narrative.Similarly, the film's dynamic visual style is equally laudable, and the entire film captivates with a hypnotic, entrancing beauty. The expressionist influenced futuristic sets and buildings and surprisingly advanced visual effects never fail to captivate, and the frequent moody lighting is an aesthetic delight. Sequences such as the opening scene of columns of repressed workers trudging desolately to work to Freder's cinematically innovative hallucination of death striking the city to mad inventor Rotwang's construction of the iconic ""Machine Man"" to the allegorical tale of the tower of Babel prove utterly unforgettable, with Lang conjuring up a dramatic intensity essentially unparalleled in its time. Such seamless quality both technically and thematically has scarcely been glimpsed to such a degree since, and the film's incredible influence becomes increasingly clear in other works after viewing it.While the film is seldom praised for its acting, considering the expressionist conventions of over-exaggerated facial expressions and movement to express inner sentiments, the film comes as across as far less melodramatic than one might expect, though the distinctly different performance styles may prove unsettling or unintentionally comical to a contemporary audience. Gustav Fröhlich is a suitably engaging and charismatic lead as the young son of the city's founder who becomes increasingly disgusted with the harsh mistreatment of the working class denizens. As his distant father, Alfred Abel turns in a poignant performance as Frederson, founder of Metropolis, consumed by his own ambition to the point of losing touch with the world around him. Rudolf Klein-Rogge is unforgettable and enormously entertaining as twisted inventor Rotwang, setting the standard for countless 'mad scientist' figures to follow. Similarly, Brigitte Helm is both luminous and horrifying in turn, portraying both the earnest figurehead for a working class resistance movement who attracts the attention of the impressionable Freder, and a 'demonic' incarnation of herself portrayed by Rotwang's devious ""Machine Man"".Visionary, innovative and desperately socially relevant, Lang's disturbing and captivating labour of love holds its own against the ages, proving nearly as staggeringly impressive an achievement in a current day context as its initial release over 80 years ago. At the risk of lapsing into cliché, they simply do not make movies like this anymore, and upon viewing such a masterful work, it is an increasing shame.-10/10",Metropolis
88,frankde-jong,Sissy story but a great film,9,12 October 2019,"For a long time the story of ""Metropolis"" was incomprehensible because of lost footage. In 2008 in Buenos Aires parts of the movie that were considered lost were rediscovered and the story made sense again.That the story made sense is not to say that it is a great story. Too many characters are one dimensional or not very realistic. Freder (the son) is totally naive and Maria is too much saint-like. On top of that the motto of the film "" The mediator between head and hands must be the heart"" is a bit sack baked.Nevertheless ""Metropolis"" is one of the great films of all time and a model for science fiction movies up to this day.The elaboration may be too idealistic, but ""Metropolis"" has two themes that are socially very relevant. In the first place the mechanization of work. This theme is illustrated by a choreography of workers that illustrates their subordination to the machines. With respect to this theme ""Metropolis"" is the predecessor of films such as ""A nous la liberte"" (1931, Rene Clair) and ""Modern times"" (1936, Charlie Chaplin). In the second place the dichotomy between the happy few and the poor workers. In this respect ""Metropolis"" is the predecessor of ""Blade runner"" (1982, Ridley Scott) (although in that film the poor were not the workers but the robots / replicants).Apart from relevant themes the film has also a very convincing filmlanguage, in some cases innovative in other instances going back to older movies. I will give a few examples. The machine turning into a savage monster in the fantasy of young Freder (""Cabiria"", 1914, Giovanni Pastrone). The transformation of dead material into living one (""Frankenstein, 1931, James Whale). The mad scientist Rotwang with the hand with a black glove (""Dr Strangelove"" 1964, Stanley Kubrick).Apart from that the architecure in ""Metropolis"" (inspired by the New York skyline) is, combined with the art deco interiors, unsurpassed.All in all ""Metropolis"" is one of the highlights pf German expressionism.",Metropolis

90,bobsgrock,When head and hand come together.,8,24 November 2008,"Fritz Lang's epic 1927 science fiction film is a classic not just of the silent era, or the German Expressionism movement of the time. It is a timeless story filled with wondrous images and visual effects that are decades ahead of its time and thoroughly challenging.The story is that of two separate groups of people living in the futuristic city of Metropolis. The workers live underground and keep the city running, while the thinkers or upper-class live above ground and enjoy the sweet things of life. One day, one of the upper-class finds his way to the workers' world and is shocked at what he sees. What follows is an extraordinary tale of love, lust, revenge, anger, social injustice and the desire to be free and happy. It is a tale that has been done many times since and may have lost some of its original gusto, but to see it be done in its original state, Metropolis succeeds as a great film and compelling drama that shows you don't need words to convey emotion. In the cinema, all it takes is an image.",Metropolis
91,TheUnknown837-1,one can only imagine how powerful the (recently rediscovered) director's cut must have been,10,22 May 2009,"Why is it, I have asked myself a great many times in my time, that before a revolutionary film or book becomes recognized as a classic, that it has to be preliminarily neglected, scorned, and almost lost forever? It almost seems to be a formula: a revolutionary idea is used, people hate it, people try to destroy it, they nearly succeed, and then decades later, after the creator's death, the public finally catches up with the sophisticated masterpieces before their time. And that, for a long time, was the case of Fritz Lang's revolutionary, enthralling silent masterpiece ""Metropolis."" It may have been despised and panned upon its original release and almost forgotten, but now time has caught up with Lang's visions and ""Metropolis"" is recognized as the influential milestone it is. Even if, up until now, it was never fully recovered and appreciated the way Lang intended it to be.""Metropolis"", based on a novel by Thea von Harbou (who also wrote the screenplay), is a story that may seem hackneyed and commonplace for futuristic tales today, but in its day, it was one of the most original. The film revolves around an unnamed dystopia in futuristic (even today) Germany, where the upper class lives in prosperity and the lower class suffers and perishes in a crude excuse for a civilization below the surface of the earth. While the mastermind of the city (Alfred Abel) plans to destroy the hope of his subterranean workers, his son (Gustav Frohlich) secretly works against his father to bring hope and happiness to them. And the center of this battle, the figure the whole film revolves around, is a beautiful young woman named Maria (Brigitte Helm).Even if one does not particularly like (or even hates) ""Metropolis"", there is no denying that is one of the most influential movies of all time. Many science-fiction elements that seem almost formula today began with this. The idea of a disguising a robot as a human being, for example, originated from this film. The futuristic dystopia, cars traveling on elevated bridges at skyscraper-level, cyborgs, a mad scientist who stares hysterically as he throws the switch. These all came from ""Metropolis"" or at least were brought to public notice by it.But ""Metropolis"" is of course, loved not because it is influential, but because it is a very powerful story. Even for the era of the silent films, it is an original sci-fi tale, a creative visionary masterpiece, a romantic love story, a poignant drama, and a fairly interesting look at the corruptibility of humankind. ""Metropolis"" very well may have been an influence for Aldous Huxley's classic novel ""A Brave New World"" among other classic stories about the future and the ""progress"" of man.Unfortunately, as anyone can tell by looking at the film in its present state, it has not been treated well. ""Metropolis"" has not been seen in its original form since its first release in Germany in 1927. Because of the negative reviews, footage was cut. And after reissue upon reissue, over an hour's worth of running time was lost and many scenes that explained the plot were lost, thus increasing the negative response toward the film. And now, even with a properly and beautifully restoration of the movie (the best restoration I've probably ever seen) the movie is incomplete, because more than twenty-five percent of the film has been lost for decades. Missing segments of the film are outlined via subtitles and even if one has become completely absorbed with Lang's masterpiece, there is still that feeling of lacking. Of incompletion. Had ""Metropolis"" been as popular back then as it was today, not a single frame would have been lost.But now, unlike say the fate of other nearly-lost films, there is hope. I am very happy to inform all readers of my review that in mid-2008, film archivists in Argentina discovered what appears to be the three-hour-long director's cut of ""Metropolis"": the way Fritz Lang intended it to be seen and really, the only way it should be seen. Why hasn't this footage been released as of now (May 2009)? Because, remember, the footage is EIGHTY years old and in terrible condition. It will take some time to restore the thousands of dirty, scratched up frames but when it is finally put back together with the already replenished footage, you can bet there will be a DVD release and maybe a special screening for the fans and movie buffs.So as of now, only those archivists, some journalists who saw the film, and the people to restore the lost footage, are the only men alive who really appreciate (to the full) the power of Fritz Lang's film. To the rest of us, even the two-hour-long cut is marvelous and enthralling, but we (including I) still don't quite know what we're talking about when we discuss ""Metropolis"". It takes sheer power for even an incomplete puzzle to revolutionize and revision the world. One can only imagine how the original must have been. Thankfully, the movie has been found in its entirety and will soon be rescued from the ravages of time and thirty-three years after the director's death, his masterpiece will be reviewed anew.",Metropolis

What a tragedy that a cinematic gem like this should have been left to fall into disarray, with several scenes now missing. Treasure the cinematic heritage.",Metropolis
93,gftbiloxi,At Last,10,10 April 2005,"Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS was very successful with both critics and audiences when it debuted in 1927 Berlin--but it was thereafter edited for distribution by Channing Pollock, who disliked it and removed great chunks of the film and substantially altered the storyline. The resulting film was admired for its visual style, but it proved a critical and box office disappointment. Neglected in the wake of sound, surviving prints of the film were left to corrode and decay--and when it began to reach the home market via VHS and DVD the results were very hit or miss; Blackhawk released a fairly credible version of the truncated film to home video, but for the most part the quality of these releases varied from barely mediocre to downright unwatchable.Until now.A great chunk of METROPOLIS--perhaps as much a quarter of more--has been forever lost, but Kino Video DVD release offers the single best version of the film available. The previously cut footage that still exists has been restored; gaps in the film have been bridged by the occasional use of stills and explanatory title cards; the film itself has been painstakingly and digitally restored; and the soundtrack is the Gottfried Huppertz original created for the film's 1927 Berlin debut. In seeing this version of METROPOLIS, I was struck by how very differently it reads from the previously available truncated version. The visual style and the story itself are much more exciting and cohesive, and in the wake of this restoration it becomes impossible to deny the film status as landmark of international cinema.In many respects the story is simplistic, but the film's visual style and connotations are anything but. Deeply influenced by such art movements as Expressionism, Objectivism, Art Deco, and Bauhaus, the film is visually fascinating--not only in its scenic designs, but in director Lang's famous skill at creating the powerful crowd scenes that dominate the film and building the pace and tension of the film as it moves toward an intense climax. But while one can--and many do--admire the film purely at this level, there is quite a lot going on in terms of philosophical content as well: while it offers few viable solutions, the film raises such issues as the relationship between capital and labor, the place of religion in modern society, human reaction to overwhelming technology, and (perhaps most interestingly) the drift of government into a class-conscious corporate entity. And religious motifs abound in the film: a largely deserted cathedral; Moloch; the Tower of Babel; and crosses--intriguingly juxtaposed with a repeating motif of the pentagram-like designs associated with the robot. It is fascinating stuff.There has been complaint that this restoration runs at incorrect speed and the performances are therefore unnecessarily jerky. I did not find this to be the case. In certain instances the movement is deliberately jerky and mechanical--the workers are a case in point--but beyond this there is nothing for which the difference between silent acting and modern acting techniques cannot account. There has also been some complaint that the title cards should have been left in their original German and translated via subtitle. There is a certain validity to this, but it seems a minor quibble; title cards were typically translated in the silent era itself.The DVD includes a number of extras, including still photographs, biographies of the major figures involved in the film, and two documentaries-one on the restoration process and one on the creation of the film itself. Both are interesting; the audio commentary track by film historian Enno Patalas, however, is mildly disappointing. But when all is said and done, it is the film that counts. And this restoration is a remarkable achievement, to say the least, a project which brings a great landmark of world cinema back from the edge of the abyss. Indispensible; a must-own.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Metropolis
94,KnightsofNi11,A timeless classic,8,24 October 2010,"Metropolis was a science fiction film made before Star Wars, Star Trek, the moon landing, and even before classic staples like Flash Gordon and Dick Tracy. It's one of the first science fiction films ever made and it marks the beginning of a trend of using the sci-fi genre as a medium for social commentary. Metropolis is set in a futuristic city of the same name as the film. In this city there is a significant divide between the working and upper class. The working class labors endlessly underground, keeping the flourishing city above ground running for all the prosperous and wealthy. These two factions of society see themselves being forced closer when the son of the city's mastermind falls in love with a prophet like woman of the working class. This societal unrest leads to chaos and Metropolis begins to fall apart. The film is ripe with socio-political commentary and all takes place in an immaculate setting that absolutely mystifies.Metropolis is a fascinating film to watch, thinking about it in relation to its time period. The film displays incredibly groundbreaking originality and this film deserves all the credit it gets in setting up the genre of science fiction for the years to come. It is much like Fritz Lang's film he made four years after Metropolis called M. M was the first serial killer film ever made and will always be the root of the lengths at which the genre has traveled since. Metropolis does the same for the sci-fi genre.It is also incredible to see just how much this movie is able to do with what little it is given. 1927 was still the early beginnings of film. The first annual Academy Awards wouldn't be till the following year. And, obviously, Metropolis is a silent film. And yet with such heavy limits on what it can do, the film accomplishes so much more than a lot of films today. The film is fueled by a fascinating story and characters, yet visually it is amazing as well. Fritz Lang was revolutionary in his direction style and Metropolis emphasized this style beautifully. Even in shoddy black and white film, the architecture of this futuristic world is mind boggling and exemplified incredibly by lighting and camera work. There are some incredible moments in this film where you forget you're watching something that was made over eighty years ago. Most surprisingly, however, is that this film actually has special effects. There is one stunning and immaculate scene set in a laboratory where a robot is transformed into the form of a human girl. The scene is equipped with whirring lights and lightning bolts. Of course it is backed only by an orchestral score, which does suit the entire movie very well, heightening the grandeur and drama. For 1927, the visual aspect of Metropolis is astounding.Any time you think of timeless classic, Metropolis is one of the first films that should come to mind. Who knows where the science fiction genre would be, or if it would be at all, today if not for this film. Whether you enjoy the film itself or not, you can't deny that it's influence will always be one of the most important and significant in cinema history.",Metropolis

Marxist elements definitely apply to this one.The leader of the workers is the saintly Maria (Brigitte Helm, in an outstanding performance), who wants to find a link between the 'hands' and the 'brain'. She thinks the heart can act as mediator, as she falls in love with the son of the Lord Of Metropolis, Johhan Fredersen (Alfred Abel). The young son Freder ( Gustav Frolich) dares to the do the unthinkable and associate with the workers. Realizing trouble is brewing and the workers could easily be robots, Johhan kidnaps Maria to make a robot copy of her. His thought is that this 'evil Maria' will cause an uprising in the working class, leading to their eventual elimination.Wow. What a film. Helm masterfully plays two roles as the 'Good' and 'Evil' Maria. Frolich is over-the-top, but it's silent film acting. We can forgive him. The visuals are stunning, and Lang's vision was remarkable. Just look at the carbon copy Maria and compare that to the modern fiasco over cloning and genetic engineering.10/10.",Metropolis
97,Atreyu_II,A major achievement in the late 20's,7,7 April 2012,"Considering the good reputation this vintage classic enjoys today, it's a little strange to think that in its heyday its popularity was restrict. I don't think it was because people weren't prepared for such a revolutionary movie. As far as I know, even then few were the ones who weren't marveled with the futuristic and highly stylish visuals. I can't say for sure, but I think it was because it combined futuristic scenarios with still primitive cinema techniques (which were what was available at the time). And quite honestly, the ancient cinema techniques is the aspect which this film is most dated. The stunning futuristic visuals haven't aged at all. I'd dare to say that they wouldn't do ugly now. They are still surprisingly fresh even for today's standards: the ""avant-garde"" mega-city of Metropolis and the fantastic Tower of Babel, all part of the director's vision for the future.The final cost would probably be far from being overly expensive today, but for 1927 this was a very costly film to make, which you can tell from its advanced ideas.Some futurisms aside, this movie is not for everyone because it is very old, silent and in black and white. Adding to all that, it is very long and can be quite repetitive. A movie with these characteristics this long can push some to the limits of their patience. One has to have in mind that ""nobody"" watches movies like this these days.Aside the greatness of the futuristic stuff, the best thing is the sequence of the overflown reservoirs and inundations caused by it, putting many children in danger who are rescued in time before any disgrace.The movie has become unexpectedly famous over time. To prove how much its popularity grew over time, let me just say that musical artists like Queen in the videoclip for the song ""Radio Ga Ga"" and Madonna in the videoclip for the song ""Express Yourself"" payed some homage to it in slight details of inspiration.",Metropolis

Although many scenes are missing in that version, one can still see the reasons why it is such a great sci-fi classic - The story is totally timeless and still very relevant today. It's visually decades ahead of its time. Films like 'Star Wars' and 'Blade Runner' are only two of many movies that look the way they do because of this masterpiece.",Metropolis

100,Igenlode Wordsmith,"Stunning imagery, pity about the plot",6,17 April 2006,"One definitely can't fault the breadth and ambition of Fritz Lang's vision, even if, as always with depictions of the future, there are a few forgivable blind spots. (The cars that swarm up and down the multiple levels of Metropolis are unmistakably the standard models of the 1920s, as are the flying-machines that buzz about them; while the business dress of tomorrow's rulers, unlike their exotic leisure wear, doesn't appear to have advanced one iota!)H.G.Wells criticised the film for its adherence to arty image over scientific rigour, and as a piece of coherent science fiction it's certainly as lacking as he claimed. The machines exist to appear awesome and to torment their workers rather than to perform any apparent task, and there is no explanation of how this society functions, how it evolved or how it is sustained, let alone of the incongruities that must surely lie behind such anomalous locations as the catacombs and the cathedral. But Wells' own futuristic film, ""Things to Come"", conceived in direct riposte to Lang's 'unscientific' approach, is tedious and talky as a result, didactic in its heavy-footed philosophy and explanations, and lacking in artistic vision: ""Metropolis"" may be 'soft' SF, but its approach undoubtedly makes for better cinema.I am not, however, impressed by it as a film. Masterpiece of Modernism it may be -- but great design and special effects can't save today's big-budget clunkers from deficiencies of character and plot, and they don't save this one. Ironically, I suspect that its reputation has benefited greatly from its being the only silent film many of its viewers have ever encountered: reading through the IMDb pages, I see well-meaning comments like ""Great -- when you consider how primitive cinema was in 1927"" and ""once you get used to the fact that it takes about ten gestures to convey one sentence..."" It wasn't -- and it doesn't!As silent films go, this is in many places agonizingly slow and repetitious, marred by clumsy acting, tendentious titles and overwrought gestures. By the late 1920s, cinema had progressed far beyond this laboured pantomime: in Lang's case the heavy stylisation may have been a deliberate choice, but compared to the fluidity of contemporaries such as Sjostrom's ""The Wind"" or ""The Scarlet Letter"", Asquith's ""Underground"" or ""Shooting Stars"", and Murnau's ""Sunrise"", the film comes across as ten years behind the times. The problem is not necessarily with the actors -- Brigitte Helm, as has been observed, does an excellent job in differentiating her two characters -- but with the direction and pacing.We saw the restored version with the original Gottfried Huppertz score; the latter didn't always seem to fit too well, with pops, jumps and awkward silences, but this was I assume due either to the difficulty of fitting it to allow for the missing material, or to problems in the projection booth when running a newly-arrived print for the first time. However, the painstaking summary of the various 'missing scenes' only ended up increasing my appreciation of what a good job had been done in the editing-down in the first place! To take a single example: where the edited version conveys Freder's sudden recollection that he is supposed to be the workers' long-awaited 'mediator' via the simple juxtaposition of three shots -- the shift-change whistle announcing the meeting, the catacombs and Freder suddenly struck by an idea and rushing off -- the restoration betrays the fact that a couple of scenes of mimed dialogue were originally provided to spell out the message at painstaking length...It is interesting to see how it was done, but most of the cuts are either an improvement or a very clever abridgement, and by and large I didn't feel that what was omitted had been any great loss. In fact, frankly I felt that the film was in need of further editing at certain points, such as Rotwang's pursuit of Maria through the catacombs. She screams, and runs, and screams, and runs, and is pursued by a searchlight effect; it's clever, self-consciously clever, the first couple of times, but the repetition becomes tedious to the point of caricature. Plot infelicities abound in increasing numbers, culminating in the infamous 'Hunchback of Notre Dame'-style ending where the mad scientist carries off the girl across the roof of the cathedral hotly pursued by Our Hero, which raised giggles, in a hitherto serious and respectful audience, with which I couldn't help but sympathise.This is a film to see once in a lifetime so that you can say that you have seen it -- not least because most of the impact lies in the visuals. But it's all surface and no substance: the characters act arbitrarily, the plot is subservient to the Message, the pacing is like treacle, the story-telling technique is primitive, and really all it has going for it is the visual flair and the special effects. I quite honestly believe that this work would be better appreciated as a set of stills in a glossy brochure; an exhibit in a design exhibition. This is not cinema as I love it -- it's innovative, it may be Art, but as an actual film it's only a poor shadow.",Metropolis

102,ofpsmith,"An amazing epic of society, love, and power relations.",10,10 November 2015,"Fritz Lang has made some amazing movies. This is his best silent film. The story takes place in a future city where the rich live in a marvelous paradise where technology and economy are better then ever. But the labor involved in this is deadly and shocking and it's where the worker's city comes in. When the son of the president, Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel), Freder Fredersen (Gustav Frohlich) falls for Maria (Brigitte Helm) a prophet of the worker's city, he goes down to the worker's city and is horrified by what he sees. Freder tells Joh who prohibits him from returning to the worker's city but Freder continues to visit Maria. Finally in an effort to prevent his son from going back, Joh orders reclusive scientist CA Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) to build a robot model of Maria, who in the form of Maria inspires to workers to rebel and riot around Metropolis. It all comes down to a clash between the rich and the poor. It's really unforgettable. Metropolis was very provocative for it's time, and the way it was made is just epochal. Metropolis is a monument of film history. An unbelievable epic.",Metropolis
103,artzau,Amazing!,9,8 January 2002,"Set aside the stylized acting, the seamy effects, the ham-laden posturing and the improbable depictions of the future, and consider these in terms of 1927 when Fritz Lang released this amazing film.  It works.  The elements of a class struggle taking place a scant 100 years from the time of great upheaval in Germany, must likewise be considered within the context of the times of this film.  Lang was right on cue.  While this film lacks much of the modernity of his later ""M,"" it nevertheless is a marvelous piece of work.  The Georgio Moroder version which adds a daring sound track to this dark prophetic film gives it a soft sparkle which stays in the mind, long after the film has been seen. It is just simply amazing.  The controversy over the emergence of the saying, ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" which was used over the gates of Auschwitz, was not of Lang's doing.  Lang was a refugee in the US during WW2 and was reportedly horrified at hearing how this motto was (ab)used.  For a long time,  the film was tacitly censured for this small scene and interestingly enough, it is omitted not only from the Moroder version but from several versions.  I was fortunate enough to see an uncut version many years ago in Berkeley and remember it well. I'm delighted that the Moroder version is coming out in DVD.  If you are a serious buff of early 20th century films, this is a definitely must-see.",Metropolis
104,tomimt,Stunnig piece from the history of cinema,9,26 September 2008,"In a dystopic future people are divided in two casts: the workers and the planners. The workers live in a huge under ground complex beneath the great city of Metropolis and while the rich elite leads a life of luxury and enjoyment the only purpose of the working class is to slave in huge factories, which keep the cogs of industry running.One day Freder (Gustav Fröhlich), son of the ruler of Metropolis Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel), sees a young worker girl Maria (Brigitte Helm), who is showing the miracles of the upper city to a group of worker children. When he runs to look for the girl, he soon discovers how badly the workers of the factories are treated and it soon becomes evident, that a rebellion is boiling deep beneath the city.Metropolis is quite an intriguing film. Visually it's extremely clever, especially when the visual and special effects are placed on the context of how long time ago this film was made. Sure enough, when compared to modern special effects, the city scape looks like a set piece, but there's charm in it and the whole landscape of Metropolis with its crowded streets, aircrafts and looming tower of Babel looks astonishing. Also the special effects revolving around robot Hel look amazing and the design of the robot is actually beautiful.It is very easy to see, and easy why that has happened, that the design of the film has influenced many sci-fi films during the time. It is so ground breaking in so many aspects, that if the truth is said, not many films have managed to churn out as magnificent sets or design than this.The version I saw of Metropolis is the restored version, that is almost complete, though it was still missing a lot of scenes. Apparently a complete version of the film has been found, so some time in the future a restored version of this fascinating, yet a bit childish tale will be revealed before our eyes.",Metropolis
105,FerdinandVonGalitzien,One Of The Icons Of The Film History,8,26 February 2010,"At this time of the new millennium it is a miracle that even today some lost silent footage from the last century can turn up, emerging from the darkness and allowing a new generation of silent fans to take a look again at those old and forgotten images. Miracle of miracles, some of that rediscovered silent footage belongs to one of the icons of the film history, Herr Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" (1927)""Metropolis"" is one of those few silent films well-known to everybody in these modern days, from aristocrats to commoners, so it is not necessary to say too much about the story of the film, a fascinating futuristic picture that in the background has elements of social criticism influenced by the troubled old Weimar days, a film that through the times suffered many mutilations and revisions, from abridged versions to even a modern pop music version. In 2008 a 16 mm. negative was found in Buenos Aires so finally there was the chance for silent fans, 80 years later after its premiere ( obviously this Herr Graff attended the original premiere in Berlin ) to watch a version of ""Metropolis"" very close to its original condition thanks to an additional thirty minutes.The film was recently restored by the ""Murnau Foundation"" and was screened at the ""Berlinale"" film festival where elegant Teutonic people enjoyed the restoration in a warm theatre while interested commoners watched the film at the Brandenburg Gate on a freezing night. Ah, the social class struggle continues even after 80 years, just as it happens in the film.""Continuity"" is the best word to sum up what this new ""Metropolis"" restoration brings to the story. Now the pace of the film becomes more rapid, especially at the thrilling climax. Some narrative gaps, admittedly not very important ones, are filled; we see more of the character of the thin man ( Herr Fritz Rasp ) Herr Joh Fredersen's spy and there are also interesting scenes of the vice at ""Yoshiwara"" district.Certainly ""Metropolis"" has been enjoyed by generations of silent film admirers who appreciated its futuristic setting, the incredible decors, special effects and technique, the different performers acting and overacting , and the social dimension of the story. In spite of suffering many mutilations through the years, the power of the film was undiminished, as one would expect of a masterpiece. It even survived the pop adaptation done by the longhaired generation; this was a dubious approach to a silent but effective as a way of getting youngsters acquainted with this great film. Finally though, after all these years, the film can be seen at its best, much like the way Herr Graf remembers it at the premiere at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo cinema in Berlin. We can appreciate the film fully now, not to mention that we are finally living now in the early XXI century, the time ""Metropolis"" is set in!And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must decide who he should invite for tea, Maria or the robot.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com",Metropolis
106,alice liddell,"Politically dodgy, but Fritz Lang is a genius.",10,11 October 1999,"I have always had more respect than love for this film.  For a start, I prefer Lang's American films in general, because the German ones, outstanding as they are, can be so heavy, and more depressing than even I can take.  Secondly, I felt that despite METROPOLIS' remarkable imagery, there was something simplistic and trite about the film's 'message', and that its politics were more than a little dodgy.  Thirdly, on a television, the overpowering visuals seemed more like a clever trainset.  But mostly, I was put off by Georgio Moroder's horrendous vandalism of the film, with his infantile tinting, and his vile music, where his previously impeccable disco pedigree was replaced by a hideous, grating, fingers-on-blackboard monstrosity of a tinny, tin-eared, tinnitus-inducing 'score'.  Rather than face that, I've always turned the sound down and played Bruckner, which is more than a little unsatisfactory.Last night I saw METROPOLIS in the cinema, and the experience was astonishing and revelatory.  I can see now why it is revered by so many, a judgement that had puzzled me previously.  It IS German, and heavy and depressing, but it has a remarkable playfulness absent from much of Lang's work - the fatuous Arcadian idyll juxtaposed with the constructivist catacombs of the workers; the introduction of John Frederson, master of the Metropolis, with his impeccably attired toadies; the mad inventor, Rotwang; any scene with the wonderful, disruptive robot-Maria, so preferable to her pious progenitor - a jerky, proto-Bride of Frankenstein - witness especially the jawdropping scene where Frederson reveals her to his cronies, belly-dancing.  These scenes, and many more, do much to leaven and ironise the film's considerable gloom, without ever undermining it.As for the film's simplistic plea, Lang does everything in his awesome power to destabilise his wife (and future Nazi)'s schematic script.  The film is not simply futuristic science fiction, but exists or refers to three temporal levels - the future-present in which the film takes place; the vast Egyptian/Biblical images this present is contrasted with, showing that history is not a straight line of progress, but a perpetual repetition of greed, power, repression and destruction; and the medieval, religious world Maria leads the workers to as a site of hope and peace.  All three involve the repression or subservience of the workers.  The medieval realm, which, with its heavy incense and gloom, is quite literally intoxicating, filmed in the style of Danteesque engravings, mirroring the Inferno and the circles of hell of the workplace at the beginning, thoroughly negating the redemption offered by Maria.This God/boss-believer/worker dichotomy is mirrored in the father/son crisis that structures the film.  This parent/child relationship pervades METROPOLIS (e.g. Maria and the children; the inventor and the robot), but rather than assert tradition and order, they spiral into chaos and destruction.  The sex-drive is linked to death and corruption for the son's hallucinations, as he revivifies (like the inventor) the seven deadly sins in one extraordinary sequence after discovering Maria's 'betrayal'.  The whole film is a well of repressed urges bursting to the surface, literally so when the very phallic gas tanks burst open.  Sexual repression and political repression are intimately linked, and their rising to the surface provide some of the film's most compelling images.And yet the politics, to me, remain very very suspect.  METROPOLIS begins as a scathing critique of totalitarianism, and its links with modern capitalism (especially in the US), but ends upholding it, trying to make it work. Although Lang undermines the obscene reconciliation at the end, by showing the sheer destructive glee of revolution, and making the workers as unthinking and robotlike as ever, following the foreman, it is not hard to see why this was Hitler's favorite film.Lang has not found a way of giving 'the mass' an individual voice without demonising it, and the clearly Semitic mad inventor (he has stars of David on both his door and in his lab; his Frankenstein narrative of creation and destruction draws on the Jewish myth of the Golem; his bug-eyed insanity is very similar to contemporary caricatures) is shown to be the root of all the problems in the film, from the creation of the robot, to the flaws in the city's infrastructure.  Once he has been disposed of, order can be restored, the Master can repress to his heart's content, while seeming to befriend the workers.I am running out of time, and I've so much more to say.  On the big screen, the true majesty of the set design blooms, but it is not the fully developed, peopled world of, say, BLADE RUNNER.  Rather, this is a dream space - appropriate to a nightmare vision of modern society - barely populated.  When a crowd walks somnambulistically, or a car suddenly drives by, it is like a dream figure in a vast oneiric landscape, not a regular feature of everyday life.  The social rupture of the film's subject matter is figured in the apparently unassailable inhumanity of the buildings - they are unstable and distorted, waiting to collapse.  The faded image of the video is replaced by an extraordinary, beautiful, clear, sharp picture, a triumph of geometry; an inhuman grid over humanity that finally bursts in the son's remarkable Expressionist frenzy.Lastly is the score.  The print I saw was provided by the British Film Institute, and the music was amazing, a victory of understanding, eclecticism, and invention over Moroder's idiocies.  Jazz alternates with industrial noise or mystical, medieval chanting; sound effects are used with unerring, evocative precision; every scene was enriched by a meta-score that actually commented on each image, providing an interpretation or insight we may have missed.  I wish I hadn't forgotten the composer's name - Kasper something, I think - but I urge you to see this BFI version, because with anything else you really needn't bother; you're cheating Lang, and you're cheating yourself.  Genius.",Metropolis
107,the red duchess,A dream of a film (spoilers),10,26 March 2001,"It is often assumed that 'Metropolis', Hitler's favourite film and scripted by a future prominent National Socialist, is a reactionary tract.  Certainly its admirers tend to praise its futuristic sets and narrative construction, diminishing its apparent thematic purpose.  On a purely plot level, the movement is definitely towards closure, to reasserting the status quo after social fissures have erupted into mass violence, reconfiguring the workers from active destroyers to passive constructors.  And certainly, the main protagonists, mostly from the ruling class, are humanised, given a psychology of their own, while the workers are an easily manipulable mass, some even given bestial features, as if they are not quite human.There is a radical tradition in German cinema, going from Lang through Sirk to Fassbinder that uses the resources of narrative to subvert its ends.  The ending of Sirk's 'Final Accord', for instance, seems to offer an exemplary image of Nazi ideology, when Sirk's procedures have been to dismantle it. 
The same process is at work here, and in the same terms - the film's very constituents explain why it doesn't offer closure.  This is a film about decadence.  'Metropolis' is no proto-Orwellian nightmare; the peak of absolute control is past, now large cracks are beginning to appear - even the paint seems to be peeling off.  Jon Frederson's anxious face is not that of a self-confident dictator.  This uncertainty in subject matter is matched by the form.  The narrative actually consists of four dreams.  'Metropolis' the film itself is Lang's horrified dream of the future after visiting Manhattan.  More directly, there are three cases of people literally dreaming within the film.  Freder is the one most prone to visions and hallucinations, unable to see what's in front of him without idealising or demonising it.  When he see Maria apparently wooing his father, his idealism is crushed, and he goes mad, having hysterical nightmares conflating religion, lust and death.  The important point is the way Freder dreams disrupt the film's 'objective' narration.  As in all of Lang's work, much of the plot information is filtered through point of view; if this point of view is suspect, how reliable is the plot information; and, more pertinently, its resolution?  There is a crucial ambiguity in the scene where Frederson and Rotwang reveal to the ruling class the robot Maria.  Formally, in its hallucinatory quality, its subjective focus, and in Lang's editing, the sequence seems to be Freder's dream, but it contains narrative action he is not party to. This ambiguity is never resolved, and, as the narrative pitch heightens and becomes more excessive at this point, it is plausible that the second half is one long hallucination.  Maria too dreams, as she lies wired to the robot, who is a conventionally Freudian double for her dark desires.  Where Maria 1 is more of a spirit than a person, etherealised by light to the point where she seems like a ghost, the 'evil' Maria is all body, a sexual creature; where maria 1 is linked to children (the future), Maria 2 rejoices in the end of the world. This fissure in Maria creates the social fissure that leads to the revolt, but it also leads to a complication of characterisation that undermines the resolution.  The final dream is that of the workers, who sleepwalk their way through life.  Like Maria, the second half of the film is a giant emanation of the Id, a Bacchic revolt.  Their political transgression is sexualised, the phallic monuments symbolising their repression ejaculating in a flood.  The geography of 'Metropolis' is also a physiology, with the city a map of the mind, broken down by warring impulses, and the wear and tear of daily modern life.This ambiguity of status - is it dream of reality - determines the whole film: in motifs, for instance - the final, hesitant handshake mirrors two previous ones that betokened no good; the images of the circle and the triangle, in the shapes of buildings and objects, in Lang's composition of characters and space, proliferate throughout the film, often subliminally creating a pattern of repetition and power relations that undermine the straight line of the narrative (for instance, the vicious circle of power and revolt being part of the same cycle of repression). 
The site of the ending on the steps of a Cathedral symbolise a Christian and Dantean redemption, after the incendiary revolt, with 'devils' cast out in what we would now call a Hitchcockian finale (Lang, as usual, getting there first); but the Inferno continues, in the monotonous routine of the workers' lives, and in the underground setting of their work and homes. 'Metropolis' is replete with religious symbolism - Maria as a virgin mother; Freder as Christ, doubting his creator-father, his exhausted arms spreadeagled in a crucifixion pose at the dial - but these are usually ironised.  Maria's message of hope may be delivered in an abandoned Church, but it is also a catacomb, a burial place, and the scene (the scariest in cinema?) where she is hunted by Rotwang, her terrified eyes being directed towards mounds of death, tend to diminish the religious rapture, with her pacifism linked to the workers' death.  The Holy Family motif is turned by Freder's sexual neurosis into an Oedipal complex when he catches Maria with his father, unleashing visions of the Seven Deadly Sins.  The witch-burning is not a very redemptive resurgence of an older, less forgiving Christian sentiment.  The mixture of different genres - futuristic fantasy, Gothic horror, psychological thriller, suspense movie etc. - reflects the conflation of different historical timespans, which makes 'Metropolis' an archetypal post-modern space.  If history is rendered uniform and, hence, forgotten, than its lessons will be forgotten, as will the closing redemption, when we can expect the same old mistakes to be made again.  Most importantly, the investigation of voyeurism and surveillance, and its link to power and oppression, implicate both the director and the audience - the Maria 2 strip-tease to an orgy of disembodied eyes is only the most extreme case - and further deny the impulse to resolution and distance. Lang knows perfectly well the limitations of the script, and his film is an act of opposition to it and its assumptions.",Metropolis
108,oOoBarracuda,Epic in spite of silence,9,6 January 2016,"It didn't take Metropolis long to reach a mammoth level in cinema. The film actually surely surpassed this description upon its creation, as the cost of production was more than any film at the time and included thousands of extras. The genius that is Fritz Lang shone through in this epic. The effects utilized in this film far surpassed their time and would prove to be a grandiose enjoyment for the audience for years to come. Never let anyone tell you a silent film cannot be absolutely captivating and stunning, as Metropolis proves both of these assertions to be blatantly false.Thrown into a world full of cityscapes and advanced machinery, the audience quickly figures out that they are in a seemingly utopian future, in the city of Metropolis. The city's founder, Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel) acts as a God-like figure overlooking the city and the means of its production and continuation. His son, Freder, becomes captivated by a woman he meets in the city below. He soon learns to find out that the person of his desire, Maria (Brigitte Helm), is a member of the working class. Living amongst the wealthy society, Freder was completely oblivious to life among the poor working class, living below the city. He then becomes shocked and quite saddened to learn that his father is responsible for the conditions of the working class. In what spawns a duel between loyalty and love, Freder devotes himself to reaching common ground between the wealthy and the working poor. Someone must mediate between the members of society that think of action for the city, and the working class that bring those thoughts to fruition; Freder is just the person for the job.A technical wonder for its time and beyond, Metropolis remains fixed in its astonishing effects. The scene in which Maria captivates the men of Metropolis is incredible. The juxtaposition between the collage of eyes, men's faces, and the dancing Maria was chilling. Just as powerful as this scene are the many in which the audience gets a view of just how many people are involved in this film. Seeing the droves of individuals racing around on screen is mind boggling to say the least. All of these technical feats culminate with Maria's transformation to machine. The visuals that Lang uses throughout the film are incredible, not just in a ""for 1927"" way either. The widely regarded first feature-length science fiction film, Metropolis is one to visit again and again, even today, for sci-fi fans.Riddled with heavy concepts throughout the entire film, Metropolis deals with social hierarchy, revolt, and capitalism, among many other ideas. Without trying, one can appreciate the stark difference in class between the citizens of Metropolis. For the wealthy above ground, they live a carefree life, completely oblivious to those working beneath the city desperately trying to sustain themselves. Freder himself, heir to the city's founder, had no idea what people endured to preserve the city and all of its technology. Once the workers realize how different they live compared to the wealthy elite, revolt becomes a possibility. It seems, even beneath the differences among the two classes, neither wants to do the other harm. The workers are driven to revolt to make fair society rather than harm the wealthy members of it. The film also makes a stark claim about capitalism, that it should be both desired and feared. Citizens should desire capitalism because it will guarantee the city in which they live will be sustained by a working class that will never leave their position. Security is a benefit that it seems only capitalism can provide to a collection of citizens. Capitalism should also be feared as a means to keep workers from reaching their potential and creating a disconnection between the workers from the rest of society. This time of constant menial work also alienates the workers from what they are doing daily resulting in spirits that are never tapped. One could spend a lifetime discussing the conceptions within Metropolis, as it remains a beautifully intense film that should be required viewing for anyone living among other people.I find it interesting that H.G. Wells quoted Metropolis as being ""quite the silliest film"" because much of it reminded me, and seemed to be inspired from, his own work The Time Machine. Both tell the story of a dystopian future, advanced technology and its flaws, and the dangers of class separatism. For whatever the reason, and it would have to be a good one, Wells didn't enjoy this film. Everyone has that prerogative; I quite enjoyed the film, and had fun seeing my first silent movie epic.

In addition to being a very impressive technical achievement for its time, the film is well known as the very first feature-length sci fi film. While it wasn't met with a very warm reception upon its release (not to mention having been cut since then), it has made a massive impact over the decades for its biting allegory and themes of purity mixed in with knowledge and strength.Set in a futuristic urban dystopia, high class city planner Joh Fredersen lives in the Tower of Babel around the prestigious city, which is atop its underground equivalent filled with workers who manage the machinery that support it. The actual story revolves around Joh's son Freder and the holy figure Maria trying to overcome the major split between the two parts. Director Fritz Lang and writer Thea von Harbou develop the film's plot through world building, as it's made clear from the start that the workers of the surface-level power plant toil with the equipment tirelessly year by year. Satirically, the workers are the clocks controlled by the ringleader Frederson. In a way, the film lets the viewers think about the societal differences between individuals and power without spoon-feeding the message as much as showcasing it through distinctive nations.Admittedly, the film doesn't really develop the characters outside of their basic tropes and goals, but they're by no means bad. If anything, they're meant more to guide the events of the different classes throughout the story's progression. Freder knows all the wrong doings of tampering with technology, therefore he wishes there to be a proper balance between the thinkers and the builders, hence why he adores Maria so much. Speaking of Maria, she is the saintly guide to the workers looking for hope, but her purity comes at a price of the mad scientist Rotwag who builds a robot to replicate his loved one Hel (who ended up becoming Freder's mother). Without spoiling much, let's just say that what he does to Maria really causes the film to get suspenseful. The remaining cast are mainly easily manipulated individuals looking for the right voice to lead them.But of course, the feature's visual style is timelessly breathtaking. Most of the special effects were huge innovations at a time of severe technological limitations, and some even work as substance depending on some given scenes (like the mythos behind the Tower of Babel). Many of the contraptions and backdrops have clearly inspired the likes of Blade Runner, Futurama and even Batman over the years, mainly through the gothic architect and abstract landscapes. Admittedly, a lot of the acting is really over the top by today's standards, but that's more attributed to the dynamic gestural performances commonplace back in the day. That, and many scenes do kind of drag on a bit for their own good. However, the narrative and message are meant to be told through these elaborate sets and melodramatic performances to gain the necessary emotional resonance for such an ambitious project like this.In conclusion, Metropolis is a prime example of how something can stand the test of time through technical brilliance and emotional resonance based on a political allegory. It's funny how Fritz Lang believed this film to be the prediction of how the future would be perceived back in the 1920s, because it's not too far off from today. Technology is a great usage and all, but all the amazing knowledge and manual labor in the world are nothing without the necessary negotiating in case one spirals out of control, something that many corporations these days fail to realize. If you are yet to check this film out, definitely feel free to do so to remind yourself how important it is to maintain order around advanced infrastructure.",Metropolis
110,PIST-OFF,The father of sci-fi cinema.,9,24 April 1999,"Silent movies are not for everyone. Neither are subtitles. Those brave enough to view a movie with no sound and words that are far and few between should definitely enjoy this silent masterpiece. One of the biggest productions of its time, Metropolis still holds its own when set design and special effects are compared. But what Metropolis really has is orginality. This German-Expressionist film had such originality in everything from its costumes to its views of a future (modern) city that its ideas can still be seen everywhere in modern sci-fi. Star Wars's C-3PO was based on Bridgette Helm's robot. Dark City and Brazil both have Metropolis look-a-like cities. This is a very good movie. It's too bad most movies don't have its originality.",Metropolis
111,RevRonster,There's a reason this film is legendary...,8,7 March 2014,"I always knew about the lasting impressions ""Metropolis"" had in the world of cinema and how it influenced so many people over the decades. I've read countless articles about the movie, seen numerous movie documentaries talk about it and have even attended lectures about it but I've never actually watched the film. Oh, I've intended to see it ever since my college days but have never took the time to actually view the legendary 1927 silent film Until recently I have to say, it's as good as all the people, books and hidden scrolls in the deepest caves in the land have claim it was. The special effects stand up ridiculously well, the massive sets and visual look of the film is incredible and the sheer number of extras that were involved in bringing this future dystopian society to life is truly a sight to witness. Granted, the actors overact like crazy (but that's a sign of the time, actors then came from the stage) and, yes, the actors may look like they are all competing to be the next Batman villain because of the makeup applications that were used at the time but that really doesn't take away from how cool the film is and how revolutionary it was.The only thing I really didn't enjoy about ""Metropolis"" (over than the sad fact that the film is incomplete due to a lot of footage disappearing thanks to the evils of time), had to be the story. While many of the themes of the film are strong and are still relevant today, the movie expressed these themes with an overt simplicity and it made the already hammy acting of the performances from this day and age seem that much hammier and made a lot of the characters come off as simpletons. However, once again, it was a sign of the times and for a silent film, the narrative was still pretty complex and stood high over other films of the era.So, the story didn't particularly WOW me but the rest of the film is just a feast for the eyes. The scope alone and the grand scale the film projects is amazing and it's easy to understand why it has stood the test of time.Hi! My name is Rev. Ron and I love movies!

112,osloj,MEGAPOLOLIS,10,14 August 2001,"Fritz Lang was highly inventive in this fantastic sci-fi dystopian vision that used stylized art deco sets to imitate a future where workers would live underground and the upper classes became slothful. Imagine seeing this at a theater in the 1920's, it must have been an awesome sight to behold! Lang always had a heart for socialist theory and almost gets revolutionary when one of the privileged class members falls in love with a leader of the underground workers. It passed the German censors simply because it 'implied' a certain future. Truly a classic for many years to come, it is continually imitated til this day.",Metropolis

114,nickenchuggets,Legendary,10,27 May 2021,"Metropolis defines the word classic, in every sense. This movie has such a look, feel, and atmosphere to it that hasn't been matched even now that it almost seems mythical. Unlike movies now that seem way too over the top and extreme in terms of exciting things going on all at once, Metropolis moves at a pretty slow pace. This doesn't mean the movie is bad. Far from it. Lang knew that it was a better idea to make the movie move slower rather than faster, since it allows the audience to follow the story easier. Speaking of the story, it's one of the most original of the entire silent era. It is about a man named Freder who is the son of the city's owner, Joh Fredersen. Freder meets a girl named Maria one day, but because the city is sharply divided between the workers and ruling class, he finds it hard to pursue her. Later on, a mad scientist named Rotwang is confronted by Joh over some secret maps, and the scientist tells him his former lover, Hel, left him to be with Joh instead. She then died after having Freder. In order to bring his love back, Rotwang intends to build a ""machine man"" and transfer Maria's life essence into it. He actually succeeds, and later in the film there are now two Maria's: one of which is real and the other is a decoy that wants to destroy the machines in Metropolis and take over the city. Throughout the whole movie, as you might expect, there are large amounts of mechanical objects shown that look futuristic even today. I don't see how anyone can watch this and say it's not a masterpiece. The sheer scale and vastness of the movie can be seen in the first couple of minutes, when you see the enormous new version of the Tower of Babel, as well as the underground where the working class performs their duty. Lang's inspiration for the look of the movie was actually New York City's skyline when he visited in 1924. Tall buildings, flashing lights, and new things called cars taking to the busy streets. There is also a lot of dream-like scenery on display, like when Maria goes into the catacombs and
is attacked by Rotwang in order to bring her to the machine man. Speaking of which, this has to be one of the earliest instances of a robot in a movie. I can't think of anything that comes anywhere close to being this groundbreaking. Many people who know a lot about movies always tell you that Citizen Kane is the best movie ever made. That might be true, because it made really good use of shadows and weird angle shots, but look at Metropolis, over a decade earlier. Classic science fiction setting, towering skyscrapers, strange flying machines in the background, mad scientists, one of the first robots, and a well written story of a man who must act as the mediator between the working class and the wealthy. Why can't Lang get credit for the best film of all time? In any case, Metropolis is without a doubt one of the best science fiction movies ever, and it's almost scary how it predicted a world run by machines.",Metropolis
115,richieandsam,A complete breakthrough in film history!,8,14 November 2013,"METROPOLISOne of the all time greats... this was the first time I had seen this movie.The movie is about the son of a city leader falls in love with a working class prophet who predicts the future... so he decides to go underground with the workers to find her. The problem is a robot has been invented and has taken her form and is stirring up trouble to cause death to all the workers.The film is completely out there. I didn't know what to expect from this film. The movie was made in 1927. It is a silent movie... one of the classics that you can see the characters talking and then a card comes up with the dialogue on. I thought I would hate this as I have not seen many films like this, but it was actually a good movie.This is an original sci-fi film. Unfortunately the movie is not complete. There are frames and scenes that have been either lost or destroyed over the years. The film has been patched together really well and you wouldn't notice too much.It is unbelievable how good the effects are for the age. They are not brilliant, but if I watched it back in 1927 I would think that the effects were out of this world. The film is so well made. Fritz Lang had such an amazing vision for this film and made it with passion. Even to this day, some of the camera angles and some of the shots that were used in this film is amazing. It is a very good looking movie and a lot of fun to watch.The acting is terrible... but as I said before, this is a silent movie so the actors are playing visually. If they didn't act over the top, it would not be anywhere near as good as it is. The best actress in the movie for me was Brigitte Helm. She had multiple roles in this movie, and she was really scary in some of them. She was by far the best cast member of this movie. Other cast members were Alfred Abel, Gustav Frohlich, Rudolph Klein- Rogge & Fritz Rasp. The make up the male actors had to wear was awful. The pasty white faces and the lipstick was so over the top, but this is how it was back then.The story is really good, but in places it is very slow. This film is very visual and so in places you are just looking at the scenery and the futuristic setting that the film is set in. That is not a bad thing, but I thought that it had slightly too much scenery as you could tell that a lot of it was reused over and over again.The music score was very good. The orchestra that played for that movie did a fantastic job. The music was perfect for the story and in places very powerful.This film is a massive breakthrough in film history and I am glad that I have seen it!I will give this film 8 out of 10.""Come!

117,romanorum1,Surreal: Utopia and Dystopia,10,22 February 2012,"Fritz Lang's masterpiece, Metropolis, filmed way back in the late Silent Movie days, was ahead of its time in many ways: scale, direction, storyline, special effects, symbolism, and geometric and shadowed sets. The plot involves a futuristic society of haves, who live above ground (""The Head""), and the have-nots (""The Hands""), who populate the world below. The haves, of course, are the plutocrats and city planners who call all of the shots. In their Utopia, they enjoy the sunshine and modern means of transportation to their stadiums and gardens and skyscrapers. The haves are generally oblivious to the have-nots, who inhabit the never-world. The have-nots, locked in their Dystopia, are equally unaware of the world above. Like drones, they have numbers for names, work hard and run the many machines that keep the society functioning. Or do the machines run the workers? Early in the film, our hero has a vision; a burned-out machine turns into a fearsome devourer monster Moloch. (Note that Moloch was the ancient Phoenician pagan god to whom the Canaanites and Carthaginians sacrificed their children.) What really had happened was that there was injury and death from an industrial accident (A machine had overpowered a worker.) Anyway, observe those machinery control dials and arrows, and how the robotic workers try to manipulate them to and fro. The work clocks show ten hours only – not 12 – and certainly not for the benefit of the workers. Note their demoralized, mechanized movements during the shift changes.One day Freder Fredersen, our hero, spots a pretty young woman, Maria, and a large group of children, who have abruptly appeared above ground via a modern elevator. Observing the haves in a garden, Maria declares to the children that ""These are your brothers."" Very soon she is escorted back into the elevator and returns below ground. Maria espouses the need for a ""Heart"" the join ""The Head"" with ""The Hands."" She predicts that a ""mediator"" will soon come. In seeing and in being infatuated with Maria, Freder – who enjoys his life and amenities above ground – goes below to follow Maria and thus becomes aware of the Dystopian world. Horrified, he returns above and confronts his father, Joh Fredersen, the founder and controller of Metropolis. Obviously the father, acting like a dictator, wants to keep things going as they have been. Conversely the son wants to improve the lot of the workers, perhaps even be the Heart that can join the Head with the Hands. A complication is the malevolent inventor C. A. Rotwang, ostensibly working for Joh, but who plays the upcoming revolution for his own agenda. He has never forgotten that a long-lost love (Hel) chose Joh Fredersen over himself. She had later died in giving birth to Freder, Joh's biological son. Note Rotwang's crooked house (for a crooked mind), marked with a satanic pentagram over the door and equipped with a Frankenstein-type of laboratory. Rotwang is building a robot that will look exactly like Maria, not Hel as he initially tells Joh. Note Rotwang's right hand (suggestive of Dr. Strangelove nearly four decades later?). But any disruption, any machinery shut-down, will destroy Metropolis. Meanwhile the saintly Maria holds meetings in catacombs below ground, with a background of crosses and candles (obviously reminiscent of the Catholic Christians meeting below ground in ancient Rome). There is praying and kneeling, and many biblical inferences. They include allusion to the Tower of Babel, Anti-Christ, Hell, and to the Apocalypse (the woman in Revelation who rides the beast of seven heads and ten horns). In the movie the monster symbolizes the seven deadly sins, not any particular government or political entity or religion. Of course the robot (the false woman) rides the Beast in the movie.By now you have the gist of the storyline, and there is no need to go into any more plot giveaways in the second part of the movie. But when one realizes that the Nazis are only a half-dozen years from power, one might say that Lang was a prognosticator. By the way, note the architecture and geometric-shaped furniture. Do see this film, which is on Leonard Maltin's Top 100 listing (listed by him as must-see films of the 20th century). Metropolis is one of 12 Silents that Maltin selected. Also, there is a Silent Movie website (The Top 100 Silent Era Films) that lists Metropolis as the #2 silent movie of all time, behind The General and ahead of Sunrise. But you absolutely must see the restored version of 2010, which, while not perfect – there are several scratchy scenes – contains nearly the whole movie as envisioned by Lang.",Metropolis

However, the city is operated by 2 factions: The people who rule the city and the people who keep the machines of the city working 24/7. The rulers play and enjoy life while the underground inhabitants live in horrible conditions and are on the brink of an uprising.Freder, the son of Joh Frederson the ruler, sees Maria. She is also a kind of spiritual leader, explaining to the inhabitants of the underground city that there will be a time and place to mend the fences between them and the rulers.Freder's father, not liking the possibility of an uprising, convinces Rotwang the inventor to help him. Rotwang has created a robot and uses it to his advantage. Kidnapping Maria, Rotwang gives the robot her image in an attempt to control the workers.

Nearly 2.5 hours.Reviewers here talk about the futuristic look of the film, and that's true. And it is impressive, but there are also reference to other ages - - the Pharaohs of Egypt...the Tower of Babel, etc. In the end, it's the art deco artistry that makes it still appear fresh.The story is sort of dumb. Have and have nots. Same theme Obama plays day in and day out and the agenda has really gotten long in the tooth.The acting is rather wooden to be quite frank, and surprising considering this was made in 1927, not 1917. By the time of the beginning of the sound era, silent film acting learned to be natural, not stagy. But stagy this is for the most part and it really detracts from the power of the film.For example the make lead over acts so badly that it's actually hard to watch him when he's on the screen. The make up used is also over done and surprising for the year. Once again, it takes away from the power of the film.In the end, the film's message is dated. Capitalism won, get over it. Still, the look of the film is what brings you back. Not the acting and certainly not the story line. It's all about the artistry of the sets and back drops. But 2.5 hours? Is there a Cliff Notes version?And just an aside. In these types of films, -- the ones that take an overtly leftist point of view, why are the male protagonists always so effeminate? The guy in this film should be wearing a dress.If the acting was better, the characters more interesting than cardboard cutouts, and the story not so heavy handed in the way it was told, I would have given an additional 2 stars, but I just couldn't.

Some I have rated highly myself but some were a bit of a let down, this one is somewhere between.I think it is Ok, visionary certainly, and the future it depicts is not much different from cities we live in today. But the acting in it is not acting, it is just people doing something being filmed with the special effects they had in those days, the quality of film does not help, the one I watched was a restored version, and its very well done.

I'm watching it in parts and watched 1.5 hours (out of 2.5 hours). This version is WAY too long. Really hard for me to rate/judge this movie. It's classical, it has some great achievements and visuals - and obviously it influenced a lot of movies afterwards - but I can't say I enjoy watching it. The movie doesn't ""flow"", the editing (especially in the 2010 version) is way too slow with shots that are way too long and the entire structure of the movie seems to be problematic.The acting is very ""expressionistic"" and highly unnatural. I know it's the genre and the fact of it being silent, but it's still weird. There are a lot of silent movies (e.g. Chaplin, etc.) that aren't acted so unnatural. I don't think even ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" (which came out 7 years earlier) is that unnatural in acting (only watched it once, years ago, so I really can't remember).Rating this movie is very difficult. Based on its achievements and influence it should get a very high rating. But based on enjoyment from today's point of view, I can't give it a high rating.BTW, ""Star Wars"" reference - Obviously, the robot is a direct influence, but I was surprised to listen to the (original) score of Metropolis - parts of it reminded me of John Williams' score to ""Star Wars"".

The film also proves that special effects are nothing new; just look at the robot transformation scene and tell me that would have been easy to do in 1927!

One might say that along with King Kong (1933), M (1931) and Griffith's work it is an essential pillar of cinema, having very obviously inspired 2001 and Blade Runner among classics.In the futuristic (and visually alluring) city Metropolis: workers feed machines as slaves while the rich live decadently in new gardens of Eden. A loving prophet calls for peaceful revolt. An artificial being is created to sew discord between the rebelling slaves. A young prince discovers the suffering his kingdom is built on...Metropolis mostly works as a metaphor, both story-wise and visually (an early shot of a machine spliced with the hungry antique god Moloch, stunning in its own right, only serves to drive home the timelessness of Lang's subject). Today, a lot of it seems dated, yet a lot that stuns wouldn't work in a modern film (where such visual language would disturb or just wring false). Metropolis looked very futuristic at the time, and the design's appeal has only grown with time, becoming a marvelous retro-futuristic beauty.Metropolis was a colossus at the time and remains one to this day, truncated though it is (nevertheless, the Kino DVD released in 2002 restores all the meaning and coherence and is an essential buy).Unmissable, on every conceivable level!",Metropolis
129,zeekwunlau,A little thinking,8,2 May 2020,"As a sci-fi masterpiece, this metropolis has a profound impact on future sci-fi films.
The climax of the film is the outbreak of the flood. A group of workers who have lost their minds with the excitement of music are destroying equipment. Workers who have been in a state of being squeezed for a long time have no time and energy to think independently under the burden of constant physical work, which makes them numb. Such a group of already rebellious workers began to lose their rationality and destroy underground factories under the influence of malicious incitement and collective herd psychology, causing a huge disaster, but soon afterwards attributed the fault to the robot Maria. And happy to forget afterwards. This also shows a bad mental state of people.
The foreman is the key figure in this riot. As a whistleblower in the early stage, he later used the image of a wise man and a leader to guide the instigated masses of workers and finally shake hands with the capital class on behalf of the working class. This is an over-ideal ending.
There is a story about Noah's Ark in the chapter of Genesis of the Old Testament of the Bible. God decided to use the flood to wash the world because of the serious sins of the world. The flood here has the same effect. Mary, who has the same name as the Virgin Mary, played the same role as Noah in this flood. They retained the most promising seeds.
Does Fredson, who indirectly caused the flood, represent God. In the early part of the film, there are a lot of shots of him looking down from the high floors of the building, which represents his highness. As the creator of this city, he has a very high status. But he is clearly different from God. In the Old Testament of the Bible, God created everything to control the power of life and death, but he only resorted to it when the world was full of sin, and Fredson acted entirely out of the anger that the workers were not under his control. He has similar rights but no similar mentality. Man can never be a god.
Like the Tower of Babel mentioned earlier in the film, the Tower of Babel is the transit tower built by Babylon. The establishment of the transit tower is due to the king's selfish desire to reach heaven with the height of heaven. Praise from those in power, but the original intention, whether right or wrong, will become a curse after causing pain for tens of thousands of people.
This film uses sci-fi religion to express social issues, expressing the obvious and profound opposition between the working class and the bourgeoisie, but in reality will there be the same beautiful ending as in the film?",Metropolis

131,jldmp1,The Outer Limits,10,11 October 2006,"While this is a template for so many later science fiction works, this is not science fiction -- this very clearly is German expressionism, in a line from ""Der Golem"", ""Nosferatu"", etc.The key is that none of this is about 'plot' or 'story'; those things we normally associate with narrative films are products and afterthoughts here. The point of the departure of this movie is -vision-, yes, even cinematic vision, I would argue, much more than mere imagery. This is all about thinking big, having big vision. Remember that this was made at a point in time when very big opposing political and cultural ideas were coalescing and on their way to full frontal impact with each other, most obviously capitalism v. socialism.It's all about pushing limits: pushing the limits of imagination, of plausibility, of perspective, of architecture, of logic and of emotion. And...the entire -way- this is filmed, edited and intertitled pushes the limits in an astonishing synchrony with the actual visual content.Many have tried and most have failed to better this...the smartest successors to this found their own groove: ""Bladerunner""...""Brazil""... those come to mind.The best silent film ever made?

132,Dockelektro,Great Historical Movie,6,21 November 2000,"I liked this picture, it's a great example of a visionary mind, and the sets are astonishing. The only thing that keeps me from scoring this movie higher is its futurist message, much identified with fascist ideals of man beneath the machines and the subjugation of people under an automated system, with some elites ruling the world from above in an unfair hierarchy. but this is exciting to watch just for the rules it broke in the time it was made. Oh, for future viewers, please avoid at all costs the 80's version with a score by Giorgio Moroder, since it destroys all the suspense and atmosphere of the movie. I don't know who approved that work, and what took Moroder to do it, but the result is like playing a record of him for 2 hours, disconnecting all the climax from the movie which is to it attributed: for example, a horror scene has the same music as the scene where we see images of the city...horrible to say the least. Whatever problems I find in this picture, I have to take my hat to the way it influenced many pictures till this time, like ""The Fifth Element"", ""Blade Runner"" and even ""Batman"" (the final scene of the cathedral is a perfect pastiche of the one in here). It's a work of vision. Let's praise that!",Metropolis
133,christian94,"Yes it is old, silent and slow-paced. Still you must see it.",8,30 August 2001,"For years now, I was very excited to see this movie, but somehow never got around to it .  When I heard of the Munich museum of cinema restoration efforts of Enno Patalas and that the film was to play at the Montreal World Film Festival of 2001, I could not prolong anymore the viewing of this sci-fi classic.  That night, there were technical problems and the projection was delayed past eleven o'clock.  Being very tired, and knowing that it was going to be an old, silent and slow-paced movie, I greatly feared that all my waiting would have been in vain.  I feared, that in the dark theater, I was going to sleep like a baby...Well, I didn't.Firstly, the music played live by three musicians that came especially from Germany was extraordinary.  It was fresh, captivating and entertaining.  It kept me riveted to the seat and fitted perfectly- no actually it enhanced greatly- the film.  The musicians received a standing ovation with cause.Secondly, the silent acting was necessarily over the top, but very powerful and engaging.  I never thought the wink of a robot could have that effect on me.Thirdly, the visual aspects of the movie were not only ahead of its time, it was in some instance better than what we see 74 years later.  Not because of the special effect, although they were very good, but because of the creative spark behind them.  Lang makes us see dreams like never before. The dance of the ""skeleton with a sickle"" (I will say no name)is a prime example. His visual collage of moving eyes and sexually tense robot dance are hypnotically riveting.  Hitchcock's later attempt at free visual expression (as in Vertigo) greatly lacked this ability to grasp the spectator and swirl him into the movie.  Even the remarkable breakthroughs of Stanley Kubric in `2001: a space odyssey ` are not up to part with Lang's visual wizardry.  As for current director's, they can also watch and learn. Lang's portrayal of crowds, either as ordinate drones or anarchist hoards is also singular in its mastery.  This is what impressed me the most with this spectacular work, straight out of the archives of history.The story, although containing some good scientific elements and trying to examine social and philosophical structures, is not as remarkable.  The pace is slow (which is not always bad, but which does not help much here) and the dramatization typical of older productions reminds us of why this type of languorous ""Greece tragedy"" scenes were replaced by the sharper, subtler, fined-tuned storytelling of today. Characters are a bit on the one to two-dimensional side.  Moral and religious implications are a bit heavy and unrevealing to my liking.All in all, this is an incredible film.  Pioneer, daring and exceptional for its period, it passed the test of time, to stand as a very very good production that lead the way for films to come.  Certain aspects became dated, but at the core, you can appreciate an artistic jewel of a rare kind. Although, apprehensive in the first 20 minutes, once I got accustomed to the silent acting/intertitle thing, I was in for a treat.  I didn't sleep and I didn't regret anything. Be open-minded and be ready to be thrown into this dark world of Metropolis. Enjoy.",Metropolis

Different classes of people do different types of work, human society can be rapid development.Johnson Friedson represents the ruling class or the bourgeoisie. He is the brain, without which a prosperous metropolis cannot be built by the insolence of the workers alone.The group of workers represents the working class, without whose labor force, no brainpower, no great idea can be realized.If class differentiation is inevitable, then the two classes are a symbiotic relationship. The effective cooperation between the two classes leads to the development and progress of human society, while the opposite leads to the disintegration and collapse.Therefore, the concept of ""coordinator"" is introduced.

135,eabakkum,Workers exploitation in Metropolis,7,27 April 2011,"The film Metropolis is famous for its critique on the exploitation of human beings, and as such is intuitively attractive. To be honest, I was told that the approach of Lang is rather sugary, and this has long stopped me from watching the film. However, Metropolis is a produce that you can not ignore. So, here is my review. The film is full of symbolism and myths, but Metropolis itself is simply what its name says. The peculiar thing is that all workers live in underground quarters, invisible to the middle and upper classes. Therefore, the mature son of the residential ruler and chief executive is totally unaware of the divided society, and leads a hippie-like life. One day, sister Maria comes from below together with a bunch of workers children, and shows them the lustrous life above. Maria, as you might guess from her name, is also the high priestess of the workers. She actually holds regular preaches on a churchyard. When the son sees her, he is impressed to such a degree, that he wants to visit her in the underground part of the city. She on the other hand, sees him as the Saviour (don't worry, he will not be crucified). The exploitation has driven the workers into a revolutionary state of mind, but Maria urges them to search for peaceful ways of change. Then the dictator orders his local insane scientist to make a machine man, a robot, which will duplicate Maria and incite the revolt of the workers. The reference to Frankenstein or Hide is obvious, but she also impersonates the human alienation. Apparently the idea is to beat down the revolt and make the workers more pliant. His plan seems to succeed, when the workers destroy the machines in the central power plant, which brings the economy to a grinding halt. In the end the underground city is drowned and the robot is burned on a pile, by the mob who now believes that she is a witch. In the mean time, the real Maria has guided all the workers children to the upper quarters. The scientist is killed by the son, who throws him of the roof of a cathedral. The dictator himself remains in power, but the son fulfills his task as Saviour and reconciles his father and the workers. And of course he marries Maria. The final text urges the viewers to merge hands and intellect with the hearth. Evidently, this abstract shows the many qualities of the film: love, suspension and even horror, battles and mass scenes. The acting is somewhat theatrical. There is lots of biblical and religious symbolism, even references to Babel. The reformation is not depicted as the merit of the working class, who are only capable to revolt and destroy. Actually, the odd worker who escapes from the underground city immediately joins the lustrous life above. It is astonishing, but the real hero and the only man of virtue is the son of the dictator. So the political message of the film has a religious and rather anti-socialist tendency, without being a real plea for democracy. It may be explained by the spirit of the time (1927), when the catholic organizations had obtained a social color and were competing with the socialists. In spite of the theme, I would dub this film a produce and a warning especially for the upper middle class. For the rest of us the message is: don't kill the machine, or your house will be flooded.

In striking black and white the film's panoramic view of pharaohnic sets showcasing titanic machinery and technology with the awesome display of urban modernity form an aesthetic backdrop to the human and social factors that form the heart of the movie. Touching on human relations the film is an attack on capitalism and the dehumanizing effect of the daily grind on the common man in the big city. The film's inclusion of one of the earliest depictions of Sci-Fi onscreen is a marvel of filmmaking and technology that adds further to the appeal and timelessness of the flick. With the size of the work and its far-reaching scope excess unsurprisingly follows and whatever merits the film have are much diluted by its excessive length.

139,filmalamosa,visuals riveting,1,22 November 2012,I would have given this movie more stars if it had been appropriately cut and the music eliminated or toned way back. (Probably something akin to what was originally released in 1927.) About 30 minutes into it I muted the sound and started to fast forward on the lower speeds so you could still read the titles. This turned a complete torture into something more enjoyable (it is still boring). It also turned 153 minutes into about 53 minutes. The elaborate sets and choreography were riveting I guess is a good word. As another viewer put it unforgettable visuals.The story = a quasi Frankenstein robot labour rights religious mêlée is a theme that didn't age well to our times. I especially am bored by class struggle dystopias. And that was the central element of this one.9.3 stars... I have to laugh there. Especially if you watched it with the sound blasting and the glacial pace of the action.

140,Bob Pr.,Stunning but somewhat disappointing,7,23 July 2012,"(We saw the 148 min. Kino 2010 restored version) The plot is very complex and interwoven with many Biblical allusions (Tower of Babel; a prophet; people waiting, hoping for a Mediator to come; catacombs; Gothic cathedrals; 7 deadly sins) along with class struggles, romance, eroticism, hoochy-koochie dancing, and science-fiction futurism.Metropolis society is divided into 2 classes: the rich masters whose families live privileged lives above ground while the workers live below ground keeping the infra-structure running. Freder, son of the ruler of Metropolis, happens below ground and sees Maria who compassionately cares for the workers' children and he's smitten by her attractiveness. In the catacombs, Maria urges the workers to be patient, prophesying that someday a Mediator will come and relieve them of their burdens. We get a hint that Freder may be the answer to that prophesy? But the workers' unrest is growing. When the ruler becomes aware of this unrest, he visits Rotwang, a genius inventor, for help. Rotwang shows him a robot which is nearly completed and, when done, will be indistinguishable from a real person. The two decide making the robot in the image of Maria will help identify and thwart the leaders of potential rebellion.But Rotwang, envious of his leader's power, changes his mind and decides to use the Maria robot to foment an actual rebellion. Suddenly we have two Maria's--the usual sweet, compassionate Maria and her robotic look-alike who is brazen, sexy, and provocative in many ways. And Freder struggles to save the real Maria.This undoubtedly is one of the most significant early films ever made because of its special effects and technical achievements. But whether your transportation is on foot or in a rocket ship, your home is a lean-to or a crystal palace, still motivations, issues, and principles have to be appropriately human. In this latter phase, IMO, ""Metropolis"" was deficient with a mish-mash of religious parallels, governing structures, and eroticism (possibly inserted to increase box office appeal?). For vision, for filming, Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" is stunning. But for reasonably appropriate human reactions and motivations, (IMO) Lang's reach exceeded his grasp.My ratings: 10/10 for film, historical & technical significance; but only 4/10 for plot/narrative. I'll compromise on 7/10. (And I'm VERY glad to have seen it -- I've heard about it for years.)",Metropolis
141,fjhuerta-2,A disturbing point of view on the future,10,14 March 2001,"First, let me get this out of my chest: I can barely think of a movie more terrifying than this one and ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"".Yes, I think it's even more scary than ""The Exorcist"". Why?""The Cabinet"" is the portrait of the world as seen through the eyes of a madman. The film itself won't reveal this until the ending (legend says, this is because the film was not meant to be this way; it was an allegory of impending Nazism, according to some authors). So you get distorted camera angles, expressionist design, and excellent acting along with what can be considered the first modern horror movie.""Metropolis"" builds upon the foundation of German expressionism, and takes it to a whole new level. While ""Cabinet"" has small sets with matte paintings, Metropolis has huge sets, which give it a tremendous sense of space. The sets themselves convey the power some humans have over other, less fortunate beings. The symbolism is apparent everywhere. And the storyline is fixated on what social inequalities could bring in the near future.Fritz Lang's vision was definitely flawed, though. He thought the ruling class of the future would ascend due to industrial prowess and mass production. Since the movie was made in the late 20's, this error was understandable. He didn't foresee that the real revolution was taking place in his home country, Germany. When Dejamark (IBM Germany) was tabulating the citizens of the nation, giving Hitler the information needed to kill every non-arian in the nation. The revolution of the Information Technology.Even so, one can watch this movie and argue that Lang hits the spot more than once on a lot of social issues. Truth is, the social conflicts he attacks are older than Lang himself (dating to the industrial revolution). But don't let this detract from watching this amazing film. It is powerful, moving, endearing and, ultimately, may be the best film ever to come out from the expressionist Germany.",Metropolis

It was an unreal world, set in 2026, 100 years after the work was produced. At that time, industrial society was mechanically divided into two worlds. In the above ground world, people live a luxurious and decadent life, the ground is full of twisted skyscrapers, gardens, fountains, theaters, sports grounds. In the paradise called YOSHIMARE, Fred, the son of the owner of the factory-like metropolis, plays with the women in the garden until the gate is opened and Fred is attracted by the simple but saintly maria, who is so different from the women he knew before. Around her were children living underground. She leaned over, pointed to the people in the garden and told the children, ""look, these are your brothers.""
In search of this haunting woman, Fred goes underground for the first time, to the ""hands"" of society. He was completely shocked by the infernal conditions in the underground and the heavy and uninterrupted labor of the people for ten hours a day. Even stopping for a few seconds is a risk of an explosion.
In the midst of this drudgery, Mary, appearing as the savior, is planning a plan. She told the workers a story, the story of BABEL tower. In the story, a man conceived of building a BABEL tower that would reach to the sky, but he was unable to build such a tower himself, so countless working people were sent to build the tower, which was a personal tribute, and to live a miserable life. They build brick by brick mechanically, but no one ever tells them what they're accomplishing; And the people who came up with the idea continued to live their own decadent lives, regardless of the lives of the builders.
Maria's attitude was neither one of total blindness to strikes and violence nor of humble submission to servitude. What she needs to do is to find and wait for the mediator between the head and the hands (Mittler). Only the heart is the mediator between the head and the hands. Only through heart-to-heart communication can the bridge of peace be built between the hand and the brain.
Oh, and here comes the mediator, frates.
Maria and frates fall in love, but frates's father, freudsen, is afraid that the workers will plot a revolt, so he goes to the inventor, rotwan. They once fought over the same woman, Fred's mother, Hel. Rotwan is building a robot that looks exactly like Hel. In order to prevent maria from leading the workers, fredson lets rotwan build a robot that looks exactly like maria and tries to sabotage the workers' plans by seducing them in this way.
Little did he know that rottwan had other plans. He wanted to get rid of the fredsons and destroy the world. He orders false maria to destroy both the earth and the earth with 7 deadly SINS. False maria then on the ground to make people infatuated with her, then kill each other; Underground, the workers were incited to stop work and destroy the machines, causing a major disaster and flooding into the dungeon.
The real maria escaped from rotewan's lab and, along with Fred, rescued the workers' children and stopped the flood, but the workers still misunderstand that the real maria caused the disaster. They caught the fake maria and set her on fire. Fred finally duels with lotwan and saves maria from him. In the end, fredson and the workers shook hands under the mediation of their son and maria.I had not expected such a happy ending rather than a complete revolution. In such a social environment, we are faced with the serious gap between the rich and the poor brought about by the mass production of machines, the worsening class antagonism and the destruction of human nature. However, the existence of the republic is still a question, such a compromise can be said to be the end of the current can be adopted, not only to maintain the social development of the rational choice.

The first film with sound in it was released the same year it was made - and a film of its type would need sound to be even better. But it is by no means bad. Who cares about words when you've got a good idea for a film? And Metropolis is a good idea - two societies in a city - one hell-like, one heaven-like. The film is great for its day - the scope is massive for a film nearly 80 years old - possibly the biggest ever at that time. And in terms of quality, it probably beat most films in the 50s and 60s. But Fritz Lang had a huge budget to play with - at that time, two million dollars was enough to send a film corporation into bankruptcy, nowadays being s*d-all. And though the budget is used well and every penny is put up on the screen, you just can't help feeling that this film needed words, and that it would just be taken the p**s out of by stupid young idiots in schools today. Though the odd title card every 30 seconds or so does do a good job of keeping everything on track and the musical score throughout the film does kind of substitute for words and sound, this film, I believe, would have been better if dialogue had been used.

There are various other messages seen and explored throughout the film, such as, playing God, women social/cultural issues and other subplots, to help carry this film into film history.I have seen this film a number of times before in the past. I have seen different versions and alternate versions. I've seen it on VHS, DVD and on television. I've seen shorter versions, damaged versions and reimagined versions. The 1984 colorized rockin-rollin'-80s version comes to mind when I think of alternate versions of this film. It presents a very interesting myopic take on this film. With talent like, Pat Benatar, Bonnie Tyler, Jon Anderson, Adam Ant, Loverboy, Billy Squier and Freddie Mercury, it brought the energy of the 1980s and infused it with the mechanical grittiness of German-born, pre-sound cinema. You should see it. For this viewing, I watched the latest, restored version I found on DVD. It is the best ever, with newly discovered footage and polished to almost original perfection. Do yourself I favor and try to find that fully restored version if you can.The costume used for the Robot-Woman does look great. Once she makes her appearance, the film becomes what it is supposed to be. It's a collection of imagery, symbolism, editing tricks, lighting, analogy and a visionary experience.

The camera-work is a little thick on the reaction shots. They are too long and too many. It doesn't look like a polished 1927 silent film, but more like a polished 1915 silent film. There are too many rough edges and it is too slow for me to declare it in its greatness, however, it is one of the first films attempting to predict a future teaming with political juices.

147,robsta23,Great but not a Masterpiece,9,18 February 2015,"This is the first feature we were required to watch in my special effects class, and though I've seen it before (and a longer version of it) I sill have to say I'm very impressed by the effects in this movie. They prove to be better in the context of the time period in which they were used than most CG effects are today in movies such as The Hobbit or Avatar.But this movie is not just for its spectacle; it has great underlying themes and motifs as well. The main motif is a quote that says ""the mediator between the head and the hand must be the heart,"" but this motif is almost overstressed. At first we probably think of this quote in literal terms, but at the end of the film it proves to be a cheesy yet effective line regarding the contrast of the leaders in society and the poor men of the working class.The story of the tower of Babel is interesting in this film, but parts of the story do not really have a place. They illustrate a tower that resembles, in height and shape, the tower in which the richest man of the city ""works."" The woman describes how men worked together to reach the heavens, but what is seemed to be left out as it applies to the story of Metropolis is the idea that God scattered men throughout the world and gave them different languages. It is a good idea that is only relevant on some aspects.Everybody says the lead actress is great, but I honestly thought she was overacting as her evil double, who is actually the machine man in her image. I mean, her ""seductive dance"" is not even that powerful - in fact, it is more so ridiculous - and is that twitching something a robot - especially what is possibly the first cyborg in film - would do? Wouldn't it be more mechanical?Overall this is still a film with great ideas, and especially great special effects, but it seems that the film is trying to handle too many stories at once, so I don't consider it a masterpiece as it is regarded to be. I personally like ""M"" better.",Metropolis
148,JaydoDre,Ahead of its time,8,17 December 2014,"When you have a silent movie from the 1927, it is tempting for a reviewer to lower the bar a little. The effects were not as good back then; there was no color; the actors seem to still be adjusting to the studio; the directors and producers did not yet have a century of experience to draw from. Let's give it a break. However, after watching Metropolis, I feel like lowering the bar is not necessarywell, mostly.The story has its good and its bad moments. It is very sci-fi adventure and has many modern elements like a person's evil double or the final physical fight between the villain and the protagonist. Watching this film, a bunch of other movies flashed before my eyes, from Blade Runner to Matrix to Judge Dredd, many of which were influenced by this film.The setting is a dystopian future, with extreme difference between the ruling and working classes. It is a theme that countless other movies would later pick and which eventually developed into the cyberpunk style. As the basis for the story, this is not a particularly exciting thme because it is the most simplistic and worn-out theme for a sci-fi movie today, exceptback in 1927 it may have been closer to reality than it is today and, I imagine, not nearly as worn out yet.Either way, the film creates interesting scenes with its story, sending the main character on an adventure through the futuristic city. The movie uses strong Christian themes, but they are modified to fit the story and the futuristic setting and work really well.In the second half of the film the story takes a few unpleasant missteps. At one point, the film decided to skip a whole scene and instead gives the viewer a title card explaining what had happened - a choice that comes out of nowhere and does not repeat itself. Did you guys shoot a scene and then lost it or what? Furthermore, believability issues arise, like during the scene when the enraged masses suddenly forget about their children being in danger. The ending also feels rushed and not very plausible. These strange story beats come across much better if you take the film as an abstract piece and its events as symbolic, but the movie does not present itself that way. Its characters are real with real motivations.The acting is interesting. The leader of the city is played by Alfred Abel and this guy is phenomenal. He does so much with just his eyes alone.But, as is typical for movies of that time, sometimes the characters overact, especially the character who plays the crazy scientist. Arms are swinging around and fingers are inventing more extreme ways to bend at the joints, which feels unnecessary.The best thing about Metropolis is probably the way it looks, and it looks great even by today's standards. It is hard to take your eyes off the art. The sense of scale is stunning. The sets are huge and the makers took full advantage of the available room, making them look even bigger than they are. The movie has special effects, half a century before the first computer effect.The fact that the film is in black and white does not even seem like a limitation. If Metropolis was released today, it would probably also be in black and white because it suits this film and its themes very well.The scale, the architecture, the way the lights reflect in the irises of the actors. This movie is must-see even if you do not care for the story. It is amazing that this was made in the Weimar Republic that had only recently come out of an economic black hole.Do some of the things look a bit artificial? Well, yes. Propeller bi-planes show up and obviously feel a bit outdated. The robot design is archaic. But even the things that look dated still fit perfectly with the artistic style of the film.As for the music, the Germans have not lost touch with their roots. Heavy tubas and big drums give an epic and heavy feel to the machine city. Sometimes, there is a distinct melody, other times the tune can get a bit generic, but it remains effective.Metropolis is a film that is truly ahead of its time. Replace some of the older props, add voices and you have yourself a modern sci-fi film. There may be some issues with the effectiveness of its story, especially in the 2nd half, but overall it was is a very interesting watch.",Metropolis
149,ladymidath,Magnificent Vision Of The Future,10,6 September 2006,"I first saw Metropolis many years ago and the effect of this movie has never left me. In fact it gave me a love and respect for German silent films that stayed with me all my life. The sweeping cityscapes, the powerful story brilliantly told, the acting that was spot on has made this movie the classic it is today. The sad thing is that we are seeing Metropolis in a butchered form. Seven reels were taken out when it premiered in The United States. Many saw the film as confusing, but that was because it was shown in such a chopped up way. In fact, Giogio Morodor tried to restore the film to it's original even using stills to flesh it out. But despite this, the movie still has a power today that it did when it first aired. Fritz Lang was a director par excellence and it shows in this. Rotwang played by Rudolf Klein Rogge set the standard for every mad scientist ever played. The wild hair, mad eyes and intense expression has been copied, but never matched. This is a movie that has set it's place in history. It has inspired such films as Blade Runner and The Matrix but it stands entirely on it's own.",Metropolis
150,faraaj-1,A prophetic vision that works on every level,10,10 November 2006,"Metropolis transcends being a work of genius to being a piece of art that inspired genius. Take for example Dr.Strangelove's gloved hand, Blade Runner's futuristic vision, 2001's uncontrollable machine that is set to destroy man, Frankstein's mad scientist and more recently Gattaca's class-divided society. The vision for all these classics partly derives from this silent German classic which was probably the most expensive made till that time. It holds the honor of being the first film on the UNESCO ""Memory of the World-Register"" list. Metropolis is stunning whether viewed as a great step in cinematic history and achievement, an inspirational sci-fi movie, an epic battle of good and evil, an expressionist masterpiece, a visual tour-de-force or a religious allegory. Unfortunately, despite great care in restoration, the best version available, in fact the only one that does justice to Fritz Lang's original vision, is the 2002 version now available on DVD. Entire chunks of the film have been lost forever and even this most complete of versions is barely 3/4ths of the original release. However, narrative text helps in bridging the gaps.A brief synopsis of the basic setting and central characters of Metropolis: The setting is a futuristic world built on several levels. The lower levels are inhabited by The Hands - workers who use their hands to run the machines. There is no joy in their lives and their depressing setting is accentuated by their dull drab clothing and a horrific sequence where the furnace turns into a monstrous idol's head and they become his sacrificial victims. This is contrasted with the higher levels, open spaces, light clothing, women of pleasure, joy and cheer and the great Tower of Babel. The Tower is home to The Brain - chiefly manifested in Joh Fredersen, an oligarch, businessman and dictator rolled into one. Joh is portrayed brilliantly by Alfred Abel - a man without compassion for the workers, who have been put where they belong! Sitting in his Tower of Babel, he does not know how to communicate with his workers or with mad scientist Rotwang. To mediate between head and heart are born two heroes of the time. There is the virginal Maria who inspires the workers to love and feel compassion. Her angelic visage is used to create a robot that can lead the workers in following Rotwang's destructive agenda. She protects and leads the children during the Great Flood. Joh's son, The Heart falls in love with Maria and is the one destined to either mediate between The Hands and The Brain or die trying.The basic themes and class struggle of Metropolis is given epic form not just by complex themes and heroes and villains. The wonderful expressionist sets - built on a grand scale give it a grandeur that few films even of the digital age can boast. The cinematography and lighting are perfect and there are moments of breath-taking beauty. My favorite is when Maria first addresses the workers - the messianic biblical overtones set a standard for future ""sword and sandal"" epics. The entire sequence where The Heart Freder gets lost in Rotwang's insane house is one of the first great horror scenes. Metropolis is above all a work of great beauty that can be viewed repeatedly to seek new meaning. Just one of many modern parallels would be the Middle Eastern City-State of Dubai with its Babel-like Ivory Towers and the teeming millions of ""remittance-workers"" who are The Hands that built that city.",Metropolis
151,Artimidor,"Finally definitive, and still pointing ahead",10,29 September 2012,"For many years the initially flopped and consequently butchered ""Metropolis"" Fritz Lang made in the mid twenties of the past century could be appreciated at least for its qualities as the indispensable science-fiction trailblazer in motion picture history. What was severely lacking from the plot however finally emerged on screen again after the famous Buenos Aires reel find which brought a quarter of what was missing from the film back from the dead. With the new painstaking 2010 restoration effort also came a grandiose symphony orchestra studio recording of the original Gottfried Huppertz score - and the results make movie buffs prone to be blown away, and this time for real.The technical brilliance and visual lavishness of Fritz Lang's oeuvre was always undisputed already at its time and only matched by fellow German Murnau's ingenious approaches on film-making. There's so much and dense imagery that generations of future filmmakers would draw from this newly emerging archetype. Among the unforgettable scenes are the giant heart machine which turns into a moloch in one of the hero's visions, the Babel tower teeming with utopian life, the enormous sets, elevators and masses and masses of enslaved and rebellious people, the staggering creation of the first robot, all set against the dominant dichotomy between - literally - those living above and those dying below. There are echoes of communism here, of nazi ideology, of the dangers and abysses of industrialization, technology, and there are also glimpses of humanity. Not perfect in all its components, the film nevertheless has everything pioneering in it - and more. Fritz Lang, while having some reservations himself referred to the picture as a ""signpost for new destinations"", and that's exactly what it became now that we can look at the great sci-fi pictures of the past century. In them and through them ""Metropolis"" still lives, and once we revisit the original again we might yet be surprised that it, miraculously, still points ahead.",Metropolis
152,colinrgeorge,"""The (Nearly) Complete Metropolis""",8,29 July 2010,"Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" was the first film I ever rented from Netflix. The (then) two-hour German expressionist science fiction masterpiece carried an immediate appeal for me I know not many will share. Nevertheless, I was excited at the prospect of seeing the film again, and on the big screen this summer, now 'complete' with 25 minutes of newly integrated footage uncovered in Buenos Aires in 2008.Other than that the experience was marred by a crummy digital projection, the new cut of the film is nothing short of revelatory for fans and cinephiles. The restored scenes, which were cut in 1927 following early criticism, expand the scope and breadth of the narrative, rounding out a much more human film.It's a shame so little could be done to spruce up the supplemental material. I was initially put off by just how starkly it contrasted with the clean, relatively well-preserved 35mm whole; the 16mm additions are matted along the top and left of the frame, and are so scratched that the scenes appear to exist amidst an omnipresent rainstorm. But bad as they look, their benefit to the film is undeniable. My only real objection to their inclusion is in two to three second insert or reaction shots, where splicing in the new content seems more distracting than it is productive. Largely, however, the aesthetic unpleasantries are worth the emotional payoff of a more satisfying story.The other issue is that ""Metropolis"" was already a long film, and one that isn't always easy to appreciate in a modern context. Fortunately, its narrative backbone is a simple but timeless 'workers vs. social elite' fable, and the sincere, if unchallenging, plot makes plenty of room for contemplation. It's easy to just slip into Lang's world, and though the pacing and running-time hardly render it accessible, what's really incredible about the film is how well its visuals still hold up.The towering, angular cityscapes, oppressive walls of machinery, and the now iconic ""machine man"" are stylistic triumphs that look great today and have had obvious influence on more recent science fiction/fantasy classics, from the dark metropolis of Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" to character design for ""Star Wars."" The fact that it was even possible in 1927 is as incredible as Kubrick's half-centennial ""Space Odyssey"" was for 1968. Maybe more so.It's rare and awesome that a piece of art is as ahead of its time as ""2001"" or ""Metropolis"" were. Fritz Lang's film may not be a 2010 audience-pleaser, but in its flawless realization of its world, it's every bit on par with something like ""Inception."" Lang's vision of the future is in many ways still our own, which helps account for its long shelf life. The forward-thinking design and fantastic visuals make it easy to forget that it saw release twenty years before Isaac Asimov published his compilation, ""I, Robot.""""The Complete Metropolis,"" though not completely complete, is absolutely the best way to see the film. Despite the fact that certain scenes are still (and likely always will be) missing, this is the closest its come to a definitive version. Those with a vested interest in the history of film, particularly science-fiction film, absolutely need to seek it out if they haven't already —The new cut is even worth reanalysis for those underwhelmed by the previously available version. It's a real treasure, however, for longtime fans, who'll be glad to hear the 25 extra minutes, while not pretty, substantially benefit the story. For the first time, ""Metropolis"" really breathes.However, if my unfortunate theater presentation has taught me anything, it's that Kino's home video release later this year will be the real attraction. I'll be picking up the blu-ray come November, no rental required.",Metropolis
153,ctowyi,a time-bending experience in which Lang's 1927 and my 2016 became one time and one place.,10,14 January 2016,"36000 extras, 200000 costumes, over 500 70-storey miniature skyscrapers - Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Filming took place in 1925 at a cost of approximately 5 million Reichsmarks, making it the most expensive film ever made up to that point. However it opened in 1927 to mixed reactions and barely made 75000 Reichsmarks. Because of its long running-time of over 150 minutes and the inclusion of footage which censors found questionable, Metropolis was butchered substantially after its German premiere, and large portions of the film went missing over the subsequent decades. In 2008 a damaged print of Lang's original cut of the film was found in a museum in Argentina. After a long restoration process, the film was 95% restored. Even though I considered myself a modest cinephile, I seldom venture out of my comfort zone of contemporary films. I blame this on one night at the uni when I was ""treated"" to a silent film - Sergei Eisenstein's Strike (1925). The movie was fine but there was no soundtrack to speak of and it was a torture to watch without even music. Since then I stayed away from films of the Silent Era; that is until Metropolis. Without even watching the film, some of the images have become iconic and have seared into my consciousness. So feeling adventurous I put in the blu-ray and OMG time came to a standstill. This is most definitely a sci-fi masterpiece on so many levels, misunderstood in its time, but revered in modern times. You can immediately see how Metropolis' dystopian cityscape as curtains has influenced countless films like Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982) and Luc Besson's The Fifth Element (1997). I can even see MTV videos belonging to Madonna and Lady Gaga borrowing cinematic elements from Metropolis unabashedly. Even ""carved in stone"" looks and mannerisms of mad scientist-villain complete with crazy laboratory has its birthplace here. The magnificent set-designs are unheard of in its time. Each miniature vehicle is moved a millimeter at a time and a single shot taken. Purportedly, 8 days of work for 10 seconds of film! I love ogling at the Avantgarde architecture. Each building structure tells a different story. Tell me you don't see Blade Runner in this.I will dispense with a detailed synopsis which you can easily glean from elsewhere. The story in a nutshell is set in a futuristic dystopian city where there exist two classes of people - the pampered citizens who live on the surface in luxury and the worker slaves of the underground who live to work and work to live. Along will come a lady named Maria and a love-smitten young man named Freder who will be the eventual bridge of reconciliation between these two disparate races. There are some weird and absurd transitions between scenes and by today's standards one would cry mawkish and maudlin in an instance. But I couldn't be bothered because the visuals are breathtakingly amazing. I could easily harken back to 1927 and I knew I was seeing all these stupendous visual effects and cinematic flair for the first time. It's kind of like sitting in the cinema in 1977 watching Star Wars: A New Hope. One can hardly get to feel that awe-inspiring feeling nowadays when the super-computers are capable of doing anything on the big screen. With Metropolis I was seeing the birthplace of the visionary future city, the humongous crowd pandemonium scenes, the robot (which inspired the look of C3-PO), the destruction of cities, the magnificent flooding, the visual telephonic machines (now you know where they came from), and so on. Several times I had to stop and ponder how the heck did Fritz Lang shoot the scenes (the only time I did that in the whole of 2015 was Mad Max: Fury Road) of puny human beings encompassed within gigantic monolithic structures, like did Lang actually build high walls just to create that running scene. Later I discovered that this unique visual effect was the work of Eugene Schufftan. He created what is known as the Schufftan process whereby human actors can be in the same frame with a miniature, a technique that was most recently used by Peter Jackson in his Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies. These days most filmmakers use green screen composite shots for that, but what Schufftan has achieved is nothing short of stunning. There are also a few noteworthy cinematographic sequences that caught me in a state of jaw-dropping wow. For example, the chase scene involving the mad scientist chasing Maria through the catacombs, and shafts of light worked like knives stabbing at the poor damsel. I love Metropolis's huge ambition. Lang wasn't content with just a Good versus Evil story, he was creating a visual world so striking that you will be lost in the themes of love, Messianic revelation, dubious democracy and the corruption of Science and industry if one is not careful. The strong religious overtones and political allegory pulsate with authority as actors go through Kabuki theatrical poses. This is a masterpiece that has been so influential for generations of film narratives and in creating a bleak futuristic city. I highly recommend the blu-ray (the 50-minute documentary within it is also a must-watch). Be awashed by the original 1927 score by Gottfried Huppertz, performed by the Rundfunk Symphony Orchestra, Berlin and presented in DTS-HD MA 5.1. Simply ravishing and marvelous. Watching Metropolis feels like a time-bending experience in which Lang's 1927 and my 2016 became one time and one place.",Metropolis
154,kurosawakira,Ultramodern,7,13 March 2013,"Luis Buñuel saw Lang's ""Metropolis"" (1927) as not one but two different films with deeply different spiritual needs: the story is overt romanticism, yet the images are full of great power. This has become a kind of critical paradigm that I tend to side with.I would prefer Lang's ""Die Nibelungen"" (released in two parts, ""Sigfried"" and ""Kriemhilds Rache"", in 1924) if I had to select an an ultra-epic from his filmography, but this is a great ride, nevertheless. It's ultramodern, as well, in its manipulativeness and sense of scope and destruction (very much like the ""modern"" blockbuster), and best works for me if I let the story to fade into the background (which doesn't make that much sense as a story, but makes all the sense in the world as a film) and let the stream of images wash over me.This might sound arrogant, but the story feels just too heavy-handed for me. I think I understand its implications as a modern-day allegory of modern times as a kind of Orwellian counter-reality, but it takes itself so seriously – as any epic will, mind you – it's difficult to make amends with. I don't see it as science fiction, instead as a continuation of the high fantasy of ""Die Nibelungen"" into the modern day, a kind of societal prophecy for their time and place. It's because of this gravitas that the film is so full juxtaposition between cultural heritage and religion and nationalistic idealism, and it's this gravitas that lends the film its rather clumsy narrative, but on the other hand it's this gravitas that lends such potency to the imagery.Whenever I'll revisit the film I'll have to see it with Chaplin's brilliant ""Modern Times"" (1935) that refers to it in divers ways and speaks of the same things. It's rather heavy for Chaplin, but still rather obviously lighter in tone than this.",Metropolis
155,Come-and-Review,Both visionary and outdated,8,28 December 2015,"Metropolis is an example of a movie that feels being both really modern because of various things we'll analyze in the review, and both outdated because certain things are depicted with a mentality of the 20s.First off, the good things. The story is really good, works well even today in 2015, also to appreciate is the huge amount of biblical references. They definitely nailed quite a few things that today work similarly to how depicted in the movie. Depiction of modern day traffic, the various visual effects and such were outstanding for a movie from 1927. Another thing to praise is the cut. Whoever cut the scene orders, with the various parallels and setting changes did a really good job.What instead seems outdated is the acting, and the movements. If this movie was made nowadays, there would not be that much of exaggeration done by the different actors as it was in the original film. Despite that, Rotwang and Fred.'s Father did a great performance, they certainly were the most believable characters in the film. Also, the message's displaying sounds bad with a 2015 mind. It just seems soo banalised the way it was told in the beginning, end and middle of the film. If it wasn't displayed at all, it would've been many times better. 76/100",Metropolis
156,mgruebel,"So 20s, and yet so avant-garde",8,19 October 2015,"It is only fitting that the Murnau Memorial Foundation restored Fritz Lang's early opus ""Metropolis."" Murnau, who brought us ""Nosferatu,"" and Lang were the two directors of the bizarre of Austrian/German cinema of the 20s.The story by Thea von Harbou is pretty simple: Boy meets girl. Dad takes girl from boy by replacing her by evil android. Mad android creator dies, dad sees error of his ways, boy gets girl.Woven around this is a spectacle on many levels. First, an indictment of the industrial age and mechanization. This has been mistaken as pro-communist, but nothing could be further from that. The workers who slave in the belly of Metropolis, feeding the Heart Machine with their sweat and sometimes lives, rebel against the machines. Not against the idea that there are brains that command and hands that make and do. So the society of Metropolis is more a reformed socialist system at the end, where people understand they ave different abilities and tasks, but have also learned that you can't do it by cold logic alone.Second, we have the religious undertones. Lang's father was Catholic I believe, and his mother a converted Jew. The religious ambiguity from his childhood surfaces (or sometimes is underground) everywhere in this film. The machines, and the mayor of Metropolis who controls them, are cast in the light of paganism: City Hall is The Tower of Babel 2, and the Great Heart Machine that powers Metropolis is likened to Moloch, the Bottomless Pit, in a vision the young hero and son of the mayor has once he investigates the dark underbelly of his fair city. There our hero meets Maria, as she preaches peaceful mediation between workers and management among crosses in the catacombs of the city. A catholic image of the peaceful and beautiful virgin coveted by our hero. Pentacles, a Jewish symbolism, abound in the mansion of the inventor Rotwang, whose girlfriend was absconded by the mayor and died giving birth to our hero. He creates the woman-machine that impersonates Maria and incited the workers to rise against the machines.Third is an indictment of the ""who cares, let it go to hell"" 20s so aptly depicted in F. Scott Fitzgerald's book, and also present in Germany. Except in Germany, hyperinflation, major joblessness (even before it hit the US in 1929) added a lot more bitterness to the elites living it up in the Weimar Republic. A Chinese Theater, with the ""top 100"" men of Metropolis watching a lascivious Maria-robot, is the playground for that part of the film.Finally, there is the visionary science fiction. A city with glass walkways connecting building, air traffic between the gigantic skyscrapers, trains in tubes, electric carts in factories, ominous machinery in the dark. All this has been copied over and over, from Coruscant in the ""Star Wars"" epic, to ""The Fifth Element,"" and many more. Rotwang finds it easy to clone a body in his lab, using some pretty amazing optical effects (1929!). Terry Gilliam is fond of humans as parts of machinery, and has been copied by films like ""Snowpiercer,"" or ""Star Trek: First Contact,"" but Metropolis is the first serious long film that uses the ""humans as part of machinery"" meme. Think of the worker who has to adjust two dials to turn off seemingly random lights on a giant clock to keep things running: a feedback circuit that the master inventors could not fully automate yet, and thus required a human part. And of course there is the human-machine that resembles Maria, as far as I know the first feature film android created by scientific means by humans as an intelligent machine.The film, being silent, is acted more like theater. Indeed, Lang has ""Preludes"" and ""Intermezzos"" grouping the film into acts. The theatrical acting is necessary in silent film, where meaning has to be sometimes made painfully obvious to the viewer without dialog. Think of the faces of The Tramp in Chaplin's opus ""Modern Times,"" a film that targets a similar theme, but remains more personally focused on its lone hero. In Metropolis, my favorite is the use of asymmetry to indicate evil. While Maria's face is always symmetrical, the evil android copy droops her left eyelid whenever she incites evil, and instant signature that allows the viewer to distinguish the good twin from the bad.It's a grand spectacle in many ways. Even the restored version will be hard to watch by youngsters used to CGI special effects (as opposed to ""Doppelbelichtung""), wooden acting (as opposed to vaudeville overacting), although in the end the story is as simplistic as much modern moralistic SF, and thus a precursor of the genre in every respect. 8/10.",Metropolis
157,dkncd,Notable early science-fiction film,8,24 November 2007,"""Metropolis"" is Fritz Lang's early entry into the science-fiction genre. For me the premise recalls H.G. Wells' novel ""The Time Machine"", where the division between managers and laborers has become so strong that the laborers are sent to live underground. The dystopian city setting is a forerunner to similar settings in films such as ""Blade Runner"" (1982). The visuals are certainly impressive and an amazing achievement for a 1927 film.The actors wear far too much makeup and the acting is especially blunt at points, but overall the performances are decent and the characterizations interesting. Particularly of note is Brigitte Helm in her dual role as Maria and the ""Robot"". She is a convincing advocate for peace and it was effective how she used facial expressions to make the distinction between her two characters.The distinctions between managers and laborers are well-developed. Depictions of downtrodden workers marching in unison were becoming to show the sharp distinctions between the classes of Metropolis. In the first half of the movie the story and characterizations are well-developed and interesting, but the second half was not as consistent. The latter half has a solid story and notable scenes, but a number of the scenes linger too long, such as the catacomb chase. Many write that restoring more footage to this film would make it better, but for me judicious editing in the later portions of the film would be more beneficial. None the less, ""Metropolis"" is a notable early entry into the science-fiction film genre.",Metropolis
158,EddyTheMartian007,"Fritz Lang's unforgettable, though flawed, achievement.",7,18 October 2020,"(2010 Restoration at 24 FPS) One of the most influential films of all time. The sets, scale, and effects are truly impressive and the movie still looks great today. The Sci-Fi elements used are fascinating, and it's certainly understandable why similar Sci-Fi elements are used to this day. I still don't know how they pulled it off in 1927. It has some relevant themes about class conflict still used almost a century later, though executed in a flawed manner. The problem is the rich and the poor are shown to be almost equal, only needing a mediator to seemingly fix everything (though how they work together at the end is left ambiguous). It's as black and white as the movie itself, the rich are using the poor as slaves to power their machines, a simple agreement doesn't seem feasible the way it was portrayed. On top of that, It feels disingenuous that a revolt wasn't something from within the people, but a scheme by a villain. The way the entire storyline is presented is quite simplistic for today's standards, though it is forgivable as it was revolutionary at the time despite initial mixed reactions. The acting is hard to judge as sometimes it was hard to take seriously with the over acting from most actors (apart from Brigitte Helm, who totally sells it), though obviously a product of its time. The movie also feels too long, like it could've easily been shortened with a faster pace. It definitely deserves praise for its visuals, and influence, but the movie is quite flawed having some pretty shallow characters, an underdeveloped romance, weird character decisions, and even plot holes, like how certain characters get to places. Yet despite its problems this movie remains mesmerizing, and entertaining almost a century later. Fritz Lang has definitely crafted an unforgettable achievement.(6.9/10)",Metropolis

""Metropolis"" is an all time classic which induces creative imagery and a dehumanizing montage of robotics into an eerie genre of sensationalism!! This dismal drama is accompanied with lingering classical music theatrics!! The finalization with what we associate with the effervescence of the human spirit has assertively besieged all of society, and heartfelt emotions have become reduced to the precarious improvements of biological progress!! This German film which was made in 1927, perpetuated the trepidations of many people who feared the social pitfalls of mankind!! On the horizon for Germany, was the ubiquitous monster of triple digit inflation, hence, it would stand to reason that they would just engage in a pejorative dissertation concerning the total demise of man's world altogether.. Start with the fact, that in this computerized citadel of negative Utopia, the prevailing moral debasement which afflicted everyone, merely compounded man's insatiable lust!! The perplexities of day to day living evoked a desensitizing callousness with Homo Sapien interaction!! Such cynical speculation delves into a rudimentary exploitation of fear, this is so often times an effective tool for preying on the skepticism of human nature!! I thought this film had a particularly astute message concerning the demise of the individual's resolve and resilience!! ""Metropolis"" was a major indictment of our yearning as a society to unabashedly categorize individuals, stigmatize them, and label them as uniform vermin meat!! This disconcerting generalization of the human race ultimately makes the population very uncivilized!! As a result, all of them would functionally cease and desist as people, and become nothing significantly more than generic chattel!! It is man's greatest fear that women will seek vengeance on man, because women perceive men to be the creatures who relegated them to the plight of submissive automatons!! So what if the shoe were put on the other foot? This would be an in-veritable misogynist's's nightmare!! This movie is an utterly scathing jeremiad against our society's hegemony!! I felt that ""Metroplois"" was very well made, and it was WAY!! ahead of it's time!! Given that this film was made in 1927, the cinematography was spectacular!!

Timeless - I don't think it would be possible for this film to become dated, it deals with issues that humanity has had to focus on since the beginnings of history.This film cost 5 million marks to make and flopped financially simply because the American market thought silent films were passe. This film is NOT passe. The cinematography is astounding, and the set design is simply unparalleled. Even by today's standards I'm hard pressed to think of a film that looks as impressive considering the technology they had available in 1925, when this was made.The 2 hour run time for a silent film gets a bit slow at times, but I blame that on my impatience as a contemporary film watcher. The sad truth is that society today just can't appreciate slower films as much any more, and I'm at times no exception. That aside, I was never bored, and when this film started cooking, it was *cooking*!This film is the quintessential science fiction film, the film that everything from Frankenstein to Blade Runner borrowed from. It has many firsts, and quite a few of them will never be repeated. Fritz Lang's genius shines through here, solidly placing him on the pedestal next to Mirnau and Fassbinder in the elite of German film-making.What more can I say? Everyone should see this film, if not for the pioneering aspect, then simply because it's a beautiful film from beginning to end.

164,spacemonkey_fg,A classic for years to come! Visually Stunning,10,31 January 2006,"Title: Metropolis (1927Director: Friz Lang Cast: Alfred Abel, Gustav Fröhlich, Brigitte Helm, Rudolf Klein-Rogge, Fritz Rasp, Theodor LoosReview: The era of silent German expresionism films ushered in a lot of horror/sci fi/fantasy movie. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Faust, Destiny, Nosferatu and Metropolis are just some of the most commonly known examples of this time. As I continue to discover films of this era, I continue to be blown away by the imagination and hard work that went into making these films in a time of limited technology.Metropolis takes place in 2026, the future. The people who live in the city of Metropolis are devided into two different groups. The poor who live in the underground catacombs and the rich who live in the ultramodern facilities above ground. The owner of the city called Joh Fredersen is in charge of the whole city. When his son decides to wonder to the depth of the city in search of his newest love interest...he discovers the horrendous conditions under which the working class work and live, and he soon decides that he will help the thinkers above ground and the workers below to unite as one.The movie has a very idealistic storyline that some people are not to fond of. For me, I thought it was great because I thought that maybe to us right now the story might not seem to relevant (though I'm sure some people will relate to it) but to the people living in the era of the great depression, with many people being jobless and hungry, well, I'm sure the themes touched upon in this flick were very very relevant in those days.Thing is maybe todays working class don't suffer as much as they did in the past, but I'm sure to some degree people who work in a factory or in an office will find a degree of interest in these themes. Same themes were touched upon in Charlie Chaplins Modern Times which I think is the only other movie that can be compared to Metropolis in terms of themes.Also the film is filled with many religious allegories. The girl called Maria, The son of the owner of Metropolis acts as a mediator between the rich and the poor sort of like a Jesus Christ figure. There's many more religious references all through out the film, so be on the look out for that.Anyhows, enough about themes and story...lets get to one of the best things about this movie. Its visual flare! I was truly amazed to see the level of detail that Friz Lang and his crew achieved with this movie. Towering skyscrapers in a city filled with lights and extravagant arquitecture. Gigantic sets depicting humongous machines twisting and turning, it all blew my mind. One of the machines the workers labor on..""The Moloch Machine"", wow, it just has to be seen to be believed. The sets and visual effects on this movie were some of the best for its time, and still look amazing to this day.The iconic ""Machine Man"" that the Rotwang the scientist creates in the film, is the grand daddy of C-3PO and The Terminators exo-skeleton or any other robot on any film. The sequences in which they are putting skin on the robot look amazing from a special effects point of view, specially considering that this movie was made 80 years ago! There's many visual delights that await whoever sees this movie. I know I was blown away when I saw the evil Maria doing some erotic dancing over at Rotwangs place. Its just visual eye candy. And speaking of the character Maria, I think that the actress who portrayed Maria (Brigitte Helm) really showed she could do her thing. Her facial expressions and contorted body gestures when she was evil really sold me on her. Plus her scenes dancing in the nightclub were really something.Of course there's some getting used to while seeing a silent film. I got used to filling in the blanks as they spoke in my mind. This helped me a great deal to follow the story. Also every single body expression and facial movement counts, so don't take your eyes off the actors.The movie is long, its original running time was well more then two hours long. But right now since 25% of the film is considered completely lost, well, this is the most complete version of the film available. (The KINO version) It clocks in at two hours. The visual clarity is superb. They really did an incredible job in digitally restoring this film. I'm sure that this is the best treatment that this film is going to get, so if your a fan of German Expressionism, and you like your movies to look pristine and not like they were picked up from the bottom of a rusty garbage can, then this is the version to get.So if you want to see what a true sci-fi masterpiece looks like, a true visual tour de force, and one of the most important German Expressionism films ever made, then look no further then Friz Langs Metropolis.Rating: 5 out of 5",Metropolis
165,Kubris,Fritz Lang wins science fiction,9,28 February 2012,"IMDb Top 250: 94It's difficult to glow about a silent film because no matter what anyone says about them, they are outdated. That being said Metropolis is an absolute gem, a masterpiece of the era, and in my opinion the best silent film ever made.Everything ties together really tightly. The plot, genre and themes go hand in hand and it's hard to break discuss them separately without touching on the other aspects. I'll start with the plot- it's genius. In a society where the rich live in luxury and the poor are their slaves, the son of the mastermind falls in love with a worker and drama ensures, centering around the idea that the two classes must be united. There's more to it than that but that summary tells you enough. While great in concept, the film isn't as strong in execution. The first half is really drawn out, and after a very serious opening the film slows dramatically. However, about midway as the Machine Man is taking its human appearance, there seems to be a dramatic change, and from then to the end is a near perfect film. The film gets tighter and tenser right to the end, with a great big finale. There are three acts, and the last one, 'Furioso' is some of the best film ever, silent or not.Now onto genre: sci-fi. By spending 5 minutes on the Internet you can see that everyone glows about how Metropolis is 'the greatest sci-fi ever'. As I said in my summary, Lang wins the sci-fi guessing game. His 2000 is incredibly close to what actually happened, his vision is what we live in now, and today we have even more. And this was all thought up in 1927! It's a very fair statement to call this the father of science fiction films. The city has planes, highways and skyscrapers. There are even small things you may not notice because of how common they are today, living in Lang's envisioned utopia, like picture phones. I totally missed that.But a great concept needs to look convincing, and for what was available Metropolis is really believable. The sets are grand, the buildings very realistic. It looks like a real city! There are effects that seem inexplicable. One really cool part involves flooding and destruction, and with a mix of models, grand sets and movie magic, it's scarily plausible.Metropolis is more than a futuristic story: it carries some heavy messages, relevant then and still today. Lang said the message was to unite Communist and Socialist movements in Germany at the time, through the metaphor of the societies. (This justifies the ending, because showing what happened after the action wasn't important). That message can be carried to modern... everything. There has to be a middle, or at least communication between those who think and those who do. It can even be applied to the film industry. Most films can be understood by the masses, but this isn't one. It's layered and symbolic, and I can't explain some of the symbols like Death and the Seven Sins,with the book. A point of discussion is Lang's handling of each class. With the message of unity, he couldn't let the workers be totally oppressed and the rich being tyrants. So a compromise seemed to have been made: it can be assumed that the rich are ignorant to the workers' plight, and the workers have a mob mentality: their emotions overrule common sense, shown by their restless action and the leaving of their children- something the surface dwellers wouldn't do. Lang's point must've been that despite a joined society being important. neither side was especially favourable. It's amazing how this is all under the facade of a sci-fi film.I don't believe in overacting in silent films, because emotions need to be conveyed without sound. With this belief, Freder is played exceptionally well: being subtle is not in his repertoire. He is smitten by love and torn by the discovery of the rift in society. He jumps from extreme to extreme, and has really strange dreams. What is Moloch? Maria is the star though- on one hand she is wholesome and peaceful, but also plays a sensual and chaotic being. She's shockingly diverse, and delivers the most nudity I've seen in a silent film. Joh is good, but not as fleshed out as could be. A few answers about his character could've made the film even more morally grey. Rothway is really creepy.Here's something I learned from the IMDb: The Nazi party loved this film so much, Hitler included, that Fritz Lang, a Jewish man, was given a 'pass' when they gained power, and fled to America. A different source had Lang meeting Joseph Goebbels, who was impressed by Metropolis, and offered Lang a job, but Lang escaped anyway. I just found this fascinating.Time has been good to Metropolis; today you can see a remarkably high quality version, nearly in its original form. This is a deserving treatment for one of the most important and influential films ever. Echoes of Metropolis can be seen everywhere, even in something like Fight Club. Here is a perfect mash of artistic, technical and creativity that will have an exceptionally rewarding second viewing to try and piece together the recurring elements. With its brilliant predictions, concept and messages, Metropolis is a must see silent film. 9.0/10",Metropolis

170,dharmendrasingh,Restored but still not refulgent,6,18 November 2010,"There are some films you are forbidden to dislike. Films which, if you're caught denouncing them, afford you pariah status. Fritz Lang's silent masterpiece, 'Metropolis' is undoubtedly one of these.Set in an industrialised dystopia, characters are either submissive workers, who ensure the constant operation of the city's ubiquitous machines, or are one of the elite supervisors, headed by the despotic Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel).Joh's son Freder (Gustav Fröhlich) falls for the revolutionary rhetoric of one of the workers, Maria (the ethereal Brigette Helm), and volunteers himself as the mediator who will unite the city's two classes by way of, well, mediation. Meanwhile, a zany inventor, Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) convinces Joh that he has created the 'Maschinenmensch' (Machine-Man) as the ideal replacement for 'flawed' humans.Not realising Rotwang's Machiavellian motives, Joh endorses the creation (a precursor to Star Wars' C-3PO), and adds that it should have Maria's face to 'sow discord', i.e. incite libidinous passion, in those it encounters. The Machine-Man causes the destruction of the city but is exposed as Maria's clone, and an armistice between Joh and the workers is realised.A wonderful job has been done of adding missing footage to the existing version, with the result being a much more cogent narrative. And, at around 150 minutes, this is as close to the original 1927 version as we're ever likely to get – thanks to an Argentinean film museum's inheritance of an original print following years of pass-the-parcel between distributors and private collectors.So, why the mediocre rating? Two things: characters' insufferable gesticulation, and the question of which Friday night to sacrifice to contend with its cacophonous score and two-and-half-hours of pessimism. The irony is that many people think this near-full version could easily be truncated.Of course, I do acknowledge its enduring visceral power and appreciate its obvious influence on world cinema. Perhaps it's just that in German Expressionism I've discovered my bete noire, and as such must be considered a pariah. So be it.There is one fantastic anachronism, however: the protagonist is female! And German! And from the 1920s! The statement makes a mockery of today's supposedly egalitarian age, in which female actors are in a state of limbo about their role in cinema.If you do get to see this epoch-making film – and if you're a serious film fan you shouldn't still be thinking about it – don't be put off by what will seem as primitive effects.

171,Cyke,Movie Odyssey Review #018: Metropolis,9,6 August 2006,"018: Metropolis (1927) - released 1/10/1927, viewed 8/15/05.A hurricane kills 650 in Cuba. Serial killer Earle Nelson, the Gorilla Man, is on the loose. The NBC radio network opens with 24 stations. Mt. Vesuvius erupts. Agatha Christie disappears from her home, turning up in a hotel 11 days later apparently with partial amnesia. The first transatlantic telephone call is made, from New York to London.BIRTHS: Chuck Berry, Richard Crenna, Johnnie Ray. DEATHS: Harry Houdini.KEVIN: Okay, we've seen Lubitsch and we've seen Murnau, now it's time for the one and only Fritz Lang. This movie was very cool. The creators were really breaking new ground with the look of this film. I really liked Brigitte Helm's performance both as Maria and in her over-the-top turn as the evil Machine. I was extremely impressed with the visual effects, mostly regarding the Machine. I've seen films made in the '50s with crappier effects than in this film. One of the more regrettable things about this film were the missing scenes. I tried really hard to visualize the lost scenes based on the descriptions given. I hope one day they recover the missing footage.DOUG: In Germany in early '27, Austrian filmmaker extraordinaire Fritz Lang released his silent science fiction extravaganza Metropolis. This is a film that I'd really been looking forward to. It's tragic that a quarter of this movie is lost; those text cards describing the missing scenes during the movie sounded exciting. I must say, I was impressed, although a little confused at times. The plot is kind of weird and confusing. Metropolis was the most expensive silent film of its day, and looks it. There's a lot of special effects, groundbreaking at the time, including futuristic cityscapes (probably matte paintings), visual overlays (done the old-fashioned way), and of course the famous ""machine man"" played in human form by Brigitte Helm. Helm does an excellent job of playing the evil robot lady and the good-hearted Maria; you can tell instantly who she is just by the way her head is cocked. Rudolph Klein-Rogge pretty much steals the show as the demented scientist Rotwang. I didn't quite get how the movie illustrated its theme/tagline about hands/brain/heart. All the extravagant effects and sets kind of distract from it.Last film: Faust (1926). Next film viewed: The General (1927). Next film chronologically: The Kid Brother (1927).The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive, chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible, starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through, year by year, one film at a time. We also write a short review for each and every film.

174,Qanqor,One of the best awful films I've ever seen,5,24 October 2009,"It's easy to see why this film is considered a classic. Even most of a century later, the visuals are stunning and the special effects impressive. I'm not usually overly impressed by such things, but what everyone says is true, it really is a feast for the eyes. And it was a landmark film, extremely influential.And as long as I'm pointing out the good things, let me say that I also thought the original score was excellent. And while, as many have pointed out, the pacing is painfully slow through most of the film, I will say that, towards the end, when the plot is climaxing, the story really picks up the pace and actually becomes rather exciting.But it's still an awful movie.The plot is stupid, contorted, and contrived. The characters stock, insipid, or cardboard. The themes are an unsavory amalgam of socialism, ludditism, and religion, three things I detest. The society portrayed makes no sense. Perhaps my favorite pet dumbism is the stupid machine that Our Hero takes over, which looks like a giant clock, where he has to keep swinging the arms to align with ever-changing blinking lights, a task which manages to nearly overwhelm two different men during one 10-hour shift with its excessive physical demands. Yet, this crucial Super Future High-tech device from this Super Future High-tech society that's causing incalculable suffering to the poor, downtrodden workers... took me all of 2 minutes to figure out how to automate, using technology entirely available in 1927 when they made the film. There's just no good reason for people to be tortured spinning big, heavy dials, when simple electo-magnets would get the job done cheaply, easily, safely, and vastly more reliably. But as someone else pointed out, the machinery all appears to have been designed to torture the workers rather than do anything useful.And all of this, to put forward the imbecilic message of the film, with which we are bludgeoned with all the subtlety of brass knuckles: ""THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS MUST BE THE HEART!"" I couldn't possibly agree less. And by the way, neither could Fritz Lang, when he later had time to reflect on it.I regularly rail at modern films that I consider ""special effects in search of a movie"". Someone else here quite accurately pointed out that that criticism is not the private property of the modern film, and rightly applies to Metropolis as well. I have to agree wholeheartedly.",Metropolis

Metropolis has a spectacular use of miniatures, impressive sets and special effects for its time. The original music score (in a new recording by KINO) is one of the best I've heard, fitting every mood. The complete story is interesting with its focus on class, the danger of oppression and anarchy. This complete version now has a back story which explains many of the motivations of the characters. There is also plenty of interesting symbolism in Metropolis including from the Bible and about the structure of society. * But while the restoration of the movie has taken a tremendous leap forward, the new footage has only been partially restored. So, some sections have lots of lines from scratches. It is still watchable though. Hopefully more money will eventually be found to digitally improve the new images.

181,commandercool88,Legendary and Influential 80 Years Later,9,27 July 2008,"To sum up 'Metropolis' in the best way I know how, it was years ahead of its time. A visually stunning film with a haunting vision of the future, Fritz Lang's silent masterpiece is still a fascinating and thought-provoking motion picture more than 80 years after its release. It is when those faced with the limitations of cinema did the best creative minds emerge, and Lang was certainly able to channel German Expressionism to create a beautiful and expertly crafted work of art.Released in 1926 and set 100 years in the future, 'Metropolis' paints a dark picture where the privileged live above ground in a bustling city filled with gorgeous skyscrapers. But it is those who helped build the city and continue to operate it who live in an underground city absent of the wealth and abundant extravagance. A cataclysmic revolution threatens when a young man, son of the city's leader, ventures below ground in search of a woman and instead witnesses the oppression that smothers the workers.'Metropolis' warns us of a society where science and technology becomes the reigning rule of thumb, when the distinctions between man and machine are practically indistinguishable. A cautionary tale we've heard many times before, but perhaps never with such compelling originality and emotional impact. A machine that systematically devours its overworked and exhausted crew, a powerful retelling of Babel, an angry mob that put's the city's future at stake. Profound moments in an influential and mesmerizing film, 'Metropolis' intoxicates the imagination and makes for a viewing experience like none other.In an age without CGI and green screens, you'd be amazed by all that 'Metropolis' is able to accomplish with simple tricks of the camera and a little artistic flair. Outdated by today's standards, but truly evocative and breathtaking. And with the recent discovery of missing footage (more than an hour's footage was lost, making 'Metropolis' unfortunately fragmented), the world will soon have the chance to see Lang's completed masterwork for the first time since its original release. But as it stands, it's difficult to deny the influence 'Metropolis' has had on film today.

Its a shame that several parts have been lost, but the newest restoration is still very coherent.The special effects and set designs are the most obvious strength. They are still impressive today. There is not a single moment of unconvincing or misplaced special effects. Many of the scenes left me in awe. The city models are incredible: huge skyscrapers, a complex network of streets, grueling machinery. Everything was well thought out. To imagine that these designs were conceived 80 years ago and remain realistic is mind blowing.I also found the characters to be a strong point. Each one had a distinct personality and beliefs. Freder makes a good hero, Rotwang makes a good villain, Joh Frederson makes a believable city head, and Maria is a perfect woman. I grew attached to each of the characters, even the minor ones.The plot is also strong, even though the message seems disconnected from today's society. It still has a timeless theme that should be remembered. The story has many twists and turns, but manages to develop smoothly.Metropolis is the ultimate silent science fiction movie.

185,tjgoalie13,One of the Most Important Films Ever Made,9,22 October 2015,"In 1927, during one of the harshest times in recent history, German Expressionist director Fritz Lang made Metropolis. Metropolis is one of the most historically important films ever made, because it was an artistic German Expressionist masterpiece, that boldly challenged the Nazi Party, and still has a massive impact on cinema today. It was an angry film pointed at its geographical time and place, but it also offered some major positives for the industry. Lang used several techniques that have become recognized as key elements of German Expressionism, most noticeably lighting. A good example of this was the scene that introduces Maria for the first time, multiple times contrasting lighting techniques were used to highlight particular characters. This technique gave Maria an angelic look, when she spoke, as well as highlighting the reactions of particular characters. Another element of German expressionism was. These lighting techniques were also used often with the presence of the character Rotwang, with this character various lighting techniques were used to make his rooms darker, and give Rotwang large shadows. Just by lighting techniques Lang told the audience how to feel about certain characters, something many filmmakers have since copied. These lighting techniques are great examples of German Expressionism, but they also help shape the narrative, and tone of the film. The narrative of Metropolis leans in the direction of formalist, because it very heavily promotes a thematic point, has a scrambled sense of time, and is occasionally intruded with the director's style. The film's narrative has very clear religious parallels and a clear message, against the Nazi Party, and their regime. At a time when the amount of propaganda films were rising, Metropolis was able to send a message with clever subtlety. The evidence that Lang was angry with the, at the time, new Nazi Party is evident through the religious parallels, especially with Israel. It's no secret how the Nazi's felt about members of the Hebrew religion, and the parallels often connected to the Hebrew religion. The catacomb scene in the film contains the best examples of this as the candles behind Maria resemble a menorah, the iconic candle that the Hebrew religion celebrates Hanukkah with. Maria has a very close association with the woman in Revelation 12, it seems relevant to point out that in the catacomb scene the candles behind Maria, may represent the crown of twelve stars. The religious parallels combined with the well known fact that Fritz Lang didn't like the Nazi Party, most likely because of his Jewish heritage, help reinforce that Metropolis was film with an angry anti-Nazi message. Perhaps the most impressive thing about Metropolis is the powerfully real way that Lang showed us his apocalyptic vision. The world is scary, because it's realistic, and powerful, because it resembled an interpretation of the world the Nazi's preached about creating. The evidence that the world resembled a Nazi vision are, again, in the religious parallels, this time with the story of Exodus. The film is clear that the world has three divisions, the hand (the Egyptian slaves/the poor), the brain (the pharoah/Joh Frederson), and the heart (Freder/Moses), it is noteworthy that the story of Exodus is about Hebrew liberation. The film was powerful, because of it's message, but is also one of the most influential of the classical Science Fiction films, and still has a massive impact on films today. Visually the Metropolis was made to be a beautiful paradox that is magnificent, yet equally hellish, this look has been copied numerous times throughout the years. Examples of this are in Blade Runner, Dark City, Escape From New York, and the Matrix. The dark yet beautiful apocalyptic world would become a staple of futuristic Science Fiction films. Another visual staple of Metropolis was the look of the citizens, specifically the poor, who are a bland, uniform set of people, beaten to submission. This has been used in films like THX 1138, and more recently films like Snowpiercer, and the Hunger Games. Another impactful aspect of the film is Rotwang's metal hand, which has been copied famously in Dr. Strangelove, and Star Wars. There are many more things that Metropolis has inspired over the years, these are many more things that Metropolis has inspired over the years, these examples were just a few examples of the impact of Metropolis. Regardless of one's opinion toward the film itself, it seems self-evident that Metropolis remains one of film's shining moments, as proof that art can reflect and even criticize culture. Metropolis also remains timeless, because it offers viewers the opportunity to enter the mindset of a skeptical German during the rise of Nazi power. Metropolis' footprint still heavily affects films today, that, and considering the message's enduring relevance, make Metropolis one of the most influential films of all time.",Metropolis

Produced in Germany in the Babelsberg Studios during the brief years of the Weimar Republic and released in 1927, it was the most expensive silent film of the time, costing approximately 7 million Reichsmark (equivalent to around $200 million in 2005) to make.The screenplay was written in 1924 by Lang and his wife, Thea Von Harbou, and novelised by Von Harbou in 1926. It is set in a futuristic urban dystopia, and, like its contemporary The Battleship Potemkin, addresses the then-current political themes of capitalism vs. communism.",Metropolis

189,chuck-526,"now emotionally powerful (""second"" restoration)",9,4 September 2010,"***** This review is in the wrong spot, it _should_ be attached to what IMDb calls ""Metropolis (2010)"", which is a later restoration version of the same film. However, at this time ""Metropolis (2010)"" is still marked ""in development"" and is not yet accepting reviews. *****I saw a theatrical release of the newly restored version including the Argentine footage in September 2010. It was distributed by Kino, was obviously their U.S. (or at least English) version, and was on a Blu-Ray DVD. (I don't know whether the eventual home DVD release will be exactly the same as this theatrical release or not...) As with the previous restoration (and perhaps even more-so, if such a thing is even possible), the current aesthetic of restoring the ""real"" item (rather than trying to re-imagine ""the spirit of the piece"") has been followed rigorously. Fortunately, this is an excellent example that investing enough care and effort into the accuracy of a restoration winds up restoring the spirit of the piece too.The additional Argentine footage was a 16mm copy rather than the 35mm originals previously used for the rest of the restoration. It's instantly identifiable by quite bad vertical streaking. Matching of brightness and contrast though, and timing of splices, were seamless, so sometimes a scene could be mostly the previously existing master footage but with interleaved bits of the Argentine footage, and the net result looked okay. Even though there was an explicit warning in the pre-film notes on the screen about the Argentine footage having a narrower aspect ratio, resulting in a vertical black band at the edge, and even though I tried to see it for myself throughout the entire film, it was so well hidden I could never spot it.There were copious intertitles (even more than I remember?), and they were very well translated. I only remember two remaining short text bridges over spots where no footage has ever been recovered; everything else is here.The story lines haven't changed hardly at all. As before, when listed they seem rather pallid or even retro: Blake's ""dark Satanic mills"", millennial ideology, an unrealistic and sappy resolution, love at first sight. The storyline is the armature for powerful images and feelings, not something of great interest on its own.During the first ten or twenty minutes of the film, the additional bits of footage just provided a few seconds or tens of seconds here and there that extended a scene, or showed the same scene from a different angle or distance, or showed an additional character's facial reaction. My first thought was ""what's the big deal?"" But then somewhat later in the film, bits of restored footage add whole subplots and flesh out characters. The Thin Man is no longer just a bit part, but is sensibly present throughout most of the film. The dual pursuits of the two Marias colliding and inadvertently swapping now makes full sense. How Georgy/11811 avoids identification by the driver, and how he gets sidetracked into Yoshiwara, are spelled out in detail. And so on.In several places Fritz Lang initially presented two bits of action simultaneously by cutting back and forth between them. In many of these places one of the two bits of actions was removed entirely, leaving the other a bit disjointed, skipping some parts of the plot, and making comparisons much less obvious (or even opaque). The Argentine footage has been used to restore virtually all of these places, and this is where it shines the most. For example always before I'd been a little nonplussed by where the obvious motivation of both sides toward rapprochement at the end comes from. With the restored footage presenting threads side-by-side, it became clear to me as it never had before that what Fredersen and the Workers discovered they had in common was deep concern about their offspring.One possible problem -just as with the original- is it's ""too long"" for American audiences. Go to the bathroom and buy your popcorn beforehand. And prepare to have your attention span challenged a bit.Always before, Metropolis has been something of an intellectual exercise for me. This version though drew me in by its dramatic force. It's no longer a quaint, ""interesting"" part of the history of film, but a visceral experience that reaches out and grabs you (even all these years later). I highly recommend it.",Metropolis

191,tyson-hunsaker,"A flawless, influential, and brilliant journey through the best of science-fiction.",10,20 November 2017,"""Metropolis"" is Fritz Lang's masterpiece of science-fiction that delves into a highly metaphorical futuristic story of two divided classes and a man caught in between them. A film devoted to ideas and themes, richly rooted in religion and fantasy, ""Metropolis"" is a haunting and emotionally powerful experience that's impossible to forget. This is one to study for the ages and every film fan should find and cherish. Time hasn't been kind to this extraordinary film. After years of different versions, KINO International released a ""complete"" version of the film which included lost and damaged footage essential to the plot of the story. Thanks to their outstanding restoration of the film, we get to experience ""Metropolis"" in mostly all of its cinematic and artistic glory. The images and story feel more striking than ever before and the unapologetic approach Fritz Lang took in creating this masterpiece is what makes this movie stand far out above other science-fiction films. The film itself has a dream-like trance with hypnotic editing that when dream sequences are actually happening, you wonder what truth is really being presented on screen. This works to the film's advantage by allowing the audience to completely feel the majesty and horror of the future. ""Metropolis"" immerses the audience with not only excellent technical techniques, but the brilliant art direction and production design. Viewing the film in 2017, one still wonders exactly how particular effects were achieved. Thankfully, we get sucked into this world and its story so effortlessly, we have no time to wonder how we're seeing what we're seeing. We simply enjoy the movie magic. With clear direction, strong performances, and unforgettable visuals, ""Metropolis"" couldn't be more recommended. If the ""complete"" version is available, it's well worth the extra runtime to grasp the entire story. ""Metropolis"" is a cinematic masterpiece; pure and simple.",Metropolis

193,GHCool,"Review of ""The Complete Metropolis""",10,15 May 2010,"I just got back from seeing the new ""Complete Metropolis"" with the recently discovered footage edited into the film. It was playing at the Laemmle in Encino. I was once obsessed with seeing as many VHS versions of the movie as possible in order to get the whole story. I think during those days, the Giorgio Moroder version was the most complete even though the music was absurd. With this new version, I'm confident that I've seen as much of Metropolis as I could ever hope to see.The complete restoration is coming out on DVD at the end 2010, but I highly recommend that you see it in theaters if possible. There are 25 minutes of new footage. About half of that footage is devoted to a subplot regarding the man that Freder trades identities with. The rest are added shots here and there and a greater emphasis on the contrast between Maria's virtue and the Robot's lack of virtue. Some of it is redundant or distracting from the main story, but much of it makes character motivations and the social critique clearer. I guess, like Blade Runner, each version of Metropolis will have its pluses and minuses and fans can argue forever about which is the ""best.""",Metropolis
194,asenkron,I am starting to become a fan of Fritz Lang,9,10 December 2007,"This is my second Fritz Lang film that I have ever watched. First one is ""M"" who made me curious other Lang pictures. Of course, it becomes to overstep the limit to criticize for Lang's these works but I do comment as I can. After I had watched ""M"" I was shocked because of the screening date. This film also got me shockedone more time. In 1927, how a glorious mind could realize such an amazing film? Firstly, it was a big misfortune to miss some parts of film that corresponds to 25 %. Anyway, this is a big work to unite available parts. All the staff exposed a professional work like they earn million dollars from box-offices. As different from M, this was a silent film but thought most talking in this sector couldn't do this effect.The story is roughly founded upon differences between people who live and work in a Metropolis, but the film shows, if wanted it could be possible to connect indifferent people from different public forms. To teach this subject, a motto is used during the film : ""The heart must be peacemaker between hands and head"".According to the story, a metropolis is controlled a powerful man who is Joh Fredersen. He and his relatives live in wealth because lots of people work in bad conditions. At last, Maria who works to show right ways to workers, enters to Freder's life(Fredersen's son). A crazy man(Rotwang) is wanted to do a copy of Maria to dominate workers by Fredersen. ""Rotwang effected Maria"" wants people to destroy the machines that work for Metropolis. In this case, Metropolis workers would die. Finally, they destroy the machines and underground is effected by flood and the workers is stuck in it. Freder does all the things to save workers and of course Maria.Fritz Lang is a real master that his just two pieces effected me so much. I especially admired the harmonious movements of workers while shift changing and walking to the place of boss. As swinging to one left and one right. Furthermore, the messages that Lang gave is also marvellous. Theses are about the conflicts between different classes of society, poor conditions for workers, happenings in a big city and the others.Lots of thanks to Lang and of course Thea von Harbou...",Metropolis
195,clivy,"A timeless classic, still relevant today, and not just a Science Fiction movie",10,22 July 2011,"Metropolis is legendary as THE pioneering Science Fiction movie. The mechanical man of the film is clearly recognizable in CP30. Its scenes of the future city are still hugely influential and are referenced in Blade Runner, The Fifth Element, and many other films. Metropolis inspired a whole generation of cartoonists and artists. The creators of Superman named his city after the film, in its honor.Metropolis did an amazing job of forecasting the future. It suggested machines taking the place of people. The mechanical man is not far off: today we have computerized artificial limbs, mechanical hearts, plastic hips, lenses for helping people see, and electrical devices for helping people hear.But Metropolis is much more than a sci fi movie predicting heavily populated cities and robots. It dramatizes issues that greatly concerned the world at the time of its making in 1927: labor relations, the rise of machines, machines taking the place of human workers, the isolation of life in the city, the rise of consumerism.Many of its themes are reflected in Aldous Huxley's novel Brave New World, written a few years later in 1931. I thought of Brave New World when I watched the restored version of the film last night. I also thought of H. G. Wells and how he showed workers living underground, enslaved to an intellectual ruling class living in the sunlight.I was surprised to see the vision of Moloch and the workers fed to the demon machines. In Allan Ginsberg's ""Howl"" Moloch is the symbol of consumerised modern culture in the America of the 1950s that crushes the spirit. The end of the poem celebrates freedom of the individual.While technology has advanced greatly since the 1920s the film still echoes fears of technology and business oppressing the spirits of citizens, and fear of losing long held cultural values. It calls out for heart, heart not just as a mediator between head and hands, but for people not to worship Moloch and technology, to remember that they are human and the people around them are human too, even if they belong to a different class, worker or billionaire. It's a message that still calls out to the audience nearly a century later.I appreciate the work of the people around the world who collaborated to restore Metropolis to Lang's original vision. The film is a classic, not just of the science fiction genre. It is as timeless as the legend of the tower of Babel, and is just as much a warning for humanity while praising the glory of man's achievements to remember the glory of God as well.",Metropolis

197,Laitue_Gonflable,Such a great film in so many ways,9,9 September 2003,"I'll keep this short. Metropolis is a quintessential, groundbreaking and in every way classic, film from the very early era of cinema. Being the first and, up to this point, the only silent film I have seen, it was quite a challenge to bring myself to hire it and put it in the VCR, but not at all a challenge to sit through it. For someone who was raised on such films as ""Meet the Feebles"" and ""Revenge of the Killer Tomatoes"", Metropolis is an absolute breath of fresh air as something that can contain such a quirky story, such whimsical film-making and still, thoroughly entertain, move and provoke thought.It is an absolute gem from a very golden age and I think it is essential that everyone see this film because not only is it brilliant on its own but the stories and later masterpieces that it inspired are innumerable. One additional thought, though: I hired the ""Jef films"" copy of this film which contained the most awful, retro 80's music over the top that fitted nothing in with the story and just changed at erratic times. It was nothing more than an attempt to put sound over a film that does not need it. Instead I rigged up my stereo to play Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring"" and it worked perfectly.

By being brief...For 1927, the film looks AMAZING. The lighting, sets, the matte paintings, and of course the Machine Man (who even before the transformation looks pretty darn feminine). The special effects in the inventor's lab scream Frankenstein...I found some of the acting to be a little heavy-handed, especially Freder and ""real"" Maria. ""Machine"" Maria, on the other hand, is downright evil! Thin Man is creepy (as he should be) and Joh Fredersen seems too emotionless. Grot is one of the most human characters.As for the story itself, with it's rich and poor, and no in-between, people on the Left will claim that is a dream of the Right, and visa versa. I personally am reminded of communist and socialist countries where the workers are conned into believing they are working for the good of the whole, when in reality they don't reap much at all from what they sow.Again, much can, and no doubt already has, been debated about this film politically.I would give the movie another star if some of the acting wasn't over-done.",Metropolis

All who complain about the lack of speed in many of the scenes should make sure to see the film again in its original speed of projection: 24 frames per second!

However, Lang's meisterpiece is about the lumpen proletariat and their fight against capitalism in ALL its dreadful forms. It is at once a manifesto for Marxism and a sensitive film-maker's prescience regarding the National Socialist (NAZI) horrors to come. Regardless of the technical innovations (forced-perspective being the most important), each scene in the Hell which is the factory, reeks of pointlessness and despair.The Daliesque spreadeagled workers moving clock hands backward and forward in a dance of futility become an exemplar for the pointless exploitation of unskilled workers in a factory - BUT we never know whether they are indeed unskilled or just misused - or does it matter in a capitalist system? The maw of the insatiable greed of the monied is dreadfully (in the true sense of the word) presented by Lang's ""face of the machine"": it has eyes, an avid expression, and a gaping insatiable need.So. The saintly figure of the ""saving grace"", the gentle nurse/link who exists between the haves-and-have-nots is displaced by what is, probably, the most striking visual interpretation of capitalist evil in its most scientifically-produced, unfeeling and machinistic form: the robot. At the time Metropolis was created, this amazing result of laboratory ""tinkering"" wasn't that much older than Shelley's monster and yet, in hindsight, is more realistic. It seems to all of us much easier to create an android/cyborg than to reconstitute/create a person out of left-over parts. Or is this the case?Lang is a sum of his movies' parts (look them up: he produced/directed many more than this one) and, perhaps, one of the most influential film-makers of all time. But what means more to us - his cinematic fluency or his cinematic expertise? Or is there a case for both?Metropolis remains one of the most striking and influential films of its time - on a par with Eisenstein's classics. They both filmed amazing women in amazing circumstances, but had different ways of portraying same. In these days of cynical denial, in some ways Lang offers hope. All we have to do is revisit his work and find it.Well, regardless: the drowning of the workers is symbolic as is their attempted saving by the reconstituted heroine. She is, perhaps, a sigil: a pointer toward the notion that, in the midst of destruction, humanity will find another St Joan. Someone who, when the emergency is over, we can burn at the stake.

206,Jules45,Metropobliss,10,24 November 2010,"When a film has as much temperament as Metropolis its like there's another individual watching it besides you. And as grand as this feeling may be, there's always a partially visible shadow beside you next time you want to watch a film that can't quite live up to its predecessor's solitary presence. It feels more like a grainy silhouette at best.Saying it is a blueprint that caused scriptwriters lead to diminish from the multitude of brainwaves it spawned would be a bigger understatement than saying, well just that. It is, the blueprint that securely holstered the pistol that fired the concepts that worked tremendously on some (The Matrix, Star Wars) and not so well on others, undeserving of mention.Freder, the silver-spoon born son of Metropolis overlord, Frederson, departs his aboveground haven of towering futuristic vision for the stark, dystopian world beneath the wealth that dwelled so ignorantly above, after gazing upon the heaven sent Maria. Haplessly he embarks to her fair grace only to discover she has branched a prophecy concerning earth's working and social division.The restoration of lost footage, doesn't produce the ray of sunshine a 1080p gloss of the original footage does, but it faithfully hasn't been clumped carelessly in the special features section, or, goodness forbid, shunted on the back of the film like a uncomplimentary prologue. It chronologically has been placed, (panic over) which makes you appreciate how bad the condition the footage must have originally been in contrast to the gleaming eye bulging of characters like Rotwang.A naturally high delivery of perfection is inevitable. The pulse that is responsible for the lively beat of the thousands it has created, not just directly but through inspiration from the inspired that aren't aware of the existence of Metropolis. If the stepping of the story feels all the too much of an acquired taste or just underwhelming from the lack of O.A.P friendly experience then by all means stick with Neo.

207,Zoopansick,Enormous Influence,7,1 July 2003,"First of all Metropolis is at it's best when you watch it with the right score (music).  Stay away from the ""MTV version"" that music is awful and doesn't do justice to the movie.  I recommend the newest version on DVD with an attempted recreation of the original score, though that would be next to impossilbe because in the days of silent films the score was provided in the theater live.  Anyways I think that many people have a hard time getting used to black and white films let alone silent ones (speaking of people in my generation), so this movie can't be judged harshly or unfairly on those 2 prerequisites.  If you watch Metropolis with an open mind you will be blown away.  It's a science fiction movie that effectively deals with themes of class, politics, and religion.  The sets and design are amazing to me, because the film was made in 1927 and in fact it's creation almost brankrupted the studio (UFA) which funded it.  The imagery is what Lang is a master at and even if you watch the crummy MTV version you have to appreciate the symbolism and at the very least the sets and imagery.  This movie has made a profound influence on Blade Runner, Star Wars, the Matrix, and many other sci-fi movies that are themselves highly influential. Without Metropolis I doubt any of those movies would have come out the way they did.  In fact I think it's highly suspect if they would have been made at all, especially Blade Runner or the Matrix.  NOTHING was like Metropolis before it's creation and even years after it's creation it stands as unique. I think for it's style and imagery alone it can be considered one of the most important movies ever.  It's story isn't the best, but this is a must see for any movie buff.  Once you watch it, you may be surprised at how many films actually ""borrow"" from it.

208,GeneSiskel,Not the Perfect Sci-Fi Movie,3,3 November 2009,"The print illustrated here is neither fish nor foul. It is neither the original 153-minute version of ""Metropolis"" released in 1927, nor the 210-minute version unearthed in Buenos Aires in 2008, nor apparently any other version described in the Wikipedia article on the film. Coming in at just under two hours, a number of the original subplots have thankfully been omitted. The musical accompaniment here works well enough, but it is by Serge Prokofiev instead of by the rather less well known Gottfried Huppertz, who composed the original soundtrack. Regardless of what version we have here, the plot is -- let's admit it, shall we? -- an embarrassing muddle. Lang himself disparaged his own film. It can hardly be a positive recommendation that Goebbels loved it when it was released and that the Nazis later co-opted the theme of the workers' struggle against the ruling class spun out in this simple morality play. The acting has all the subtlety of an 1870 melodrama or grand opera by Meyerbeer, but if you hunger to watch a female android perform the hootchy cootchy at the front of a worker's uprising, well, you've come to the right place. Except for a pioneering use of models, the production values of this film appear to have progressed little beyond what D.W. Griffith accomplished a decade earlier in ""The Birth of a Nation"" and ""Broken Blossoms."" And the vision of the future seen in ""Metropolis"" and so beloved by sci-fi enthusiasts? It may be prescient for its reliance on Bauhaus and art deco design, but it is pretty much hopeless for everything else. The airplanes, automobiles, formal dress, and dance styles of 2026 are all straight from the 1920's. Chemistry and electric generators, just beginning to give way to physics, electronics, and biotech in the 1920's, are seen as still governing science and industry a century later. Finally, the quality of the ""Restored Authorized Edition"" seen here is poor. It should be 16mm film, but when viewed on a computer it lacks clarity and definition. Every film lover should see the classic silent films at least once. It's part of a general education. I'm just not sure that every film lover needs to see this version of ""Metropolis"" right now.",Metropolis

210,keesha45,Fritz Lang's heart unites his head and hands herein,8,13 April 2008,"While this is not my favorite silent film, it definitely rates in my top ten silents. I enjoyed Chaplin's futuristic vision in MODERN TIMES much better, but Lang created a marvelous tale of what he felt the future (and our present, more or less) might be like. I saw this film at our neighborhood Garland Theatre last night. The print was advertised as the longest version yet to be restored and I wished I had seen more of the scenes that were hinted at by the titles, but sadly missing from the screening. The score was provided by a musical duo called Enuma Elish, which is touring the country accompanying the showing of METROPOLIS in other cities (You can access their work by going to www.lithiq.com.) The music, though a bit loud for my taste, was very good at adding a futuristic techno beat to enhance the enjoyment of the movie. I heartily recommend this showing if it becomes available in your area. I commend the Garland for the screening of this and all older films. I enjoy the availability of watching old movies on venues like the Turner Classic Movie network and of having them being sold in the DVD and VHS format for seeing at home. But there's nothing like the thrill of seeing a film on a large, theatrical-size screen, surrounded by an appreciable audience, as the producers intended them to be shown. I look forward to seeing more oldies but goodies in the future and I urge you to take advantage of the same opportunities when they arise. Dale Roloff",Metropolis

The effort that as gone into this film. You just don't see that anymore.The film may now seem clichéd but it was the first of its kind. It created the clichés. Long before Orwells 1984 or Blade Runner.This can be seen as a inspiration behind almost all Science Fiction or Cyberpunk efforts.I even liked the Giorgio Moroder version. All versions are fantastic.

212,IkuharaKunihiko,A slightly outdated silent classic,7,27 November 2005,"The future. In Metropolis people are divided into a working class and a rich class. The working class has to do heavy jobs which last up to 10 hours a day. All that the rich class does is pretty much party all day. Freder, the son of the rich industrialist Joh, falls in love into Maria, the leader of a group of revolutionists. The scientist Rotwang kidnaps Maria and makes a robot twin out of her in order to create chaos inside the revolutionists...Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" from 1927, considered one of the first sci-fi films in the motion picture history, is a classic with a high reputation ( it's no. 81 on IMDb's top 250 films ). Still, despite having many brilliant sequences, the film seems a little dated today. The biggest problem is that it has actually very few sci-fi elements and too much dry drama, while the pace keeps getting slower and slower near the finish. Lang's visual style is impressive ( the sequence where a story about the tower of Babel is told, the hallucination about one of the skeleton death statue's coming to life, the waking of the female robot, the flooding of the town ) as is the composition of the story, but they can't hide all of the flaws. For example, F. W. Murnau's silent fantasy ""Faust"" looks much more spectacular. -------- A very good piece of demanding storytelling which criticizes the government's decision of people being divided into working and not working classes, analyzes the nature of capitalism and offers a not so bright vision of the future. And the set design looks even more impressive when you think about it that it was made in Germany in the year 1927 and probably inspired ""Blade Runner"", while Rotwangs black glove probably inspired the looks of the mad scientist in Kubrick's ""Dr. Stragelove"". It's a classic, but a very dry one.Grade: 7/10",Metropolis
213,antoniocasaca123,"A good movie but not a masterpiece like ""M"" (Fritz Lang himself says it)",8,19 May 2018,"This is one of Fritz Lang's two most iconic films along with ""M"". I confess that I found the film to be great and far ahead of its time, with messages and subliminal symbolism and visually fantastic but I did not like some aspects, namely the exaggeration of the ""interpretations"", which is sometimes the ""evil"" of some German expressionist films , when they overpower this artistic chain, as well as the development of the main characters, which should have been more complex, in-depth and elaborate. This development falls short of the expectations, given the film's option to explore grandiose scenes, special effects and scenes with countless extras. I have seen many dozens of silent films and there have been many who, on the whole, captivated me more than this ""METROPOLIS"" despite acknowledging the merits of the film. But I still think ""M"" is Fritz Lang's great masterpiece, at least from the films I've seen so far from this excellent Austrian filmmaker. In fact, Lang himself found the same (he himself says it in the film ""LE MEPRIS"" directed by Jean-Luc Godard, in which he participates as an actor whose character he plays is himself). In short, I found a good movie but not a masterpiece, as most of the viewers who watched this movie find.",Metropolis
214,carljessieson,What a ride,9,30 March 2015,"First of all, I just love this movie. It blows me away every time I watch it. Filled with awesome shots and angles, and the special effects are just outstanding. So many facets of this film shocked me just because I did not expect them to be in a film from this time. The techniques and styles that I thought were more modern, results of decades of filmmaking, are actually born from this time. The models of the city, the machines, everything, was spectacular. The sets were so grand and stylized, absolutely stunning. The style of this film is breathtaking. This is my favorite film of the Expressionist era. Characteristics of other Expressionist films that I felt were too dramatic were just right in Metropolis. The acting was just right, not too over-dramatic. There were still moments of arms flailing, eyes bulging, and random, intimate, somewhat forceful embraces, but generally the performances were perfect. I love the way the underground workers performed so uniformly in their exhaustion, despair, and hope, waning hope. Maria's performance was particularly stellar to me. The make-up, the hair, use of lights and shadows, and the set design indicative of Expressionism were all excellent.A stellar story! Noticed a couple impossibly fast jumps in plot but that's something I'm seeing in every film I watch from this era. Definitely a movie with a message. Don't 100% agree with the overall moral of the film, but I was pleased by a lot of the films bits of wisdom and poetry. I think this is an incredibly important film on class differences and separation, and the exploitation of the lower class by CEOs with fat wallets and cold hearts- still applicable and hugely important in 2015. The conclusion was more tame and dreamy than it should have been, in my opinion. Nonetheless, it was an incredibly innovative and creative way to show a cultural issue. The first true science fiction epic, made in a medium that was relatively new- wow, this was an enormous endeavor and it was handled like a real visionary. Imagine taking a relatively new art form and doing things so innovative that they're still used and still impressive one hundred years later! The imagination of this filmmaker is absolutely astonishing. I am so impressed with the artistry of this film. The metaphorical sequences were a huge treat, oh man, I love that stuff. The scene with the statue of the seven sins is definitely going on my list of favorite film scenes ever. No doubt. The score is so exciting and ominous, powerful and epic, very good at conveying at setting the mood and conveying the feelings of the characters/moment.Such an important story, told in such an amazing way- allegorical, but universally applicable, a voice for the people against injustice, a portrait of greed and corruption, the seemingly subjective value of human life, and the price some must pay, sacrificing their lives and dissolving into sweat and dirt for the benefit of the undeserving, unappreciative upper class. Truly an amazing cinematic feat.9/10 Bye love you",Metropolis
215,k844140,A true masterpiece of its time and still very enjoyable.,9,19 June 2021,"Metropolis released 94 years ago, and unlike many long silent films of that time it still makes you enjoy every second of it. A legendary film which influenced generations of film makers and references to which we can see either in old movies and in the ones released just recently. It is flawless in any respect, especially because of its age. Metropolis demonstrates us a city created by the true genuises with vivid imagination. It is really unbelievable how they thought up and created such a beautiful and futuristic scenery 94 years ago. Seeing all this alone worth watching the film. Script and the story itself are unique and original for its time. Although we have seen it many times since, but Metropolis was the first. Actors and their characters stand out from many characters of that time, though German directors and screenwriters were always quite ingenious. Each separate character, whether it is a human or not, is memorable and outstanding, as well as the actors who performed them. Visual effects of Metropolis are really one of the best I've ever seen in films older than Star Wars (which is partially influenced by this film) and are the best of their time. The other crew member who made his job perfectly is the director. Fritz Lang is really the one who can show and make us understand the story perfectly without tons of dialoges.So, this movie is really still worth watching in 2021. It does not bore even for a second all throughout its 2,5 hours timing. Even those who don't prefer old movies should acquaint themselves with this masterpiece.",Metropolis

The layout of this film is also awesome, and it is some of the best layout and design that I have ever seen in a movie. The people who worked on this film really took the time out to work on this film, and put their best foot forward to make this masterpiece.

Wow, I was so wrong in my preconceived notions of this movie. Yes, the plot line is simplistic, but nothing else about it is. The idea that a filmmaker conceived, pushed for, and actually managed to make this ""serious"" science fiction epic back in 1925 (released in 1927) makes me want to stand up and cheer. It was one the most expensive movies of its era, and every penny of those 1925 dollars (er, reichmarks) is up on the screen. The original re-recorded score is gorgeous, very accessible, and as a die-hard film score fan, I can say it is one of the most intelligently scored movies I have ever seen. The acting is of the silent era, but don't let that scare you off; some of these actors were quite good! The highest praise I can give this ancient film, is that very few science fiction movies of today can match the passion, vision and depth this film strove for (and often achieved) with 1920's film technology.

218,johnnysugar,Between mind and hand is the heart...,10,13 September 2002,"This is, without a doubt, one of the finest movies ever made and definitely one of the very best in science fiction.  The newly restored version of the movie is a film lover's dream.  Do not see any other version, especially the desecration that is the Georgio Moroder disaster.For those of you not in the know, ""Metropolis"" is a classic 1927 film about the division between the rich, upper class rulers of Metropolis and the oppressed working class.  A young agitator named Maria encourages the workers to wait for a mediator that will bring the two societies together. Meanwhile, a scientist creates a robot to replace his lost love.  The robot becomes a tool of instigation, of riot, and of revolution.This film was decades ahead of its time, and the imagery in it rivals even the most visionary directors of the modern era.  The use of special effects is extremely impressive for its age, as is the make-up and costuming (most effectively in the cathedral with Death and the Seven Deadly Sins).  I can't remember a more visually engrossing film...and all without the use of sound!My only complaint about the new version is that since about 40 minutes of the movie are permanently lost, simple title cards list the plot points that occurred in the movie where the scenes were lost.  The lost footage sounds amazing...I will forever be haunted by scenes I've imagined in my head.This film is a must-see for anybody who even considers themselves a casual movie-goer.  Yes, it's a little long for people weaned on the crash-boom-bang of Hollywood action films, and yes, it's a little symbolic for people who's idea of a movie star is Freddie Prinze, Jr.  But you owe it to yourself to witness the first true merging of mind and hands.Ten out of 10.",Metropolis
219,Nothinggrandproductions,A movie with awful pacing and muddled philosophical messages,4,10 September 2013,"I really hate it when I don't enjoy a classic film. I really want to enjoy it but I just can't. I want to understand some people's love for it, but I just can't. Metropolis falls under this category. An unbearably slow film, (I watched the restoration which is over 2 hours longthat may have been a bad idea) that starts off with interesting ideas but then seems to not really do much with them. It is the year 2026, the wealthy rule the city of Metropolis, while the lower-class work for hours on end underground in awful conditions. The Master of Metropolis is Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel) and his son is Freder (Gustav Frohlich), who spends his days with other rich people in a place called the pleasure garden where he truly does nothing at all. A woman named Maria (Brigitte Helm) brings a group of working children up for a visit in pleasure garden and Freder is quickly enamored by Maria. Freder decides to explore the underground part of the city only to be shocked as an explosion goes off and kills multiple workers. He reports this to his father who is disappointed his son was the first to report it over his assistant, Josepha (Theodor Loos), and his assistant is quickly fired. This does an immediate job of showing the coldness of Joh but they never do much else with his character. In fact, very little of the characters are developed in anyway. Most of them are completely uninteresting and the setting itself is compelling at first but quickly loses anything interesting halfway through the film as the film moves at a snail pace. Anyways, the main aspect of the plot here is that the workers are led by Maria to stop this feud between the rich and the poor with nonviolence and the eventual arrival of a mediator to make it happen. My real issue is that the film starts with such a great idea and had potential to become something like 1984 (I'm aware it came out afterwords (and that it's a novel), but still, just an example) but it instead becomes filled with strange religious allusions and becomes a witch hunt essentially by the end. They never really do any decent social commentary at all. If any at all. This wouldn't matter if the film was actually entertaining, but it only is in spurts and then quickly becomes a repetitive bore. I do think the special effects were impressive and this film is obviously important for being the first full length science fiction filmwell, ever. That doesn't mean it holds up because it doesn't. In fact, it'd be hard for me to believe the film was entertaining in 1927. I still wonder if I had watched the shorter version of the film how much more I would've enjoyed the film. It certainly would've have been paced better considering so much of this film is unbelievably uninteresting. But, I don't think that changes the fact that this movie doesn't really do anything. It isn't entertaining. It doesn't really have a message. What is this movie? I guess, good special effects for 1927? Whatever. I'm glad I gave this classic a chance, but I highly doubt I'll revisit it anytime soon.",Metropolis

They're equally stunned when I tell them it's actually ""Metropolis"".  When I first saw ""Metropolis"", I was coming down after having seen ""Star Wars"" for the third or fourth time.  ""Metropolis"" was being shown on the local PBS channel, which touted the viewing as a 50th anniversary special.  I was equally blown away with the effects in both movies, and even more impressed that the effects in ""Metropolis"" still have the ability to mesmerize me to this day.  I was also able to track down a copy of the book, and have found the Moroder restoration the better version I've seen (yes, soundtrack, tinting, and all.  The music and tinting add an extra layer and help move the story along better).  The movie also shows how acting in a silent film is a lost art; the expressions Brigitte Helm uses as the robot Maria are priceless--the first when she winks and nods after being told her mission, and the second when Freder discovers ""Maria"" with his father.  The story of the loss of humanity at the expense of machine is timeless and well-told.  A beautiful, beautiful film that deserves to be studied.",Metropolis

The imagery shows titanic nearly fantastical skyscrapers in a world where the rich in ignorant bliss, and then contrasts with the grimy, steamy, machine filled, inhuman labor of the poor as they struggle to uphold the wealthy's world upon their shoulders.

Metropolis is a slightly incomplete film due to some of the footage having been lost but a few years back, some lost footage was found to complete more of this fantastic film. Not only that, if you saw the grainy version years ago on VHS, the Kino version is digitally restored and *razor* sharp. So good in fact, you'll see detail you've never seen with the low-res VHS version. The additional footage and supplemental material is great.

223,MovieKen,"Good film, but not that good",4,19 June 2003,"I typically don't like silent films, but I decided to watch this one for two reasons.  First, I usually like sci-fi movies, and second, Metropolis had received so many glowing reviews that I couldn't pass it up.  However, my opinion of this film is below what most reviewers have been saying.Kino's digitally remastered version on DVD is very impressive.  The sound and picture quality are both excellent.  However, I have to conclude that favorable reviews of this film are likely based on nostalgia, on the film's influence on future films, and on the incredible visual effects, given its year of release.  Film history buffs and silent film fans should see this movie.  I thought this was a good film, but not a great one.  A rating of 8.3 is much too high, and at #93, there are plenty of better films ranked below it.First, the good parts of the film: 1) The special effects are excellent for a pre-1930s film. 2) The mindlessness of the working class is portrayed well in how they work, the decisions they make, and in how easily they are led/misled. 3) The main character is well developed throughout the film, and the audience can relate to him well. 4) The film is visually stunning and impressive. 5) The story of the working class, vision of the future, ""machine-men,"" etc. have had a very strong influence on many films which came later.
On the other hand, here is a list of what could have been done better: 1) Many scenes dragged on too long and were tedious.  I can't imagine it being any longer than it already was. 2) The differences between the thinking class and the working class were not clear; both seemed to be pretty mindless. 3) The themes and ideas in the film have been explored better in other productions. 4) The set design and special effects are not as good as they are in the 1936 film, Things to Come. 5) Things to Come also has a far more interesting and creative vision of the future. 6) Joh Fredersen is not well developed, and his motives and decisions seem illogical for the leader of the ""thinking"" class. 7) There is no explanation for how the spiritual and motivational leader of the working class became so intelligent, capable, and/or competent.  More background on Maria would have helped develop her character, and improved the film.
In its defense, it could be that I was not as impressed by this film simply because so many films which came after it have copied, borrowed, stolen, or re-worked ideas that appeared here first.  Metropolis certainly was a trend-setter.  Like I said before, I don't think this is a bad film.  It's simply overrated, and I've seen plenty of films that are better but are rated lower.",Metropolis

225,panchodh_12,"Holy cow, is this really nine decades old?",9,2 October 2015,"Long live modern cinema. No matter how revolutionary the avant-garde movement was for art as a whole, the modernists' true medium, was definitely, the last, seventh art. Metropolis captures perfectly the zeitgeist of its moment: the Weimar's republic contradictions and overlapping between Marxist ideas, Christian references and a futuristic faith in the machines. The way these interplay is astonishing, because the final result is as relevant to today's reality as it was to that of the inter-war period. We still have segregated cities; we still have enslaved proletarians in East Asia building iPhones for a few; violent revolution is still not the answer. And I find very curious how the movie, despite its socialist claims, depicts the workers as an irrational crowd, easily manipulated by pretty much anyone with a tiny bit of agency. And the relation Man-Machine is never completely resolved: are they evil? are they a tool for exploitation? are they the basis of our survival?What also makes me marvel is that this movie is from the time before the stock market crash; before Hitler. The camera techniques, the special effects (!), the massive amount of extras, have nothing to envy those of today's blockbuster. The plot situations that rise up in this movie, have become way too recognizable tropes over the course of the century. The evil double, the fight on the rooftop, the water rising scene, the artificial hand, the wrongdoer who later sacrifices himself, the damsel in distress... Hollywood seems to have run out of ideas these past ninety years. And yet Metropolis has bits that resemble nothing I ever saw, and completely blew my mind; above all the dancing scene at the end of the Intermezzo, which is probably among the best movie scenes in history, full stop.Metropolis is, therefore, a virtuous combination, between a movie that fully captures the zeitgeist of the avant-garde time, while at the same time being a timeless piece that is relevant to today's world and can be enjoyed by today's audience as much as the audience it was intended too. Few movies deserve as much to be on the podium of greatest movies of all time.",Metropolis
226,willwoodmill,The definitive dystopian film,9,24 February 2016,"By 1927 Fritz Lang had already solidified his place as one of the masters of the silent era. His films like Dr. Mabuse: The Gambler, and the two Die Nielungen films are some of the most cherished silent films of all time. In fact Dr. Mabuse essentially defined and popularized the crime thriller genre and the evil gang-leader character, so its responsible for films like The Departed and Scarface. But if Fritz Lang wasn't already immortalized for those films, his film Metropolis made sure he would be.Metropolis is the first major Dystopian film, and even predated novels like 1984, and Brave New World. So it would be difficult for anyone to deny its originality or its influence. (One small note the dystopian novel We was published in 1921, so Metropolis doesn't deserve all the credit.) Metropolis is actually based on a book of the same name written by Fritz Lang's wife, Thea Von Harbou, published in 1925. The film and the novel both take place in the distant future of 2026, where the rich live in a luscious paradise and the poor are forced to work and die like slaves. Freder the son of the city's ruler, falls in love with a beautiful women named Maria a member of the working class, after she breaks into the gardens one day. Freder immediately falls in love with this strange women and follows her down into the depths of the city where he witnesses the terrible conditions of the working class. This is only a brief introduction to the plot though, as the film goes on it becomes far more complex as more characters and side-plots are introduced. Even though Metropolis does have so many characters and side-plots, it never loses its focus or its overarching theme, and Fritz Lang is able to bring every single character and side plot together in the film's massive climax.After Metropolis was originally released in theaters, the film was heavily edited and reduced to a fraction of its original runtime, and the rest of the footage was lost. Supposedly because producers thought the film was too long, and audiences wouldn't enjoy it. However slowly overtime, piece by piece, the film was restored until in 2010 it could finally be viewed in a nearly completed format. But the film still has some rough edges, some of the footage is rather grainy, and there are some title cards that come up to explain scenes that are still missing. Even with these annoyances the film can still be enjoyed. But hopefully one day audiences will be able to see the film in a completed high def format.Metropolis is a film that is larger than life, with sets that are still impressive today. So it's hard to imagine what watching the film must have been like back in 1927. My personal favorite of all the sets is either the great massive piece of machinery that the workers are on, when Freder first comes down, or the church-like caverns were Maria preaches to the workers about who there needs to be the mediator between the rich and the poor. But there are so many more, the house of the twisted occult-like house of the inventor that looks like something out of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, or the gigantic underground cities of the workers. Going back to the scene where Maria preaches about the mediator, the set isn't just amazing it's the whole scene, its one of the greatest in the entire film. Maria is trying to get the workers to understand the importance of a mediator, so she makes a comparison to the biblical story to the Tower of Babel, and how originally, the Tower was conceived as a symbol of humanity's greatness and unity, but the men who conceived it were unable to build it. So they enlisted the help of thousands of workers and Babel to them become a symbol of slavery and pain. Eventually the workers cannot take it anymore and rebel against the people who conceived the idea for the Tower of Babel. Babel was doomed from the beginning, Maria tells them, because without a mediator between the rich and the poor it was destined to fail, the city is now facing the same problem that Babel faced, and without a mediator it is only a matter of time before the poor overthrow the rich.If you haven't yet figured out, Metropolis (like many films from that era) has some communist undertones. This could be the reason for the films heavy editing after its original release, or maybe they really did just think that the film was too long and boring. Anyway back to the communist undertones, they're not nearly as strong or prevalent as the ones in say Battleship Potemkin, because Battleship Potemkin portrays the ruling class as naturally violent and oppressive and should be entirely overthrown. No Metropolis is much more optimistic than that, Metropolis is trying to convince its audience that the ruling and working classes can live in harmony as long as there is some sort of mediator for both sides. Some older films can be dated when viewed by modern audiences, and by dated I don't mean there special effects seem cheap to us now, no by what I mean by dated is that there themes and messages are incredibly old and no longer hold no meaning for today's society, Metropolis is not one of those films. After its release it's difficult to imagine a time where Metropolis would not be relevant. Nearly 9 decades after its first release and Metropolis feels like it's trying comment on our current political state. It is a film that will never be forgotten, it is both a massive cinematic epic, and a personal timeless classic. 9.5/10",Metropolis

The story was great, the filming was pure genius and the effects directly from another dimension.I don't think any movie after this one have gotten so much out of the available effects of the time as this one. Nowadays they have super computers generating special effects. Sure they look good, but it's no big deal making them. Back in 1926 computers weren't even invented yet, all effects had to be done by hand or in simple editing. And when you take a look at all the thins that have been done in this movie, it's impossible not to get impressed. Huge buildings, explosions, flooding, picture phones (however did he come up with the very idea?), transformation sequences, robots and so on. No movie has ever pulled the limits of special effects as much as this one. Star Wars and Jurassic Park are also known as limit pullers in special effects, but they don't even come close.Then you have the filming. Everything is perfect. The use of body language is tremendous, the light setting perfect, everything well timed and perfectly captured by the camera. I've never been witness to such a treat in filming other places.And the story!!! Perfect in every detail. Intriguing, exciting and thrilling with lots of religious undertones and tyranic leaders. No wonder Hitler liked this movie...I don't know how the original music of the film was, but the new music for the restored 139 minute version I saw was really good and moodseting.All in all. This is one of the most perfect movies of all time, and it deserves anything it can get. Never has a 10/10 been as secure as for this movie...",Metropolis
228,dimbost,A film that was ahead of its time.,9,17 May 2015,"Watched the 2008 uncut release. First of, I just want to say that the pure epicness and scale of this movie alone was amazing and deserves all the credit it got and then some.I watched this film for the first time on the 17/05/2015... I am huge movie buff and an aspiring movie teller, who loves old movies. Some of my favorite films include 12 angry men, The Seventh Seal, Bridge on the river Kwai, The Wrong man, Dial M for Murder, and much more... However as i have seen only few Silent movies before, i was worried that i was going to judge this film very biased, like many young people today do. That's the honest reason as to why i have put off watching it for a long time... But i have finally watched and was not only impressed but shocked as to the actual quality of the film and the emotion that it bought on the screen without any use of sounds. Not including the amazing score.so lets begin. Story: the story is a very complex one, it has links to religion and social standing behaviors, love story and a revenge/ vengeance conflict running through it. But for most part the story is not to hard to follow even the subtle meaning is clear.Acting: this is what real acting is all about, where actors have to express their emotions not through speech, but through facial expressions and body language. So Acting is for most part great.Set/ Special effects: This part is of the charts. For a film that is coming up on its 90th birthday soon has incredible visual elements. From amazing set decorations to huge and epic street views of the futuristic cities. Not including that in this 1927 film they perceive the future to have video calling ability, Vehicle phones, ability to ""copy"" not transfer BUT copy one's mind into a fully functional A.I Robot. and wireless electricity. Overall This is a brilliant and amazingly incredible accomplishment in the film industry which gave birth to a lot of films in the new category of Sci-fi movies. I Also would like to note, that i can see why the newer generation of film viewers can find this movie boring, or plain, or extremely slow. But that is not the true. This film will stand the test of time, and any possible remake of this will only prove how magnificently amazing this work of art really was.9/10 because we as humans understand that there is no perfection, and that everything has some kind of a flaw.",Metropolis
229,SanTropez_Couch,"Not really sci-fi at all, but a masterpiece nonetheless.",10,11 April 2003,"""Metropolis"" is, if nothing else, one of the most spectacular visual movies I've ever seen. Reportedly the most expensive German movie up to that time, Fritz Lang created an awesome city, totally memorable. I was lucky enough to see the restored version of the film -- listed as being 124 minutes, seeming like less -- in the theater with a group of about 70 people. Everyone seemed to enjoy the 75 year-old beast. (There was some clapping at the end -- a tradition that has always perplexed me. I mean, it's not like Fritz and his crew, or even those responsible for the wonderful restoration, are around to bask in the applause. Although, I guess, the applause was meant more for the theater that opted to bring the film here.)This is definitely one for the big screen.The story is heavy-handed by today's standards, but putting myself in the shoes of what I imagine the average audience of the time would have been like made me appreciate the ideas of the film more. (By no means, however, am I suggesting that a 1927 audience was less educated than we. They just didn't have the extra 75 years of movies we do.)The subterranean workers of the great city threaten to overthrow its rulers, led by Joh Fredersen. Now, Joh's son, Freder, sees an angel of a girl, Maria, who shows him his ""brothers"" and the terrible conditions of his father's workers. Maria captivates Freder, and she preaches the message of love and peace. The film's message, stated through her, is that the mediator of the hand (workers) and the mind (leader) is the heart (Maria and Freder).Freder goes below, to the ""depths,"" where he poses as a worker. He discovers plans for a revolt (more like a strike) where the workers will leave their machines in the hopes of being granted better conditions.But things get more complicated when Joh Fredersen has his scientist, Rotwang, who lives in an old barn-like house that the technical revolutions of the future have forgotten, design something for him. Rotwang has already created a machine man, modeled after Joh Fredersen's dead wife Hel (a sort of ""replacement""), but Joh Fredersen has him affix Maria's face to the machine. Joh plans to use this machine to incite the workers to violence, by having her first get the workers' attention by doing a (not so) sexy gyspy dance. Of course they do, and the city is flooded. The moral at the end of the film is silly, but because the whole film is so unrealistic, so much like a fable, it didn't bother me. (I did, however, lean over to my friend and say in a Fred Rogers voice, ""Won't you be my mediator?"")There really isn't much else you can say about ""Metropolis."" Those images are why you'd see this movie. The way it reflects (or maybe warns against) Nazi totalitarianism is interesting. (One image, in particular, where a machine explodes and turns into a giant devourer, has an unsettling similarity to gas chamber.) I like that Lang was interested both in the ideals of Freder and Maria, but also in a sense of order. With the uprising that does occur, of course, there are repercussions. The dialogues (or title cards) in the film express a protest of the sort of dictating aristocracy of Metropolis, but Lang's own spectacular sets and monumental vision seem to argue with that.The sets and the images (including two memorable camera moves) just can't be overemphasized. Sometimes they look like models or Styrofoam or just plain goofy, but they're incredible and original and influential. Many a homage has been paid to this film, from ""Dr. Strangelove"" to more of a blatant rip-off in ""The Fifth Element.""This is a vastly entertaining movie, made no less enjoyable by its sometimes silly premise. (It's not as if the acting in silent movies isn't wildly exaggerated -- and isn't that the appeal in the first place?) I'm completely ignorant when it comes to Lang -- this is the first movie of his I've seen. Nevertheless, this is a masterwork.****",Metropolis
230,ACitizenCalledKane,"Highly influential and, dare I say, prophetic?",8,3 December 2004,"Fritz Lang's Metropolis is the first true masterpiece of science fiction in film. You can see it's influence in films such as Star Wars, The Matrix, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, Blade Runner, and countless others. Despite the fact that parts of the film are no longer available, the efforts to reconstruct the original film from its remains are valiant enough to provide enough to make the story clear. The special effects were far ahead of their time and the set designs were, in some cases, phenomenal. I can see where some people may not enjoy this movie. It is hard for some to really appreciate a movie that is 77 years old, because a lot has happened in film since then. Yet, if you look at the basic elements of this movie - its story, characters, artwork, cinematography, etc., I believe this movie has just as much to offer now as it must have in the late 1920's. Also, take into consideration the asthetics of German expressionist film when viewing this. The performances and set designs are going to be over the top. That was part of the style. Metropolis may not be for everyone, but, for those willing to read between the lines, this film still has a lot to offer!",Metropolis
231,corporalko,"A German masterpiece, with only one other being similar",10,21 April 2020,"Everyone in the world should see this film at least once in their life. It is like no other that I have ever seen.Well, I'll amend that statement in a few moments here. But anyway, this German masterpiece from 1927 directed by Fritz Lang tells a story of a Marxist-like city where a minority of wealthy, independent people have a complete whip hand over thousands of poor, starving working-class people who slave for them under the earth. Footage of these oppressed people early in the film could move you to tears, it is so real and believable.But the apple cart is upset for the rich Marxist rulers by several events involving the son of one of those rulers and a sweet, innocent girl he falls in love with. As the movie goes on, more and more on-screen action -- and violence -- erupts with the final few scenes being awe-inspiring by the thousands of people involved, the unbelievably skilled special effects, and other things.As I said above, anyone who hasn't seen this film, should do so. And to amend one thing I said in the first paragraph, I've seen only one movie in my life that this film reminds me of in a number of ways. And that was ""The Phantom Empire,"" a 12-part serial released in 1935, with singing cowboy Gene Autry in his first starring role. If you get to see both of these classic films, maybe you'll agree with me.",Metropolis
232,mlink-36-9815,BBC Metropolis,9,18 August 2017,There is no mention in the various versions of the BBC Metropolis which was issued on TV 1975-78 on PBS in USA. I was fortunate to own a vcr at that time to record it. 126 min. - it is superior to the kino versions in many ways - for one they used a German original 35mm print. BBC added synchronized sound effects and by use of videotape were able to slow the film down to a normal speed. Making it a much different and better movie. The Complete version is way too fast and makes it look ridiculous in some scenes. BTW the Murnau folks censored their version which is borne out by a comparison with the BBC version. The German version uses the best takes.Australian Metropolis - this tinted print was the basis of the Moroder version. It is special in that it uses the writing of Channing Pollock who was hired by Paraufamet to create a profitable English language version - All Pollock ended up doing was to make a complicated movie incomprehensible by dumb editing choices. Left alone Metropolis by Fritz Lang was a 3 hour movie and if projected properly the complete version would be 3 hours. For some unknown reason they need to cram this epic picture into 150 min. there is much more info than I could write here. m234link@gmail.com,Metropolis

234,ignatz928,Watch the Kino DVD!,9,25 April 2005,"Technically speaking, I have seen this Fritz Lang silent sci-fi before, but this was the first time I saw it in any shape by which I could fairly evaluate it. I had previously watched Metropolis on a public domain VHS from the 80s. The print was terribly scratched and while there were a few memorable images, the story was so incoherent that their context was usually unclear. Though this was clearly not the best way to see Metropolis, I was still left with an impression of this supposed classic as a dusty museum piece that was praised by critics because they were expected to like it. So finally seeing a restored and expanded copy was as much as a revelation as seeing Once Upon a Time in the West letter boxed in how it led me to reevaluate my opinion of the movie. The movie is a strange mixture of political speculation political parable, apocalyptic fantasy, and religious allegory. It depicts a futuristic city that is divided between the wretched workers, who toil in the depths tending the machines, and the upper classes, who dwell in luxury up in the skyscrapers. The hero, the idle, pampered son of the city's supervisor Joh Fredersen, changes his ways and becomes concerned with the plight of the lower classes after catching a glimpse of Maria, the Madonna of the workers. His father, meanwhile, is plotting to thwart Maria with the help of the mad scientist Rotwang, who has discovered how to create robot replicas of human beings. One of the most surprising things about watching this version is just how much I didn't see. In addition to restoring scenes to the film, the DVD also includes inter titles to explain pieces of the plot that cannot be found in any version. With these changes, the story becomes much clearer, particularly the machinations of Rotwang and the master of Metropolis. Perhaps most importantly, a whole new subplot is added involving the hero's dead mother Hel, who was loved by both his father and Rotwang. With this clarification of the back-story, the close but adversarial relationship between Rotwang and Fredersen becomes much clearer. In some ways it recalls the family back-story of the Star Wars movies. Of course, the real strength of Metropolis isn't the story, which is pretty silly and probably wouldn't have worked in anything but a silent film, but its amazing visuals, which in their scale and ambitiousness look forward to 2001 and Blade Runner. Actually, though in most respects silent films now look primitive, one area in which they have the edge over modern film-making is in their frequently grandiose production design. Metropolis employs huge sets to show the hellish factories of the subterranean world. The models of the city's towering skyscrapers are also surprisingly convincing for a 1920s film. Even beyond the expansive production design and (for the time) special effects, Lang's visuals are all consistently inventive. The robot Maria provides some of the movie's most iconic images, including her transformation into a human being. In a later scene, she performs for upper-class men in a nightclub, and as she performs a striptease that in 1920s Germany was apparently seen as very decadent, the screen is filled with wet staring eyeballs. A sign of Lang's visual lavishness, and the studio's, that he doesn't hesitate to throw in lavish dream and hallucination sequences to drive home a point or illustrate a character's state of mind. For instance, when the hero first enters the subterranean city and sees rows upon rows of workers toiling on huge machines, he imagines the furnace transforming into a monstrous idol's head into which the workers are being sacrificed. At another point, while he's sick in bed he imagines statues of the Seven Deadly Sins coming to life and advancing out from a wall in a cathedral. When Maria preaches her message of peace and understanding to the workers, she tells them the story of the Tower of Babel of a management vs. labor parable, and Lang gives us spectacular images of the tower's construction and fall. In a sound film many of these scenes would have seemed redundant and over-literal, but they're what silent cinema does best -tell a story without the advantage- or obstacle- of dialogue. The story is a little slow to start, but once it picks up Metropolis becomes one of the most directly involving silent films that I've seen. In addition to being a pioneering example of the cinematic possibilities of science fiction, Metropolis also has to be one of the earliest disaster films, as the workers riot and sabotage the machines, endangering the entire city. Lang creates a sense of rising fury and nihilism in the last hour that in a strange way reminded me of what was going to happen to Germany in less than 20 years.",Metropolis
235,StoryCharts,Love will save us from tearing each other apart,9,6 August 2013,"Metropolis is about the idea that love will save us from tearing each other apart. Though this idea is well hidden among many things: class warfare symbolism, biblical references, human cloning and an ensemble of recurring, meaningful characters each with their own arcs and surprises. All this taking place on silent film made almost 100 years ago.The main plot is Freder's pursuit to win the love of Maria. The film opens with Freder falling in love on first sight and ends with Freder saving Maria and winning her love. In between is a demonstration that this love is the only thing that saves Metropolis from destruction.Freder happens to be the son of the master of Metropolis and Maria a prophet of the worker class. In his pursuit of Maria's love, Freder sympathizes with the workers' plight. His growing sympathy, trust and love for the workers stands in sharp contrast with the cold political calculus his father employs against them. His father's mad scientist, seeking revenge for losing the love of his life, manipulates the mistrust between the classes to incite a revolution to destroy Metropolis. He does this by cloning Maria with a robot which begins to incite chaos. The workers destroy the machines that run the city and seem to have killed their own children in their blind rage. Freder and Maria save the children. In the end, Freder helps the workers reconcile with his father who has had the cold heartlessness shaken out of him.This does not even mention the ensemble cast of characters who add dimension and meaning to the story. Nor does this give due note to the above mentioned symbolism and the psychedelic effect of sped-up film and thousands of human bodies marching in rhythm. Suffice it to say the story makes a poetic case for the idea that love will save us from tearing each other part.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.",Metropolis
236,bakchu,"Visually groundbreaking, weak story",9,8 March 2010,"There can be no doubt that visually ""Metropolis"" is one of the most influential movies of all time, especially for the science-fiction/dystopia genre. Its bold, expressive visuals are still striking and a treat to watch, and it's not surprising that so many directors have found inspiration there; traces of ""Metropolis"" can be found in countless movies such as ""Brazil"", ""The Fifth Element"" or ""Blade Runner"", and even in some episodes of ""Doctor Who"".Furthermore, we're now lucky to have a very good restoration available on DVD. Although this most recent release still doesn't contain a rather big part of footage, the gaps are filled by explanation texts (quite unobtrusive, as silent movies contain intertitles anyway) in an attempt to recreate the story in its original 1927 form. Most of the footage thought lost at the time of the DVD's release was recently rediscovered, so I think that we can expect an even better DVD not too far in the future, but due to the mentioned method of filling the gaps, the approximately 30 minutes still missing from this release certainly don't heavily deform the story. Still, if you want the movie in the most complete form imaginable, maybe you should wait for a release including the newly unearthed material.Well, but now... to the story. As said above, a meticulously restored DVD release is available, so we can't blame loss of material for weaknesses of the story. And I have to say, if this were not such a visually amazing movie (with excellent original music, by the way, greatly enhancing the experience), I would give it four points out of 10, and only when feeling generous. This is not a good story. It has nothing to do with the age of the movie - there were many movies in the 1920s telling far better, far more consistent stories than this one.My biggest issue is with the ending: For instance, foreman Grot suddenly being accepted as leader of the revolutionary workers, after previously appearing as Fredersen's loyal servant who e.g. dutifully provides Fredersen with the plans found in the pockets of dead workers and who tries to stop their attacks on the machine. Still, at the end, the movie depicts him as the one whom young Freder and Maria have to unite with Fredersen for a ""happy ending"". And that's it - what kind of ending is that? What message? What about the social situation of the workers? It's a false, sentimental pseudo-""happy end"" and the movie's motto ''""Mittler zwischen Hirn und Händen muss das Herz sein""'' (""the heart must be mediator between brain and hands"") is pure kitsch, especially in the way it is presented as the grand culmination of the whole movie's meaning.No wonder the German critics largely ditched ""Metropolis"" in 1927... maybe underrating (although noting) its visual greatness, but being less forgiving regarding the story than many people nowadays, who maybe think ""well, it's an old movie"" - which would be grossly unfair towards what was possible and also achieved in the 1920s in movies, story-wise.Nine points from me, nonetheless! Lang's imagery alone is great enough to justify such a vote.",Metropolis

239,laika-lives,How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?,9,19 May 2006,"Francis Ford Coppola once said that 'Apocalypse Now' wasn't just about Vietnam, is was Vietnam. In a similar way, 'Metropolis' isn't just about the Twentieth Century, it is the Twentieth Century. Almost every image in it reflects or, more often, predicts the realities of life in the West over the past hundred years in a way that is truly uncanny.From small details - the traffic jams and blackouts that plague city dwellers - to major historical events - the climactic flood predicts every industrial disaster that has destroyed the lives of thousands of workers, from Chernobyl to the Bhopal disaster, whilst Fredersen's vision of workers being fed to Moloch can't help but bring to mind the holocaust - 'Metropolis' feels prescient in any number of ways. In the image of the Manhattan skyline, Lang really did find the perfect symbol of the coming century - progressive, new, faceless, oppressive.This is far from the simple Marxist fable it is often taken for - although the Socialist message can hardly be ignored. It's also a Christian parable (Maria, flanked by crosses, is counterbalanced by the Machine, brought to life under a pentagram) informed by the book of Revelation; a retelling of the Orpheus myth, with Freder as Orpheus and Maria as Eurydice, lost in the underworld; and a Kafkaesque nightmare of depersonalisation (although the Gothic, expressionistic production design is a long way from Kafka's more sterile style).It's also, lest we forget, a silly adventure-melodrama, with a mad scientist, an evil twin, a bad father with a noble son and an impossibly virtuous, idealised heroine. In many ways, it anticipates 'Star Wars' in dressing up mythic standards with Science Fiction tropes - with Fredersen as the misguided King, Freder as the handsome Prince, Maria the good-hearted peasant's daughter, Rotwang as a scheming sorcerer and the Machine as the wicked witch, appropriately burnt at the stake by the 'villagers'.The Machine-'Man' (a confusing name for a construction so obviously feminine) is the single most indelible image of the film; the scene in which Rotwang brings her to life for the first time is a real moment of magic and awe, untarnished by eighty subsequent years of cinematic showmanship. Even better is the scene in which she becomes a duplicate of Maria - such an obvious influence on James Whale's 'Frankenstein' that it's hard not to shout out 'It's alive!'. The optical effects are years ahead of their time, certainly the best of their kind until the sixties (at least). It also marks the beginning of Brigitte Helm's truly extraordinary turn as the false Maria.This is only the third silent film I've seen (after 'Nosferatu' and 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari'), and it's taken me a while to acclimatise to the acting style, which can seem close to parody. What it really reminds me of, however, is modern dance, which similarly seeks to communicate with the audience visually, rather than verbally. 'Metropolis' encourages this comparison, with the highly choreographed movements of the workers operating the machinery. Bearing this in mind, Helm is hugely impressive in multiple roles. Maria could be a rather dull and virtuous heroine (she enters the film surrounded by poor children in rags) but Helm invests her with enormous energy and expressiveness. It helps that the script allows her to take an unusually proactive role for a female character, organising workers' meetings and racing to the rescue of the endangered children. However, it is her performance as bad Maria, vamping up a storm, that lingers in the memory - the twitching, jerking movements of her head and body, the Anne Robinson style half-wink that changes the shape of her face, that malicious little grin that makes it hard not to root for her mischief. The entirely weird 'erotic dance' that she performs isn't technically very good (or erotic), but it is utterly unforgettable. Subtextually, she's the Whore of Babylon.The other performances are mainly very good, particularly Alfred Abel as Fredersen, proving that it is possible to underplay in a silent film. Only Rudolf Klein-Rogge hits any wrong notes - difficult as it undoubtedly must be to play a mad scientist in a silent film with subtlety, some of his more unrestrained gesticulations leave you worried about the safety of the other actors.Ultimately though, it all inevitably comes back to the imagery. Lang's film remains unmatched even today. Pick a scene, any scene - the synchronised, shuffling crowds at the shift change; our first sighting of the Metropolis, all biplanes, skyscrapers and suspended motorways; the vision of Moloch; the Machine-Man awakening; Maria, pursued along a pitch-black tunnel by a beam of light; the statue of Death coming to life in the Cathedral; disembodied eyes, entranced by the twitching false Maria; the crowds swarming up the steps in the 'Tower of Babel' section; the lifts crashing down, one by one; desperate children crowding around Maria as the flood-waters close in; and, most of all, false Maria, laughing as she burns on her pyre, then transforming back to her metal visage. No film, before or since, matches this for spectacle. And if, in order to appreciate it, you have to swallow a little treacle about the heart being the mediator between head and hands... well, trust me, it's worth it.",Metropolis
240,dbn3,Watch the Kino Video DVD; It has the Complete Storyline.,7,1 June 2006,"Story Line:Joh Fredersen is the leader of Metropolis, a sunny, towering city full of energy and commerce. Freder is his son who revels in the libertine freedom that he has as a son of privilege. One day, while cavorting in the Eternal Gardens with a dozen scantily clad women, Freder sees a school teacher bring a group of dirty, poor children into the garden. The staff and the women are shocked and annoyed, but Freder is captivated by the teacher's words that ""we are all brothers"" and, of course, her beauty.Freder sets out to find the school teacher and investigate the world of the workers. The workers live deep underground operating the machines that keep Metropolis operating. The workers are not like the Morlocks of Wells' The Time Machine, they do not terrorize the upper dwellers, but they are rarely seen on the surface. He is searching the underground for her when he witnesses a terrible accident where dozens of workers are scalded with steam. Freder comes to see the machine as a god demanding sacrifice. He rushes to see his father to tell him of the horror, but his father is only upset that his own people didn't tell him first.We are introduced to Rotwang, an inventor who was a suitor of Joh Fredersen's now dead wife, Hel. He has created a Machine Man whom he says is Hel still living. But before we can work that out, we find the school teacher, named Maria, leading a religious service with the workers. She tells them that a mediator will come to set them free peacefully. Rotwang and Joh Fredersen decide to make the Machine Man look like Maria, and trick the workers into attacking Metropolis so they can be put down with brutal force.Unknown to Joh Fredersen, Rotwang is still bitter about Hel and has set Machine Maria to not only destroy the workers, but Metropolis too. Machine Maria not only convinces the workers to destroy the machines that power Metropolis but also those that keep underground water from flooding the worker's living areas. At the same time, she uses her body as a dancer to keep the people of Metropolis too distracted to know what is going on. The workers storm the machines to the strains of La Marseillaise.The result is the destruction of the worker's homes and the imperiling of their children. When the workers realize the folly of their acts, they turn on Machine Maria and burn her at the stake as a witch.There is a silly chase at the end (the acting has been very good up until this part), where Freder saves the real Maria, then brings both the workers and the city dwellers together to fix their city.Metropolis as Christian Allegory:The most obvious example of Christian symbolism is the Whore of Babylon story from Revelation, with the Machine Maria playing the part explicitly while she is distracting the city dwellers. But there are others, too.The teacher is named Maria, a variant of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Maria is the one who finds the mediator between head and hands like Mary brings Jesus, who is said to be the mediator between God and man, into the world. In Mary's religious chapel in the depths, the symbolism is strongly Christian, with crosses and fish. One of her prayers is that ""The mediator will come"" just like prayers in the Bible that the messiah will come. The movie opens and closes with the quote: ""The mediator between head and hands must be the heart."" Freder is placed as that heart, that mediator, that savior figure who beings healing. Even pagan gods mentioned in the Bible are alluded to. The word ""Moloch"" flashes up in the scene where Freder sees the machine as a god demanding sacrifice. The Catholic Encyclopedia notes that Moloch is named in the Old Testament of the Bible as one of the pagan religions stamped out early on: ""The chief feature of Moloch's worship among the Jews seems to have been the sacrifice of children, and the usual expression for describing that sacrifice was 'to pass through the fire,' a rite carried out after the victims had been put to death.""When Joh Fredersen's right hand man is fired because of his incompetence, he is sent into the depths with the workers like a person being cast out of God's sight and being damned to Hell. Freder acts the part of the Jesus the savior by offering a job and allowing him to stay. The depths where the workers live and work look like Hell with smoke, steam, and heat. Metropolis as Foreshadowing of the Holocaust:Although Mein Kampf was published the year before the movie was released, but it would still be several years before the Nazis came to power in Germany. Nevertheless, Metropolis is an eerie foreshadowing of the work and death camps to come. Just like prisoners in a concentration camp, the workers do not have names, only numbers. They have been dehumanized to the point where they not only look and act like a part of the machines they operate, but they are numbered like parts in a catalog. When his son tells him the plight of the workers, Joh Fredersen comments that ""the workers are where they belong, in the depths"" -- sounding much like the Nazis saying Jews and other undesirables belonged in ghettos and camps. During the metaphor of the machine as Moloch requiring human sacrifice, there are dozens of men marching into the gaping, flaming maw of the god like so many concentration camp victims marching to the crematorium. Finally, during the story of the Tower of Babel that Maria tells the workers, there is a depiction of thousands of nearly naked workers who were shaved bald that looked just like concentration camp workers from the Nazi era.",Metropolis

Yes, some of the acting seems ludicrous to us, and the robot's erotic dance seems to involve a lot of shoulder hunching. I like Freder but can't help laughing at his speeded-up, elbow-pumping run. And why must the male characters, including Freder, wear obvious, thick wigs? Though it makes it possible for Joh's hair to turn white from fright as he watches his son fight on the cathedral roof . Despite the awful wigs and thick makeup, though, we do care for the characters, especially Freder and Josaphat, and even Joh, the Thin Man, Grot and Rotwang (it means Redwing).",Metropolis
242,Cloud20,Fritz Lang's Metropolis: The Coming of Science Fiction.,10,23 May 2005,"Metropolis (1927) Directed by Fritz Lang.One could say that Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" has been cut up and re-edited so many times that the whole point of the original view would be ruined. I have seen three versions of the film: The Kino DVD version, the Hollywood Classics version, and the horribly butchered Giorgio Moroder and 80's rock soundtrack version. While watching the Hollywood Classics version (my first viewing), I was still affected in the end. After seeing the Kino version, I loved it even more. But after making an awful decision by buying the Moroder version for a cheap price, I wonder, why? The color version, re-editing, cutting scenes, and 80's rock soundtrack COMPLETELY kills the vision of Fritz Lang's original classic. It is silly, confusing and nearly unwatchable.The story of ""Metropolis"" is legendary. Metropolis is a dark city in which the population is divided into two. The thinkers, the rulers and the rich of the city, who live in the buildings above. And the workers, the poor and the slaves, who work their whole life underground for the city. When one of the ""thinkers"" witnesses a fatal accident underground, he is horrified by the situation. In seeing this, he joins the beautiful Maria, leader of the workers, in an apocalyptic revolt against the thinkers.What makes ""Metropolis"" such a classic is because of it's influence on other films, such as ""Dark City"", ""Blade Runner"", ""The Matrix"", and even the background story of ""The Terminator"". It was also the first film to show a truly nightmarish look at a futuristic society. With the terms of originality, films usually don't get much better than this. In the end, I do believe that ""Metropolis"" is not only the greatest film from the 20's decade, but also my the greatest Science Fiction film in my opinion. 5 stars out of 5.",Metropolis

Nonetheless, even if the pace was too slow (I'm not an action junkie but still....), I couldn't help being awestruck by Fritz Lang's work and imagination, the plot is quite good, the visuals must have been stunning at the time the movie came out (I didn't imagine seeing special FX in 1925!!!)...

Nowadays acting actually looks real, films have dialog instead of caricaturist intertitles and exaggerated facial expressions, and, like it or not, special effects are done using computers and look much more realistic.Look, we don't wear 1920's clothes any more.

246,croweykid,Beautiful & Orwellian,9,28 July 2019,"Metropolis is an exquisite film, hands down. In 2008, the lost footage was recovered, so I was fortunate enough to see the full version (available on Youtube via public domain). Overall, I found that it has more value if we identify those posed as heroic & saintlike as ethically neutral participants in society's machine, playing a role in the amoral depiction of civilization's social cycles. It's been described as prophetic, yet it was actually tellingly reminiscent of the 1917 Bolshevik Revoluion which occurred a decade prior. Regardless, what was striking was how relevant the film remains, across cultural barriers, and nearly 92 years after its release.Nevertheless, (slight spoiler to follow) one unsettling moral takeaway might be: ""if we wait for someone to save us like good & pious working class heroes, maybe one day a rich person's son will encourage his father to shake the hand of our foremost scab.""Specifically, without completely giving away the ending:
Maria, the figure of virtue, is both the one who opiates the masses with her words, keeping them complacent with the promise that someone will someday save them from their lives of misery and toil. She is somewhat redeemed when she becomes that actual messiah figure, but only when sinister schemers and idiot mobs force her hand.The cynical take is that the trustafarian dauphin gets hip to the struggles of the masses by slumming it a bit in the service industry and hooking up with a low rent activist babe, then ineffectually begs his dudzy to stop being horrible. But frankly, they're both pretty useless until the SHTF. At which point, sure, they come into their own.More unsettlingly, we never know what happens to Georgy 1181. Josaphat, Hel & Thin Man are extraordinary & memorable secondary characters.",Metropolis

248,Cristiano-A,A masterpiece,8,2 March 2007,"One of the greatest works of German Expressionism. In the near future, the world is divided in two: the thinkers, those that do the planning and know nothing about the real functioning of things; and the workers, who reach objectives, but do not have global understanding and know nothing about planning. Alone they are nothing but together they make a strong ensemble. This super-production for the time, with scenarios of an entrancing architectonic grandeur, Metropolis is a pessimistic utopia on the future, that only love can redeem. It's a metaphor on the struggle of classes, a renewed vision of the parabola of Babel, Metropolis is smashing in its scenarios but in the same way, is dramatically emotional and human. The excellent restored copy I saw, allowed me to see the brilliant cinematography, all the games of light, the dark - bright fluctuations. I think that the limitations imposed to filmmakers by the nonexistence of sound and color, sharpened its ability to take the maximum from light effects and from the facial expressions of the actors. Seeing Metropolis today is not the same of seeing it at that time, because the technique evolved immensely. But for that time, it was brilliant. And the movie became a eternal and the android female figure of Metropolis, Maria, is now a symbol of science fiction cinema. While some criticize Fritz Lang , saying that the film is an apology of capitalism and even Nazism, he said: ""I was convoked by Goebbels (...) to know, for my great surprise, that the Minister of the Propaganda of the III Reich had been charged by Hitler to offer me the direction of all the German cinema. The Fuhrer saw Metropolis and said that this was the man who will create national-socialist cinema. In that same night I left Germany"".",Metropolis

A film impossible not to admire.  Yet each time I have seen it -- four now I think -- I always find myself bored.   The visionary sequences are too few and the melodrama grows too heavy far too often.  Scenes like Maria's flight from Rotwang become overwrought at once and then drag on long enough to be comical.  My most recent viewing was the Hollywood Classics DvD.  With so many restored versions of Metropolis around, the quality of this release was terribly disappointing.

No classic Germanic folk story, no, this is science fiction, distopian fiction and simply incredible filmmaking.The scale, the ambition, the effects, the cinematography, the tension, the way it feels astonishingly modern in parts... it is all very exciting and impressive.It might be a tad too long, especially the final act got a bit ridiculous. But perhaps it is a fool's errand to expect a Fritz Lang movie to not go all the way.

251,barhound78,A film brimming with imagination and invention,8,23 July 2006,"One of the most visually arresting films of all time, Fritz Langs Metropolis is a sci-fi masterpiece that's scope and imagination have influenced almost all that have followed it. From Star Wars to Blade Runner and even to the likes of 1984 and V For Vendetta, the vast cityscapes and nightmarish dystopian vision of the future have set the template for generation after generation of writers and directors. Perhaps only Kubricks 2001: A Space Oddysey can claim to have such a profound influence within the genre. Inspired by Langs first impression of the Manhattan skyline, Metropolis is a seemingly utopian city of immense architectural grandeur and towering skyscrapers. Those who live in this city lead an opulent, almost decadent lifestyle. They are the thinkers of society and they have almost all that they could desire. Yet deep underground below them live the workers; men and women who toil slavishly in unrelenting ten hours shifts in order to sustain the city above. It is a hellish existence that emphasises the two-tier society that has developed through the creation of this futuristic Tower of Babel. The film centres around Freder (Gustav Frolich), the sensitive son of Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel), the all-powerful Master of Metropolis. The young Freder becomes infatuated with a saintly worker woman named Maria (Brigitte Helm) and descends down into the depths to seek her out. However, once down amongst the slaves and oppressive machinery, Freder is appalled by the hardship and suffering that he witnesses. He pleads with his father to do something about the conditions yet is rebuked. So instead he goes down once again and, after taking over a workers agonising shift, he attends a meeting of workers where the raging discontent amongst them is clear. The only person keeping them from revolution is the elusive Maria herself, who speaks of peace and of finding a middle way by using the films lasting mantra... ""There can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator"" When Freder reveals himself, Maria believes she has found her mediator. Yet political machinations in the ""utopia"" above puts them in both in peril. Aware of the workers barely tempered disgruntlement, Joh Fredersen turns to his inventor friend Rotwang (Rudolph Klein-Rogge) to to kidnap Maria and to give a robot (or ""machine-man"") a likeness of her in order to instigate a rising amongst the Workers which he can subsequently crush once and for all. It's a dangerous game to play, especially as Rotwang is quite insane and harbours his own duplicitous desires to bring down Frederson and all he has built. As the revolt begins and the Workers city starts to flood it is left for Freder and Maria to lead the children left there to safety and to ultimately reunite the hands and the head. Obviously the narrative is incredibly overblown and rather contrived, yet the story of the constant battle between the oppressors and the oppressed is a timeless one. This is never more apparent than Langs masterful blending of futuristic landscapes and machinery with surreal biblical, mythical and at times medieval imagery. The toil of the Workers is imaginatively illustrated in a sequence where they transform into slaves of the Pharaohs, whilst the heights of Metropolis itself are like opulent gardens belonging to Greek gods. The zenith of civilisation itself. Metropolis truly is a film, brimming with verve, energy and an abundance of invention and imagination. The acting may clunk a little and the moral may lack subtlety, but Fritz Langs far-reaching vision, be it artistic or philosophical, never once dwindles whilst the the final rampage of the oppressed is as spectacular and as exciting as anything Hollywood has ever produced.",Metropolis

I bought it and watched it eagerly. It was DIRE. The music (by a British composer I hadn't heard) was terrible, totally removing all interest that remained after the utter tedium of watching the film was overcome. It was at least 3/4 hours too long, and such a painful slog that it took two attempts to watch all of it.I can only conclude that the 1984 version was simply a lucky fluke and credit must go to Georgio Moroder for having Van-Sant-like guts for defying establishment and turning this utter disaster into something just about passable.",Metropolis

Note the Marxist undertones, which are not at all subtle. The political commentary of the bourgeoise vs. the proletariat, and the classic David vs. Goliath theme are well conveyed.

The visuals in this movie are excellent for the time, but many people will find the overacting jarring. If you enjoy ballet and can treat Metropolis as more like a ballet than a modern movie, you will enjoy its relatively simple plot and message - if not, you may well hate it, especially since it is well over two hours.I watched the DVD from the ""Masters of Cinema"" series of the restored version and found the music soundtrack somewhat over-the-top too - it may be advisable to sample the movie in two or three sessions, as I did, rather than ploughing through it all in one go.An interesting experience.",Metropolis

No wonder why it is called a classics. Just judging from its visuals, this is much better than films coming out even 30 years later. The storytelling and performance style are a bit old for modern taste, but are not entirely outdated.

259,redrawn,A visual feast,7,17 January 2013,"Metropolis features huge, wonderfully designed sets, a cast of thousands, and great visual design. The story details a collision between classes, the poor working class, consigned to the depths, and the industrious living in the bright city above. The city is beautifully realised given the effects of the day, lights, automobiles, aeroplanes, and vast crowds living and breathing in the city, machines are superimposed on top of another in a series of endless work, the workers move in a tired trance, synchronised as if in a slow dance to the death.The move is a little too long and dawdles, instead of justifying its entire two and a half hour length. Despite this the images are captivating, the social commentary is justified, well reasoned and well presented. The references to the Tower of Babel are welcome, if a little obvious, and completely unnecessary to actually detail. Fritz Lang has particular skill at telling a story with just images, and directing his actors to give well considered performances. His visual metaphors, as workers struggle with giant clocks, or are sacrificed to the hunger of the machine, are particularly evocative.The acting is expressive, as the actors struggle to say so much, without saying anything at all. The editing and effects are good, obviously dated, but in sync with the film as not to be awkward or distracting. The costumes are designed well, and Maria the robot is superbly designed.",Metropolis
260,RWiggum,The Mother of Modern Science Fiction *Spoiler*,10,25 June 2003,"This review contains Spoilers. But since the story is by far the least reason to watch Metropolis, feel free to still read it, even if you haven't watched it yet.Metropolis is a film that was far ahead of it's time. It influenced a great lot of science-fiction films, and how The Blade Runner, Batman or Dark City would look like if there wasn't Metropolis - who knows. Even The Matrix Reloaded is heavily inspired by this classic that is as old as my grandmother. Now what is it all about? About Freder, the son of the head of the city of Metropolis, a Christ-like figure who falls in love with the preacher of the working class, a saintlike woman who happens to be named Maria. When a robot who is modeled to look like Maria makes the workers almost extinguish their city and their children, Maria and Freder save the children, and in the end Freder makes his father and the workers cooperate for a brighter future.Sounds silly to you? Yes, and that's exactly what the story is: silly. That's also the reason why, still today, Metropolis isn't accepted as the masterpiece it is by a few film buffs. But these people don't understand one thing: A good film does more than only tell a story. A film can be great even without a story at all, and a silly story combined with amazing visuals can make you forget all the other weaknesses a film has. And wow, what amazing images Metropolis offers. What an art direction! What wonderful special effects! And remember, as I already said, this film is as old as my grandmother! Just have a look at the workers. They hardly ever seem to be individuals. In the mass scenes they look like one big creature moving forward or backwards. When they are working they look more like machines than like human beings, whereas the machines resemble monsters more than they do technical devices (best seen in the moments when Freder hallucinates and sees the big machine as a worker-eating Moloch). We also see a worker (and later, Freder) work on a machine that looks like a clock with 100 blinking light bulbs, doing some that looks as exhausting as it looks senseless. Or think of Rotwang, the mad inventor who lives in a little hut that looks in this film like it was from another world. He has a black prosthesis for his right hand (it's not a coincidence that Stanley Kubrick gave his mad scientist/inventor Dr. Strangelove a prosthesis for his right hand, too). He builds the robot that he makes to look like Maria, and that transformation scene is one of the most magnificent scenes ever and looks more convincing than some scenes of modern sci-fi flicks. I also have to mention Brigitte Helm, who plays Maria and the robot - and the look in her eyes would already be enough to tell which of her characters is on screen at the moment. If something like awards already would have been given in the 1920s, she sure would have walked home with quite a bunch of them. And just look at her sexy dance! It is just as memorable as the shot of the many eyes watching her dance - or the many faces watching her preach just a few minutes later. Metropolis is a film no sci-fi-fan should miss. I had the good luck that my first viewing of Metropolis one year ago was in a cinema (when it was a re-released after its restoration). I can only recommend you to watch it in a cinema if you have the possibility to, as Metropolis is, just as 2001 - A Space Odyssey one of those rare films that are masterpieces on your TV set, but a revelation on the big screen.",Metropolis

Gogol wrote it in 1835, so there's a possibility Langwas familiar with the work -- but it's more possible the fallout fromthe industrial revolution haunted both men similarly, even 100years apart. Despite seemingly disparate themes -- the Overcoatis about an individual's flirtation with popularity after savingpennies for a new jacket, while Metropolis tackles social dystopiaon a grand scale -- the common themes and visuals are stunning.Originally produced as a movement piece for the VancouverPlayhouse, the Overcoat's one-hour TV special luckily managed tocapture the wonder of the critical acclaim on film.

This 1926 film is set in the year 2000, and takes the form of the fictional city of ""Metropolis"". Though often considered a pro-fascist film (a claim which Fritz Lang always vehemently denied), there is little to suggest that there is any intended Fascist agenda. The film once again draws on female contrast. For example, the contrast between the ""pure woman"" (Maria), and the ""impure woman"" (the robot Maria), further exemplifying the dichotomy between good and evil. Metropolis paints a negative image of mechanisation, with the machines running the city, yet mankind is worse off. The social critique is also there, with a 3 tier social structure, reflected in the habitats of the classes. The geometric mise-en-scène is seen as a representation of the rigidly ordered and structured society also. Scripted by Thea Von Harbou (Lang's wife), this film can truly be regarded as a landmark, and the first sci-film. Quoted as inspiration by many modern directors, and similarities can be seen in many areas (ie C3P0 was modelled on the Metropolis robot).

266,Dainius8888,The Mediator between the head and the hands must be the heart!,9,17 July 2011,"Probably one of the most important, original and inspirational movies, not to mention one of the oldest, in science fiction history.This picture first premiered in 1927, and since then many of the copies of the original picture have been heavily damaged, ruined or simply lost. Therefore the picture today does not equal the quality of the original which was released back then, but it definitely isn't a problem. It was only in 2008, that they found another copy of the original in Argentina with a lot of the original missing footage, which was used to restore the movie as superbly as possible. Of course not everything has been recovered, and it is highly unlikely that it will change in the near future. But having this fact in mind, it is amazing how well the movie looks. The plot is unquestionably perfect. A legendary masterpiece. It is about humanity. It's flaws, it's sins, and it's virtues. The main character, who has been living a comfortable life, discovers the 'real' world. Cruelty and harsh settings for people rule life for the majority of the city's population. 'The workers'. After witnessing the unfairness of it all, he is determined to make a change. Also, as the Metropolis is practically one huge machine, that sucks the living effort out of hard workers, there is an important element of humanity versus machinery, which is heavily essential to film's idea. More clearly speaking, the plot actually resembles ''the Matrix'' and ''Dark City''. It would be quite likely if the creators of ''the Matrix''and ''Dark City'' were inspired by ''Metropolis''. At least that's just my opinion. But of course comparing the two for anything else that the idea of the story, I believe, would be unwise, as they differ one from the other aggressively. Probably due to the fact that the the time line between the both premiers is massively huge. Exactly 72 years! So if you liked ''the Matrix'' or ''Dark City'', I can not guarantee you will enjoy ''Metropolis'' as well. However, the fact still remains that the plot's are based alike. Knowing that this WAS one of the first major sci-fi stories, it would be idiotic to neglect it's importance. It IS a must see to any film fanatic, and ESPECIALLY to a sci-fi fan.

I would like to write an interesting intellectual piece of literature about this one but I think this film is smarter than I am because of how trailblazing, groundbreaking, idea-generating, influential (you get the picture) it was/is. Regardless of if one chooses to take into account the fact that Metropolis appears formally with the numbers one, nine, two and seven beside its name, in that order, Metropolis is everything we have. What do I mean by that? It's a film that silently addresses every facet of society, imagination and human behaviour in 150 minutes like no other piece of expressive art had done before or has done since. The city in which Metropolis takes its name from is one of historically encapsulating vivacity, precision and (happenstance or not) vision. From each remarkable value Metropolis holds, others stem from it: from the setting we can ask ourselves about the models built to represent the city, built from scratch and spawned from a creative blank canvas, in a time before any such city existed or the computer technology to cast it painlessly onto a screen was invented. For many, Metropolis represents the birth of the science fiction genre, and aside from being so much more as mentioned, I feel that this feature of the film needs to be addressed. Even in silence, black and white and from an age that a child of our days would consider near-ancient, the fantastic costume of Maria's transformed character remains one of the most striking-looking fictional hero or heroine after nearly 90 years. Metaphorically, Metropolis is deeply woven with ideas of difference, segregation, oppression and revolution. For its day: it was too long for any profit motive and too outrageous for the realistic expectation to start a momentous chain reaction of a new genre (although, clearly, that was an understatement). It begs the question: was Lang trying to broadcast gospel through allegory? In the end, as the years went by, the answer to that question started to become less and less important. Because above all its philosophy and its painful intelligence, it's entertaining and extremely pleasurable to watch. Each visual is like It's like a larger than life blank canvas pinned up against the wall in a loft apartment, having sludgy acrylics of all cultures, all eras of time, and all walks of life are hurled at it whilst a lover lies on her side and watches with deep blue eyes. Metropolis will always be, without question, the greatest film of cinematography's phase one.",Metropolis

270,kbunck,The workers wanted a violent rebellion.,5,20 February 2011,"I believe that the workers rebellion in ""Metropolis"" was inevitable, robot Maria only hastened the process not started it. If you recall near the beginning of the movie, when Freder Frederson has first started working with the machines, he hears of Maria through the other workers; who act as though going to hear her speak is the last thing they want to do, after getting off of work. Their facial features and tone suggested, to me at least, that they held little respect for real Maria and her thoughts. When you see the meeting with real Maria, only about eleven workers are there listening to her speech on nonviolence rebellion. Later too, when real Maria takes the workers children to the ""Garden of Sons"" where the rich play, she tells the children to look upon their brothers, indicating that she believes the people of Metropolis are all a family and should be treated as such. This of course, does not turn out to be the prevailing opinion of Metropolis's working class. In the scene where robot Maria has taken real Marias place at the meetings, she attempts to rile the crowd into violent rebellion; the room she speaks to is packed with almost one hundred people. Showing that they would much rather listen to talk of a violent rebellion than that of a peaceful one. In fact they are so entranced by this talk of violence, that in their attempt to make it happen they temporarily forget about their children that are still in the workers underground city. So entranced are they by the thought of finally punishing the rich of Metropolis that they do not stop to question the consequences of their own actions, or why Maria after preaching nonviolence for so long would suddenly change her stance. The only explanation for this is that robot Maria was giving the workers what they had wanted all along a quick way to show their aggression and displeasure to the rich of Metropolis by taking away their pleasures, the machines.",Metropolis
271,parkermenn,tooooo loooong,4,19 February 2011,"Metropolis was a two and half hour long silent movie. I was hoping to have my socks wowed off by an incredible classic movie (because of the way our professor hyped it as the silent era's Avatar). Nothing could be farther from the truth. After an hour or so I could barely stand it. Another thirty minutes go by and I begin to seriously contemplate walking out. But I couldn't just leave. It wasn't that I was interested in the movie but I had already invested too much time to leave and not get credit for being there. The last hour was a test of my will. I was antsy and I was jittery but I stayed and I got my damn credit. The movie was not that awful it just didn't warrant two and a half hours of screen time. So far the silent movies we have seen have been one hour maximum. This was just too much.Like I said the movie wasn't all awful. If I forget the agonizing length of the silent Metropolis I can see a few positive things it had going for it. I loved the machine woman Hel. I think her name foreshadows what she does in the movie because she basically lets all hell loose on the city by inciting the workers.The story spends a lot of time on the workers and the machines. The time it spends up top deals almost exclusively with the mastermind behind the city Joh Fredersen. The workers are basically rising up against and destroying the system he has built, but the two never come into direct contact. It is as if such a confrontation of the lowly with the high brow is unthinkable and that is why there must be a mediator. I would have rather seen an invasion of the upper-class lifestyle by the rioting workers.",Metropolis
272,weatherl-josh,Metropolis: A Modern Classic Years Before It's Times,9,26 April 2011,"I must warn you before reading my review: I really, really like this film. It is absolutely incredible. With that being said, my review will likely be biased. I think I like this film for several reasons. Firstly, I think this is one of the only black and white films I've ever seen that actually makes use of black and white film stock. The contrast between images is so crisp and clean, it is visually stunning and artistically executed. It is an absolute pleasure to watch it for that reason alone; black and white has quite a bit of depth when done correctly; this film is no exception to that rule. In terms of the actual narrative of the film, it is easy to watch, and translates well for a western audience of any age. The narrative is laden with messages of the dangers of blatantly following any ideology and putting too much faith in technology. The climax of the film, in which the lower levels of the city are being filled with water and the children of the workers are in danger of being drown, is one of my favorite scenes in the film; it is executed very well, and even seems to contain some elements of montage filmmaking in the way it is cut.The acting also is executed quite well; it has a bit of a theatric flare, but still is quite believable. It, overall, adds to the overall phantasmagorical feel of the film and helps the viewer become immersed into the world of Metropolis. Overall, an excellent film for anyone. There is a lot of depth to be explored, but it also is just enjoyable to watch without going into the details of the subversive meaning behind the film.",Metropolis
273,finchy9-976-77969,Metropolis,6,21 February 2011,"Metropolis is a German expressionist film made by Fritz Lang. It is a visually extraordinary film for its time. You could almost consider it the Avatar of the 1920's. But then again it's like Avatar in more ways than one. One it spent a ton of money on the set design and production of this movie. It is said that Metropolis spent over half of the studios annual budget just to create this masterpiece, and it definitely paid off. The architecture of the great wonder city is brilliant. It truly grasps the vastness and wonderment of a futuristic city. The story however is not revered as being so in depth. This might have been because Fritz Lang built the reputation of the movie too much, I don't know. All I know is that Metropolis has gone down in history as being one of the most expensive, and visually groundbreaking films ever to be put on the screen, exactly like Avatar. I tend to agree with the critics. I did not think that the story was awful by any means, I thought it explored the aspects such as Christianity and romanticism. I thought the robot was a great human metaphor as people do always appear to be who they really are on the inside. The part of people that only themselves and their makers know is a self that is hardly ever revealed. But as far as the story being silly at some times, and just sort of boring at others, is what really gave it a negative effect for me, and once I got past the awe of the set design I soon became tired of the movie. So I believe the greatest amount of credit goes to the design team here. They are truly the ones who provided the label of ""masterpiece"" to this film.",Metropolis
274,cking-37-372041,Best movie ever.,10,26 April 2011,"Fritz Lang's The Complete Metropolis is one of the best silent movies of all time. This film was the most expensive of its time and it really pays off, but it is a shame that it was mostly overlooked back in the day. I had the opportunity of watching this film in a screening series and I am so happy that I was able to have that opportunity. I had never heard of this spectacular movie before this, and I can't believe it has taken this long. The movie overall was exciting and haunting at times. The characters were showcased by superb acting and it is very apparent throughout the film the immense skills each actor contains. The film loses no points on acting or over dramatization. The film contains many crazy scenes; it is almost like being inside crazy persons head for a day. The plot is intense and suspenseful; you stay on your toes the entire screening. In addition, this films score is awesome, everything is fast pace, but you still continue to feel like you are in the movie. One of the main characters Hel is just intense throughout the movie and captures the facial expressions of a sadistic human being. I found it very interesting to watch her in the movie because she looked possessed each time she was filmed. When thinking about the time period when this movie was made it is almost remarkable to think that one could accomplish so much with little technology that we have today. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. I greatly enjoyed it and look forward to watching it again soon. This is one of the best movies of all time, and I can easily choose this movie over big newer block buster's such as Avatar. Watch this movie you will not be sorry the visuals, props, expressions are worth everything!",Metropolis
275,eksrox-40-902286,Summary and Review,5,28 April 2011,"Metropolis is a film full of symbolism and radial thought. When this silent science-fiction movie came out, it was far beyond its time with the technical side and the conceptual side. German Expressionism is clearly expressed here. The main theme was how technology is taking over the lives of people and their jobs, and how monopolies are not good. It is a long and bizarre movie with a futuristic setting. The movie shows two distinct classes. One is the thinkers and the other are the workers. It emphasizes how the elite live many levels higher than the working class and poor. The workers are depicted as having a mundane, repetitive, cruel, and non-stop lifestyle that is constantly monitored. There is much tension between these two and this leads to an overall revolution and take down of the factory that runs the city. One of the messages it is sending is that people should be able to think for themselves, use their own creativity, and be allowed to move up in the work force. A mad scientist clones the main character, which is a young woman. She represents evil and temptation. Her evil twin leads the workers into revolting and destroying their work place to make a point. They are so caught up in the fact that their life is about to change, they don't take into consideration until the end that they are destroying the city along with the factory, because that factory is what the city runs on.",Metropolis
276,wadih_ws,Metropolis,7,30 April 2011,"Fritz Lang's The Complete Metropolis was indeed a film to remember, because it was a film that showed the difference between the working class and the wealthy class. This video, unlike most films that take place in present or past, takes place in the future where it's all about skyscrapers, state of the art train stations that go high up to where you get a view of the city. It's the life of a young man named Freder, whose life seems made. He doesn't have to work, doesn't have to worry about a thing then when he first see's a woman (Maria) in which he immediately falls in love is when his life takes a dramatic turn. From there all he wants is to be with her, and he risks everything to do it. Joh Frederson (Freder's father) and his most trusted man, the Inventor, go on to find this woman to end Freder's run. Near the end, the story takes another turn to where the inventor betrays Joh Frederson and things go on from there to where the working class' homes start to get flooded all these things go on at once to where at the end Freder and Maria are together. I honestly found the movie predictable, nothing out of the ordinary that you see in other films, but that doesn't keep the movie from being good. The movie was a entertaining to say the least from somewhere near the start to the finish and it may be one of the better Sci-Fi movies out there. The only films I could think of to be better would be the Star Wars trilogy, but it's honestly difficult to compare films made in different times and different styles. But all and all this film was entertaining to watch this film.",Metropolis
277,jrmontalvo3,"Metropolis, Greatest Sci-Fi",8,9 May 2011,"Metropolis was a movie in the silent era, also in the era of German expressionism where during the period of recovery following World War I, the German film industry was booming. However, because of the hard economic times, filmmakers found it difficult to create movies that could compare with the lush, extravagant features coming from Hollywood. So keep in mind while viewing this film that it was placed in the German expressionism period. In Metropolis it is placed in a futuristic city, in this futuristic city many people put in hard working hours to keep the machines working, so that there city doesn't fall apart or cause mayhem. The story takes place following the son of John Frederson who is the master of Metropolis, the son wants to find a woman he met and express his love to her, but his father will not allow him. Throughout this movie, the son switches place with a worker and endures the hard working conditions that a lot of the employees can't even handle. Later in Metropolis, you find out that the evil doctor has created a robot that can transform into the sons love, and this robot pretends to be the woman whom everyone looks up to. Towards the end of the movie the robot causes a riot by shutting down the machines in order to stop the factory from working, once the citizens succeed little did they know that by doing so the kids they left at home would be in grave danger of being flooded out. Luckily the true lady and John's son save all the children and the citizens get the robot and destroy her. This film is an excellent sci-fi putting in many never before seen special effects, and even today watching this makes you feel like you are a part of that futuristic life.",Metropolis
278,cocomariev,Great Science Fiction story that gives a negative view of society,7,10 May 2011,"Fritz Lang's science fiction film, Metropolis vividly portrays a negative view of future society. First off, I am not really a fan of science fiction films, but I must say that this movie a must see. Lang did a fabulous job at filming this movie and really had me thinking about the negative views of technology that we fail to see. It is scary how this movie was shot in 1927 because it really captures the haunting effects that technology has over society that we failed to see. Although Fritz Lang is a bit over dramatic on his view of technology doesn't mean he wasn't right about his predictions. The workers through out the film are portrayed as lifeless machines that are forced to work countless hours without breaks. I thought this was interesting because it portrays our society today. With the number of innovations that exist today, we are forced to become available at all times, no matter where we are. The shots and angles that Lang uses are stunning. The machines and special effects are also very effective at portraying technology as a monster. Brigitte Helm did a fantastic job at playing Maria and the robot. The use of light and shadows are also perfectly placed throughout a number of scenes. A perfect example of this use was when Rotwang follows behind Maria. Lang did a fantastic job with this scene. It has me sitting at the edge of my seat. Again, this was one of my favorite science fiction movies by far. I am generally not too fond of silent films either, but Lang did a great job at capturing my attention. I definitely think that Metropolis is a film that everyone must see. I still can't believe it was shot during the 1920's. It is haunting and makes us think twice about technology and its effect on society.",Metropolis

Actually, I never really seen a silent film until METROPOLIS, unless you count THE ARTIST. Like most people, my first impression would be that silent films are boring. But I was wrong...METROPOLIS took me completely by surprise. I was impressed at how advance the special effects are. The set design of the city is fantastic, looks very similar to something you would seen in Sci-Fi films today. The story is original with a powerful message. Though the performances of the actors are a bit over the top, which I suppose is to be expected in silent films. Also some lost parts of the film were recovered and restored, so the transitions of different qualities throughout is a bit distracting.Overall, METROPOLIS is a great film ahead of its time.

I saw it a few years ago late one night and thought ""that's alright"" but never really apreciated it until I bought the video which I now understand to be one of many edits (84 mins from 1991) but I am very happy with this version of Fritz Langs classic and EVERYONE should see this for the drama, the tension and excitement that is METROPOLIS!",Metropolis

Fritz Lang was the most brilliant visual director of his day, and is one of the most brilliant of all time. The storyline, the set design, the characters, the message... all of it is outstanding.It's sad that there are people who will never see this movie only because it is so old.Also great is the rerelease from the 80s with the Giorgio Moroder soundtrack. The restoration, colour tinting (not colorized, mind you, just tinting) and occasional sound effects add beautifully to the atmosphere.

282,kaleidoscope_eyess,ahistorical,9,23 July 2019,"My disappointment with Metropolis stems from its failure to understand European history. Aside from a few campy performance, Metropolis qualifies as one of the all-time best sci-fi movies. However, a movie produced in interwar Germany, Metropolis lacks proper understanding of Belle Epoque and the Great War. The first ten minutes of Metropolis is sheer brilliance: it reminds us of everything of industrialization, modernity, class conflict, etc. A tour de force, the few clips are reminiscent of Futurist Manifesto (1909). The problem is, just as the Futurist Marinetti ignores the incompatibility between old regime and new empires, it seems to me that Lang disregards the tensions between empires, races and ethnicities. In Lang's vision, class conflict is the only true problem in a highly industrialized society. Later in the film, he promptly turns away from socialism/communism by showing his contempt for working-class men, depicting them as irrational rioters. It also discomforts me that even after the tormenting WWI, Lang still approaches common people as a group of faceless men without individual needs and shared humanity. I am not necessarily implying that Lang approves of fascism, but his lack of historical perspective mildly reduces my pleasure in watching this film.",Metropolis

In any case, whatever I had seen before had nothing like the clarity and beauty of the Kino restoration.  I expected to be distracted by the restoration's technique of concise written descriptions of missing sequences, but the narrative coherence that these provided was definitely worth it.  As ""exaggerated"" as the style of acting seems by contemporary standards, some performances, such as the Master of the city, are amazingly nuanced and layered, and Brigitte Helm is stunning as both Maria and her evil clone. The meticulous design of the film, the unerring camera placement and Lang's muscular choreography of the crowd scenes are breathtaking. I'd thought of METROPOLIS as a curiosity (""important"" = ""dull"") but now I've come to appreciate it as the seminal work it has always been.",Metropolis
284,Lionel M.,Few movies can do what this can.,10,1 June 2000,"""Metropolis"" is by far one of the greatest films ever made. It is not only entertaining, but deeply true.The sets of this masterpiece were large, cold, and formidable. And the black-and-white film accentuated that aspect, giving the feeling to the audience member the environment of a cold and heartless future.The beginning scene (which is quite famous) where the shift change takes place really spells out (to me) what working-class life can be (just me, I come from one). The scene also made me think that our educational system is set up like that on ""Metropolis"". The students are the workers and the faculty are the ""Super Trustee"".As the film continued, I continued liking it more so. I liked Freder the best because he felt sympathy for the workers, unlike his father, John Fredersen (who ran Metropolis). He (Freder) even offered to work one of the machines for a tired worker. That shows great sympathy I think.Also, I liked how they introduced a staple of modern sci-fi films, the robot. I was amazed on how odd the robot looked, blocky but strangely human.Another thing that caught my eye in this film was all the machines. Scads and scads of them every where. That was one thing my friend told me about before I watched this film was the amount of machines in the movie. I guess that was to hammer in the idea that this was supposed to be the future.""Metropolis"" definitely inspired many films and film-makers. It inspires me to say the least.

285,Cadriel,Unsurpassed Science Fiction.,10,15 June 2001,"Last summer, I'd picked up the Madacy version (packaged as the ""Excelsior Collector's Edition"" from the ""Hollywood Gold"" line at the modest price of $6.99) of Fritz Lang's classic.  It took a while before I could get through it, but once I could, I fell in love.  (You see, the Madacy version runs at a moderate frame rate, but is low-quality black & white with a horrible soundtrack.)  I knew then that this was a great work of art.Today, I lucked into the Giorgio Moroder version of Metropolis in a video store that was having a closing sale.  Produced in the mid-'80s, with tinting and a very '80s soundtrack, the Moroder version (running at, surprise surprise, around 80 minutes) was, to my mind, clearly a better version:  it was a better picture, had different missing scenes, and the colorizing made it much easier on the eyes.I'm told that the Kino International version is superior to the Madacy version in terms of video quality, and you may want to check it out--it runs at about 90 minutes.  The Madacy version runs 115 minutes, and a version I'm told is quite inferior, by JEF Films, runs 139 minutes.  The differences are mostly due to frame rate, and a variety of other factors (like Moroder's version lacking separate screens for title cards, subtitling them instead, or the various scenes each version has) make up for the rest.  For the time being, the Kino and Madacy are probably your best bet, but a DVD is forthcoming with a new restoration plus Moroder's.  Just remember, don't judge it by run time.Metropolis is a visionary work of silent film.  It is accused by some of having fascist/nazi motives, but in all honesty the film seems to come down hard on both the totalitarian elites and the riotous workers. Both sides of society are rotting from lack of contact, and it is all falling apart unless they meet in the middle.Fritz Lang establishes himself as a visual genius, and the visuals rule in Metropolis.  The sets, the skyline, everything...other visual masterpieces of SF, like Star Wars and Blade Runner, probably won't date as well as Metropolis has.  The very expressionism in the workers and the factory is a sense of desperation more than being quiet sheep, and the characters are all brilliantly played.  You must see this movie if you are to believe it, and only rarely will you be reminded that this is 1926.No science fiction piece has ever gotten past Metropolis as far as visuals or ideas are concerned, for the time.  Take the time to take it in, and remember:  it was all original back then.",Metropolis
286,TheMovieCritic_83,Bursting at the seams.,10,26 June 2007,"'Metropolis' is absolutely one of the greatest films ever made. Fritz Lang's vision of an apocalyptic future, is one of the best examples of cinematic art in existence. Time has done nothing to reduce the film's impact. It is probably the most electrifying film to date.The story is set in 2026, in a time where society has split into two classes. The workers, who simply exist below ground level, keeping the city functioning, and the rulers of the city and the upper-class citizens who live in luxury above. The ruler's son, Freder, while indulging at the 'Club of the Sons', is curious when a woman from down below visits, surrounded by a group of young boys. It is at this moment that Freder is moved to visit the worker's environment. He tells his father of the distress that he finds and eventually becomes part of a rebellion that will finally unite both classes.What Fritz Lang created in 1926 is truly incredible. It is mind-boggling at how modern it still is. And as far as art is concerned, this is a film that is bursting at the seams. It is however, ridiculous that the film was labelled as a flop on its release. It is even more outrageous that a good chunk of footage from the original print of the film is now irretrievably lost because the film was re-edited. Although it has been restored as much as possible, it is such a shame that it is incomplete.'Metropolis' is a film that has made more sense and has become more understood as time has passed. It is now greatly praised and has rightly been given the honour as the greatest German film from the silent era.",Metropolis
287,the-oldgoat,Who needs cgi?,8,17 October 2017,"OK, its a daft title, but I finally got to watch this - the 90th anniversary version - and it was a mind blowing experience. You have to really watch and concentrate on the action, the flow of the story, and realise that in the days of the silent film, there was very little dialogue and a lot of very expressionistic acting,miming, and those apparently silly #exaggerated# poses had a really purpose to them.Within the restored film, complete with the grainy sections recovered from a print found in Argentina, there is a complex story of a ""dystopian"" future city - gridlocked roads, multilevel railways, a sky full of aircraft, an elite class of city managers, armies of drone-like workers, and three people who turn it all on its head.Matte, miniatures, overlays, all here, all clearly show where their influence would appear decades later. A lot of the camera work is fixed, but some segments, like Maria being chased through the catacombs by Rotwang, appear to be hand-held, and really jolt you.Some sections of the film contain amazing choreography - the wild dance of the workers in the ruins of the machine, Marian, as the 'Maschinenmensch' doing an exotic dance for the crude elite.I watched Bladerunner (final cut) the other week. Its not so different to Metropolis - the restored cut of the film is vastly better then the 'general release' one - but Metropolis gave me a lesson in how to watch, how to really watch.Its not for everyone. No film is, but take the time to try it, without distractions.And please, Hollywood, this is not one to eye up for a remake! Trust me, its way out of your league!",Metropolis
288,dundaswest,future is not friendly,10,12 January 2007,"Directed by great German director Fritz Lang in 1927.Metropolis is considered one of the best science fiction movie ever made, it is a masterpiece and great example of the German Expressionism.In the film, director Fritz Lang created two different world .The world of the workers who live in underground factory and the upper class society who control the city and the workers .In the underground world, slavery workers use their hands the control the machines and work 10 hours with inhuman conditions. In surface, people enjoy the life of the mega city with flying ships, beautiful gardens and extremely modern facilities.Film begins showing workers when changing their shifts and their mechanical movements which represent their slavery positions in the society. However, the story of Metropolis is about the young guy called freder .His father, Joh Federesen, is in charge of the city and owner of the factory. One day, when Freder is looking for true happiness he sees Maria with children of the workers .Maria is a school teacher and mediator between two worlds. Because of her, Freder decides to discover the workers world and witnesses their terrible conditions. To prevent the rebellion, he hires a mad scientist to create a robot like Maria.Considering the special effects conditions in 1920's, effects, decorations and details in the movie is magnificent. Huge sets, the machine man, flying ships, skyscrapers are very convincing and effective.Biblical imagery of the movie is also primary key for the story. Good Maria as Virgin Mary which represents pureness, Jesus like freder, the son, who tries to save people and the city and heartless father rules his own world in the skyscraper and he has a power to destroy everything which represents apocalypse.Actor performances in the Metropolis are almost same as the other expressionist silent movies. Over-dramatic scenes, exaggerated emotions and body movements fairly express the characters situation. Sound effect and classical music in the Metropolis give enough excitement to audience As a part of the German expressionism, director Fritz Lang has made deep shadows and lights which creates very cold and disturbing ambiance.In a cinematic perspective, I believe that Metropolis has started to science fiction genre and influenced many other movies such as Blade Runner, Dark City, Star wars, artificial intelligence, fifth element etc. In a social perspective, unfortunately, we can still see the struggle between rich and poor and the gap between them which is getting wider day by day",Metropolis

Both are currently on re-release with extra footage added, Metropolis has an extra 25 minutes of film, Avatar has an extra 9 minutes.

Add to that the fact it was on a 14-inch television I purchased for £25 whilst at University (the brand name could possibly have been Sorny or Panasonix). Not exactly the best way to view any film but it was still painfully clear how original, relevant and important Fritz Langs masterpiece really was.Fast forward a few years and I have the pleasure of enjoying Metropolis on a cinema screen and with 25 minutes of lost footage added. What was originally an important film to watch for anyone who loves cinema has become more than that. This landmark vision of the future is truly great on almost every level.A silent film made in the 1920's is not going to appeal to most of the cinema going masses, and it shouldn't, its not for everyone and takes some effort on the part of the viewer to really become immersed in. But if you like something with a little more depth than Piranha 3D and are willing to invest almost two and a half hours in an 80 year old film, Metropolis rewards you with images that stay in your mind for years.Most aspects of the film have been pastiched, homaged and sometimes just plagiarized in sci-fi films since its first release. From the beautiful dystopian city set design (Dark City, Blade Runner, The Fifth Element) to the robotic Maria (Star Wars, The Terminator) to the mechanical arm (Dr. Strangelove). The character of Rotwang became the paradigm for almost every 'mad-scientist' character in cinema since.The IFI will be running a season entitled 'After Metropolis' until the 19th of September. The fact that it includes Brazil, Dark City, Dr Strangelove or :How I stopped Worrying and Love the Bomb and some of the other greatest science fiction films of all time, is testament to the influence Metropolis has had on cinema.For those who have seen it before, the opportunity to see a restored version of Metropolis on the big screen is not to be missed. For those who haven't, but have an interest in German Expressionism, Science Fiction or film in general, it's an absolute must. The only downside being that any film watched after this will somehow seem slightly dull and insignificant.",Metropolis
290,angus-lamont,Wow...,10,19 October 2017,"I watched this film for the first time last night (courtesy of the stunning Eureka! Blu- Ray) and was totally blown away. This film was light-years ahead of its time in terms of its filmmaking techniques. I can definitely see how films such as ""Blade Runner"" and ""Star Wars"" were influenced by this masterpiece.

291,jeffro517-783-121956,A film student's view...,10,14 September 2013,"In 2026 Metropolis is run by the wealthy industrialists who have enslaved the working class in an underground world. When Joh Frederson's (Abel) son Freder (Fröhlich) is lured into the worker's world, he witnesses a horrible accident and begins to have a crisis of conscience. Now he's decided to trade places with one of the workers to better understand their plight. This decision leads to a bigger crisis when he falls in love with a prophetess (Helm) who threatens everything his father has worked for. As his father seeks to destroy the young woman and the people who have followed her, he also threatens the existence of all the working people in Metropolis.Metropolis is a visually stunning film. Fritz Lang (M) essentially created the science-fiction film genre when he co-wrote and directed this epic film. The movie was produced in Germany at cost of five million Reichsmarks, making it the most expensive movie produced up to that point. The result is a large-scale epic that tells a tale of a futuristic world ruined by industry. This would also be a major building block for Lang, a director who made the transition to American films under his contract with MGM.The acting in a silent film is all about body language and facial expressions. This movie displays great acting by all of the people involved. It definitely has a melodramatic feel, but that's something common to most silent films. Brigitte Helm (L'argent), Alfred Abel (Phantom), and Gustav Fröhlich (Asphalt) do a great job as the three main characters. Lang also worked well with the massive number of extras that included over five hundred children.Classic movies are often lost due to age and damage. The film wasn't made to last for 100 years, and unfortunately this has cost us many of the classic films of the early years of movie making. Thankfully, this movie was saved through hard work and a lot of luck. Most recently a copy of this film was located in Argentina and allowed restoration work to be done that brought back a lot of missing footage.If you're a fan of classic movies and you haven't seen this one, I think it's a must-see movie. This puts early innovation on display as Lang stretched the technology and the art of cinema to the breaking point. This isn't a short movie or an easy one to watch. I would recommend this for people who want to see some of the best early feature film-making. I give this one 5 out of 5 stars.",Metropolis
292,bjornet,An old movie worth seeing,7,7 February 2001,"I must admit that I saw this movie mostly because I thought it would be cool to see an old movie. Although visual effects and sound are areas that have improved a lot since the early years of film-making, I thought that the plot, the directing and the acting of an old movie might be as good as it is in films made today. But unlike other areas of art, like photography or literature, the art of film has really changed to the better over the years.
Although Fritz Lang's movie is worth seeing, it is not nearly as well-produced or well-directed as many movies are today. In fact, Metropolis is somewhat of a disappointment. The acting is almost non-existent and the movie focuses far too much on the big scenes, missing out important details.I should say, however, that the political message of the film never gets out of date. If the scenes of Metropolis are considered being symbolic, the futuristic vision of Lang's movie has in some ways become reality.",Metropolis

So I finally got to see this movie, and I wasn't disappointed at all. And what stuns me the most, and I know this might have been said in previous comments, is that this movie was done in 1927, but it's vision of the future could still, in this day and age, be a vision of the future.

294,Joe_Chip_627,LANGmark Film,9,24 November 2009,"Fritz Lang's masterpiece, and one of the most influential of all films, ""Metropolis"" is a stunning portrait of a futuristic city. With the look later adopted by ""Minority Report"", ""I, Robot"", and practically everything of the sort, Metropolis is ruled by Joh Fredersen, whose son Freder enjoys the privileged life of the Club of the Sons and the entertainment district, among other things. One day, Freder ventures into the area of the machines, where workers are forced to work grueling ten hour shifts before returning to their small, overpopulated city, which by the way is underground, away from the privileged. The only thing keeping the workers from revolting is Maria, a young woman who preaches a mediator who will serve as the ""heart"" between the head and the hands. Freder becomes this mediator, although it is not without a serious threat to the entire city from Rotwang, a maniacal inventor who plans to destroy Metropolis. Full of biblical allusions such as the Tower of Babel, ""Metropolis"" sets the precedent for all science fiction. The ""Matrix"" trilogy is a perfect example of something that owes its existence to ""Metropolis"". The visuals are absolutely stunning when one considers that this was made 80 years ago. With these visuals and a great story, even someone who doesn't much care for silent cinema will find ""Metropolis"" worth watching.",Metropolis
295,jon-fougner-966-434081,How Music Supports the High/Low Symbolism of Metropolis's Marxist Message,6,5 March 2013,"Clocking in at 148 minutes, the restored print of Fritz Lang's Metropolis (Universum Film 1927) (available streaming on Netflix) is a marathon to watch. Otto Harzner's relentless orchestral strings keep the show on the road, but they also make it an exhausting two-and-one-half- hours of cinema. Besides making up for the lack of dialog, the score supports Lang's Marxist dichotomy between the rulers up top and the workers down below.Work underground, like the soundtrack coloring it, just doesn't let up. Especially unrelenting is the music when these slaves are death-marched into the mouth of the industrial beast. Perhaps Lang's point is: never mind your hardship as the viewer-listener, just think of these poor souls! When capitalist uberlord Joh Fredersen's (Alfred Abel) newly enlightened son Freder (Gustav Fröhlich) ventures down there to see his ""brothers,"" deep drums and shrill strings carry a frenetic energy of an underclass whose sole cognizable goal is daily survival. Diagonals, triangles and oblique arrows translate this discordance visually. The workers toil like rhythmic puppets, moving with a stoic staccato that might be familiar to the modern viewer from the Blue Man Group.Not everything in this hell is in a minor key. At worship, ethereal, melodious strings carry us up the Tower of Babel into the heavens, and in comes the full orchestra. But like the language of the faithful in that story (Genesis 11:1-9), this musical tongue is soon to be confused. ""One man's hymns of praise became another man's curses,"" Lang teaches. Indeed, the first truly church-sounding music comes immediately after the intermezzo; it's no subtle irony that the accompanying visuals are skeletons of the seven deadly sins.Up above, the flute and triangle provide sparks of genius and intrigue to the DPs' (Lang had three) photography of C.A. Rotwang (Rudolf Klein- Rogge), the inventor, at work in his Frankensteinian lab. While electricity fires on all cylinders, sweeping strings suggest a trance state. (These might recall, for the modern viewer, James Horner's triumph in A Beautiful Mind (Universal 2001).) But there's trouble in paradise, and soon after, arpeggios capture Freder's vertigo at seeing Maria (Brigitte Helm) in his father's office.These two social classes are on a dialectical collision course that seems destined for war. So when Machine-Maria is about to speak in worker city, a drumroll and trumpets imply militancy. Harzner delivers more of the same when the proles storm the heart machine: this is an invasion. A biblical flood ensues, and survival proves—surprise, surprise—to be all about climbing. Lang counter-cuts to the rotten euphoria up top, where a tinny triangle and effusively poppy strings underscore how out-of-tune the ruling class are. Minor chords battle major ones until the film culminates in a successful final mediation between labor and capital. Brokered by whom? The next generation, of course. They always find the new music.PostscriptThere's an eerie resemblance between the modern musician and Joh Fredersen. With demigods like trio Swedish House Mafia, so-called ""progressive house"" music has continued its meteoric surge in 2013. North America's leading electronic music concert, the Ultra Music Festival, anticipates 330,000 attendees as compared to half that many last year. To whom do these acolytes pray? Not the simian guitar smashers of the 1990s or the aerobic pop icons of the 2000s. No, they prostrate themselves instead before the DJ. Serene, this new superstar perches before an array of buttons, any one of which can summon the work of others and project it, writ large, across the throng. That's the same sort of leverage Joh commanded, 86 years ago, sitting at his proto- computer console. And to similar effect: a mechanized, synchronized throbbing of the masses. Some call it slavery. But some, including the genre's minor-key precursor Nine Inch Nails, say there's ""happiness in slavery.""",Metropolis
296,chrisgomez_01,"Gorgeous score and mesmerising acting, but a questionable argument",9,20 September 2011,"Having missed the epic 2010 restoration (which added about 25 minutes of material back from a newly-discovered, low-quality 16mm print) upon its release, I was pleased to be able to catch it a year later at a local cinema as part of a science fiction series.What I liked most about the film was Gottfried Huppertz's exquisite score, which has strong themes, and is richly orchestrated and very prominent. The love theme between Freder and Maria is particularly lovely, and the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra's sometimes audible page-turns add greatly to the atmosphere.This is the first silent film I've seen (other than Christmas Charlie Chaplin fare as a kid), and it was intriguing to see how much could be expressed with only body language and the sparing use of intertitles. Brigitte Helm in particular did a remarkable job of playing both Maria and the robot - two very different roles - especially now that I discover that she would only have been about 20 at the time.The central opinion that the film promotes, repeatedly and pretty forcefully, is that ""There can be no understanding between the hands (the workers) and the brain (the ruling class) unless the heart (a third party) acts as mediator."" I'm not sure that I go along with the idea that using a mediator will solve the problems of workers being oppressed by their bosses, as if it were all just a misunderstanding. But it's a start, and watching the argument play out for two and a half hours is a lovely way to spend a Sunday afternoon.",Metropolis
297,MetroMike,You've Never Seen Metropolis Before,10,16 May 2010,"If you've seen Metropolis before, you only thought you saw it. The newly restored ""Complete"" Metropolis is, for today's viewers, entirely new and a masterpiece. It's not just the 30 minutes of lost footage discovered in Argentina (although this includes wonderful scenes -- mad inventor Rotwang's shrine to Hel, the woman he loved, the harrowing details of how Freder and Josaphat rescue the children of the workers from the flood, how the angry crowd chases the real Maria and winds up catching the false one, and many, many more).But perhaps more important is that the discovery of an unbutchered print of Metropolis enabled the restorers to reorganize the existing footage and fill in formerly incomprehensible gaps in the plot, so for the first time we have the film with scenes and titles in their original order. The special effects of Metropolis were always dazzling, but the plot never entirely made sense. Now it does, and the imagery is more spectacular than ever.The missing reels of Greed may never be found, the original ending of The Magnificent Ambersons may be lost forever, but -- against unbelievable odds -- we now have back the Metropolis that the first audiences saw in 1927 and no one ever saw again.

302,hondaboy,"Obviously a landmark, with enduring relevance to society",8,13 September 2002,"""What? It's black-and-white? From 1927? And German? Well, I'll never watch that.""Such would be the average response from the average person regarding Metropolis, Fritz Lang's masterwork. Be assured, it is not the average film.As with most older films, we must first remember that what you see on screen had never been visualized in such a way before. Thus, the sheer thought of such stunning ideas as airborne walkways between buildings, entire cities underground, or even the ability to use TV cameras and ""see"" into other rooms (TV didn't hit the big time until the 1940s), was absolutely incredible.And it's shocking that Lang's vision of our modern world would prove so accurate, 70-odd years hence. You will recall that skywalks are fairly common in large cities, airplanes have become far too prevalent, places like Walt Disney World actually do have ""workers' cities"" underground and TV - well, I won't go into TV. And the fact that all of the incredible effects still have the power to awe viewers today, without the use of complex animation or computer graphics, makes the film a treat to watch.The plot is fairly formulaic by modern standards, though it was stirring stuff for the poor and disadvantaged majority of Germany's inhabitants in 1927. Young Freder Fredersen, privileged son of city leader John Fredersen, has an epiphany of sorts when he finds out about the subhuman treatment of the underground workers who keep the city of Metropolis alive. Disillusioned by his father's uncaring attitude toward them, Freder leaves his comfortable surroundings and decides to live underground. To his surprise, the young man discovers a small but influential resistance movement led by the beautiful and mysterious Maria.Maria turns out to be the central point of the story once properly introduced, embodying obvious references to religion (as a way to appease the monotony of daily life). But, later on, she also embodies the problem of centralized power when under her (?) control, the workers finally revolt with perhaps an unintended result.Freder, of course, represents the transformation of man into man-as-machine by uprooting himself from a palatial garden of Eden (literally) and descending into the workings of the massive power plant that keeps Metropolis running. Lang's concept of such a transformation is brilliantly realized in the towering control room where exhausted workmen robotically transfer back and forth along a series of dials and switches, acting only as a ""human valvetrain"" of sorts in an effort to appease the machine. Another device, the ""clock-wheel"", forces Freder to continually keep up with time as each second must be marked by the pull of a lever. Though implausible in design, the wheel is a visible indication of man's futile struggle to beat the clock and work harder.If nothing else, Lang managed to promote the cause of the laborer, though the ending (as well as certain plot points leading to it) is fairly hard to believe given the apparently hopeless situation of the workers and the chilling indifference of the elite.Metropolis is definitely worthwhile, not just for its groundbreaking technical achievements but also for its (sadly) historical impact. It must be mentioned that this was reported to have been Adolf Hitler's favorite film. And while his own plot to free Germany's workers from oppression perhaps began with a noble goal, Hitler's own maniacal and misguided views on race relations and political conduct proved to be horribly destructive for the world as a whole.It would be unfair to say that Lang's impressive achievement managed to cause World War II all on its own, because such a murderous outcome was probably not what the director hoped would result. Like all films, Metropolis must be seen with an eye toward the times in which it was created. It was a fabulous commentary on an overly-technological society back then, and it remains so - perhaps being even more relevant today.Four stars - a classic, and for good reason.",Metropolis

For its role in the history of the cinema, it'd be 10/10.As with other innovative films of the pioneering era, such as Birth of a Nation, The Odessa Steps, Citizen Kane and so on, aspects of Metropolis did a lot to advance the medium of motion pictures. There's even a solid message behind Metropolis (though I believe it'd be spoiler material to go into that). But... how can I put this?... it's unbelievably boring. The other film school classics I mention above were all much more entertaining by comparison. No film I viewed in film studies had more students asleep than this one, and we're not talking about kids obsessed with car chases. These are genuine film geeks who have amazing patience for films made in an era when entertainment was defined quite differently.

306,A-Clockwork-Bobbin,A landmark of all filming,9,19 January 2009,"What can I say about Metropolis? The words: Amazing, genius, thrilling, captivating, wonderful, purely excellent, and imitable come to mind.Metropolis was a very early sci-fi film, by that master of filming, Fritz Lang. It was made in 1927; so if you had even seen a few seconds of the film, you would be surprised at how advanced it was, even then. No CGI or 'special effects' like we get nowadays; Metropolis is absolutely magical. And it has such a storyline that is absolutely unique... there is not a film like Metropolis. It mixes Sci-Fi, dystopia, romance, and thriller, along with other genres, so there's something for everyone.The most unfortunate thing about Metropolis is that it is incomplete. Or, at least, the versions of the film you can get now is of the incomplete versions. Due to it being a lengthy film (Fritz Lang had a habit of showing every meticulous detail that may be relevant to the storyline), it was cut severely, so that the audience would receive it better. Unfortunately, this made the plot confusing; what seemed like bit-parts were in fact originally key characters, important events were missed out... Generally, the copies of the film you can get now on DVD are of the most 'restored' version, but there are still some parts missed out.Fortunately - the parts of the film which had been cut have just recently be found. I would love to see the film when Metropolis has been reunited with the 'lost' footage! Even so, Metropolis is highly recommendable. There are still some minor flaws, I find, but if you appreciate good films, with good story lines, with revolutionary filming techniques... Then Metropolis is for you.",Metropolis
307,Banquo13,Restored print is amazing!,9,29 December 2002,"For being 75 years old, this film holds up remarkably well.  The restored version(the most complete to date) gives us a glimpse of what Lang had really intended. The countless cut-up and blurry copies of the past should be thrown out (my ""cheap"" version I bought for $5 has entire scenes that are out of focus!). I was anxious about seeing this version since I had seen the Moroder version back in the 80's and was so turned on by the color-tinting and now-unbearable synth-pop music! However, I must give Moroder credit for getting me interested in this film in the first place.The original score for the film gives the remarkable visuals a solid companion piece and is extremely moving at times.  The film is a visual spectacular; the sets and special effects are quite remarkable for their time. Froelich and Helm are solid as the two driving forces behind the story; although I really had to distance myself from the fact that the excessive gesturing (Helm repeatedly touches her breast in her surprise/amazement in one scene) nearly all the actors engaged in was simply commonplace in silent films. Helm as the ""Machine Maria"" and ""Human Maria"" is simply amazing...her body language tells us exactly which character she is playing; it is a wonder that her career was not as noteworthy after ""Metropolis.""I am eager to see this restored print on DVD and would love to see how therestoration process was carried out--the work here is nothing short of remarkable.

308,birdy123,"""The Complete Metropolis"", finally",10,7 April 2011,"For purposes of some kind of time line here, it's necessary to start from the beginning. Metropolis was my graduation thesis for NYU Film School in 1976. I was stationed in Wiesbaden (West)Germany in 1978 and actually arranged a showing at Wiesbaden's Lindsay Air Station (gone, thankfully) through the William Murnau Stiftung. I've owned every version of this movie ever put out for public consumption.So, I have to say this first: You must see the complete version of this movie! Through the new discovery of additional footage, a deeper and more complex story line than previously portrayed now emerges. It's also an astounding view through the portals of time back to the embryonic mindset of the Nazi culture.Let's start with the visuals. To me, it wasn't what Lang and Von Harbou had in their minds to present, it was the fact that they were able to so completely realize the society and culture of Metropolis on film down to the smallest detail. There isn't just the hint of the way things are - it's there right in front of you, bloody warts and all. The cityscape recedes far in the distance, the cars stop and people actually get out of them in what seems to be over a mile away. You know with today's eyes that some if it is animated, but just how it was put together (especially so long ago) is still a source of amazement.Rotwang's laboratory is full of arcane set pieces. You have no idea of what he is doing when he generates the robot Maria, but it and his performance look so convincing that you believe it anyway.The theatrical acting so often found in silent movies is now tuned to a minimum due to the re-editing of scenes, the changing and re-ordering of the inter title cards, and the inclusion of 25 minutes of additional scenes unseen since the original film's premiere. All of this was previously impossible. The original film script had long disappeared, the film was incoherently re-edited for the US market, and there were no longer any clues as how to put it back together.With the discovery of clues within the original film score composer's archives and the German Film Censor's Board notes, the correct order of shots was finally reestablished, and now the film makes sense for the first time.The following portions may contain spoilers (really, you need to be warned about a film from 1927??): I find the structure of the society of Metropolis to be baffling. Automation was understood when this film was made, in fact there's automation present within the movie. I can follow the idea of someone subjugating a class of people, but I can't follow the idea of that person making their lives so obviously into a time-bomb dangerous to oneself. The workers are (grudgingly) allowing themselves to be tied to working with and within enormous machines, whose every function is tied to their performing the same task, over and over again. Should the person fail to perform their task for whatever reason, the entire complex is in danger.It's understood that is to be the case by every worker as there is a safe/danger indicator at every work station. These tasks should logically be automated. Why do they need people to perform them when the society is advanced and seems perfectly capable of automation? Why have they made the mechanics of the underground city so subject to human failure? And, why is the above-ground city so unprotected? For answers to this, I turn to the Nazi culture. In fact the movie and the Nazis are very much tied together. Here's a parallel equation to this movie for starters: Why in the concentration camps did they use a dozen inmates to hand-pull a heavy cart containing a package the size of a pack of cigarettes? It's the same answer as in this movie. It's the same answer you find in the novel 1984: it's control for the gain of power's sake only. There's no form of compassion, it's all done for the Party and for the Party only.There IS no hope under this situation, only death.Even the film's ending is hogwash, complete and and total nonsense. You are being duped all the way. Do you really think the heart has performed mediation? Joh Frederson has now completely consolidated his power over his workers, and *that* was the idea of the Nazis, the entire world at their feet with everything under their control. The workers at the end of this movie aren't free, in fact as they march toward him at the film's end they are in a triangular arrow formation with heads bowed. They are even more submissive and restricted in that formation than in the rectangles they march in during the movie. They have nothing, their city is destroyed. They have no one to turn to except for Joh Frederson. The workers have no thought, and not even the slightest bit of capacity for self-governing. They are made by Joh Frederson's society to be helpless without him.Joh Frederson sure seems contrite at the film's ending, but inside I bet he's grinning.",Metropolis

American film editors had the right idea to shorten the film to an hour and a half when it first screened in the States. They cut out some key scenes due to the Hay's censors, but they could have left those key scenes in about the robot and still shorten the film. The plot was not strong enough to captivate the audience for that long. The plot love triangle plot and the ideal of Utopia are so over done. The only thing that was semi entertaining was science fiction aspect of the film. The underground subspecies of humans working in unison in the hidden factor city and the look of the city above made the movie slightly bearable to watch. The thing that made the film a deal breaker was the female lead. Her acting was horrific. German Expression from of acting was jerky and over exaggerated, but she took to an extreme. Even when Brigitte Helm was the sweet angelic Maria she didn't portray compassion and honesty. The only thing that she did well was make all the characters she portrayed different so the audience could distinguish between them. The final scene the completely destroyed the film was lustful dance sequence when the inventor first debuted the robot Maria. The whole scene was the represented the seven deadly sins, but it was entirely too long. The entire scene consented of the men's reactions to her dancing. The whole film focused entirely too much on character reactions. Someone would say something and the camera would immediately have a close up person's face they were speaking to.

If you can only give its makers the credit for what they achieved in the era of no CGI or any other modern tech. The sets are huge, the screenplay is good, sometimes really good, the story is engaging, except that this movie doesn't make sense, if we watch it in the era of modern cinema. The normal movie goers, I rather say the people who go to movies, just for fun will not take it. YES, it is outdated, but that doesn't make it bad. The Meta critic rating of above 9 shows that. I rate it at 8 for its pure genius and heart, but it doesn't fit today's cinema and funny thing is that no one has told us to fit it either. I went through many reviews, including that of Sir Roger Ebert. Every one has high praises for the movie, but I personally feel that there were many other greater and better movies than Metropolis at that time. Some of them are ""M"" , ""City Lights"" , ""Modern Times"", ""The General"" that don't have time or era boundary as this movie has. They still are fresh and every normal person can enjoy them.

He descends into an abysmal underworld of man-eating machinery that is nearly indistinguishable from his fevered hallucinations. Despite the film's hyper-drama and viciously precise arm movement, it is a riveting study that compellingly mirrors the French Revolution and yet eerily foretells the rise of Fascism. It invokes distinctly Germanic art styles as we see Freder become a black-uniformed living transistor, fully 20 years before transistors were invented. No movement, no lighting change is extemporaneous; in legendary Teutonic vision, every frame is set exactly as it must be. As an example of the film's relentless angst, the governor, Joh Fredersen, beholds his son breathtakingly idolizing a Joan of Arc character, Maria, to the revolutionary strains of La Marseillaise. Maria's gaze is mesmerizing.To regain his son and control a worker's revolt, the governor beseeches an old nemesis to turn the first robot into a Maria automaton, but a Lorelei-type emissary. Joh's desperation is Freder's undoing and, later, his own. As the great city begins to hemorrhage, a fight for the future of the republic ensues. It will be impossible not to see Metropolis' incomparable flavor within dozens of other movies, not the least- George Lucas' entire Star Wars saga.Despite issues inherent to early movies and having lost a large portion of its substance to fledgling Hollywood meddling, Metropolis is the watershed cinematic experience that every dedicated film-maker must acknowledge.",Metropolis

With the look later adopted by ""Minority Report"", ""I, Robot"", and practically everything of the sort, Metropolis is ruled by Joh Fredersen, whose son Freder enjoys the privileged life of the Club of the Sons and the entertainment district, among other things. One day, Freder ventures into the area of the machines, where workers are forced to work grueling ten hour shifts before returning to their small, overpopulated city, which by the way is underground, away from the privileged. The only thing keeping the workers from revolting is Maria, a young woman who preaches a mediator who will serve as the ""heart"" between the head and the hands. Freder becomes this mediator, although it is not without a serious threat to the entire city from Rotwang, a maniacal inventor who plans to destroy Metropolis. Full of biblical allusions such as the Tower of Babel, ""Metropolis"" sets the precedent for all science fiction. The ""Matrix"" trilogy is a perfect example of something that owes its existence to ""Metropolis"". The visuals are absolutely stunning when one considers that this was made 80 years ago.

Lang tells a story of huge town called Metropolis. The designers of the town live in beautiful skyscrapers, have money and amusements. The ""hands"" of the town live in the heat underground, each man working ten hours a day.

But as something I had to sit through, it was torture.The acting is hopeless unless you're a fan of the ""act with your eyes"" school of the overly dramatic. The music was standard orchestra fare with no defining theme. Just the same kind of boring old crap you'd hear on early Looney Tunes. But the biggest offense is the plot.Workers rise up against the industrialists and in order to really drive their point home--abandon their children and then flood (?) their part of the city. Brilliant. Why flood? Who the hell knows. Looked cool I guess and the lame cardboard city models would have gone up too fast if they'd used fire. None of the action is remotely logical. Like Maria showing up with all those dirty school children in the middle of some ""Club of the Sons"" sex party. Huh? Or Fredersen's plan to send a robot chick to foment rebellion among his workers instead of, you know, getting rid of their leader (Maria) and arresting the other ringleaders. Said robot chick is apparently whipping up the workers into a froth by day and stripping at some swanky club by night. Which has the result of turning the industrialists against each other (in some of the silliest fistfights ever put on film) which advances Federsen's plan how again? The storyline is absurd and used to drive set pieces, nothing else. 90mins, 124mins, 153mins, doesn't matter. There is no length that would fix the dimwitted writing (courtesy of Lang's wife who went on to join the Nazi Party in 1933).

Even if it's somewhat lengthy and very liberal with its long shots of people talking about sound, you have to admit that it was very ingenious for its time. No one had really tried to create a science fiction film that was quite this ambitious before. It must have taken guts to spend so much money on a film that audiences were doomed not to understand. But even though it was entirely overblown, it also had an eerily accurate foreshadowing of the future. The buildings and modes of transportation (namely the futuristic elevators) are very similar to what we actually use today. Plus it was able to influence some really good movies like Blade Runner, so that makes it very worth it. My one negative comment about the film would have to be the pathetic mama's boy protagonist, Freder. He literally faints at every sign of opposition, can't fight even the weakest villain, wears sissy parachute paints and too much makeup, and has a serious door problem. He runs around, falling in love at first sight and beating himself up at the thought of his love turning to the dark side, without ever trying to do anything about it except get himself into trouble. He gets bedridden after realizing Maria has gone to the dogs. And he can't save her when she's captured by the evil scientist because doors repeated keep closing on him and he doesn't recognize the pattern. As in the door opens, he walks through it, and it closes and locks. I could just picture him thinking ""the door opened! It must lead me to Maria!"" every single time it happened. It was almost sad to me that so talented and good a woman would fall for such a dunce. However, because the film was such a larger than its characters piece of art, his being stupid didn't effect the overall production or outcome. So all in all, a good film.",Metropolis

Wealthy citizens live carefree lives free of want and strife. One of its wealthy citizens is Freder Fredersen, son of Metropolis ruler Joh Fredersen. One day, Freder sees a beautiful woman with a group of children. He tries to follow them, but they quickly disappear. Then, to his horror, he discovers an underground world of workers. It turns out that these workers, unknown to him previously, actually work the machinery which keeps the beautiful city above in operation. Yet, despite being solely responsible for the wealthy, beauty, and all-around functioning of the magnificent city above, they live and work in dreadful conditions themselves.Freder learns that the woman he saw was Maria, an activist amongst the workers who espouses a way forward to a better life. Her programme centres around a single idea; the need to join the ""hands"" (the workers below) to the ""head"" (the wealthy and powerful above) by a mediator or the ""heart"". Freder us taken in by the idealism of it all, and joins the cause. But meanwhile, his father and his henchman, Rotwang, are working to smash the growing movement. Metropolis is actually a phenomenal film and an important piece of German expressionism, with beautiful cinematography, art work, and sets. The robot is awesome, and many of the scenes are really powerful.The film faced the danger of being obliterated by fascist censors both in Germany and in Chile, but today has been returned to its (almost) original state and is available on DVD. It's run in with the far-right thought police was due to its ""dangerous"" political message.But that's not to say that Metropolis is politically radical or revolutionary. In reality, the clear message of the film is that workers and bosses must cooperate for the common good. It attacks abuse and exploitation, but at the same time it condemns the notion of revolutionary change. Insultingly, it refers to workers as merely ""the hands"" and laughably refers to bosses as ""the head"". It promotes the mythical ""third way"" between capitalist exploitation, and worker- controlled socialism. In other words, it uses science fiction to expose the unfairness inherent in the system, then it tells you that if you behave, maybe things will get better.

Maria is captivatingly beautiful young lady who remains level headed when all the men around her are driven by rage and anger.  Rotwang (I didn't make up that name) is the brilliant scientist driven mad by the loss of the woman he loves who creates the robot.It is probably success of this melodrama that made Hitler misunderstand Lang's social messages.The image of the robot, which appears only briefly in Metropolis, has become the symbol of the movie.

332,anirguha-60-851453,A prophetical movie made more than 80 years ago,8,9 November 2020,"I recently watched the 2010 restored version of the movie (153 minutes in length). Compared to the present day productions perhaps the movie is no match. But what impressed me are mainly two things - one the tremendous innovation and skill that have been employed to create the special effects for this first every Sc-fi. Secondly the symbolism and the message that it tried to portray is so apt for the present day dystopian world we live in.
For the first point the lack of modern day technology has been very well compensated by innovative ideas and skill to create the visual effects during the sequence of creation of Iron Maria, sequence of Moloch, etc. The set design for the Metropolis skyline, underground worker's colony, the factory itself show an artist's mind and ultimate expressionism.
The film shows the elements of capitalism through the grotesque city skyline where there is not a trace of beauty and nature anywhere. The cityscape depicted an ugly juxtaposition of sky reaching buildings and bridges and fast moving highways powered by machines which are so common in any modern day city today. There is not a semblance of nature anywhere in the entire film, not a tree donning any scene apart from the pleasure garden which is only in the reach of the city's upper class. This so much symbolises the present day world where we have banished the nature with rampant exploitation of the environment for the growth of modern cities and technology.
Now about the prophetical nature of the movie. The film made in 1927 during the Weimar Germany had perhaps foretold where the world would come to in future. We today can realise how true the prophecy was.
The social message of the film is equally potent. Reflecting Marx's communist ideaology the film perhaps hopes that the middle class (symbolised as ""Heart"") will be instrumental in bring the gap between the upper class capitalists (""Head"") and the proletariat or the working class (""Hand""). But the ultimate outcome of the alliance has not been touched upon in the movie. It does not attempt to show any material change either in the condition os the working class or the upper-class industrialists. All it says that the lower and upper classes need to be brought together by eliminating the cronies (symbolised by the evil scientist Rotwang) and that can be achieved only by middle class bourgeois (symbolised by Freder and human Maria) and that bourgeois will be an upper-class anomaly.

334,GalaxyGal,One of the Classics of Silent Cinema,10,29 June 2006,"""Metropolis,"" directed by the great German director Fritz Lang, is one of the classics of the silent-era, and one of the entries on any science fiction movie fan's must-see list. Sadly, there's no one definitive 'version' of the movie, as the original was heavily edited, cut parts being destroyed; 'reconstructed' versions exist (including a colorized one with a rock soundtrack!).This is a silent, black-and-white, allegory-laden tale about the future in the city of Metropolis, where the wealthy live in soaring skyscrapers, and workers live in dark, dismal, underground housing. Maria, a young working-class woman, is a nursery-school teacher who seeks to reconcile the workers (hand) with the wealthy elite (head) by trying to become the mediator (heart)--whence comes the film's classic thematic statement: ""The heart is the mediator between the head and and the hand."" Freder, son of the most powerful business owner (?) (one doesn't know exactly what those wealthy types are--business owners, politicians, robber barons?) Thea Von Harbou (the scriptwriter and Lang's wife) didn't specify), sees Maria by accident one day, and he's in love at first sight. His father is trying to stop workers from meeting in secret after their shifts--he fears a workers' revolt--by going to Rotwang, the inventor who created most of the machines in Metropolis.Of course, it's not German cinema without a jealousy-filled back-story between Fredersen and Rotwang, unbelievable similarities between Maria and a dead character, plots that endanger all of Metropolis--who said the course of true love runs smooth? The story unfolds slowly because film was a new story-telling medium in the 1920s; the sets are stunning for their time, the acting is a bit heavy-handed--but that was the style in silents; the camera moves are well-designed, and--this is the only spoiler you'll get from me: this is the first appearance of everyone's favorite--a robot or android that looks exactly like a person, and is programmed to behave completely unlike that person. Great art deco design for the nightclub and the, um, character. You'll know it when you see it.If you ever see in your local papers that ""Metropolis"" is playing at a local art-house cinema and you haven't seen it before, go. Just take my word; even if you don't like silent movies or science fiction movies, go see this--it's one of the first milestones in movie-making.",Metropolis

The film is the greatest silent film I have ever seen and is silent films at their zenith.

I don't see it as supporting either Nazism or Communism. Hitler admired it but Fritz Lang made it at the height of the Weimar Republic and some of that republic's famous partying can be seen in the film. I don't think it was Communist either, but rather a plea for simple common human decency in the face of inhumanity.What struck me the most was the Biblical allusions. There was a Tower of Babel, a Great Flood and a not quite human woman being referred to as ""The Whore of Babylon."" That was relevant to me as my own church is studying the book of Revelation right now!! Since the Bible is so little studied in our own time, I wonder how much of those themes would actually be recognised by younger viewers. They might be more likely to see the film's link with Star Wars and other famous science fiction films much more quickly. I would call Metropolis more a work of prophecy than of science fiction. It still has a relevance in its call for people to be treated as more than just labouring machines. It may be 87 years old but its message is as true today as it was on the day of its premiere.",Metropolis

Imagine trying to make a movie today with only the tools available to Fritz Lang in 1925, and even if you used a modern camcorder it would be nigh impossible!

It is inarguably the greatest silent film of all time, and one of the greatest of any films of all kind. It is pure genius. Every shot, every composition, every cut is rich with meaning, yet it can be enjoyed just for its beauty and cinematic pleasure with no intellectual reading of it necessary. To fully understand it, however, one should brush up on the history of the brief Weimar Republic of Germany between 1918 and 1933, since the film reflects what the Germans were feeling at the time and is a prime example of the art movements of this period. A must for every lover of the cinema.",Metropolis

We watched this is my film studies class yesterday and I felt like I was being punished for something (like in A Clockwork Orange).  Maybe I feel this way because I'm young or because I'm not used to two hour films with no sound.  It's great that there is a movie that so many people like.

However, the perfect coordination of an in-depth meaning and photography, soundtrack and motion, and most important of all, the impacting expression of strong emotions towards the crude reality of capitalism, left me more speechless than the movie itself! It is totally worth watching and do not mind the length--it will not matter if you get enrolled by the message. Should we leave capitalism do its ""magic"" where surplus is squeezed on a few hands thanks to the undermined labor? Should be break the system and ask for revolution? Or should we find a mediator, a heart, between head and hands? We are still nine years away from 2026.

Where else can you find a film of that period that contains not only brilliant social comment, sheer spectacle and such a fascinating and absorbing plot, even by todays standards. Without Metropolis, movies like Star Wars and Blade runner would have looked very different, and the entire Science fiction genre would have taken a very different route. My only niggle with this film is that it has been so heavily cut over the last 80 or so years, and great chunks of it have been lost forever. This results in a few version of various lengths being on the market, and it is very easy to buy one version, only to find another longer one soon afterwards. Overall, get hold of the longest one you can, then sit back, relax and take in a true classic of the science fiction world. I love this film, and I am sure others will too.",Metropolis

349,mike-2675,The Mediator Between Head And Hands Must Be The Heart!,10,29 August 2011,"Science fiction is a genre with a long tradition of social critique. Beneath its veneer of gee-whiz exploration and extrapolations of technology, science fiction of any enduring value unfailingly offers the reader an unblinking look at the society around them. The conceit of fiction gives the author a great deal of subversive license in exposing taboos and the shortcomings of accepted wisdom. This tradition of literary sci-fi extends to modern film, of course.As with any narrative, however, even great science fiction narratives fall victim to the vicissitudes of framing.I'd like to throw up Metropolis as an easy example of this danger. Fritz Lang, along with his wife, strove to critique Industrial society and, as any decent critique should require, resolve the contradictions this social development presented.In order to present a coherent narrative, one must select a frame within which to construct the story, and the paradigm selected by Lang is quaintly anachronistic, to understate the matter. In the film, the movers-and-shakers of the world are characterized as Randian John Galt-like characters (""brains""), with the unwashed masses (""hands"") providing the necessary proletarian contribution of executing the dreams of these indispensable men.While the frame is infantile, this dilemma persists today in modern society, as it is so constituted - or rather, perceived. The struggle of the film lay in resolving the glaring injustice that invariably appears in such an arrangement. The resolution appears as the quasi-mystical and insufferably patronizing ""heart."" In all fairness, Lang himself was not particularly pleased with its naiveté: ""...You cannot make a social-conscious picture in which you say that the intermediary between the hand and the brain is the heart. I mean, that's a fairy tale – definitely.... I didn't like the picture – thought it was silly and stupid..."" What is interesting about Lang's lament is that it doesn't discard the ""hand/brain"" frame, but only the easy and obviously childish ""heart"" solution.Metropolis is a film worth viewing even today.",Metropolis

I think most people can appreciate the 1920s black and white film look as a unique treatment to our current full-color film stock standards.Listen, this movie is interesting and a little spooky especially through the lens of 80 years. It's a vision of the future that became typical with movies like ""1984"" or ""Brazil"" and a look that inspired 12 Monkeys and a hundred other cool modern day sci-fi films.It's standard sci-fi...the machines are taking over and making life crappy for everyone. People are their own worst enemy. I love some of the crazy industrial revolution jobs you see our workers performing, like the guy who has to point these giant clock hands at different flashing lights.If you like sci-fi, you'll probably enjoy this, at the very least you have to appreciate that this creepy art-deco 1920s vision inspired a lot of what you see today.",Metropolis

(Which is good, because Taylorism needs attacking) And the visuals from the Metropolis itself is copied, to greater or lesser degree, by Blade Runner, Judge Dread (can't believe I mentioned those in one breath), Star Wars (R2-D2's first performance was in Metropolis, it turns out!)

355,Oxon01002,Make sure you get the latest version!!!!,10,7 December 2006,"Metropolis is so gigantic and important a picture that its impact and genius can't be exaggerated. However, almost from the day filming was completed it has been subject to butchery. As a result, chunks of Fritz Lang's original vision have been lost forever, and the film exists in numerous dodgy, splotchy prints, hacked up and misedited, cut down and supplied with musical soundtracks that range from the completely inappropriate to wonderful modern techno-rock things which, nice though they are, are not what Lang had in mind.Kino came out with a DVD just a few years ago that is a fantastic attempt to restore Lang's original. I am NOT shilling for Kino -- you don't have to buy it, as there are plenty of sources for super-cheap rentals, or you can borrow it from some libraries (or friends!) for free. The point is, if you intend to see this movie, and even if you have seen a videotape version of it before, see this latest version: the picture is super-clear and the lighting restored; every bit of Lang's film that survives is included; Lang's original title cards are restored; the bits that have been lost forever are discreetly replaced with a title card to summarize the action that you should be seeing, in a way that completely unobtrusively, but helpfully, clarifies the film; and the soundtrack is the restored musical score.If your only experience of this movie has been a rocked-up modern club-kid version, or a creaky, shadowy poor print on video with a single cheery piano tune incessantly repeated as the score, see this latest restoration. It will become clear to you what all the excitement and angst was about back in Lang's day.",Metropolis

Acting is in what I might term an expressionist fashion - in part due to the popular German style and also due to the constraints of lack of today's computer trickery and, of course, the silent aspect.The plot and overt symbolism - while perhaps compelling in historical terms - may seem naif to present viewers; yet this is not a film about politics (although it to some extent tries to be) but a film of great art and beauty.Sadly the original ending is lost and in pieces; the American release ending is what most have seen. I believe today's DVDs piece together what is left of the original ending which is, of course, of great interest to all.Jochen L.",Metropolis

It's classified as science fiction, but it goes farther beyond the guidelines of sci-fi than any other science fiction film i've ever seen.  it goes into romance, into social and political criticism, into horror, even.  It's an amazing movie.  I've been trying to get my friends to watch it for years, but they all get turned off when they hear the word ""silent""- but silent movies are an art form, and, as the other person said, very few modern directors would be able to accomplish anything even near what fritz lang did with this masterpiece.",Metropolis

The director did a perfect work, the scenes, and the frames just being perfect. The storyline is complex, yet simple, tells so much through so little. Prophetic, yes, but a bit exaggerated.

It is groundbreaking, and is the precursor to Star Wars, Blade Runner, 2001, The Fifth Element, etc. The world's only epic silent film. The story is really good- the uber-rich planners and the dirt-poor workers and the city leader's son who seeks to end the tyranny. The film is gripping, and even moving. The film's message resonates with viewers of all ages, and it's prophetic view of the potential of unchecked future societies is one we must all be aware of. Especially when you consider that Adolf Hitler used this film as inspiration for his horrific attempt at a global dictatorship and racial sterilization. The effects are ahead of their time. No one got more out of what was available to him than Lang in this film. I can not imagine how anyone enjoyed this film in any of it's previous versions. It is a timeless classic that will continue to be relevant for decades to come. Any future remake will be spectacular visually, but it will look typical for our time. Simply magnificent.",Metropolis
360,sweetkness,Best Silent Film Ever! A good prediction of the future???,10,26 May 2005,"Taking into account when this film was made, and what Fritz Lang had to work with, this film has to be easily be considered one of the best silent films ever made and certainly one of the best sci-fi films ever. The set designs and absolutely amazing, so good that many sci-fi films can't compare to them 80 years later. The story is also very good for a silent film, building up enough suspense and drama to easily keep my attention for the entire two hours, something which much shorter silent films have not been able to do for me.Fritz Lang was so far ahead of his time with this film, it just had me totally amazed. I found it quite ironic that this film, made 80 years ago, paints a good picture of the path our world may be taking. Maybe its just the pessimistic side of me, but we continue to become more and more dependent on technology yet we are depleting more and more of out energy sources. There also appears to be a larger gap forming between classes and the power the upper class is able to enforce. Could this lead to a future quite similar to the one Fritz Lang pictured? Maybe, maybe not, but thats the beauty of this film, it can get you thinking about larger issues such as that, unlike many silent films where the world is portrayed as all hunky dory, and everything ends happily.",Metropolis

When a man named Freder discovers the bad conditions the poor are going through whilst falling in love with a profit named Maria who predicts the coming of a saviour who will bring equality to the city which has now become a dystopia. Behind the scenes there is a conspiracy going on about the construction of a robot who will put a stop to Maria's prophecy and in the long term take over all over the workforce underground.The story is perfect and inspirational with a great performance from Brigitte Helm who basically steals the spotlight as both Maria and the robot, Gustav Fröhlich also steals the show as well as his performance as Freder is great as well. The supporting characters are great as well but they kinda bite the dust as Gustav Fröhlich and Brigitte Helm steal the show. Although the story is perfect, I found it underwhelming and predictable as you could see all of the plot-points coming from a mile away.Even though the film is almost 90 years old, it still stands the test of time with some great set design and cityscapes, the robot design is particularly impressive. Its immortality with the films overall design has lead to other sci-fi and superhero classics taking notes from this silent movie such as C-3PO in star wars taking inspiration from the robot and the city Metropolis in superman taking the actual name from the movie.This movie has left its mark in time and has even become more powerful than when it came out in 1927.

So it must be strange if mankind look up to civilization as something higher than themselves. If (physical) progress is superlative, and men are mere contributory factors of production--and a very expendable factor, for that matter (brought to existence to be used up as fuels so that some divine machine can keep running).This movie proposes a critical look at the ever ironical industrialized society's attitude toward the so-called modern life: Developed as we might be, our world is constrained--delusional, no matter what social class we are in. That no matter how industrious we are, without compassion and spontaneity, we're just like an army of robots--humanoids without will that incapable of sensing happiness.There are a bunch of reasons why this movie deserves respect. Like, the idea is so insightful as well as foresighted, way beyond its time (released in 1927--a couple of years before the Black Tuesday of 1929, many people consider this movie silly). Or, its daring approach in combining the common visual language with drastic symbolic images (this time, two years preceding the destructive style of Buñuel's ""Un Chien Andalou"").

A must see for sci-fi & film fans",8,17 January 2015,"After looking for sci-fi classics, I decided to check out the so called source of modern science fiction genre. And oh boy was it interesting. For a silent, 88 year old, black and white film, I wasn't expecting anything spectacular. However the presentation, acting, special effects were done quite well and I would have been mind blown if I saw this film back when it came out. Even looking at how many films, books, games and various other aspects of sci-fi works, this film has influenced and amount of material the story covers is phenomenal. Maybe my lack of knowledge of older films doesn't allow me to fully grasp the evolution of modern cinema, however this film has both made me look and think about the potential of technology, human emotion involvement across many aspects of our world, how religion and hope affect human behavior, but also the divide of classes the society creates. At time of release these things were far more relevant, but regardless all of these aspects of the world can be seen today and will be for many years to come. There are few problems with this film, however they do not particularly affect the overall enjoyment and experience of this film. Highly recommend this film for those who really want to get down to the roots of science fiction, and those who seek to see the best of cinema.Sorry that I haven't been more specific about the details, but if this small insight from a viewer made you consider watching the film in the least, the go full speed ahead!",Metropolis

I amazed of how the movie, just with music, great performances and not more than 10 blackboards of dialog, the complexity of story is get it perfectly.But besides the that, the really advanced SFX for it's age are outstanding, and the most important thing of Metropolis, is the fact that it is an universal metaphor about the ""working class"" and the ""thinking class"" that shows us, that there isn't too much difference of the modern way of life, and the one that shows in the film, that was the thing that I was most amazed of, and if you don't think that this is enough reasons to see it right now, THIS IS THE HITTLER'S FAVORITE!!!",Metropolis
366,Phaeron,My New All Time Favourite,10,18 August 2018,"Metropolis covers a range of topics, from social inequality to importance of having good intentions, from love to what it means to be a part of a community, not only this movie from 1927 covers these really fundamental topics to our nature really well, but it also pictures a future that is really similiar to ours with poor people getting poorer and the deterioriating social relations giving way to radical thoughts and ideas. While stating that radical actions are sometimes justified and often caused by other factors, The Metropolis says that no matter what our current stance is, in every action of our life, our heart, our humanity should find the middle ground between our ideals and power. 
 The movie is full of biblical references that I found really refreshing, since they are not made in the most obvious sense, but they make themselves clear enough if needed, unlike these modern movies where we would have any sort of imagery either be pushed through our throats or would be really hard to figure out. I am glad that sort of a middle ground exists.
 Actors have done a magnificent job. Their actions caused me to want to jump with excitement with every new scene, despite not uttering a word. That is art at its purest sense, and for some reason, Josaphat, one of the side characters, really left a mark on me, I don't think I shall forget how grateful he was to the Freder for saving him from going to the lower town.
 The clips are pretty sweet for their time, if you are watching the full version, which includes scenes from clips that were brought from Buenos Aires, you can have a handful of clips that are in lower quality, but they are detrimental to the story, so I don't mind that, and would like to thank everyone and everyone who worked to create this full version.
 Well, story is about two young people who fell in love despite their socio-economic status, the guy being the heir to the ''leader''(?) of the city, things get complicated soon enough and there are few side stories that I don't want to spoil.

If this movie had been made seventy years later, that might be true, but the fact is that Metropolis was the movie that set the stereotype for distopian-utopian society movies.  It is the original story of how the machines that run a futuristic utopia are oiled with the sweat and blood of the unseen workers. The images in this film are stunning, and the original score for the movie is pretty good too.  Director Fritz Lang did not give himself enough credit for providing the movie with an effective soundtrack.  Rent the version with the original score if you can.

371,mosimann,What a film!,10,29 July 2004,"I have just recently looked at a pristine DVD remastered version of Metropolis from F. Lang. Without doubt, Mr Lang is one of the greatest directors ever. But also, what a team he had: what entrepreneurship, what wizardry and what imagination. However the plot may be a little simple, the way the film is filmed, directed, acted, edited is splendid. Furthermore, I thought the film music one of the best ""classical"" film music I have ever listened to: richness of themes, various leitmotives and a sense of drama that is exhilarating. Finaly, this film is still so potent in it's modernity. Just look how masses can be driven to their one end - even forgetting their children! Just look our the spy is everywhere: big brother is watching. Just look how the few rule the mass. Just look how religion can be so strong and powerful. And is man really man or machine? And it's not hollow or vain to believe that love can transcend anything as the mediator. I just loved it and recommend it to anyone, especially those who think that cinema is just SFX or Computer Programms. Refreshingly modern! Gave it 10!",Metropolis

So many confusing points were cleared up by this careful reconstruction of a film that never should have been cut up for any reason. I'd already seen Metropolis a couple of times and found it fascinating but muddled; this version, on the big screen in glorious black-and-white with its original soundtrack, is electrifying. Although the acting (particularly Freder) is stylized almost to the point of unintentional hilarity, for the most part the performances are gorgeous - Brigitte Helm is astonishing, playing two roles as the sprirtual Maria and her feral, hypersexed robot-double.",Metropolis

Metropolis is science fiction, but it's much more than that.  It is passion and obsession, good vs. evil, the weak vs. the powerful.  It challenges the viewer to really consider what the future may be, but what's truly amazing is that the vision of the future in 1927 may still become our future today (in a sense).

375,nholder93,Fritz Lang's Sci-Fi Masterpiece,10,25 December 2010,"In 1927, Lang's Metropolis was released. Despite being the most expensive silent film made up to that point, it was a commercial and critical failure. Now after being partly restored, audiences can finally enjoy this beautiful film. However, this film may be a bit of a challenge for common audiences. It's hard to fully appreciate the significance of the film without having seen movies made before it. For those who love silent films, this one won't disappoint. The movie is set in a futuristic utopia that is powered by underground workers. After the city's founder's son, Freder, stumbles upon the underground city, he is determined to alleviate the worker's plight. This bizarre reworking of Marxist ideology turns into a beautiful story of cooperation and peace between social classes. Yes, it's sentimental and like all silent films the acting is melodramatic but it also has a special relevance to today's audiences. It's majestic score serves as the pulse of the rapidly moving film. For those who haven't seen it, it won't leave you disappointed.",Metropolis
376,jdoobie105,A Nightmarish Fable and a Beauty of Cinema,9,9 February 2011,"Metropolis's history is both famous and infamous. Fritz Lang, a leading director in the school of Expressionism, made this movie incorporating numerous themes of labor, heart, and proper communication between the mind and the working body. Using many tools of Expressionist cinema, he put together what many consider to be a cinematic masterpiece full of emotional tension, spectacular sets and strange scenes all in the attempt of bringing out what the characters are feeling. This new- world film had to be edited before being released to the masses, and a number of the cut scenes were lost. There have been numerous attempts to complete the missing work, the most recent being in 2010 in Argentinian print. With the missing scenes added to the film, the movie truly becomes one of the greatest things to see on film. The sets bring out a scope of magnificence in the elaborate grandeur of the city above as well as the lowliness of the world below. The expression of the machines, both their size and functioning, make this world seem more industrial than ever. It's quite possibly a nod to the Industrial Revolution because it does express a lot about the worker and the work that it must do to keep the city, both above and below, alive. The story is simple: Freder, the son of the founder of Metropolis, finds a woman named Maria in which he is captivated. She represents the workers that live in the city of the worker below the Metropolis, and he follows her down. He switches with a worker and discovers the world that was hidden from him and the rest of the world. Unfortunately, his father has bigger plans and goes to an inventor to make a machine-woman in her likeness to fool the workers and destroy her. This world that Fritz Lang built is definitely elaborate and inventive as well as haunting. The idea that if people become ignorant of the human aspect of labor and invention, they destroy themselves and their society really makes you think about whether or not technological progress is truly a great thing. The movie does use a lot of religious ideas such as the Seven Deadly Sins and the story of the Tower of Babel, but the point that I got out is that the lack of God and the lack of goodwill towards each other will destroy humanity. The acting in the movie is very expressive because there is no sound, so the expressions need to be big; but the actors work very well in bringing out the general feel of the moral and the story. The actress who played Maria also plays the robot that manipulates the people into destroying the city and fall victim to lust. It's the basic Jekyll-and- Hyde but with two separate monsters. What separates this performance from the rest is how well she sets the characters apart. Her facial expressions, her body movements and even her eyes are so different and so perfect with the character that you could believe they were not the same person. Freder is the most dynamic character in the film, being the inevitable hero, and you root for him from beginning to end as his emotions towards everything express the stress and the appreciation of the people that do the hardest work and the trauma and the fear when he sees all that goes wrong. Also most interesting is the father, Joh. He rarely shows emotion which shows how cold and calculating he is. He shows no contempt for the workers. Why should he? However, he does show love for his son and fears losing him, even though he doesn't really know it yet.The story does have its predictable moments, but they end with different results so it's not entirely predictable. In the end, it shows that without a sense of humanity, humans are doomed to be destroyed for the things that aren't human, such as a lack of heart or sound mind, will lead to perpetual ruin for those that do not deserve it. Bottom Line: Metropolis truly is one of the greatest movies ever made. The sets were creative, the acting was well done, the story is simple but not overdone, and it truly haunts people with its themes. This is a great example of Expressionist cinema and, in its most complete form, provides to be one of the strongest and emotionally provocative films to come out of early cinema.",Metropolis

Since it is a silent film the facial expressions and gestures added lots to their acting. The story was well written and very interesting. The uses of audio suited the movie extremely well for the specific scenes. My only small gripe with the movie is its length. Sure the movie is an epic and powerful movie, but I overall felt it was a bit too long, and this isn't even technically the full movie since some of it has been lost. Still length is a small issue because of the scale and build up the movie had.

How can i say this film is bad or good all I do know is that I as a 18 year old British kid did not enjoy the film and was thankful when it was over. For such an old film i just couldn't appreciate it. I do however think that the cinematography is obviously fantastic and very creative for the time the film was made. A second point i would make is, I do not believe silent films can be rated in the same way that the films now can be. They are so different and comparing them is ridiculous.

382,devintheinteresting,A masterpiece that should be seen by all who love film,10,29 June 2015,"Fritz Lang's Metropolis is a film I had heard of, and I knew it's cultural impact, but I had never actually seen it. I decided to download it on my iPad and watched the 2010 restoration. I was expecting a good little sci-fi silent with anti cruel government messages. I did get that, yes, but I got much more. The story follows Freder Frederson (Nice name) who is the son of the mayor of a grand city called Metropolis. Freder encounters a woman named Maria who is the caretaker of the worker's children. Freder learns that all the workers live in their own little underground city and are not allowed into Metropolis. Freder confronts his father about this and gets a negative response. His father then fires his assistant Josaphat. Freder then let's Josaphat live at his house, while he goes off to take the places of workers. Freder learns that Maria also runs an underground church for the workers. She is trying to give them faith that a mediator between brain and hands will come and help them. Freder's father learns of this and has an inventor named Rotwang have his Machine-Man take Maria's form and pose as her to crush their faith in a mediator. For 1927 that is a great plot, even today it works. Fritz Lang really takes advantage of this and gives us some of the best direction I've ever seen. The effects are beautiful and innovative. The use of mirrors and double exposure is just wonderful. The performance are good. Some of the actors over act (The men in the yoshiwara during Maria's dance are just the worst), but some of them give good, non goofy performances. The best performance comes from Brigitte Helm. The way she plays Robot Maria is over the top, but because of that, you have to love it. The ways she moves quickly and talks is just so fun and entertaining. The screenplay is well written, even though the dialogue can be pathetic sometimes. The production design is the most iconic thing about the movie. The way the city of Metropolis looks has influenced a great number of films. It was a vision of the future that does exist today. Look at modern New York City and Metropolis. The resemblance is certainly there. Overall, Metropolis is well directed, interesting, vision of the future with important social commentary. I give a 10/10",Metropolis
383,boc70,Die Mensch-Maschine,10,19 December 2005,"Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" is a revolutionary work in the cinematic medium and is considered by many to be the first film of the science fiction genre. When released in 1927, it stood in stark contrast with American standards of film-making, which were mostly shot in open outdoor areas. Rather than imitate nature, ""Metropolis"" consciously rejected it, with some of the most elaborate and complicated structures ever designed for a motion picture. In doing so, Lang embraced the modernism of his era, in which mass industry continued to widen the gap between classes. The films construction of the 'man-machine' was an appropriate reflection on the times as well. As technology was becoming something which people were growing increasingly dependent upon, the worker was transforming into an extension of the machines in which he or she used.""Metropolis"" is often criticized for being overly exaggerated. People need to take into account when the film was made and the specific context it holds within that particular time period. Obviously, certain aspects of a work made so long ago may seem awkward to many, when it is being judged according to recent expectations. Perhaps one of Lang's most amazing achievements lies in how well so much of the material has withstood the test of time and how incredible of an achievement it was back in 1927. I would further argue that the films expressionism is actually the glue that holds it together. Whether from the larger-than-life sets constructed in the Babelsburg films studios, to the fictional technology used to construct the 'man-machine', the films expressionistic techniques have ultimately heightened the work and helped in making it the artistic achievement and critical success which it has come to be regarded as.",Metropolis
384,crh-82694,Intro to Film Class Review,7,26 September 2018,"Metropolis is considered one of the first science-fiction films ever. The general plot consists of a man raised in the upper class, Freder, who sees the troubles and suffering of the lower, working class, and he works to fix the unfairness in this futuristic dystopia. Freder falls in love along the way, he falls for a revolutionary named Maria, who helps him fix the injustice that the working class has been suffering through. 
 Throughout the film, the director, Fritz Lang uses many different cinematography tricks to make the audience experience the feelings that Lang intended. One of the most heavily used techniques was camera angle, low angle, high angle, eye level, bird's eye, oblique, all of them were used throughout the film to influence the emotions of the audience and the story itself. The city of Metropolis was a gigantic one, that was shown through the use of a bird's eye view of a miniature model of the city; the camera angle combined with the shot size, in this case it was a wide or long shot, gives the audience a taste of the sheer size of this city. The bird's eye angle and the wide shot make people think that even from way up here they still can't see the whole city, even though it's a model, it makes the audience believe that this is a real city that's bigger than they can imagine. The wide shot doesn't really allow for people to focus on one thing because there is so much in the shot that most people want to see everything there, they don't want to miss anything, it is used incredibly well to show the size of the city. There are a couple of scenes where either Freder or Maria is talking to a crowd of people and the speaker is raised above the crowd, this is a great example of how Lang used low angles and medium shots to put the audience in the place of the crowd. The camera is looking up at the speaker, who is standing on top of something so that everyone can see them, the camera shot isn't zoomed way in or way out, it's in the middle, just about what most people in the crowd are seeing, this allows the audience to become a part of the movie. This could probably be argued that it's an eye level shot that's angled up since the camera is at the same height as the crowd, but the effect is the same no matter what angle you call it. There were several chase scenes throughout the film that used camera movement, angles, and editing to add suspense and anxiety to the scenes. When the camera moves with the people running it makes the audience feel as though they are running along with them, varying camera angles adds a little bit of confusion, which is a feeling the people being chased most likely feel. The editing was quite good, for the time period, quick cuts from one alley to another road from a different angle sometimes with a gap before we see the characters in order to make the audience feel anxious as those involved in the chase. The emotions created with these techniques are the part that draw people in to movies, the feeling that we are connected to what is happening. Lang does a good job of drawing people in emotionally even when there are whole scenes from the original film missing; the missing scenes only make it harder to understand the story since it is a silent film and most people now are accustomed to movies with dialogue and soundtracks and sound effects.

389,leaveraml,Metropolis Review,9,6 June 2019,"Metropolis is a film I really enjoyed; a must see! A cross between science fiction and film art, Metropolis takes place in a futuristic city that's inhabitants are divided into an upper class and a worker class. The upper class is referred to as the ""head"" or brain that designed the city. The workers are the ""hand"" that built the city and are responsible for running the machines that keep it alive. Freder, the son of the man who designed the city, meets a woman from the worker class, Maria, and they fall in love. Maria believes that the two classes need a mediator to help with communication between the classes. Otherwise, they will forever be divided. Could Freder be that mediator? Although Metropolis was created in the 1930's, the film looks into issues still relevant in today's world such as the differences between socioeconomic classes and the question of if advancements in technology are better or worse for society.One thing great about this movie is the large cast of extras used to bring scenes to life. There are many scenes where there are so many extras! When first introduced to the workers' environment, I was instantly able to understand the day to day drudgery of the workers' life by seeing two large groups' trek to and from work. I also like how the movements of the individuals in the large group make statements. For example, when first viewing the workers operating the machine, their movements create a rhythm, and I was able to understand that the workers are seen as replaceable just like machine parts. The large cast of extras is especially effective when the workers become an angry mob intent on destroying the machines. It makes such an impact when the workers not only completely fill the large space, but more continue to stream in.I enjoyed the futuristic technology shown in this film such as video conferencing. It is hard to believe that this film was made in the 1930's and includes elements that have been staples in science fiction movies over the years. One scene shows a futuristic city with buildings that stretch to the sky and streets of varying levels full of bumper-to-bumper traffic. There is an android in this film who was created by an inventor, Rotwang, who actually used his hand as a material in creating the android. This android is then transferred into a copy of Maria, and she is able to sway the opinions of others. The inventor has the perfect ""mad scientist's lab"" fully equipped with the levers, test tubes and lightning seen when the Rotwang is creating this copy. The special effects are pretty impressive in this scene, especially when the android's face fades into the face of Maria.I think the acting in this movie is fantastic. Especially that of Brigitte Helm. She plays two different characters and is able to effectively show the differences between the two by changing her facial expressions and body language pertaining to the personalities of each character.I definitely recommend this movie for one interested in seeing the future as it was imagined in the 1930's!",Metropolis

Metropolis gives us a look into how people in 1927 viewed the world and what they expected and feared about the future. The film portrays mass inequality and how technology may not always be to everyone's benefit. Metropolis is the tale of Freder, the main character, who has to become the mediator and help the oppressed workers. There is, however, no clear resolution to the inequality. We do not know if the workers' conditions improve or if the people who live above the city ever take up the responsibility of manning the machines.

398,elisacm,See this movie! Great science fiction and commentary on class issues!,8,23 May 2007,"Fritz Lang's 1920s Metropolis is set in a dreary futuristic world where thinkers live in ivory towers and workers live and toil under the city as slaves to machines driven to produce by the thinkers. As the workers buckle under the strain and plot a proletariat revolution, Maria, the movie's heroin, encourages them to turn away from violence and to involve a mediator instead. However, an evil genius with a personal vendetta for the man in charge of Metropolis, kidnaps Maria and uses her likeness to create an evil humanoid machine that incites the workers to destroy the machines that support Metropolis. Lang's Metropolis creates an interesting third dimension to the classic story of class struggle by going beyond pitting upper class (thinkers) against the lower class (workers and doers) and introducing machines and automation as a third class in the struggle. The characters in Metropolis are forced to go beyond examining their relationships with one another and the dependency of the workers on the thinkers and vice versa, but are also forced to examine their relationship with machines: The workers feel enslaved by machines. However, the existence of Metropolis and the workers' lives are dependent on the machines. The evil humanoid in the likeness of Maria tries to tempt and destroy the upper echelons of Metropolis society, as well as the machines that the city is dependent on. While much of this silent film has been lost, plot summaries that have been inserted into the missing parts help pull together the movie so that it doesn't have too many plot gaps. The art deco set design gives this futuristic world an interesting timeless, placeless feel. On the whole, this classic film is interesting, and thought provoking.",Metropolis
399,lauraebush,Metropolis Echoes Nietzsche and Book of Genesis,4,22 May 2008,"Metropolis screenwriters utilize silent and black and white effects to present a post-war, Marxist critique. They highlight not only class dualisms, but basic temptations of human knowledge. Metropolis' construction of fragile human nature echoes Nietzsche's paradigm of the over man as well as the Biblical account of creation.Freder's naive portrayal embodies the fragility of human nature. His previously exaggerated facial expressions lose animation when he is caught with the young woman and banished from his father's house. His entrance to his father's boardroom in a white shirt symbolizes innocence. The terror in approaching his father, asking what it's like to be dismissed, shows childlike sensitivity and desperation.Freder's acting style seems minimalist by today's standards. Yet his exaggerated facial expressions, gaudy make-up, and melancholy demeanor at the beginning position him as a catharsis for understanding the World War I generation.This once genteel young man is shell shocked to see machines operating and exploding. The utopian, frivolous garden world he once enjoyed is a burden as greater knowledge makes him aware of the workers' plight. Similarly, World War I was initially perceived as a swift triumph of intellectualism and military might to end all wars. Trench warfare and combat machinery developed, but Germans were surprised when the war and its consequences lasted much longer. References to war trauma are conveyed as workers march facing the ground and drag gurneys through an explosion site.These scenes carry generational messages subtle to today's audience. The film accurately portrays the identity struggle soldiers faced within the expectations of urban economized culture. Within this context Nietzsche's over man paradigm developed, conveying man's joy and suffering as the same in an unequal world. The quest for knowledge to resurrect Freder's mother as a machine echoes Nietzschean impulse for man to take vengeance overcoming social adversity.As a man-made machine intercedes for the plight of underground workers, characters expect knowledge and machines to replace God's vengeance. The Tower of Babel is referenced as Freder flees his father. Such symbolism awakens understanding of the temptation of man made machines and presumptions to address social inadequacies.",Metropolis
400,jbalough,Good Flick,9,28 May 2008,"Metropolis is the oldest movie I have seen; therefore I do not feel it is fair to compare with recent science fiction films. I think the film is phenomenal and creative for the era in which it was made. The use of scenery to create the skyline for the mega-city is brilliant. I thought the special effects used throughout the movie were innovative, especially the laboratory scene when Rotwang creates the 'Maria' robot. Although the movie was in black and white, I noticed the color of the character's clothing was part of their role. For instance, Freder was dressed in white to portray a good guy. The acting was a bit dramatic compared to today's actors, but considering it is a silent film it was tolerable. I enjoyed the movie and place it on my list of 'Must See' movies.",Metropolis
401,dhemmin1,well-done early sci-fi movie,7,27 May 2008,"People in large groups have been stupid and cruel for a very long time. At the very least, they have been stupid and cruel since the mid 1920's. Fritz Lang's Metropolis captures very well the essence of this insanity of the mob mentality. Painted against the backdrop of a dystopian society, Metropolis tells the story of a Marxist type setting where class conflict exists between the planners of the upper city and the workers who toil underground to keep the city's machines in order. The heart of Metropolis is one where the privileged rely on the work of the oppressed and the only two people with any strength of will are nearly spurned by the ignorant masses.One of the main assumptions throughout the film is that the workers are miserable, but given hope through the peaceful preaching of Maria. Essentially, in realistic fashion, the thinkers and planners take advantage of the workers and care not about how difficult it is for them to live as they operate the machines below the surface. The film contends that correspondence between the ""brain"" and the ""hands"" or the thinkers and workers is impossible without the heart acting as a mediator. There must be one who understands both sides to mediate because alone the two are too different from each other as evidenced by Fredersen's attempt to further control the masses with the robot, and the ensuing attempts of the workers to destroy the city, despite their better judgments.The film's greatest strength lies in its ability to skillfully portray the tendency of people in large groups to follow the voice of a leader. The workers quickly flock to Maria's words, though why they choose to follow her is not exactly explained. Perhaps it's because she acts as the only positive presence in the workers' lives. At any rate, it is a bit strange that every one of the workers continues to follow the robot Maria even though she essentially goes completely against the real Maria's previous ideology. It is thus both commendable and disturbing that the film manages to assume that none of the workers can think for themselves. What's more, the film doesn't do the best job of differentiating between the Marias and it can become a bit confusing to follow which is which.Metropolis is a film that largely succeeds, especially when considering its time. The cinematography is well done, as is the expressive acting, and it should be given that it is a silent film. The film had the potential to be a bit more interesting: Perhaps instead of the robot Maria being burned at the stake, it could have been the real Maria, only to have the workers find out that the robot was the real malefactor. Something like this might have prompted the workers to take a bit more care before deciding foolishly to destroy their city. As it stands the ending is a bit cliché, well-suited to mainstream audiences, but stands as the finale to components that are mostly well-done.",Metropolis
402,aharri7,Film Review on Metropolis,8,11 June 2008,"What if there was a city, hidden deep under the surface of the earth that was the powerhouse to how our world was run? How would we feel if we discovered that a whole multitude of people were working exhaustingly away so that we could live in the lap of luxury? I would imagine if we ever were to find out, we would be extremely scared and apprehensive to the fact that our lives were in the hands of others. Actually, the way I work, I would probably not be surprised to find out that WE were part of the underground city, slaving away for those above! Fritz Lang's Metropolis was the movie that I devoted my time to. Even being a silent film, it captivated me in a sort of disturbed way. The movie's thesis is stated several times throughout the movie. At the beginning of the film, words popped up onto the screen. They were, ""THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS MUST BE THE HEART!"". At first, that meant absolutely nothing to me, but as the movie progressed, I slowly began to see how the thesis panned out.I thought that the film Metropolis showed, very contradictorily, how much technology had advanced and how much it still was so lacking compared to what we have today. Even though it was a silent film, I had absolutely no problem understanding everything that was going on. I even think that awareness is heightened with no words, only the music of the orchestra. Of course, music plays a vital role in movies today. It sets the mood, whether happy or sad or dangerous. The music definitely portrayed every urgency excellently.One thing that I was hoping to see in the movie was an encounter between the real Maria and Robot Maria. As soon as Maria was able to escape from Rothgang's house, I was waiting and waiting for an encounter between the real and the fake Maria; and perhaps a conflict as to whom the people would believe. Obviously, technology was not so advanced then that it could accomplish such a feat, like was done in the movie The Parent Trap, where one girl played two girls in one scene.Although certain parts of the film were a little creepy and disturbing, I thought that Metropolis was a good film. Even though the trials took the characters through tumultuous highs and lows, the thesis came to fruition in the end with a happy ending.",Metropolis
403,ibaunited,Outdated,1,17 December 2010,"The movie is best described as pathetic. It may be good when people had nothing else, but not today. Not even after sound appeared in films. I wonder what the film is doing so high up in the ratings when it was a galactic effort to even sit through it. Metropolis is a complete waste of time. Ever since dialogues appeared in the films, there is not a single film that is considered good without good dialogues. Take any of the top films, even the IMDb top 250 list. There is not a single film that has won its place with run of the mill dialogues. And this one is without sound. Today's audience wants a story, strong dialogue, good acting and effects. The acting is stiff and out of fashion in Metroplis. The excessive use of expressions to make up for lack of sound may be understandable back then, but today it just looks a bit too funny. My recommendation: Don't watch it!",Metropolis
404,james-reed-3,Fritz Lang is a Master,9,26 September 2008,"Fritz Lang's masterpiece of a film is one of the greatest examples of exactly what silent film should be. With gripping plot lines, outstanding special effects for its time, and filmed under the direction of a great mastermind of early film, Metropolis is the film that influenced every science-fiction film that followed it. This film brings superb storytelling and emotional themes together in a beautiful harmony that grips the viewer and does not let go for more than two hours.Lang seizes the emotions of the viewer from the very beginning as he first focuses on the workers of the industrial underworld of the metropolis, toiling endlessly at machines to eek out an existence. As the shift changes, the outgoing workers shuffle drearily to a slow beat, exhausted from the days toil. In subtle contrast, the new shift's workers shuffle in a similar, slightly quicker, fashion, ready to be beaten down by a shift's work. In a handful of silent seconds, Lang has shown the audience the meaningless lives of these workers, and the hopelessness felt by each and every man. Not a single worker has a face, a name, or any distinction from any other worker. Each one is of similar height, wearing an identical uniform, shuffling in an identical fashion towards a meaningless day of labor.When the camera was close to a small group of workers, the audience notices that they are all the same. Each man has his head down, shoulders hunched, moving in a restricted fashion. As the workers totter along, the camera cuts from one end of the cold stone corridor, revealing an interminable line of workers identical to those seen before. The line of workers continues for close to an entire minute, reinforcing the hopelessness of these men to the audience. Immediately following, Lang reveals the city of the workers, a bleak collection of underground tenements into which the workers shuffle, heads down, shoulders hunched.In stark contrast, the director then reveals to the viewer the glistening paradise of the metropolis rising high above the ground, inhabited by the privileged sons of the city. Lang moves from an underground industrial area where men are forced to physical labor to be able to survive to an immaculate stadium where the elite run races for pure entertainment. The chosen sons of the city also frolic in the Gardens of Eternal Pleasure. This pleasure park is described by the film as a diversion for the people of the upper city, but it appears that the garden is only a diversion from other pleasures. The young and beautiful people find romance and chase each other around blooming flora and gushing fauna in Eden, without an inkling of worry. Peacocks strut the manicured lawns as their human counterparts fall into each other's arms in passion and the heat of the moment. In an emotional moment for the plastic people of the upper city and the audience, the beautiful vision of a woman, Maria bursts into the gardens, surrounded by peasant children.This moment is both critical to the plot and to capturing the attention and emotions of the viewer. As Maria gracefully steps forward, Freder, the son of the leader of the metropolis, rejects the embrace of one of the beautiful women of the garden because he is so taken by the natural beauty of this woman. In quick succession, the camera cuts from the face of Freder, back to the face of Maria, and back to Freder again. Each time the camera changes angles, it moves closer and closer to the subject, and his or her emotions become more and more clear. The two worlds of the metropolis, entirely separate until this moment, are about to collide as these future lovers see each other for the first time. At this crucial juncture, Lang gives nothing away, and focuses all attention completely on the sparks flying between this woman of the underworld and the chosen one of the elite. Without words, the director has set up the critical emotional connection that will drive the plot forward for the remaining two hundred minutes of this masterpiece.Specifically, there is a shot showing Freder in a position of fear, as if he has not quite decided what to make of the intrusion of these creatures of the underworld. One of his arms is pointed forward in a defensive position, as if the cringing children will spring into action and strike at any moment. He is breathing heavily and the woman he was holding a moment before is now taking refuge from the threat behind him. Lang then cuts to a tight shot of Maria's expression, as she looks up hopefully, as if asking Freder for his help. Nothing else is visible in the shot except for Maria's face and shoulders, as she looks deep into the camera with a pleading look on her face. Her wide eyes and hint of a smile contrast greatly with the fear in the eyes of Freder.This shot is a microcosm of Lang's work with the entire film. He continually contrasts the decadence and waste of the upper city with the strife and angst of the lower workers. Metropolis is a gem of the early age of film, and any aspiring filmmaker owes it to himself to see this film.",Metropolis
405,jbdc30,Artistically and Visually Brilliant. Intellectually Moronic.,5,21 December 2010,"I was very anxious to see ""Metropolis"" for the first time. I had been into silent movies for a couple of years, but hadn't had the opportunity to see Fritz Lang's classic. I finally saw it at a silent movie theater in Hollywood, and my feelings were, to say the least, mixed.The film is visually stunning. Monumental sets, brilliantly directed scenes, amazing special effects (by the standards of the time). In fact, I might say that I was more enthralled by the visual effects of this movie than I was by say, Lord of the Rings or Avatar. Whereas Cameron and Jackson used CGI to make their visions come true; Lang had to use camera trickery, paint, and wood.This movie no doubt set the lexicon for the Sci-Fi and blockbuster genre in stone. The images of Metropolis have been repeated in innumerable movies. The scene of the underground city being flooded has curious similarities to James Cameron's Titanic. Even the villainous Rotwang can be seen in the characters, Dr. Strangelove and Doc Brown from Back to the Future.But then there's the story. And the dialogue. And the acting (which is overwrought, even by the standards of the time. But I don't have enough room to go into that.)Starting with the opening line: ""Look---These are your brothers,"" a violent cringe would run through my body every time the intertitles would appear.The later line about the head and hands needing the heart as mediator caused a huge outburst of laughter in the theater. This serves as the basis for the moral of the story, which was eerily similar to ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"". Essentially, it can boiled down to this: Somebody (according to writer, Thea von Harbou's later beliefs, this turned out to be Adolf Hitler) needs to appeal to the hearts of capitalist managers and tell them to be nice to their workers. The outcome is a grudging handshake between the head manager, Joh Frederson, and the leader of the workers, Grot; and thus begins a shining new day!""Metropolis"" also incorporates religious symbolism which is, to say the very least, heavy-handed. Scenes of the Seven Deadly Sins, The Tower of Babel, an altar to Moloch, and the Flood all warn of doom to decadent societies that exploit the weak and kill the righteous.In the end, this muddled mixture of Socialist calls for justice, and Christian Apocalypticism creates a political message that Lang himself described as ""silly.""I recommend this film for its artistic brilliance and groundbreaking techniques. But don't go into this expecting an award quality film.If you want to get into silent film, this is a relatively easy one to get start with. However, I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing. I've met too many people who've said that Metropolis was the best silent movie they've ever seen; which probably means that it was the only one that they ever bothered to watch. I would recommend ""Sunrise"" or ""City Lights"" as a first over this.",Metropolis

408,sainttan13,Picking up the Brain of Metropolis,10,25 April 2011,"Most people dismiss easily this movie because they find it boring, but truth is, the movie is really really interesting. The key is to watch it from the point of view of the 20's (by knowing the culture and ideas back then). Also, watch the film as if you're watching theater. The acting may seem overacted but that's really how it was in theater. The shots were advanced...It is extremely ahead of its time.The cast were admirable. They performed the way theater actors then performed (a lot of interesting characters). I also believe the number of actors were outstanding as well at that time. Children even acted. It even has a relatively big twist. Not to mention that the plot was unique and ahead of its time.It showed culture and ideas back then. The way of acting reflected the theater days = a bit over-dramatic and exaggerated. The shots, effects (psychological drama of multiple shots per scene), lighting (flashlight was used to highlight an intense revelation), graphics (the city drowning might have been a big thing back then) and narration were advanced during that time.The plot included (a very advanced thinking back then), the creation of intelligent machines capable of human simulation, underground cities, human survival being dependent on machines, and a solitary ruler/dictator that is a monopoly. It did not show any nature at all: animals or plants and trees, even soil! This ""is"" the future, the movie says. And that was a scary yet interesting thought back then.They inserted great ideas of Marxism, Plato's allegory of the cave, or Buddha's story, personal identity, the experience and sense of admiration, rebellion (mobs), and greed.They viewed the advancement of flying cars, but in the movie they were small planes able to fly low. The skyscrapers were designed as ""the taller and bigger, the better"", instead of what we have today.The flyovers were done right, so were the trains. The elevator. Even the traffic (when back then, vehicles were minimal) Amazing.They probably viewed the advancement of robot that could really simulate human beings. However, they did not expect the advance of science making cloning possible.The music expressed the emotion and transition of the story really well. The movie is a view of a futuristic tragedy, and even though the score may not sound dramatic in our sense today, back then the music used during the sad parts could've brought tears to the cruelest man.And the ending, wow, the morale of the story is just really beautiful. Great film. I bet I wouldn't left the theaters in a few tears if I belonged in the era.

415,oldschoolassassin,"Extraorindary film, but with a heavy Marxist message",10,22 May 2008,"Has slavery truly been abolished? Men and women go to work every day in the world. Some never return. Many work long hours, some even twenty-four hours straight. Many of these jobs are grueling, dangerous and people even die while at work due to overexertion, accidents or negligence. For as hard as these people work many are paid minimum wage; some even less than that. With all of this mind, I believe one can soundly argue that slavery does still exist.I feel the 1927 film Metropolis conveys this. In my opinion, this film is an early political vehicle to persuade its audience to embrace Marxism. I say this because it shows the workers (or proletariat) being exploited, basically worked to death, by the rich (or capitalist bourgeoisie).I also think the Maria character is symbolic of the Christian church. Marx described organized religion as ""the opiate of the masses."" I feel Maria is supposed to be this opiate because: for one, her name is Maria (or Mary) like the mother of Jesus; two, she wears white and is beautiful similar to man's concept of an angel; and three she speaks of mediator (or messiah) who will come and deliver the workers from their plight. This fits with Marx again for he believed religion was used to keep the proletariat subjugated, extolling virtues such as submitting to authority, pay taxes, turn the other cheek, be happy that you are a slave, you will be rich in heaven. This is what Maria said, be patient.I don't feel the film made it completely clear as to why the rich man wanted to use violence against the workers. I wasn't sure if this was to set an example that if they ever tried to rise up and overthrow the powers that be, they would be swiftly punished and perhaps even killed. This seemed a bit strange to me because if all of the workers were killed, who would do the work? I feel this film probably did reach many of its viewers because many probably have similar exploitative jobs. People probably do feel challenged when seeing something like this. However, I feel the problem with this film (as with most other political movies) is that they bring up a problem, complain about it, but propose no practical solution or policy alternative. At the end of the film the ""mediator"" or ""heart"" is uniting the rich man with the worker, or uniting the ""brains"" with the ""hands."" Perhaps Fritz Lang then felt that the audience would be inspired to launch myriad political reforms. I honestly don't know.I honestly feel, for it's time, this was an extraordinary film. I feel the politics of it were expressed explicitly, implicitly, and creatively. And most importantly, this film was very entertaining. The actors were excellent and the directing was phenomenal. I do think the whole purpose of the robot/agent provocateur should have been developed more.

Until the early minutes the plot intrigues and the next 150 minutes flow without boring. Scenography and the futuristic and finely made environments project the viewer in the dystopia of Metropolis; city in which, Fritz Lang, skillfully mixes architectural and industrial elements of the Twenties with medieval elements and religious references: robot burned at the stake, machines transformed into ancient divinities, the emblematic tower of Babel and the Rotwag's alchemical laboratory.

I was incredibly surprised to enjoy the film so thoroughly.The acting was absolutely amazing. There were distinct changes in the cast throughout the film, particularly Brigitte Helm's portrayal of the Machine Man versus Maria. Every time I saw her on stage as the Machine Man I was absolutely chilled to the bone. She conveyed both of the characters so uniquely and seamlessly that I can now only envy her amazing talent.The direction was superb, every scene, every cut, was so utterly perfect. You could stop the film at any time and have a perfectly composed picture. The balance of lights and darks were perfect, especially when Maria was running through the catacombs. The shots were hard, being in such limited light, but they were pulled off and looked amazingly natural.As to the plot line, very very unique- if simple. However, simple plot lines are often the ones that influence the watcher the most. At no time did I find myself bored or listless. However- for those who cannot seem to appreciate the beauty of simplicity and need an action sequence blaring in your face every five minutes- this is not the film for you.Now as to the sets, music, and ensemble. The sets were amazing, following the visions of German Impressionists of that time- one of my favorite facets of old German films. The sheer scale of the sets, and variety of them, was stunning. I also believe that the music, contrary to popular belief, was very well suited to the film and moved me through the movie as fluidly as the acting and editing. The ensemble cast was amazing as well, not to mention the huge size of it- impressive even by today's standards. The choices of characterization, particularly the workers, were spot on. The workers' hobbled walk was perfect and gave me chills every time I saw it.All in all, an remarkable film that I could watch over and over again and see new things every time. For those of you who don't like the film because of its simplicity, its length, its lack of color, and its lack of talking- I beg you to reconsider. 10 out of 10",Metropolis

Since I saw it that first time in my English class I have longed to see it again. The movie keeps you thinking about it for months. I highly recommend everyone see the movie Metropolis because it makes so much sense, and after seeing all the science fiction movies eighty years later, one will be shocked as to how much in the movie is familiar to what we still use in our flicks today. It is clear that every SciFi flick that has come to pass since Metropolis is somehow based on Fritz Lang's brilliant movie.

424,yxs-07273,"""Metropolis"", Online Comments",9,24 September 2018,"""Metropolis"" is a classic expressionist film directed by Fritz lang, a German film director. In the history of science fiction film, this film also has a milestone status, classic scenes are repeatedly used by many science fiction films. Other than that, I found it to be a thoroughly religious film in the guise of a science fiction film. Although there are many dystopian elements in the film. But the overall tone is an optimistic, religiously utopian mood. Then please let me explain my understanding to each reader.Joh Fredersen, the capitalist - the master of metropolis
 The 1920s was a period of rapid capitalist development, and before the global economic crisis hit in 1929, Germany struggled and wavered to develop its own economy. In this case, the capitalist also has a sense of authority that is superior and unquestionable. It must be emphasized that Joh Fredersen is not only a symbol of the capitalist class, but also a metaphorical religious symbol: god. The reasons are as follows:
 As the ruler of the whole metropolis, Joh Fredersen enjoyed a high degree of authority in the whole metropolis. His words could plunge people into the abyss of despair (as could be seen from his dismissal of the supervisor). And much of his opening shot is of standing in the window of a towering building overlooking everything outside, and the director goes to great lengths to make the audience understand that this is a master in charge. 
 Second, he could have suppressed the workers' rebellion, but he only told the foreman and the workers through the foreman that if the machines were destroyed, their homes would be flooded. In this regard, the director not only wants to say that ""crushing machines cannot bring freedom"", but also wants to make people witness the destruction of their homes caused by their own atrocities. He also wants to imply that human beings cannot communicate with god. I take a series of suffering caused by a series of wrong actions that I want to ""pursue freedom"". 
 Finally, it was his own son, Freder, who served as a mediator between him and the workers. Although he did not give up his son voluntarily in the film, he did not limit Joh Fredersen' actions. It can be said that Joh Fredersen went to the workers with his acquiescence, and he went to the workers completely and completely. Therefore, it is not strange to regard the capitalist Fred sen as representing god.The woman teacher Maria
 ""Look, these are your brothers."" Freder, who was playing with the girls by the fountain, suddenly saw a crowd of ragged boys and girls, led by a plain schoolmistress. It was her words that struck the carefree fun of Freder that made him want to ""get down there."" This Maria, though it did not give birth to his body, did indeed turn Freder into another person, and his soul was reborn. The name Mary itself has a strong religious color, but the early preaching of patience and waiting for workers in ancient tombs gave her a religious color beyond the virgin Mary.The foreman
 When many people watch ""Metropolis"", they will focus on several main characters, such as Joh Fredersen, Freder, Maria and the inventor Rotwan, but actually the foreman is also an indispensable figure in the whole movie.
First, the foreman facilitated Freder's trip to the factory to find out.In the film, with the help of the foreman, Freder enters the factory and begins his work as a ""heart"", or ""mediator"", with the huge machine that devours the lives of the workers. Therefore, the foreman plays the role of prophet here.
 Second, the foreman intervened to stop the frantic actions of the workers, who, at the instigation of Maria, told the workers that the result would only be the destruction of their own homes. The foreman had to tell the metropolitan's owner, the capitalist Fred sen, that while the workmen were still determined, the answer was: let them go. At this point, the foreman's role becomes the figure of the late old testament prophet that the bible warns against transgressions and is completely ignored by the people. 
 Again, as the workers bask in the joy of smashing their machines, the foreman comes out and asks ""where are your children"" and takes them from a populist pinnacle of joy to a moment of desperation where their children's lives are seriously threatened. The scene also has a symbolic meaning: after indulging in the challenge of god's authority, human beings will always suffer the consequences, but it is often their children who suffer the consequences rather than themselves. In this scene, the foreman's role is more similar to that of the apostle who preached the Gospel of great men of repentance in the new testament.
 Finally, when Freder and Rotwan were fighting on the roof, it was the foreman who first spotted them and led the crowd to see them, and finally made peace on behalf of the workers and the capitalists. In fact, the foreman here, playing the representative of the human church, became the first person to be associated with god (shown in the film as capitalist Fred sen) and good. Therefore, the role and performance of the foreman in this film, every action has a very significant metaphorical meaning and performance value.The capitalist's son, Freder
 In fact, the author realized that the religious significance of the film was from Freder' discovery of the hard work of the workers in the factory. Even if he stopped for a few seconds, there might be an explosion that would kill all the workers, so he decided to take his place after a worker passed out. At this point, a worker gave him a set of overalls to wear.
 First, he saw Maria coming into the garden with a group of workers' children and said to him, ""look, these are your brothers."" When he arrived at the factory, he witnessed a machine explosion and had the illusion of ""the devil's gate that eats people"". On the other hand, he chose to take his place because he felt sorry for the exhausted workers. After experiencing the heavy, repetitive work himself, he crouched over the machine, crying out in pain: ""father, I never knew that ten hours would be a torture."" Here, he himself abandoned the garden of paradise to the leisure and joy of life, willing to experience the hard work of the bottom workers.
 Second, as workers smash their machines, the workers' housing estates begin to spray water underground. (it's worth mentioning that the scene here is very similar to the fountain where Freder and his girl play around at the beginning of the film. Freder rushed into the workers' quarters to help Maria and other nannies save the workers' children. The children had great hopes for Freder, and they did not hesitate to follow his lead and follow the foreman's directions as they fled from the flooded workhouse.
 Finally, at the end of the film, he fights inventor rotwan, who has the upper hand at first, even knocking Freder to the ground. But Freder eventually kicked rotwan off the roof, and the inventor fell to his death.Inventor Rotwan
 In normal times, the development of science should be expected and expected, but why in this movie, the inventor played a bad guy, and was shamefully kicked off the roof by fritz and fell to his death. Why did the inventor take on the role of villain Boss and clown in the film? The answer is simple, because in this movie, rotwan comes out as an image of satan.
 It is conceivable that the machines should be of underground plants from Rotwan, and indeed for the world of life provides a variety of necessary resources, but they also became one of the underlying workers at the root of miserable life, make workers almost lost the characteristics as a person, live like machinery, even just collapsed in a person as a backup parts fill up. This reflects that in the age of film making, people have an attitude towards machinery and technology: they need and fear, but fear and disgust are the majority.
 In Mr. Freder's imagination, the factory machine became a monster's gaping mouth, and workers lined up mechanically to the mouth of the monstrous demon. And the most colorful villain in the whole movie, machine Maria is also from Rotwan's hand. His laboratory is full of strange machines, bubbling flask beakers and giant electric switches, exactly the sort of ""laboratory of the future"" people imagined in the 1920s. In a sense, perhaps that's because of the natural racial divide between robots and humans. Nevertheless, Rotwan's laboratory is a complex reflection of people's worship and fear of the development of science. People believe that the development of science will bring about significant changes in life, and even expect machines to replace human work completely. On the other hand, the development of science is frightening because the workers on the assembly line have become a part of the machines. This development makes them full of fear about their future relationship with the machines.Robot Maria
 In the film, Maria keeps saying to the workers, you have to endure, you have to wait for the mediator, you have to endure the fate. Interestingly, this apparent ""drug of thought"" was cut off by Joh Fredersen, leaving Rotwan to impersonate a robot and disrupt the normal order of workers' lives. The appearance of robot Maria can be said to be fascinating and very demagogic. The first sentence on the stage is ""I have taught you to be patient, but there is no need to be patient now"", completely breaking the original teaching of ""waiting for mediation"". And the workers actually did not have a doubt, did not hesitate to follow the arm shouted.
 Machine Maria is a complete villain in this movie, a love-hate villain. She is loved because she is not so thin, so weak, so far from the world as Maria is; She was energetic, provocative and lively. Every word she said caught the hearts of the workers. Robot Maria sets up a confrontation between workers and capitalists, and is so successful that the big machines in the factories are smashed to pieces, that the w",Metropolis
425,aic-09122,Intro To Film Class Review,8,25 September 2018,"Metropolis is the first Sci Fi film that was created. It is about a future in a massive metropolis with a heavily divided upper and working class. The movie follows the son of the creator of the metropolis as he try's to unite the working class and the upper class to build a better city. 
This movie is fascinating as most of the visual design and even the special effects hold up well to this day. The physical set design was really well designed and extremely impressive. Even in movies today with CGI and modern effects do they rarely capture the scale of things in such a spectacular way. The hand drawn effects of the movie also still holdup today, like when the various rings around the machine man that had to be painstakingly hand drawn on each frame. The wider shots are equally impressive with the wide views of the city and the moving traffic when showing the exterior areas of Metropolis. It would be very interesting to see the original sets for the movie, I imagine that they spent a lot of effort to produce such large and intricate sets. The verticality in many of the scenes gives a sense of enormity of the setting. The amount of moving parts in the machine rooms gives a hectic but still extremely orderly feeling to the film, which ties well into the massive machine city. A lot of the emotion of the setting can be attributed to the use of so many extras. They sheer amount of people on screen at time really gives a unique weight to the setting that modern films seem to lack. 
Another interesting aspect of this film is the choreography of the extras. Their movement lends to the film a lot of the impact on the audience. When the workers are marching in a monotonous fashion completely in sync, it makes it seem like the workers are no more important than the machines that they tend, and are just replaceable cogs in the machine. When at the machines their frantic movements at the levers and knobs gives a sense of desperation as they try to keep up with the demands of the machines. When the workers begin to destroy the machines they begin to dance in lines jubilantly, even if it may have been misplaced. Another time when this helped the film was when the workers city was flooding and the children kept streaming from the buildings and congregating around Maria added to the panic of the scene. Finally when the mob is chasing Maria and they mix with the doomsday crowd the movements of everyone becomes so chaotic really bringing the movie to its climax. The choreography of the extras gives an extra dimension to the film, and helps convey the emotions present in the film, instead of with dialogue. The synchronized nature of it as well gave the movie a strong sense of what it was conveying, since every person moved with such purpose and precision. Even though the choreography was a necessary thing to do in the film since it was silent, it was so well executed that it really elevated the film, giving it extra depth in what each scene was conveying.
Overall this was a very enjoyable film (and my first silent film). Even with the very limited dialogue it was easy to follow the plot of the movie. The stunning visual design is what drew me to the film, and its clear that a number of other science fiction films, most notably blade runner, took inspiration from this film.",Metropolis
426,jtb-25814,Metropolis's Influence on the Genre of Sci-Fi and the Industry,7,25 September 2018,"Metropolis is regarded as one of the first great science fiction films and its influence is clearly seen on some of the most popular films from its genre throughout history. Despite the gaps in the story and missing segments, it still manages to entertain nearly a century after its original release. Metropolis broke barriers in the special effects department as well as the genre of science fiction. Its influences can be seen everywhere throughout film history. The film however, isn't without its drawbacks. A bland story and soundtrack mixed with some subpar acting are the few blemishes on the otherwise stunning project.
 Star Wars, Blade Runner and High Treason are all staples of the science fiction film genre. After viewing Metropolis one can see how heavily they are influenced by many elements of the film. Mad scientists, humanoid robots and futuristic cities are all common elements or any sci-fi film you might see at the theater in modern times but back in the 1920s, Lang was pioneering these symbols. Think about how many sci-fi heroes or villains who have had prothetic hands throughout film history: Dr. Strangelove, Luke Skywalker, Captain Hook, Peeta Melark, etc. Also the signature mad scientist lab with curly test tubes, an operation table with thick leather straps, and of course the evil laugh as their experiments unfold. Common troupes viewers take for granted in modern fils were revolutionary ideas back when the Metropolis was released. 
 In the 20s when the film was being produced, all special effects had to be done without the assistance of computers, this led to Karl Freund and his special effects team to come up with some revolutionary ways to create the effects. They used mirror effects to make small models appear large while the actors are still able to move on the set. This created some epic scenes with towering city backdrops. The special effects with the transformation of Maria into the machine were also revolutionary with the glowing rings moving around her body. Director Lang was know to have his actors stand in cold water for hours during the flood scene and even have the actor of Maria being ""burned alive"" by real flames for authenticity.
 Its also worth noting Lang's unique directing style. Fritz Lang placed the workers in a visual patter for two main reasons. The first is to show how Joh Fredersen uses them as objects not humans. By giving them robotic, ornamental movements the viewer can see how the workers are stripped of their humanity when they are forced to work under the city with the machines. The second reason Land uses these patters is to show the development of the workers over the length of the film. The viewer can notice how at the beginning of the film, the workers are placed in patters. However, later in the film they are placed randomly and act erratically. This is to show the chaos caused my the Machine Man. As soon as this chaotic character is introduced to them they not longer move in an organized formation. The best examples of this are the two elevator scenes. In the first elevator scene, all of the workers are marching head down, in even rows. In the second elevator scene later in the film, all the workers are running out of order and climbing over the railing of the elevator. There is no longer any order to their movement. At the end of the film, there is one scene where all the workers march in a triangular pattern. This is after then Machine Man is burned and order is restored when Freder links the ""head"" and the ""hands"".
 Metropolis isn't without its drawbacks. The acting is out of date and exaggerated. Examples of this include the chase scene between Rotwang and Maria in the catacombs and the fight scene between Freder and Rotwang on the church roof. These scenes are very drawn out along with an outdated style of acting potentially bores the viewer. The story is also quite bland and confusing to follow. Missing segments may contribute to this but it is evident that the original story is not very original or full if twists, suspense or surprises. The music is also average. For a silent film, the music is all that the viewer hears for over two hours straight so having an excellent music selection and production for the film is crucial to keep the viewers engaged. 
 As the films tattered history came together over the years, film aficionados are lucky to be able to view the work in near completeness. In contrast, when the film was released, most film experts disregarded the piece as it received unfavorable reviews by confused critics such as HG Wells. Although the film is slightly dated, it can still be enjoyed in its original form and through its countless influences in the history of filmography.",Metropolis

In the third part of the movie, cameras alternating between the dancing workers, the crazy peoples in the Metropolis and Freder and Maria who are trying to save workers children. The music in these scenes performed a large contrast of these people, fully expressed the madness of people driven by a single robot.",Metropolis
428,cme-40632,We aren't here for the story,8,25 September 2018,"Directed by Fritz Lang, Metropolis is a Sci-Fi film which depicts the story of a city with a large disparity between the working class and the wealthy in which the leader's son falls in love with a working class woman and, in the process of trying to make things right, causes events which lead to the destruction of the city. The film, having been produced in the late 1920's, was a massive, experimental undertaking which only proves to further exemplify the genius and technological marvel that the film truly embodied. Many scenes in Metropolis hold up even today in special effects and cinematography technology as an amazing example of what proper editing and special effects could bring to a story. Though in the modern day the story of Metropolis, with the sci-fi setting, stark and obvious secondary meanings behind the scenes, and somewhat predictable storyline may not hold up, for the time period it was produced in it was unlike anything else that had been produced on stage. While perhaps a shame such beautiful and masterful cinematography went into a story that seems as manufactured and unfinished as Metropolis' may have been, it was amazing work in each and every frame nevertheless. The story, while understandable and while the 'main' idea was completed does seem to show a story in which Fritz Lang wanted to continue to add more and more but, in the end, was not able to complete his entire vision. Some of this loss may be attributed to the fact much of the original film was lost, but it gives Metropolis a strangely unfinished feeling to it while being undoubtedly whole.
As it was, Metropolis was and still is a shining star of expressionist film making, Metropolis uses wide angle framing to capture the masses of workers marching in unison and places them in stark contrast to the seemingly utopian world of their wealthier city planner counterparts. Each scene possesses both blatant forwards meanings that are displayed through impressionistic choices and deeper meaning brought forth through inflection of what is shown and the how the scene is portrayed, ultimately revealing the deeper intentions of the film as a whole and the story behind the oppressed lower class rising to claim it's rights. This ironically even reflects reality in Fritz Lang's director style as he was reportedly rather cruel to his workers to the point in which producers feared worker revolts on set. However, it is that bleeding of the reality into the creation of the film that also gives Metropolis some of its greatest merits in cinematography and effects. Many of the worker class extras and children were actual poor working class people, and the lack of stunt doubles being used in many scenes allowed for continuous, unedited shots that grant an extra level of realism to the film. Overall, Metropolis is not a film to be enjoyed for its narrative or emotionally moving story telling ability, the now clichéd idea of the 'head' (Leaders) and 'hands'(Workers) falling apart when the heart(love and empathy) does not connect them does it no justice in a modern age of these stories being common place. Instead, Metropolis is to be viewed from the view of appreciation for the art of cinematography and expressionistic development in the time period in which it was produced. The stretches of which the available technology was used and the painstaking methods in which the so memorable and notable imagery and scenes were created and the reasoning behind each are to be marveled upon. As it is, Metropolis is a film to be enjoyed for the artistic mastery it represents instead of the story it tried to convey.",Metropolis

430,rvm-18257,"Well done, enjoyable film",10,27 September 2018,"Directed by Fritz Lang and released in 1927, Metropolis is considered by most film critics as a ground-breaking classic from the silent film era. It follows various conflicts relating to a futuristic city, it's inhabitants and those who power it behind the scenes while exploring the themes of a society that has been consumed by technology. 
The main external conflict follows Freder Fredersen, a young man who leads a privileged life in the dazzling city above ground, after he falls in love with a woman, Maria, from the dismal worker city below. When he follows Maria underground, Freder becomes disillusioned with the city above, seeing how it is powered by people in the depths who essentially sacrifice themselves to maintain it. In order to better understand the workers, Freder switches places with a man for a shift, after which he attends one of the secret meetings held by Maria. At these meetings, Maria shares a prophecy of a man who will be the mediator between those the overseers of the city and the workers; Freder then decides that he is the mediator the workers have been waiting for. During this, unbeknownst to those at the meeting, Joh Fredersen, the main overseer of the city and Freder's father, was secretly listening in and plans to ensure that the workers will not revolt. 
In addition to this, Lang includes many other external conflicts to keep the audience entertained. For example, there are the workers who struggle against their oppressive conditions, Joh who struggles to contain the workers, Rotwang, an evil scientist who resents Joh after the death of Freder's mother during childbirth, Freder against the Thin Man who is tracking him, and Freder against the chaos that the robotic Maria facilitated. The almost constant addition of conflict adds to the dramatic tension present during the film. As a result, this tension keeps viewers invested in the plot since they crave resolution. The numerous conflicts also add many opportunities for physical activity as the different parties collide. This action also helps to keep the audience engaged throughout the film. With the constant struggle and chaos, Lang also highlights the negatives effects that technology has on a society that becomes obsessed with it.
From the representation of the workers to the robotic Maria, Lang provides different perspectives of the powerful grip that technology has on people. This negative effect is prominent when considering the workers. When they are shown, the tone becomes very dreary and mechanical, especially when the groups of workers are seen walking about. Lang portrays them in large, seemingly uniform groups that shuffle through the city in an orderly manner, emphasizing how dehumanizing the upkeep of the city is. In the factories, they can be seen working to the point of utter exhaustion, merely being replaced if they fail to complete their job. The workers represent the overwhelming oppression technology can bring for the sake of maintaining a certain standard. This intrinsic metaphor is executed effectively through the use of the repeated action of walking in uniform groups and dismal tone. Contributing to the oppression is Joh, who is obsessed with keeping the ideal city as it is, even if it means disregarding the lives of the workers. He, along with the other inhabitants of the above ground city, turn a blind eye to the clear injustice faced by the workers in order to maintain the advanced life they live. Rotwang's creation of the robotic Maria also brings up an interesting dilemma about the extent to which technology could advance and whether or not it will be used for good. The chaotic, lewd, robotic Maria is a direct foil to the actual Maria, who appears kind, wise, and pious. This contrast between the seemingly righteous human woman and the sinful machine woman continue to cast a negative light on technology. Also, when following the robotic Maria, both the aristocrats from above and the workers from below were thrown into discord. The aristocrats where literally starting to kill each other over the robot's affection and the workers destroyed their own city despite the fact that they were risking their own livelihoods' and the lives of their children. These nonsensical reactions ended with the robot being blamed and burned. To conclude, the negative aspects of overbearing technology are definitely expressed by Lang throughout the film, as seen by the different methods he employs. 
In the end, Lang shows a solid application of impactful expressionist ideas through Metropolis, especially considering the amount of external conflict and themes reflecting the devastating effects of technology. He utilizes action, symbolism, and characterization to capture his audience and give his work noticeable depth. The ideas expressed by Lang are also still relevant today, seeing how certain parallels can be made to industries that dominate the present. Clearly, his effort does not go unnoticed since the film has withstood the test of time to become an influential classic.",Metropolis
431,logansingercrawr,7/10. Decent but dragging,7,27 September 2018,"Metropolis (1927) is a silent film about a young man named Freder who seeks to unite the underground society of workers who keep the utopian city of Metropolis running, with the wealthy elite that control it. A woman named Maria is seen as a leader of the workers underground and is portrayed as an angel. Freder follows her and is appalled by the worker's situation. Freder's father is essentially the mayor of Metropolis and wants to keep the working class a secret. He tasks a wild inventor named Rotwang with giving a mechanical human the appearance of Maria. From there, the film picks up quite a bit and conflict starts brewing. This is one area that the film does very well. It is plain for the audience to see which Maria is the real one and which one is the automaton, but the workers cannot tell a difference. The city begins to collapse due to the influence of the robot, and Maria is stuck trying to save the worker's children who are effected. Throughout this whole sequence we lament the fact that the workers cannot tell that this is clearly not the way Maria would behave but it is understandable as the workers are fired up and ready to revolt.  It is easy to see the influence of Metropolis on other films. The Matrix for example also depicts a sort of utopian society kept alive by the masses. In both films the hero falls into his role by mistake. Metropolis also featured special effects that were ahead of its time. I would not have expected a film from 1927 to have the same fidelity and special effects work that Metropolis flaunts. All of this however comes with a caveat. I believe that the movie could have had about half of its runtime and still told the story effectively. For modern audiences a two and a half hour silent film is daunting and as a whole Metropolis is pretty slow. It is without a doubt one of the best films of its time in terms of production quality and writing, but the pacing really leaves a bit to be desired. I believe this film is best experienced in hindsight. The premise is cool, the setting is very cool, and the characters are done reasonably well, but sitting down and watching the film is actually kind of boring. If I could give the film two ratings I would say that the beginning is a five and the ending is a nine. In the beginning it drags its feet quite a bit and is not super engaging. By now we all have seen plenty of utopias with a dark secret and this one feels like just another one. The second half of the film however takes a much different approach and has all of the action unfold quite rapidly. The main antagonistic force towards the end is the mass of workers that are capable of destroying everything in their path. The workers are not inherently evil but are being manipulated by the false Maria to cause havoc and terror. The frustration felt by the viewer works perfectly to create an atmosphere of desperation. Despite not being exciting enough for modern general audiences, I do think that this film is very well suited to science fiction and movie enthusiasts. If you are someone who is looking for a meaningful and impactful film and not just a fun flick this movie will satisfy you.",Metropolis

I felt it was cheesy at first, that it lacked human connection and was just overall pretty boring. But it was not until I actually spent some serious time thinking about the film that I realized I was entirely wrong. One of my favorite movies of all time is The Matrix. I have watched that movie close to 200 times, and I can recite each line by heart and reenact any of the scenes. I find that movie to be absolutely brilliant in every single way, and I never believed any film could come even close to the throne that The Matrix held. After these past few weeks, I think Metropolis may sit in a close second to my favorite movie of all time. Not only was Metropolis the beginning to a new era of films, but it was the forefather of The Matrix, and the comparisons are uncanny. The dystopian society, the reigning of machines over humans, the idea of an underground society, Metropolis has it all. Metropolis is, at almost every point, a masterclass in set design, sound design and story design. The music is flawless, and conveys exactly what is going on in the scene at that given moment. Due to the fact that this is a silent film, the music is arguably one of the most important parts, and it ties everything together in an almost magical way. The sets feel and look real (well, as real as they could be in 1927), and they provide the viewer with an understanding of the cities social classes and wealth without ever literally describing them. But the most incredible part of this film, in my opinion, is the story. It is filled with intense moments, passionate moments, frightening moments and overall a hefty amount of scenes that I felt so enveloped in the story I almost forgot I was in class while watching them. I never thought I could truly enjoy a silent movie as much as I did, but in a way, it didn't even feel ""Silent"". Of course there are no lines of dialogue that are spoken, and to be honest, I didn't even see the need for the words on screen. I felt as though the film was written so well in terms of the actor's actions and expressions that every scene could be understood without ever speaking. One of the more staggering things about this film was it's ability to predict the future, or at least shape it. Being the first well-known sci-fi film, Metropolis clearly sets a path for sci-fi movies to follow in the future. It lays out the idea of a dystopian society in which the wage gap and personal wealth determine how your life is spent, with the rich often seen as being above everyone else, quite literally, in their flying cars and high rise buildings far above the workers in the machine below ground. The film presents the idea of machine dominance, showing that a robot could one day be smart enough to start a rebellion and an uprising. Almost 100 years later, in 2018, this theme is still seen, with the latest advances in Artificial Intelligence and robots with machine learning. A.I. such as Siri or Cortana can now learn their user's speech patterns, make decisions for their user's and almost scarily ""speak"" to users with a distinctly ""human"" voice. In my opinion, Fritz Lang is one of the most influential and brilliant filmmakers to ever live, and I am tremendously thankful that my professor had our class watch the movie that has earned it's spot as one of my favorite movies of all time.",Metropolis

Soundtrack was one of my main points of frustration for me. It is too ""metallic"" (which was the point) and agressive and added very little to story. I enjoyed the unique story though as well as some amazing acting! I give it a 7 purely because of the film's soundtrack.",Metropolis
