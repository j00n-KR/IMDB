0,Leofwine_draca,Ill-conceived prequel,4,19 June 2018,"LEATHERFACE is an ill-conceived prequel to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise, supposedly telling of Leatherface's back story and the events that made him a killer. Not that it does. Instead this plays out as a cheesy murder mystery for the most part, with lots of cheesy and over the top gruesome death sequences. The original Tobe Hooper classic was all about what you didn't see, whereas this is a film that delights in showing bodily dismemberment and chainsaws penetrating chest cavities and lopping off limbs. The asylum setting is an unusual one that doesn't really fit, while the subsequent road movie action feels like it belongs in another movie. Of the cast, only the old timers (Stephen Dorff, Lili Taylor, Christopher Adamson) impress, while the rest are bogged down by the sheer numb-headed predictability of it all.",Leatherface
1,SnoopyStyle,lost me in the first five minutes,3,21 January 2018,"It's 1955 rural Texas. Matriarch Verna Sawyer (Lili Taylor) rules over her brutal pig-farming family. Her youngest son Jed is reluctant. They lure young Betty to her death. Her father Sheriff Hartman (Stephen Dorff) sends the Sawyer kids to mental hospital, Gorman House. Ten years later, nurse Lizzy befriends good-natured Jackson and Bud. Verna comes to visit and a riot breaks out. Crazed couple Ike and Clarice take the group on the run.The moment that Betty starts chasing an unknown little boy to an unknown place is the moment the movie lost me. I'm willing to give this movie every chance. I'm willing to forget any connections to the franchise. I'm willing to ignore any inconsistency. I can't take ridiculous stupidity. Why would she run after him? What's the thought process? I stop caring about the characters. The name change is unnecessary. Keeping him Jed would be more compelling. It's an unnecessary misdirection which doesn't pay off. I do like the misdirection at the end with Bud but it's too little too late.",Leatherface
2,claudio_carvalho,The Origin of Leatherface,7,22 October 2017,"In 1955, in Texas, the teenage daughter of Sheriff Hartman (Stephen Dorf), Betty (Lorina Kamburova) and her boyfriend Ted (Julian Kostov) are driving along a lonely road kissing each other when Ted almost hit something on the road. He stops his truck and Betty realizes that is a child is asking for help. She follows him and is trapped in a derelict barn and killed by the dysfunctional Sawyer family under the command of the matriarch Verna (Lili Taylor). When Sheriff Hartman learns that he beloved daughter was killed, he sends the boy Jed Sawyer to a mental institution called the Gorman House Youth Reformatory as avenge. Ten years later, the idealistic nurse Elizabeth ""Lizzie"" White (Vanessa Grasse) is hired by the Gorman House and soon she befriends the teenagers Bud (Sam Coleman) and Jackson (Sam Strike). But Verna comes to the institution with a lawyer bringing an injunction expecting to see her son Jed that had his name changed. However the director Doctor Lang (Christopher Adamson) rejects the document and Verna leaves the security doors open to let the patients to escape. There is a havoc in the mental institution and the violent Ike (James Bloor) and his girlfriend Clarice (Jessica Madsen) steal a car and bring Bud and Jackson and decide to abduct Lizzie as hostage. Hartman learns what happened in the Gorman House and hunts the escapees down with his men, following the crime spree left by Ile and Clarice.""Leatherface"" is a horror film that explains the origin of Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise. The film is underrated maybe because its release timing more than forty years after the release of the original ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974). But the storyline, screenplay, direction, performances and makeup are remarkable. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Availale",Leatherface
3,nogodnomasters,Needs puttin' down,5,2 October 2017,"This is the second prequel to the series and one that grossly conflicts with the superior Jordana Brewster film. We see the Sawyer family lose their children to the state and they become institutionalized with different names. They managed to escape, go on a Rob Zombie style killing spree and we have to guess who is Leatherface. Bud (Sam Coleman) is the only guy big enough and he is socially inept too. But excuse me for the plot spoiler that they opt for the puny guy to wield a chainsaw as if it was a plastic prop.As a straight out slasher style film, it passes. As a prequel to a classic, it doesn't make it. Nothing like Texas justice. They did get grandpa right.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Nicole Andrews).",Leatherface
4,kosmasp,Before the Origins,7,18 October 2017,"So the duo of French directors (responsible for ""Inside"") are on this. In the same year a US-Remake of their most famous (and over the top) movie is being released. I haven't seen the Remake, though the directors don't seem to mind or think ill of it. But back to this, a movie that is more than decent. It is dark and gritty and it has the horror one should and would expect of it.There's also a bit of a guessing game, of who is who, since we get a couple of teenagers in this. Good acting overall but I'm not sure this will be for everyone, as the rating also is showing. While respectful to the legacy, it's still building something of its own. The have been worse TCM movies, but as we can clearly see, the Texas Chainsaw never rests ...",Leatherface
5,BA_Harrison,Another disappointing horror origin movie.,4,1 October 2017,"As a child, Jed Sawyer is taken from his murderous hillbilly family and put in the Gorman House Youth Reformatory, where he spends the next ten years with a new identity. When the prisoners revolt, a small group make a bid for freedom with pretty nurse Lizzy (Vanessa Grasse) and fellow inmate Jackson as their hostages.Tobe Hooper's original The Texas Chain Saw Massacre ranks as one of the scariest films ever made, its iconic killer Leatherface its most frightening creation. With this latest film in the series, they've gone and done what Rob Zombie did with his godawful Halloween remake: give the killer a back story. In humanising the character, they have lessened his effectiveness as an object of fear. Once an emotionless, uncontrollable monster, impossible to reason with, he is now someone we can identify with and feel a level of pity for. It didn't work for Michael Myers and it doesn't work here.The origins story-line also makes much of the film seem frustratingly unlike a Texas Chainsaw movie, at times even reminding me of a Tarantino flick (the escape from Gorman House made me think of Natural Born Killers while the BBQ stop massacre was redolent of both NBK and Pulp Fiction). Only in the film's closing moments do things actually feel like they belong to the franchise, with Lizzy trying to escape the Sawyer's charnel house, a chainsaw wielding Jed (soon to become Leatherface) hot on her heels. Directors Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury don't hold back on the brutality and blood, but even so, I can imagine many fans of the series being disappointed with the level of splatter (too much for some, not enough for others).5.5 out of 10, rounded down to 5 for that really dumb scene in which three people (including one really fat guy) hide from the law by climbing inside the festering carcass of a steer. A really big steer. Also, minus half a point for the unbelievable necro sex scene. And another half point subtracted for Jed's sudden (and also completely unbelievable) transformation from rational human being to hulking homicidal maniac.",Leatherface
6,paul_haakonsen,Talk about a pointless prequel...,4,9 June 2018,"I didn't even know that they made this movie and happened to come across it by sheer luck. And being a huge horror fan, I did of course grab it immediately, because ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is indeed a mastodon in the horror genre.But wow! This movie disappointed tremendously, as it had a very pointless storyline, which offered nothing much to the franchise. And it was a very anti-climatic and disappointing backstory to an otherwise iconic horror character.I will say that the acting in the movie was adequate, and that was actually one of the brighter sides to this otherwise abysmal prequel.There were a few good kills in the movie, but hardly enough to make up for all of the other shortcomings that made up the ""Leatherface"" movie.""Leatherface"" is not a movie that you should run out to invest in right away, unless you find it a super bargain discount bin and if you are an overly huge fan of the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" franchise.",Leatherface
7,Coventry,French master-gore in Texas,6,19 March 2018,"I had good faith and strong confidence that this horror sequel (or prequel, whatever) would be worth checking out. Not so much because I swear by the genius of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" franchise, but mainly because I'm a huge admirer of the French writers/directors' duo Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury. I've been following these two ever since their shockingly brilliant 2007 debut ""Inside"", and if there's one thing I can guarantee, it's this: Bustillo and Maury know how to make audiences cringe with fear and disgust. Their previous French films, ""Inside"" and the extremely underrated ""Among the Living"", are masterpieces of raw, uncompromising and sadist horror; - thus making them the ideal candidates for the next installment in one of the most notoriously sick & twisted horror franchises of all times. If anything, ""Leatherface"" truly is a nasty slasher with a tremendous body count, shockingly gross slaughtering and a variety of other (and totally random) raunchy stuff. Unfortunately, that's where the positivity ends, since the story is quite poor and derivative of numerous other movies (horror as well as non-horror). In their everlasting quest for financial benefit and exploiting success formulas, Hollywood clearly still hasn't learned that providing monster icons with a humane background actually weakens their frightful image. It happened to Michael Myers and now it's Leatherface's turn. 10-year-old Jed is taken away from his deranged Sawyer family and placed into an institute where the guards and head doctor aren't exactly role models, neither. When his crazed mother Verna comes to run amok, Jed escapes with three other juvenile delinquents - far more lunatic than he - and they take a cute young nurse hostage. They're heading for Mexico, with the obsessive and vengeful Sheriff Hartman on their tail, but it's Jed inescapable fate that he'll end up back at the Texas family farm. I'm not entirely sure if we were meant to know who of the three troubled adolescents was Jed/Leatherface, but it was pretty obvious. Their violent road trip is a series of unoriginal events, but entertaining to watch for the sick puppies among us. Gratuitous necrophilia, for example, has never contributed to the essence of a plot, but it sure helps to get your horror movie noticed! I will remain a big fan of Bustillo and Maury, but I hope they'll be working from their own screenplays in the future.",Leatherface
8,michaelRokeefe,From less than admirable beginnings,5,11 December 2018,"Recounted in this prequel is the formative years of the killer to be known as Leatherface. As a teenager, the psycho, escapes from ten years locked up in a reform institute for problem youth with a couple more ""white trash"" heathens with an abducted nurse in tow. It is time now for full tilt mayhem with grisly murder the main line of order. This film does sustain a sheer sense of horror, but falls a ton of bloody guts short of showing how Leatherface came to be. Not as scary as it is expected to be.",Leatherface
9,AlsExGal,Yet another prequel to the 40+ year old horror franchise,4,3 July 2021,"Starting out in 1954, the story follows the Sawyer family, a rural Texas band of miscreants and murderers. When a cop's daughter is killed by one of the family, the child culprit is taken away and put into a home for disturbed youth. Cut to ten years later, and new nurse Lizzy (Vanessa Grasse) is assigned to the disturbed teens ward. When the Sawyer family matriarch Verna (Lili Taylor) causes a riot during a visit, several of the inmates escape, taking Lizzy with them as a hostage. One of the escaped mental patients will grow up to become Leatherface, the mask-wearing, chainsaw-wielding terror of the earlier films, but which one will it be: volatile Ike (James Bloor), hulking idiot Bud (Sam Coleman), or troubled nice guy Jackson (Sam Strike)? Also starring Stephen Dorff as a violent cop, and Jessica Marsden as another homicidal escaped inmate.There's a lot wrong here, from the easy-to-guess ""mystery"" of who will become Leatherface (a transformation that doesn't take place until the movie's final 10 minutes, so be forewarned), to the many anachronisms for a story supposedly taking place in 1964. The production values are low, and you don't have to look at the minor cast credits or crew listings to guess that this was made on the cheap in Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, to be specific). There's some bloody gore, but not presented in any original or at least humorous way. The acting is all barely serviceable, with Dorff turning in another loathsome jerk role, and Taylor seriously slumming as the killer family boss. This is the eighth movie in the series, although most of them are unrelated, with perpetual reboots, prequels or just dismissal of previous films the norm.",Leatherface
10,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Decent enough when it counts,5,25 November 2017,"Years after being incarcerated, a group of friends spring a deranged teen and his brother from a sanitarium and take a nurse hostage as they attempt to head out into the wilderness trying to head home and stay away from the sheriff trailing them as he turns into a fearsome killer.This here wasn't all that bad of an effort. One of the finer points of this one is the fact that this one manages to tell the origin story of the family in somewhat coherent fashion. By managing to tie the youth's adventures with his family that gives full on advantage of the dynamic that's been known from the beginning, this one sets up the initial turn of the killer in fine league with the established credentials in the series. As the events that occur here start to approach a much more psychologically challenging ordeal as they get hunted and chased down, it becomes all the more logical how the change occurs and it fits in together as to how everything gets tied up. As well, this one manages to get some fun action scenes involved here, which is the rather strong escape sequence from the sanitarium that has plenty to like about it from the inmates running wild overpowering the guards, attacking the other inmates or the rather chilling abduction that sets this one in motion as the film goes along the idea of the group going through the wilderness together in a hostage format for the majority of the movie. This isn't too terrible with the scenes of them brutalizing her and their treatment of each other as they try to escape the cops on their trail from the break-out of the sanitarium that really drives this one as this one lets it loose rather nicely. Alongside the fine gore here, that's all that really works here as the film isn't that great. The biggest issue is the fact that there's just not a whole lot of rather interesting action going on for the most part here. The film decides that telling this story at this point in the characters' history is enjoyable when it's quite hard to believe that such a long time elapsed in the time that occurs here, and that really makes this one rather hard to believe. Not to mention, the film's reliance on having her be held hostage for the majority of the film means that the film puts her in rather lame circumstances simply to keep it going, as there's little reason why they keep her around after every escape attempt. Most would've tried another hostage but to keep this one going it requires they stay together so it's quite often that they have to corral her back into the fold and it just gets tiring seeing all this which holds it back. The other problem is the finale which feels like such a rip of the others that it doesn't feel all that impactful at all since it needs to tie into all the other story lines present in the series. These here really hold this one down.Rated Unrated/R: Extreme Graphic Language, Extreme Graphic Violence, Full Nudity and a strong sex scene.",Leatherface
11,Sylviastel,I found the mother to be interesting,5,19 March 2021,How did the sawyer family become heartless killers and get away with it for so long? How come the sheriff didn't arrest the whole family? The killing and violence is unnecessary really. The family matriarch is the one I want to know more about. How did this family evolve? Lili Taylor is superb as the mother. We all know leatherface and his family were disturbed but it is how and why they became monsters. How come nobody looks for the victims? It's like free and legal to kill in sawyer country. The sheriff must have a gun. They could take the family down or into custody.,Leatherface
12,trashgang,the magic is gone but worth seeing,7,2 October 2017,"And the mystery is gone. If you are going to make a prequel and do explain how Leatherface became the villain then you really have to make a good flick. Some parts are okay for horror flicks made nowadays others are a bit frustrating.What they tried to do is to make a gory flick that refers to the beginning of the original Texas Chainsaw Massactre (1974). So off we go to the fifties were we do meet the family already bringing in the chainsaw. But things go wrong and the kids are taken to a mental hospital. That part is a bit boring and it takes a while before they brake out. Once that happens Leatherface is born. The only problem I had was that they tried a bit too hard to make a story about the family. And by doing so the story itself isn't that strong. Once grown up the chainsaw did come into the hands again of Ted. And the massacre is born. On part of the effects it's all okay and the gore is there but as said, the script. Doing a robbery in Natural Born Killer style, having sex with a death body, Nekromantik style. 3 persons hiding into a cadaver (how do you do that?). Yes, all the best of the classics are used.Is it all that bad, no not at all, it delivers on gore and a bit of nudity and for the geeks it will work out fine but the magic about who leatherface is is gone, If you can stand throughout the hospital scene's then it's worth picking up.Gore 2/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",Leatherface
13,Hellmant,"Would have been better, in my opinion, if it wasn't a prequel to the TCM franchise.",7,4 January 2018,"'LEATHERFACE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The eighth installment in the long running slasher flick franchise, which serves as a prequel to the original 1974 film 'THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE', and is an origin story to the classic movie monster/deranged serial killer Leatherface. The film was directed by Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo (the duo also wrote and directed a segment of the 2014 horror anthology sequel 'ABCS OF DEATH 2', titled 'X IS FOR XYLOPHONE'), and it was scripted by Seth M. Sherwood. The movie stars Stephen Dorff, Lili Taylor, Vanessa Grasse, Sam Strike, Jessica Madsen, James Bloor, Sam Coleman, Chris Adamson and Finn Jones. It's received mixed to negative reviews from critics, and it also only got a delayed VOD and limited theatrical release at the Box Office. I have very mixed feelings about the flick, but I think it's mostly well made and entertaining though. The story follows the origins of Leatherface, as a young man named Jedidiah Sawyer (Strike), who grew up in a mental institution going by the name Jackson. When his mother, Verna (Taylor), causes a riot there, while trying to visit him, he escapes with other inmates, and a nurse named Lizzy (Grasse). The local sheriff, Sheriff Hartman (Dorff), begins hunting them down. Hartman originally took Jedidiah from his mother, as revenge for the murder of his daughter, and he'll stop at nothing to stop the murderous criminals. Jedidiah attempts to flee and pursue a normal life, and a relationship with Lizzy, but the crazy circumstances he's in begin to drive him mad.The movie would have been better, in my opinion, if it wasn't a prequel to the TCM franchise. It's a decently made (and well acted) horror flick, with a lot of strong character development. I just don't see the central character (that they develop here) turning into the classic slasher villain icon Leatherface though. The ending, where he starts to become the serial killer, feels like it's the ending to a different movie (in my opinion). Everything that precedes the climax is well done though, and it could have been it's own separate horror flick. I would have respected it more that way.",Leatherface
14,thesar-2,The Beginning Part Deux,8,29 October 2017,"Found another Mother's Day movie to watch!What a coincidence. In a period of about 24 hours, I watched two horror movie Part 8's that happened to shorten their franchise's titles down to just the main villain's name (Jigsaw and Leatherface.) I wonder if the long awaited next chapters of Friday the 13th and Halloween will be rebranded as just ""Jason"" and ""Michael,"" respectivelyI tease, but I really enjoyed this second prequel in the series. I would say no more or less than Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning for they are two completely different films. That one, the prequel to the rebooted The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in 2003, pretty much just rehashed all the others with the exception of the opening origin story of found- baby Leatherface. And I didn't have a problem with that. I like seeing these movies for just another telling of the original 1974 classicas long as it's well acted, written and gory as all hell and ""The Beginning"" was.This one, simply named ""Leatherface,"" not to be confused with the other Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, is actually pretty well shot, acted, suspenseful, interesting, gory and brutal at times and the first mystery of the series. Not to mention, it DOES fit in nicely with the 1974 film which its predecessor Texas Chainsaw 3D in 2013 did abysmally. Leatherface starts off with a bang (buzz?) at the creepiest birthday party for the young, future chainsaw-wielding momma's boy, but soon after, the police (pre-CPS) remove the child in order to place him in an American Horror Story'esque mental hospital. Not long after that, he escapes with several others and the race is on remain free and let us discover which will become the real Leatherface.Oh, and boy, did I leave out: some of these kids are freaking ruthless. Expect no mercy, plenty of surprises and a Pulp Fiction reference long before Quentin was even conceived. Despite the series it's attached to, it didn't originally have the feel of a gory film in lieu of a, well, coming-of-age fable for the brute, mute man we met 43 years ago. Not true. It's definitely both.The nice thing is, not only is this definitely for TCM fans, but newcomers should find themselves fascinated and engaged as well. In fact, it wouldn't hurt to begin here, then watch Parts 1, 2, 3, 2003's reboot and ""The Beginning."" (Everyone should skip #4 and 3D like the plague.) Highly recommended. See it!***Final thoughts: I listen to a horror movie podcast, Shockwaves, and boy did they ruin a lot of this movie for me. Well, or so I thought. One host got a lot wrong (as in facts of what actually happened in the movie) and though he has a right to his opinion, which obviously differs from mine, I think he missed the whole point of the film and should rewatch it. Despite that, he needs to check his facts before discouraging others from seeing a movie based on lies.",Leatherface
15,bowmanblue,Unnecessary remake #608,4,5 July 2018,"Many of us horror-lovers took a sick enjoyment out of the homicidal antics of a certain faceless, chainsaw-wielding Redneck serial killer from 'middle America' back in the seventies when we first met him in 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.' Naturally, our - the public's - weird fascination with him meant that he was featured prominently in one sub-standard sequel after the next. Despite the character still 'selling' the franchise, less and less people got excited by what followed the original 'shocker/slasher.' The 2003 Michael Bay remake wasn't bad, but divided long-term fans. However, no matter how much people enjoy seeing 'Leatherface' slice and dice his way through hordes of screaming teens, I never actually heard anyone asking the question: 'What was he like as a child?' (think about what the public reaction was to the 'Halloween' remake which delved into Michael Myers' adolescent backstory!).Here, surprise surprise, we meet our future nut-job as a wee young child and get a brief inclination of how, growing up in a family who eat people and actively promote cutting up dinner guests with a chainsaw, may end up damaging young minds. The film is effectively a whistle-stop tour of the boy's life, from how he gets taken away from his family to a - supposedly - 'safer' establishment, only for it to yet warp his mind further.Yes, this story is not only not what anyone was asking for and merely - yet another - cheap cash-in on an established brand, but it's also pretty dull. There's little you need to know or see here if you're a fan of the franchise and, if you're looking for gore, scares and/or creative death scenes - then you won't find any of that here. Instead you simply get 'horror 101' displaying every tried and tested technique to get even a slight scare out of its audience.I didn't enjoy it. And I know it may sound like a stupid thing to say, based on the fact that the film is named after one of the most evil and therefore unlikable characters in screen history, but there is a total lack of sympathetic characters to root for. I know there are a couple of 'heroes' who we're supposed to feel for their plight, but they're just too damn generic and uninteresting to care for.If you're a fan of the 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' then just watch that. If you think it looks a little old and outdated then watch the 2003 remake (it's actually not as bad as some people made out!). This is simply a horror film that doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as a film which - kind of - started the 'slasher' genre which still goes strong today.",Leatherface
16,Platypuschow,Leatherface: This franchise needs time off,4,14 November 2017,"I've not been a fan of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise, they've had their moments but have never impressed me. This latest outing is no exception and I feel the whole thing needs to be put on the shelf for a while.With a couple of familiar faces in Stephen Dorff & Lili Taylor we see an alternative origin story for our antagonist as it tells the story of young Mr Sawyer and his early run ins with the law.It starts strong enough and exceeded my expectations (Which were low going in) but it quickly spirals into mediocrity and covers the content we've seen already for the past 40yrs! It's time for Leatherface to hang up his chainsaw and go on an extended vacation. Somewhere nice, to recuperate and come back reinvigorated in a decade or two.The Good: Starts strong The Bad: Predictable twist Falls apart a tad near the end Things I Learnt From This Movie: It takes approximately 1 minute 20 seconds to get over a murdered child The franchise is badly burnt out Leatherface should have kept the cow mask!",Leatherface
17,jacobjohntaylor1,I did not except mush.,5,20 September 2018,I do not except mush from a horror movie prequel. It was kind of scary. It is not has good has Texas chainsaw massacre the next generation. But still is did have good acting. And it and a story line that was well okay.,Leatherface
18,Fella_shibby,"An elucidation of how a young boy descended into madness n became a deranged killer aka Leatherface. Much better than the remake, its prequel n shady sequels of the original.",8,6 November 2017,"Having enjoyed Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo's previous works (Inside, Livid n Among the Living) n having seen all the seven parts of TCM, i was looking forward to this.Well, i wasn't disappointed.Surprisingly i got more than i bargained for.The direction, cinematography n acting is very good.I liked the sun soaked settings n the road movie style.The film is suspenseful, tensed n at times brutal, the film will keep u guessing who's Leatherface, which is something very very new.The movie succeeded in paying homage to:
1)There is a psychotic couple on the run who kills people mercilessly a la Natural Born Killers.2)There is a bonding between two boys in which one fella takes care of the other deranged fella a la Of Mice and Men.3)There is a cop who is hell bent on revenge from a deranged family a la Devil's Rejects.4)This is indeed a befitting prequel a la Hannibal Rising, explaining the story how a young boy descended into madness n became Leatherface.5)It does have shades of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.6)There is a scene which is similar from the Revenant n another brutal scene from another film.... wont say the name or it will spoil the movie a bit.The previous prequel showed him as a mentally n deformed face fellow who just kills but this prequel showed a proper descent into madness n the trauma at a young age which does make for a proper elucidation about the origin.While the 1974 original will forever be a classic without showing on screen violence, this film does have some very brutal violence but not the kind of gore which is there in the remake n its prequel.Surprisingly good star cast n solid acting by Dorff n Taylor.",Leatherface
19,jtindahouse,There is hope for the horror genre yet,8,24 September 2017,"I have been quite excited for 'Leatherface' for a while now. I'm a big fan of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' series. Each film is impactful and entertaining in its own way, be it the light-hearted editions or the deadly serious ones. A prequel has already been done in the series, but nothing going back far enough to explore the origins of 'Leatherface'. Finally we have that story though and I can confirm is very well done. It far exceeded my expectations which were already admittedly high.What I love about these movies is that they don't need jump-scares, because the concept itself is terrifying enough. That's not to say that there aren't jump-scares (there are but they're few and far between, and even then they're kind of half-hearted because they're unnecessary) but for the most part the horror comes from visuals and just the pure thought of what is actually happening.Also the characters for a horror movie are exceptionally strong. I really cared about the fate of the good characters and the bad characters were both memorable and genuinely disturbing. This is a very well put together script. It shows patience, and at the same time the pacing feels exceptionally fast. It's in no race to tell its story, and in modern horror that is a rare thing.I was thoroughly impressed by 'Leatherface'. It's a hard film to find flaws in. Every aspect is done to a very high standard. To say that about a horror movie is incredibly rare, but it's also incredibly pleasing to do so. More like this please Hollywood.",Leatherface
20,jadavix,Confusing mess,4,6 February 2018,"""Leatherface"" and ""The Belko Experiment"" are two recent horror flicks I've seen that have made me wonder if horror movies have run out of ideas in regard to the creative depiction of violence. Perhaps the torture porn trend (which seems to be over?) just exhausted every possible thing that knives, shards of glass, bullets, chainsaws, needles, axes and blunt instruments can do to the human body. Sure, these movies are still violent, but there's nothing in them you haven't seen before, and nothing to make you cringe.The plot of this one is quite confusingly told. It's a mess. The focal point keeps changing. The movie features a huge boy with long hair in ringlets who could indeed pass for a young Gunnar Hansen - and yet this is not the eponymous Leatherface? The one who ends up wielding the chainsaw is some other guy who is nothing like Hansen, and nor does he have an intimidating, or even interesting, presence. Did they throw the big guy in to confuse us? Why? What does that add to the experience?The plot is your typical ""innocent kidnapped by psychos on the run"" tale. The only difference is that this one isn't even good enough to make clear who the psychos are, and thus it has absolutely no suspense. Stephen Dorff is adequate as a sadistic sheriff - but then he becomes a good guy, and the movie cuts back to other, lesser bad guys you can't take seriously. Lili Taylor is a great actress who could have been evil incarnate as the matriarch of the evil Sawyer clan, but she doesn't get enough screen time, or do enough when she is on screen to justify her presence in this schlock.The more I think about it, the more I realise that that's the problem with ""Leatherface"": at least three actors who had it in them to play evil on the big screen (Dorff, Taylor, and the big boy) - and yet the movie keeps pulling the rug out from under them and giving the best roles and lines to lesser actors who can't handle it anywhere near as well. The guys who made this don't have a clue.",Leatherface
21,Stevieboy666,Mixed feelings,6,8 April 2018,"Prequel to the legendary Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this is as much a violent road movie as it is a horror. I heard many negative things about the film beforehand but as always I watched it with an open mind. On the negative side I found this film to be somewhat unconvincing and unnecessary. Obviously it was made to make money but it really does not add anything worthy to the TCM series. On the plus side it was technically pretty good, having seen a few of the director' previous films it lived up to expectations. Acting and pace is good plus there is a lot of blood & violence to satisfy most gorehounds. I would certainly watch it again.",Leatherface
22,parry_na,Very good.,9,1 March 2018,"Pretty new nurse Lizzie (Vanessa Grasse) is left to patrol a mental institution for deranged and violent children on her own, with no security to or senior staff to protect her. All on her first day. So being attacked and threatened is something she gets used to rather quickly. Even in 1955, surely this a serious security lapse. Ah well, it allows Lizzie, and us, to get to know patient Jackson (Sam Strike, formerly an actor on UK soap EastEnders). Jackson, a seemingly wholesome young fellow, isn't his real name however - his real name is Jedidiah.A furious Verna Sawyer (Lili Taylor) enters the institution and, on her own, incites a riot. She's come to rescue Jedidiah, her son. Soon, they are both taken hostage by patients Ike (James Bloor), Bud (Sam Coleman) and Clarice (Jessica Madsen), who are escaping. This story follows their murderous rampage and the various events that lead to the birth of the legendary Leatherface.I suppose whether you view this enterprise as a success or not depends on whether you feel Leatherface's early life needs chronicling, if it is necessary (if you forgive the word-play) to put meat on the bones of a mindless, rampaging killer who became a horror icon back in 18974's 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. It's up to the viewer to enjoy, or otherwise, a series of bloody events that carefully put all the pieces into place directly before the original story was told. Is the lead character better as a faceless lunatic killer, or a person with a past and an identity? Again, it's for the individual to decide.This individual had a great time with this. Terrific cast, no bubble-headed girls or vacuous boys. A strong, fast paced story full of eye-watering moments and genuine thrills. A decent budget, strong enough to stage a convincing 1950s setting, but not so generous as to be a slave to CGI that would add an unwanted cartoon element to proceedings. Sense is even made of Leatherface's transvestite tendencies, which met with such disdain in 1994's 'Next Generation' project.",Leatherface

I don't need to know all his backstory, it's way scarier if you don't know it all & just imagine him & his family as evil, inbred,depraved,cannibal serial killers.Another thing that really annoys me is whenever there is going to be Vigilante justice,IT'S stopped like poor evil killer Leatherface can't be hurt too badly or killed,oh no even though he's brutally savaged tons of innocent people & wears their faces!!!Same happened in the equally terrible Texas chainsaw 3D,some sheriff is beating & torturing the evil Leatherface & of course the vigilante is shown as being the violent-savage bad guy? It's ridiculous & the same here with the excellent Stephen Dorff as a tough vigilante texas ranger,his performance is excellent & he's the best part of the movie by far!!!
The film is gritty & brutal but is all pointless really,no need to see the back story or feel sorry for the vile killers!!!
The Texas chainsaw massacre:The Beginning was pointless too & so was Texas chainsaw 3d & this Leatherface all needless films in the pretty terrible, confusing franchise!!!The Texas chainsaw massacre (2003) was absolutely BRILLIANT,that is the masterpiece CLASSIC in my opinion & is a million times better than the original 1974 film!!!

Her father, Hartmann (Stephen Dorff) a State Trooper, arrives enraged and clashes with Jed's mother Verna (Lillie Taylor). Jed's brother goes to the gas chamber but Jed is given a new identity and sent to a psychiatric hospital. Ten years later a new nurse in the hospital, Lizzy (Vanessa Grasse) gets on well with two patients, Bud (Sam Coleman) and Jackson (Sam Strike) but is harassed by the crazed Ike (James Bloor). Verna arrives demanding to see Jed and when she is refused causes mayhem allowing a riot to occur and patients to escape.

But Jed fails the test. That's no to say the thief doesn't meet and unpleasant death. Next, Jed is dressed up in as and in a pig's corpse and lures a teenage girl to a barn where his brothers will kill her gruesomely. But this girl is the daughter of a cop so he takes Jed and has him institutionalized. 10 years later we meet a bunch of kids who at the mental institution as new and lovely nurse Lizzy starts working there. The good old doctor subjects the patients to electroshock therapy. When Verna wants to visit Jed, the doctor refuses, so Verna decides to explore on her own just as all hell breaks loose. Staff are killed and 4 kids escape taking Lizzy hostage. Among them are the crazed Ike and his crazier girlfriend Clarice, the more levelheaded Jackson and the fat kid Bud. It takes a while till we find out which one of them is Jed. Why all of the kids let Ike abuse them is not clear when all he has is a broken bottle. In any case, they make their escape, end up in a diner, shoot up the place and make off with a bunch of guns. Now the cops are on their trail.Eventually the kids will take on Ike, Jed is revealed when he makes it back to his family ranch and the family takes on the cops. We learn also why Jed starts wearing a leatherface.Leatherface is a pretty good horror movie, but it's not that good of an entry into the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series. That said, it's much better than some of the other disasters that have been made. It's somewhere in the middle I would say. Direction is good, acting is strong overall and the movie looks very nice. It's definitely a return to form for Bustillo and Maury who've had a hard time recapturing the spirit of Inside. It could have used more gore and nudity but it's worth a watch.",Leatherface

Firstly I'm a massive fan of the original, so I'm always judging these by those lofty standards. This is the 8th entry into the franchise (i think?) and is way better than the dire 'Texas chainsaw' but way short of the highly inventive 'T.C.M :- The Beginning'. This might just be the goriest of the lot, but lacks a compelling story and the characters are not exactly interesting. It's hard to know where they will turn next with this series, but don't watch this space.",Leatherface
28,arungeorge13,A prequel that doesn't hold much value! [+33%],3,24 September 2017,"When the directors of 2007's gore-spectacle 'Inside' (Alexandre Bustillo & Julien Maury) took over the reins of a supposed prequel to 1974's Tobe Hooper classic 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', expectations had indeed sky-rocketed. But what we get isn't even worthy of being called a tribute to the TCM franchise, let alone be regarded as its worthy canon prequel.The screenplay offers very little in terms of the surprises it throws at the viewers (and TCM fans), thereby ending up strictly ho-hum. We see a bunch of eccentrics creating a riot at a mental health facility and escaping, with tidbits of the Sawyer family thrown in to engage the viewer. In fact, the makers are trying to sell this movie around the mystery of which character amongst the the leads ultimately evolves into 'Leatherface'. Well, much to our dismay, even this stretch appears annoyingly contrived (and to be honest, the poster kinda spoils it already!). What we're subjected to for most part, is literally a lunatic couple shotgun-killing their way to notoriety on their supposed escape (even the big chainsaw-kill comes in too late) with a helpless nurse named Lizzy (Vanessa Grasse) who has unnecessarily been dragged along with them while also being accompanied by a duo of brothers (the somewhat compassionate Jackson and the bulky Bud). Lizzy is the character we're supposed to root for, but sadly this does not work. We know as little about her as we know about the rest of the zany troupe. The directors who're known to stage horrifically-exciting set- pieces, resort to cheap tricks here (like a partial necro scene) in order to augment the shock-value. The shot of a woman's derriere walking into a barn surrounded by badlands (during one of the opening segments, clearly reminding us of previous TCM films including the Michael Bay funded remake) had just about raised my hopes a teeny weeny bit before everything came crashing down. With no real thunderbolts in store for fans or non-fans, this prequel falls head first into a pit of quick-sand, the real difference-maker in the story being the weapons (shotguns, knives) that the characters possess and not their personalities. You're bound to forget this movie as soon as the credits roll.Verdict: Terrible!",Leatherface
29,areatw,"Lots of tense music, but not much tension to go with it",4,1 October 2017,"Despite a plot that had the potential to be high on scares and suspense, 'Leatherface' relies on some cheap gore for all of its horror elements and is about as tame as any horror movie I've seen in the last few years. Unlike the original 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', there's nothing remotely scary about this film, in fact I would go as far as to say its pretty boring.The acting and stylish 1960s theme is about as far as the positives extend. Everything else about the film is severely lacking in both effort and outcome. It's flat for the most part and, despite lots of tense music, the only real tension comes in the final 15 minutes. I only chose to watch 'Leatherface' because I thought it had the potential to bring something different and fresh to the horror genre, instead it just ends up doing what most low-budget, cheap horrors do by relying on generic gore scenes.",Leatherface
30,baumer,A surprisingly solid entry in the TCM universe,8,26 September 2017,"Some of what makes modern reimaginings of classic horror films, not so endearing is that you can't replicate the original's look and feel. 70's horror, especially The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, has that grainy, cheap, almost documentary type feel to it. I thought the Platinum Dunes remake nailed the feel and ambiance of the original. This one comes really close to nailing it as well.Being an origin story, it doesn't start out feeling much like a Texas Chainsaw movie. It opens well enough but then the setting changes to a mental institution and you are introduced to a character that you think and believe is going to grow up to be Leatherface. Here we meet some of the main characters and one of them is Lizzy, played by Vanessa Grasse. I hope to see more of her. Her beauty is what you first notice about her but she plays the character really well. She's strong at first and then completely vulnerable once it gets going. The two most recognizable faces in the film are Lily Taylor, as the Sawyer mom and Stephen Dorff as an obsessed sheriff, wanting to once and for all put an end to the Sawyer clan. Both are very good here as well. Once out of the institution, things get pretty crazy. There's a lot of death, murder, gore and gruesome scenes, most of it taking place in a diner. This is also a bit of a mystery because you think you know where the film is going and then they pull the rug out from under you and make you question who is who and what is what. This is another element I enjoyed about it. When we finally get to the chainsaw massacre part of it, it feels right. This film reminded me of Unforgiven in a way. Through both films, there are hints of what you are hoping to see and there is a lot of character development and then when things finally go down, you are kind of ecstatic. Once the chainsaw makes an appearance and people are sliced and diced, it's a bit shocking. One death in particular took me by complete surprise.I liked this entry and next to the original and the PD remake, this is the best one in my opinion. 8/10",Leatherface
31,IonicBreezeMachine,"Objectively speaking it's better than Texas Chainsaw 3D, but it's also less entertaining and runs into the same problems as most prequels.",5,12 October 2021,"In 1955 Sheriff Hartman (Stephen Dorff) is called to the scene of his daughter, Betty's, death. The Sawyer children are at the crime scene (and not for the first time as they've been present at other deaths) and while he can't charge any of them he gets revenge on the Sawyer matriarch, Verna (Lili Taylor), by taking custody of her son, Jedidiah, away under Child Endangerment. 10 years later Jedidiah has been given a new name and has been integrated into the system at mental hospital Gorman House Youth Reformery. When Verna unsuccessfully tries to contact her son, she instigates a riot by opening several facility doors. A group of four inmates consisting of hulking mute Bud (Sam Coleman), violent psychopath Ike (James Bloor) and his equally violent girlfriend Clarice (Jessica Madsen), and Bud's subdued relatively level headed friend Jackson (Sam Strike) escape with Ike taking nurse Elizabeth White (Vanessa Grasse) hostage. Learning of the escapees and that one of them is Jedidiah Sawyer, Sheriff Hartman pursues the group intent on bringing them down rather than bringing them in.Following the relative success of Texas Chainsaw 3D, Lionsgate and millennium opted to move forward on another installment tentatively titled Texas Chainsaw 4. Following a proposed follow-up to be filmed by Texas Chainsaw 3D director John Luessenhop being scrapped, the producers instead opted for a prequel pitch by Seth M. Sherwood described as a road thriller akin to Terrence Malik's Badlands but with gore. French New Extremity directors Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo who had made a name for themselves with their films such as Inside, Livid, and Among the Living that like other members of the (Alexandre Aja, Xavier Gens, etc.) were noted for their brutal intensity and violence. Leatherface is technically speaking a better film than Texas Chainsaw 3D, and it does well capturing the period with Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo evoking an almost neo-western vibe from the film, but it's also an exercise in redundancy as much like other prequels we know exactly where it's going and the characters and story aren't engaging enough to make us forget that.The movie does have good elements to it. The cinematography is well done and convinces us the Bulgarian filming locations are in fact 1960s East Texas and unlike the Platinum Dunes films I actually felt like Leatherface took place in a different decade. Stephen Dorff is really good as antagonist Sheriff Hartman who plays the hellbent lawman archetype with seething intensity and hatred for the Sawyer family, in many ways it's reminiscent of Dennis Hopper's Lefty from Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 except played straight but still good. I also liked Lili Taylor as Sawyer matriarch Verna Sawyer-Carson who conveys this almost Betty Crockerish image that barely contains the intense violence and hatred beneath the surface.Unfortunately the principal cast whom we spend the most time with are the least interesting. Bud, Ike, Clarice, Jackson, and Elizabeth aren't all that interesting and it feels like we're focusing on the wrong people story wise. Stephen Dorff is arguably the driving force behind the story as he's Hellbent on taking down this group because he knows his daughter is dead because of them, and while his character does engage in shady or brutal acts, he's not more evil than the group we're following who we see kill without hesitation or remorse. The story isn't unworkable and all the pieces are in place, btu the movie wants us to sympathize with the group of escaped psychopaths rather than be scared by them and it just leaves the movie lacking in much of anchor point for investment. This probably explains why certain actions the hostage character Elizabeth does seem so outright perplexing because there are several opportunities where she can make a run for safety from the unstable group but just doesn't and the relationship between her and Jackson isn't strong enough to buy give credibility to her uncertainty as to whether or not she should leave. Eventually the movie leads right back to where we knew it started and because it played with the uncertainty of who is Leatherface the character's descent feels like it's on fast forward when it should've been a slow rot.Leatherface is just kind of ""meh"" it's not unique enough like Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, it's not bad enough to be funny like Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Next Generation or Texas Chainsaw 3D, and instead is content to settle for competent mediocrity. It has some good performances and a nice look, but it's in service of a movie that's just ""there"".",Leatherface

35,Vivekmaru45,I consider this film disgusting in every sense of the word.,3,17 December 2017,"In 1974 Tobe Hooper directed a horror film that cemented his name as a cult status horror director.However my first film was The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 1986, which I consider to be Hooper's masterpiece. Later on I saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation 1994 in which Matthew McConaughey portrayed the sadistic Vilmer Slaughter and also the first time I saw the actress Renée Zellweger. Next on I saw the two remake films The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003 and its prequel The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning 2006. Then I saw Hooper's first and original film. Lastly I saw Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3 1990 directed by notable horror film directed Jeff Burr who has directed many good horror films like Offspring 1987, Puppet Master 4 1993 and Pumpkinhead 2 1994. This is a good guide for watching the Texas Chainsaw movies.You should know that Texas Chainsaw Massacre is based on the true story Edward Theodore Gein, also known as The Butcher of Plainfield, who was an American murderer and body snatcher. Deranged 1974 is loosely based on the life of Ed Gein. Verdict: Leatherface is meant ti be a prequel to 1974's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, explaining the origin of the series' lead character. There is graphic gore and violence in the film as well as nudity and sex, so I would not recommend this film to anyone under the age of 18. Lili Anne Taylor and Stephen Dorff Jr. are the only veteran actors in the film. The rest of the supporting cast is mediocre. The special effects are well handled and some are very disturbing. Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo have directed some gory movies in the past as Inside 2007 and Among the Living 2014.I feel this latest addition to the Texas Chainsaw franchise will be ill received mainly due to its perverseness.",Leatherface

A series that has a total gross of $235 million from 8 parts!I say it is about time they give up. If it would have been a stand alone movie, it could have been seen slightly better than the average. You have some gore, blood, nudity and violence. Sadly people nowadays confuse that with horror, and so it is explained the success of so many sequels. Like Wrong Turn ones, Saw, Amityville and so on. Enough is enough. Overall for die hard fans of the series I think it will come as a slap on the face. But fans will be fans, so they'll take it. They get to see yet another film about one of their favorite subject: the Texas chainsaw massacre.Cheers!",Leatherface
37,Darkside-Reviewer,5 Stars for Lili Tayler,5,25 May 2019,The only thing this movie has going for it is Lili Tayler as the mother of Leatherface she gives more emotion to her character with the short screen time she had than the characters on the end of the chainsaw give throughout the movie.The movie is meant to be a backstory for Leatherface but really all it tells us is his family made him the way he is by literally putting the chainsaw in his hands throughout the movie he shows no interest in sawing people in two but by the end is wearing a face as a mask. They tried making the Leatherface character more human but by the end hes just a grunting idiot which makes anything we learn about his past pointless and boring.There's a few good kills in the movie and some disturbing scenes that are just thrown in there for pure shock value the effects are passable for a modern slasher.I'd recommend this to fans of slasher movies just don't expect too much from this movie it's worse than the original reboot and will become just another forgotten entry in the franchise.,Leatherface

When you're making an origin story to such a famous character, you should make sure that the story you make up and make into a movie is really awesome. Unfortunately, it's not. We see Leatherface's family and stuff, and it's just meh. The opening scene is just not very interesting. What follows though, isn't bad. They have some kind of story to tell here, not relying too much on TCM- lore, and I thought it was somewhat entertaining.You wouldn't have to cut a lot here to make this movie totally unrecognizable as a Leaterface origin-story, though. That's a shame. And it's also pretty tame, I'm sorry to say. Actually really tame.

I said what the hell ? how can they kill leatherface in a prequel ?my questions were answered after a few minutes.jed=bud=leatherface was not alive. he was really dead but what happened is.......the nurse with Jackson took the car tried to escape another cop went after them he shot the car.....the car was damaged and Jackson was hurt in the face.then the drama went it's climax.the cop took Jackson prisoner and the nurse in a barn...the sawyers thought he held prisoner jed they went there captured the cop freed Jackson who they thought he was jed and then Jackson acted like he was jed let verna fix his damaged face put a mask took a chainsaw killed brutally the cop and then the nurse who tried to escape when the nurse told him......Jackson u are not like this not like your crazy mom....Jackson killed her like verna was his real mom like he was the real leatherfce when he wasn't.Little bit confusing I know but I tried to explain as much as I could.Anyways.....those were the facts happened in this movie and u have to see it to judge for yourselves if what they done with this twist they destroyed or not the leatherface legacy.will someone give light as to why Jackson acted like jed (leatherface) and how verna did not recognized her own son ?Apart from that.........movie was solid but due to those twist problems I can't give it a straight A.grade // B,Leatherface
44,darkreignn,The outstanding acting elevates this mediocre horror film,8,20 October 2017,"I'll be completely honest: I found this movie to be pretty mediocre when it comes to the story department. I mean, this ""road trip from Hell"" plot is something that we've seen done a thousand times before; it's nothing original. However, the outstanding acting from every single character in this film elevated this movie for me; the acting is truly better than it had any right to be.Sam Strike and Vanessa Grasse gave powerhouse performances. Seriously, they had scenes that were truly Oscar-worthy. Sam has one scene in a car where he loses his god da*n mind and it's riveting and fantastic to witness, and Vanessa builds up such a sympathetic and likable character that you can't help but hope she escapes her tormentors. Also, there's another scene with Sam at a diner where he's sitting with Vanessa, basically explaining to her how much he hates his life; his mannerisms and facial expressions are so subtle, and his words are so powerful, that he is absolutely magnetizing to watch.And also, towards the end of this film there is a surprisingly emotional moment; I'm not ashamed to say that I actually had some tears running down my face. Of course this moment is brought to an end by a moment of cheap gore (like literally cheap, the effect looked like utter sh*t), but I didn't expect to have my mother walk in on me dabbing my eyes with a pillow, ask me, ""what are you watching that's making you cry so much?"" and then threaten to 302 me when I responded, ""Leatherface.""Now, when it comes to cheap gore, this film does have its fair share of bloody violence. This movie is definitely more bloody then it is gory, but it's almost bloody to an absurd degree. The blood is too red and watery, and there's always fountains of it every time someone gets shot or stabbed or hurt in any way. I don't mind blood in movies at all, but I can't help but wish that they would've cooled it a bit. There is just too much blood and it cheapens the scares, cheapens the experience as a whole, and adds a layer of ridiculousness to the entire film. Yes, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"" definitely has tons of blood and gore, and so does ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (2003), but those films showed restraint, sometimes showing the violence, and sometimes leaving it up to the imagination of the viewers, and that made these movies absolutely disturbing and terrifying. Because ""Leatherface"" never misses an opportunity to revel in its bloodlust, the movie becomes less scary and more campy, especially when you see blood squirt 20 feet in the air when someone gets shot in the face with a shotgun. Plus, the blood looks super fake.Like I said, the road trip storyline is nothing we haven't seen before, but I would recommend seeing this movie solely because of the acting; it's just that terrific. ""Leatherface"" may not be a fantastic film, but it for sure is a well-acted one.",Leatherface
45,lorcan-61881,Great prequel!,7,16 February 2018,"As a prequel to Tobe Hooper's masterpiece, Leatherface had to be good. Considering the film took place in the Texas Chainsaw 3D timeline, I could only imagine what it would be like..pure shit, but, actually it was'nt. Leatherface is actually a really great prequel. When the film came out, it recieved lots of negative reviews mostly from TCM fans but I'm a TCM fan, I thought it was great. The film follows a nurse who goes to start work in a mental home and when all of the inmates escape, she is then pursued by two inmates to walk with them to an unknown destination, if being honest, Leatherface is actually barely even a horror film, it was a lot like The Devils Rejects in ways and the whole film takes place in fields and on roads, Lin Taylor was in this film as Leatherface's intense mother who overall was actually really good and the movie tied in with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre pretty good although it did not feel to TCM as we don't even get a ""Leatherface"" or the actual ""Leatherface"", himself and trying to put this in with the original 1974 film, dose not really work but still, Leatherface is a very good surprising film I think you should go watch!

If you're not a big fan of Texas Chainsaw Massacre series than it's for you but for fans that's big, it's oppisite or the same but for me it's okay. The story is a bit of a slow burn but at least you know how it began, the writting is a meh, and the acting could be bad here and there. At least it's better than that crappy 3D one and better than that pointless prequal to the 2003 remake. I like the death scenes, they are gory at its best. Also the one main problem in the film is that you can get confussed on who is leather face like I thought the fat one is leatherface but it's the character Jackson but towards the end of the film say he's Jedd. Overall it's an okay movie. This is my review on Leatherface (2017), it's an inprovement to the two previous film but it's not good.",Leatherface
48,MinistryofDoom,Leatherface has Egg on his Face......,3,28 June 2018,"In case you are not aware from the title of the film, this is the origin of Leatherface, the main character from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The film, itself, looks like it tried too hard to copy the Rob Zombie formula for horror film-making, particularly his style of extending the back-story of Michael Myers, as well as obviously taking a lot of inspiration from Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses and Devil's Rejects. That is kind of ironic since Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses and Devil's Rejects were at least partially inspired by The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. 
In any event, as a horror fan, when I heard that there was going to be a Leatherface origin film, I was very excited! Unfortunately, that excitement quickly dissipated when I finally watched the film. It starts out slow, but OK, it seems like they wanted to work their way into developing the characters a bit. However, they just sort of gave up and it just fell apart very quickly. The writing was awful, the dialogue was terrible. At times it felt like I was watching a student film-making project. As far as horror goes, it had its moment but nothing ""jump out of your seat"" scary; mostly just ho-hum although a couple scenes were very gory still weren't really satisfying. The gory parts just kind of happen and then you're moved along. Lili Taylor was great but she was held down by poor production. If this film had a bigger budget and more time allotted to development, I think it could have been great. Sadly that was not to be the case and so now you just have another entry in the Texas Chainsaw franchise which will be forgotten just as quickly as it was released.",Leatherface

Then it takes the story in a completely opposite direction for about an hour with a whole different feel and initiative. This is where it runs into some dragged on problems of scattered plotting and pointless gratuitous violence without substantial connection to the overall story. There's a character named Bud that has an overwhelmingly distinct look to that of Leatherface with a heavy stature and messy brown hair and you're constantly thinking that will end up being the iconic character until they throw their massive attempt at a clever twist at you and kill him off only to have the very unsuspected Jackson character turn out to be the main character. This ridiculous move alone destroyed this film's potential. I get wanting to be clever and unsuspecting with the plot in this day and age of endless twists and turns, but it would've been so uttlery fitting to have had Bud turn out to be Leatherface. I don't think it would've made the overall mediocre story and pacing much better but it would've added a familiarity element to have that outcome. Maybe I'm just being biased but overall this origin story didn't amount to much other than some well shot cinematography and a few throwbacks to the franchise.

52,horizon2008,Dire,1,23 September 2017,"Oh dear oh dear. Many people were excitedly waiting on this one given it was coming from the directors of the brilliant Inside, but now that its here it seems their slide has continued because that films greatness has never been echoed (particularly after the terrible Among The Living). Leatherface lacks any ember of dread, menace, tension, or thrills and an attempt to have us connect with just one character (the nurse) fails badly. I just didn't see the point of this film, I at least expected to get some kind of simmering, disturbing, sweats on the level of (say) Girl Next Door but there was none of that. The movie has an entirely overproduced mainstream feel to it (completely unlike the original) and while it has some punctuating gore (I guess they thought it was shocking) its done so matter-of-fact it has no impact whatsoever leaving this viewer sighing an unaffected meh. The inclusion of a cheap necro scene was both pointless and silly (another failed attempt to shock) and while I often love Stephen Dorff acting his attempts in this stinker made me cringe. The huge leap in the development of the character who becomes Leatherface also felt forced. One minute hes offering some kind of negotiable humanity and the next hes a brainless loon for the rest of his days apparently.

The trailer was awful and that's what turned me off. When we just got off the band wagon of Texas Chainsaw(yet another remake) we get this low budget film with an advert that makes it look stupid. Whoever was in charge of making the trailer for this film should be fired, they picked all the shock and awe of the film to sell it, but all they had to do was be a little more discrete while trying to advertise the movie.This prequel erases all other prequels like ""The Beginning"" which was branched off the remake starring Jessica Biel. This film takes place before the original film, this tells the story of Leatherface how he was molded into a monster, even when you thought you had figured out the monster this film has a nice surprise and I welcome that idea. For once no glitz or glamour just a simple story, which sets up the original film nicely, what a smooth transition it makes at the end to the 1974 original.

The deaths are once again gory and painful looking, *spoiler alert****especially the opening two deaths. The only real gripe that I have with this entry, is that in both the original ""Texas Chainsaw"" and the 2003 remake, they said that old Leatherface was born with some kind of facial deformity, which was one of the main reasons why he performed impromptu surgery with his chainsaw for faces to wear.

59,pedroquintaoo,The Texas Shotgun Massacre... Annoys,5,23 September 2017,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINORS SPOILERSMy hype about this prequel was high. I loved the idea of follow 4 inmates spreading out the chaos in Texas and making the viewer trying to guess which one of the protagonists would be the famous serial killer. Although Leatherface gave us an ambiguous taste! In a good way we have a movie about 4 lunatics characters trying to escape from the police, but in the bad way we have a movie without the typical vibe of the Texas Chainsaw films.Forget all the things that made you liked the previous movies, I thought was watching a spin- off instead a prequel, Leatherface only turns in a lunatic killer during the last 5 or 10 minutes (and he only dress the skin mask in the last 2 seconds), the Sawyer family development was far way of what we have seen in another films, they weren't so crazy or creepy, they were just a sadistic family. Even the sequences about the inmates spreading the madness could be better, they go to 2 places after escape from the asylum, take a shotgun and then the final act begins, the producers could put them in more scenarios and doing a lot of crazy stuff.Leatherface isn't so bad, has some potential but is very far away of to be a good horror movie as also I can't call it a Texas Chainsaw movie, because even a shotgun has more screen time than the chainsaw, hasn't the typical insane vibe and sometimes looks more a spin-off or a thriller based on the story that we all know.Rating: 4.5/10",Leatherface

65,shawthingproductions,An embarrassment.,1,26 September 2017,"Tobe Hooper was the executive producer? I'm guessing he didn't read the awful script before signing his name to this mess of a film. The direction is terrible, almost comedic in places (waitress getting head blown off being an example) and acting all over the place - I mean, fair play to Sam Strike - coming from Eastenders to this but... I wouldn't be surprised if this is also a nail in his coffin. There are no characters you give a monkeys about in the whole film, even the nurse taken hostage, and there are scenes put in for shock value and nothing more and - even then - they're not that shocking considering horror films gone before. One such ""shocking scene""? A burned girl having sex with her boyfriend whilst making out with a corpse. Seen it before in ""Nekromantic"". The deaths are boring too - things we have seen before such as a person eaten by pigs (Hannibal) and another having their head put on a rock and stamped on (American History X). The problem being, the other films did those scenes so much better.The story - what made Leatherface into the monster he became - was boring. Part ""Natural Born Killers"" and part ""All the bad Texas Chainsaw Massacre films"" - it was, thank God, only 1 hour and 20 minutes long.

And all the other Chainsaw films are pretty solid, yes that includes 1994's 'The Next Generation', however this one here was a disgrace to the iconic franchise. Completely boring and hardly any chainsaw action at all. Gory yes, but not your typical Leatherface movie. And the so called ""twist"" in this movie was absolutely awful. It turns out the young hot shot, Jackson, played by Sam Strike turns out to be Jed Sawyer (leatherface) which is revealed the last twenty or so minutes of the film. No believable in my opinion. This film is supposed to be a direct prequel to the 1974 film and when the sheriff shoots Jackson/Leatherface in the cheek with his gun a huge gash is left across his face, which wasn't on him in the 1974 film. Yes I know this film was made long after '74 But they still Could be made that work. I don't even know what else to say, this film was just such a disappointment.

I'll never understand how with so much money involved in these productions, they don't even try in the slightest to do something outside of the ordinary.But besides all that, the characters don't make any sense, it doesn't make any sense that a guy like Jed becomes Leatherface, it would have made much more sens if it was Bud, not Jed, who was the most sane out of the group along with Elizabeth of course.It doesn't make sense that he becomes so deranged so quickly and so easily manipulated by his mother whom he has not seen for half of his life. Nonsense that he kills Elizabeth, absolute nonsense; The Leatherface in the original would totally do it, but not this one with this garbage backstory they gave him.Didn't anyone involved in the making of this film think how extremely and unbelievably weak the story was? Why exactly he becomes leatherface? The whole movie is just basically a group of people who escape a mental institution and then they try to hide from the cops until they catch them, in the process Jed gets shot in the face and that magically makes him the iconic demented killer. That's seriously the best they could come up with as a backstory to Leatherface??????? come on.He goes from being a completely rational human being to a deranged killer over the course of a few hours, it's ridiculous. This also is supposed to be set in the 50's - 60's, but it looks modern day except for the cars, lazy.Also, the whole scene in the trailer is ridiculous.

76,zdflanders,"High quality footage, great actors, decent scenery, HORRIBLE WRITING",1,9 April 2020,"The realisticness of the Texas Chainsaw franchise has always been over the top nonsensical. 1-4 are dated and stylized in campy way. The sequels with Andrew Bryniarski are brutal and beyond gory yet still carry the spirit of the plot. This was just poorly written and couldn't be more unrealistic.
First of all, it could've been mostly fixed with one small change. Bud is the only sicko in the cast that possibly matches the Leatherface persona. He's dumb, full of brute strength, and large for his age. Instead he turned out to be Jackson who's basically a friendly, charming, and sensitive teenage heart throb. It was so dumb. Moronic fans will try to counter this argument with the fact that some real life serial killers are good looking and charming (such as Ted Bundy). Ok Leatherface is not a sociopath. He cannot function as anything other than a mentally impaired homicidal maniac. It's very apparent in the franchise, especially because he can barely speak a language and only grunts like a pig. It was also seemingly hereditary given that both his father and brother acted with some form of mental illness (more than likely schizophrenia).
More on this note, why is the entire caste of Leatherface (aside from Bud) played by extremely good looking people? The guys all have six packs and good bone structure and the girls are all tall and gorgeous. They're from a mental institution. I have seen people in mental institutions. Trust me. They look like they belong in there. Not only that, but everyone had a unique sense of charisma to them. They geared up Ike and Clarice to be like Boney and Clyde and played upbeat music while they were robbing a place. I mean come on. This isn't Leatherface. Idk what this is.
Alright final critique. Jackson's family was probably the most unrealistic thing in this entire movie. A family of homicidal maniacs isn't going to be a ""Leave it to Beaver"" type household when they aren't killing someone. It's going to be people with backwards morals and disturbing behavior even aside form killing. These people acted like it was initially just a regular loving household. Then when they were killing someone, they acted like it was their form of justice for theft. People with extreme senses of capital punishment DO NOT use of aberrant methods such as what this family did. Like why would you have your young child son murder someone with a chainsaw as a birthday present. That's not even scary. It's just really stupid. Also just wanted to point out that after a murder like the one that happened to the sheriff's daughter, the police would've swarmed that area and everyone would've been arrested. No possible way they would've let that go because of lack of evidence. A brutally murdered corpse was there with the entire household present. That's all the evidence you need to make the arrest.
Here's a good way to rewrite this. Start with the murder of the sheriff's daughter to start his personal motive. He wants justice but because the perpetrators are so young, they are put in institutions rather than a prison. So he stalks them. They grow up (use James Bloor as Nubbins and Same Coleman as Leatherface). Eventually they (and several other violent teens from Sawyer ranch) escape and the sheriff uses everything he can to finally bring his daughter justice. He manages to kill everyone except Bubba, Nubbins and the father. This gives him enough reason to feel like he served his purpose and leave the same characters for the eventual Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Basic plot but it makes way more sense than this train wreck.",Leatherface

I've seen pretty much every sequel, spin-off or parody on the brilliant original and always found something made watching it worth while. And that to be expected from a horror freak from the eighties but this flick made that difficult and eventually impossible from the moment the necrophilia stept in. Apparently that's where I draw the line. Up till then the horror storyline did more then it's job, totally annoyed by the naive behaviour of the good nurse an the shortsighted sheriff and doctor in charge of the institute. The flagrant disregard of normal visiting protocol which let the obvious deranged mother walk free through the building causing the escalation that turns out in the escape of a bunch of them. Add to it the shortcoming implemented safety protocols of daily proceedings and your in for a treat. Normally! But I couldn't get past the aforementioned corpse desecration.

It was totally unbelievable that an almost compassionate normal functioning, rational person, would immediately transform into a dumbass mute for the last 10 mins of the movie! A shot in the face would not cause this, it would cause disfigurement sure, but it wouldn't dramatically change his whole personality into a mindless idiot. 
It would have made far more sense if the other character Bud turned out to be Jed, especially as it gave us an inkling of what he was capable of by killing the guy at the mental hospital and Isaac. 
They were obviously going for maybe a bit of a twist, but it's one that wasn't believable and just makes the movie disappointing.

When a young woman follows a little boy, she believes to be hurt, she is met by the sadistic Sawyer family and brutally murdered. The woman's father is a local Sherriff and vows to seek revenge by taking a young Jedidiah Sawyer to a mental institution. Ten years have passed, and the newly named Jackson has formed a close bond with one of the nurses. A riot soon starts in the wards leading many patients to escape, Jackson and the nurse being a couple. However, it is not just the law and authorities the couple are running from, it's the Sawyer family wanting their son back. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the greatest horror films of all time, but the constant recycling of the film is becoming tedious.

I expected a lot considering the directors behind Inside, which is perhaps one of the best European home invasion/horror movies ever made, directed Leatherface.For one, it is shot in Eastern Europe, which looks nothing like Texas. For the first 10 minutes or so, I had the feeling you get when you are watching a poorly made movie—that feeling that you are watching a bunch of actors pretending. Then in the middle of the movie, events occur, but no story substantial story is told. I was going to give it a 5, which means I was bored during it, thought there were major flaws, and probably didn't finish watching it. But I decided to watch the last 15 minutes instead of shutting it off, and it was entertaining, so I then wanted to elevated my rating to a 6, which means there were some boring parts, some major flaws, but I watched the whole thing and thought at least some of it was entertaining. Then I remembered some of the really stupid WTF moments where I thought, ""How could anyone who gets paid to make movies think that is a good idea?""I would recommend watching it to see how far off this one is from the style and feel of the rest of the franchise.

91,Skaigear,One of the worst mainstream horror movie I have ever seen,2,8 October 2017,"Leatherface is directed by Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo and it is the eighth film in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre horror franchise. The entries in the series have been very interesting even by horror standards because it has gone through so many reboots and remakes and prequels that each film feels completely disconnected from another. Each new film seems like it is just grasping for straws to cash-in on the legacy that was the 1974 original. The newest iteration, simply titled ""Leatherface"" is the 'prequel' to the entire series, not to be confused with 2006's The Beginning which was a prequel to the 2003 version. At this point, making a good Texas Chainsaw movie is not impossible, it just needs to be in the hands of filmmakers who actually care and know about the source material, because watching Leatherface, all I see are amateurs who do not know how to make a movie nor understand what makes the 1974 film a classic. This is not only the worst film of the franchise, but quite simply one of the worst mainstream horror movie I have ever seen.Everything about the film is utterly atrocious and needs not be seen by anyone. First off, the whole entire premise is innately flawed, as we do not want nor need to see how Leatherface becomes Leatherface (again). Showing Jed Sawyer as a child with crazy family members demystifies him and in turn makes everything less scary, so thus this movie should not even exist in the first place. Second, if you are going to make a movie about Leatherface as child/teenager at least make it compelling and character-focused, but no, the entire movie has almost nothing to do with Leatherface, Texas or chainsaws.The first act of the movie takes a place in a mental institution, where violent criminal patients can peculiarly roam freely. A laughably bad breakout scene leads us to the not much better second act, a road trip with psychos, which is the bulk of the movie. The movie tries to play it coy by not telling us which of the five road trippers is Leatherface, but it was so painfully obvious I was sighing every 10 seconds. The main nurse character was one of the captives in the group, and she was the closest thing to sympathy we have in the film, but even she had no character aside from being a nurse and being kidnapped. She was also very dumb as she had opportunity to escape her captors multiple times but decides not to for inexplicable reasons, despite the fact they do not have weapons of any kind in the beginning.The film feels very far removed from a Texas Chainsaw movie that it felt like it was originally written to be a different film altogether, and was then combined with Texas Chainsaw elements to create the screenplay used. What made the 1974 original so effective was the terror and surreal feeling of being captured by a crazy family, being tied up to a chair to have dinner with them, like a nightmare you are unable to wake up from. This 2017 movie's road trip plot of ""Who is Leatherface?"" completely misses the spirit.Technically it is perhaps even worst, as the entire film has a cheap direct-to-video look to it and the night scenes are really dark and not properly lit. The scenery is obviously not Texas as they could only afford to show a barn, a diner and a hospital, all in the middle of nowhere with no context of where they are. The editing has to be some of the most jarring and disgusting I have ever seen. There was actually a jump cut used when two people were sitting and talking to each other in the most obvious and egregious way. Two sex scenes were employed between the two escaped patients, and they served no purpose except as attempts to shock the audience. It had no effect on me because I was too busy rolling my eyes on how terrible they were. The violence while here, has the fakest looking blood to date. With not much else to look forward to, the editors actually had the audacity to cut away from some of the gruesomeness. The movie is not going to win an Oscar, so it might as well should went all out with the gore, but no, the filmmakers disappointingly holds back.The only things I can say that were not truly awful were the diner scene, and Vanessa Grasse as Lizzy just because she was easy on the eyes, but that is it. The franchise has definitely seen better days, and if a ninth film ever gets made, I hope it is handed to filmmakers who actually know what they are doing so we can get another great Texas Chainsaw movie. Leatherface has very little redeeming factors and even for the most die-hard fans of the series it is hard to recommend.",Leatherface
92,Joshua_Penczek,One of the better TCM films has nothing to do with TCM,6,13 October 2018,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise has been a long and drawn out one, comprised more of reboots and remakes than straight-forward sequels, and nearly all of the failing either critically, fianancially, or logically. Or all three. By this point, the franchise has been completely wrung out dry of creativity, but Leatherface is a film that tries something new. Is it good? Almost, it certainly has good aspects, but at least it tries to tell a new story.For the good, Leatherface is well directed and well acted. Most of the characters are quite compelling and are certainly acted well by the entire cast. It serves a prequel to the original film, an origin story that describes a young Leatherface and how he became the infamous slaughterer we know him to be today. The same concept was done in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beggining, but it's done infinitely better here because more emphasis is given towards character development instead of cheap gore effects. The movie also does a decent job at making Leatherface a likable protagonist and making the lawful pursuing cop a good antagonist. This is something that's very hard to pull off, and it's something Texas Chanisaw 3D tried and failed miserably in doing, but it's helped significantly by Stephen Dorff's excellent performance as the destable vengeful police officer.My main issue with the film come from the fact that this story certainly doesn't feel like the story that would shape Leatherface. In fact, in no ways does it resemble a Texas Chainsaw Massacre film. Instead, Leatherface is a teenage jailbreak-roadtrip movie, where one of the teens happens to be a young Leatherface. Without the first five and last five minutes, this film could've easily been branded as another movie, and the fact that it's somehow tied into the TCM franchise actually hurts it more than saves it.Another issue is that the film just isn't necessary. It falls into my above point, but this story does not feel like the story that describes how Leatherface came to be. It doesn't really tie into the first movie or any of the other films and simply isn't an important story in the grand scheme of things. As it is, however, Leatherface really isn't that bad. It's not very good as a Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie, but it certainly works much better as it's own film. Leatherface certainly should've gone by a different name and I think the film would've benefited a lot more without being pigeonholed into a franchise it feels out of place in.",Leatherface

There's the first 10 minutes of this film... then there's the last 10 minutes... NOTHING in between contributed to an acceptable origin story of Leatherface. We got a brief look at his childhood (first 10 min)... eventually we learn how he became disfigured (last 10 min)... but how he became this giant, semi-mute, monster... there's NOTHING about this story-line that explains this or gives us ANY additional insight. For the most part we find out what we already knew (in the first 10 min)... his entire family is sadistic and insane... THAT'S how he became Leatherface... not anything you're going to see here.This was nothing but an attempt to tell a story that ultimately has nothing to do with the origin of Leatherface. The leap from how this guy became Leatherface is astronomical and nonsensical. What we already knew was sufficient and should've been the focus of an origin film. THIS was just an opportunity to take advantage of a successful franchise with a story that was FORCED to tie into the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Complete with a bunch of forced twists and turns in attempt to appear to have more depth than it actually does.

Whoever wrote this movie did a great job not going the typical, one-dimensional route prequel-sequel films can tend to do. I honestly thought this was going to be a lame cash grab with pointless, over-saturated violence, but it is not.The film is extremely violent, but instead of pointless distractions, it adds to the development of the story and serves to show the qualities the characters you are dealing with in a short amount of time. I recommend everyone who gives this movie a try to watch it all the way through, and it might need a repeated watch because a lot happens and it is very chaotic.Greatest thing about this film, there really are no good guys. There are innocent characters, sure, but just about everyone is out for each other, and psychopathic hostility is present in almost every scene of the film.This is a good installment in series of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies, in my opinion it is not gratuitous (especially compared to the films of today), but it is definitely a gruesome film, but if you are making a film about the origins of one of Hollywood's most popular serial killers, how could it not be?

So I thought I would give this a chance just based on the previous work from these two.Is it perfect? No, there are some issues. Is it worth seeing? Yes!There are some great kills, some good atmosphere, camera work is well done and some decent acting. The start of the movie is also very well done, I wish they would have stayed longer when he was a kid. The whole first half of this movie is pretty well done.My issues with the film are the 2nd half is not as good as the first half and how they didn't give us more time with leatherface as a child. At times it feels like this movie is two different movies, could have been edited better.Overall its well directed, some gorey kills, some good atmosphere, decent acting, camera work is good and the start of the movie is very well done.

As many said before, and I've said since seeing the amazing 1973 version at a 80's re-release drive-in, it worked because of the mystery, atmosphere, and NO GORE. So basically, Leatherface 17 basically does every single thing the original didn't do to make it the film it was. Are the filmmakers aware of that? Do they care? Do they know origin stories are bad financial decisions for horror properties? If I were credited exec producer Tobe Hooper (RIP), I would have made sure to pass away before seeing this too. It is a better option. No, really, die before seeing this.As Scorsese says as he continues to sell out ""cinema is dead"". This is a mean, inept, nasty, badly overacted at every breath. It has more production value than the 1994 version. Haven't seen all the TC films, but somehow this makes the Matthew Mcconaughey film look like a gem. In an attempt to be relevant, they added forced shock as there is a sex scene taking place on top of a dead body. Lame. And this is a no-no to say subjectively in a review, but there is definitely something wrong with you if you like these kind of movies. And I've seen Henry/Cannibal Holocaust/Serbian Film - don't condone those, but there's a point to them, at least. These statements will make people outraged, but the real fright is, nobody will be outraged that film content like this is normal these days. Worst part is, all the imagination this property can offer is fully drained from this Bulgaria filmed outing.Lili Taylor tries to underact. To think, she and Stephen Dorff had respectable careers at one time in the 90's, and before.

For more than half of the movie, I questioned myself why is called Leatherface, the action never calling for the well known killer nor his reputation. If you had no knowledge of him, one would assume is just another movie about a mentally ill killer, scaring off some teenagers and hunting them down. The acting is not bad but could be a lot better, the plot is probably the biggest downside of this prequel, having too many stupid scenes. Not that many references to Leatherface at all, apart from the beginning and the ending.

Or just plain waste of film?,3,29 September 2017,"After Texas Chainsaw 3d, which was another pretty bad addition to the franchise, another film has the claim (Or fans and medias claim it?) to be the true canon sequel to Tobe Hooper's 1974 masterpiece, The Texas Chainsaw massacre.No matter how many sequels have been made, none has managed to top the original 3 films franchise: Texas1, 2 and 3 which was also titled Leatherface. The 2 sequels to the original, although a little silly were also mindless fun and that's something that's been lacking to these films since the 2003 remake in my opinion. Now we are stuck on repeat, always trying to find a way to reboot the series but with more of the same at each turn. Only the fans of gore alone, this is a film for you. Don't get me wrong, i love my films extreme and filled with it. Horror and violence deserves to be rated R and be worthy of that mention, and even the Unrated version that avoiding the wide theater release can provide. Hell yes, i'm all for it.But this time, yet another time for this franchise turns into a wasted opportunity. Or in a waste of film since their might be no more ways to explore and better this once fun and outrageous name. To sum the film up in a short story: Cops are bad and we still try to make the Sawyer family and especially Leatherface sympathetic characters. Trying to find some redeeming traits to this particular monster or justify it after everyone, every fan at least is aware since the 1970s what he is and what he's capable of? I'm bore out of my skull once again.Try Cult of Chucky. For lack of better films in theaters, it easily tops Leatherface in terms of style, cinematography, silly humor and fun overall.",Leatherface

116,Kirsty2515,Surprising good prequel.,7,17 March 2018,"Now I know prequels can be massively hit and miss, but I was really impressed with this one. I love the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise, it's a classic. When I sat down to watch this film I was really hoping that this wasn't going to one of them films that tried so hard to fit in to an iconic franchise and fell flat on its face and it wasn't.For me the film helped to build and understanding of Leatherface and how he became the crazed killer that we have seen for so many years. I loved the way that from the start the film kept you guessing as to which of the characters was going to end up being Leatherface. It made you feel compassion and sympathy for the character of Leatherface and although you know that no matter what he does, his fate of becoming that brutal killer is set, you still hope that he may be able to have a normal happy life away from the depraved family that want him back.The film has all the elements of a traditional TCM film, the gore the brutality the suspense. There are a few scenes that make you uncomfortable, for me the scene where Clarice and Ike are having sex and they include the dead body they found turn my stomach and when Bud makes Ike bite the rock but every nerve in my body on edge, but for a film like this them type of nasties are expected.The Sam Coleman, Jessica Madsen and James Bloor done an amazing job of play psychotic crazies. They were terrifying with their unpredictableness. Sam Strike was brilliant at carrying such an iconic role. I think he really took you on the journey of Leatherface and made you love him, hate him and fear him all at the same time. As for Dorff, you just have to hate him all the way through and feel a slight happiness when he gets his just deserts, And Lili Taylor just plays that depraved killer mother role far too well.I think this is a really great film, and a welcomed addition to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise. Defiantly worth a watch.",Leatherface
117,george_aslf,One of the best in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise,7,24 September 2017,"The problem with many horror movie franchises is that due to lack of new ideas brought by their authors (who tend to solely exploit the trademarks and fundamentals of the original work instead of contributing something of their own) sequels/prequels lack originality, are too derivative, formulaic and overall subpar. None of these applies to the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre prequel entitled ""Leatherface"".""Leatherface"", directed by Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury (""À l'intérieur"") is an example of a very well done prequel – to a certain extent reminiscent of the original work of Tobe Hooper, containing multiple references thereto as well (like the grandfather slamming a victim with a hammer and killing him with a single hit, as the granddaddy is in his prime here), but nevertheless original, self-reliant and solid piece of work.The biggest achievement of the directors is a successful mixture of genres: a horror movie, a rural shotgun crime film and a mystery. An ""asylum horror movie"" could also be added to these as a sub-genre, however I have intentionally omitted it as the scenes taking place in the asylum were my least favorite (somewhat derivative, similar to Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" prequel and other asylum horrors). The events taking place after the asylum part are much more interesting and exciting. The diner shootout (reminiscent of Oliver Stone's ""Natural Born Killers"") is classic on its own terms. Then comes the mystery (big twist) part that I am not going to elaborate on (in order not to spoil anything). And, finally, the kid-to-monster metamorphosis (both, physical and moral) was done immaculately.A few words about the cast: it was good! The characters felt real, there was no overacting (or just bad acting) that we often see in horror films. Lili Taylor, Jessica Madsen and Sam Strike did a great job.Visual and special effects are topnotch. The movie is ultraviolent – just the way a full-fledged Texas Chainsaw Massacre film should be. The ability to create amazing violent scenes on screen was demonstrated by Bustillo and Maury in their prior work (primarily, in ""À l'intérieur""). The imagery (rural landscape, Sawyers' house, killing weapons, etc) is spot on and consistent with the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.The only way in which ""Leatherface"" is not fully consistent with its predecessor is that the latter is a dark comedy, while the prequel somewhat lacks the comic and the whole ""Grand Guignol"" elements of the original. This is only a minor issue though and does not affect the quality of the film in any way, especially if we consider that the film is already a mixture of various genres (as described above).In a nutshell, ""Leatherface"" is one of the best installments in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise and is a great horror movie on its own terms. Definitely recommended to all horror fans.",Leatherface
118,kriskennedy-79484,Absolute garbage...,1,23 April 2018,"If I could rate this movie into the minus numbers I would because I've never seen a more ridiculous film that is driven entirely by the level of violence it depicts for the sheer pleasure of it. Its films like this that tend to show how bankrupt/devoid Hollywood has become of ideas to make a film instead resorting to feeding off a franchise that goes back to 1973 and has had countless sequels since then. 
In this case what you have are a pack of escape psychotics running around killing indiscriminately and a sheriff out for revenge who isn't much better. 
What lacks for a storyline is effectively made up with the gorefest deployed here, including a graphic sex scene involving a dead person. Its almost as if there was no desire to create characters here of even the most basic level of complexity to keep the viewer interested and that is sad because the notion of a prequel to this story could've been done in a far more compelling way without the reliance on depicting various methods of killing to make up for it.
What I will say is that this isn't a film for anyone under the age of 18, unlike previous iterations as even I had a hard time sitting through it. I like the horror film genre but those movies that depict varying degrees of violence instead of true suspense just aren't worth the price of admission.",Leatherface
119,meadever,Really Enjoyable,8,11 January 2018,"I seem to be in the minority on this, but I found this movie to be pretty good. That could be because I'm a die-hard TCM fan, but then again I found Texas Chainsaw 3D to be pretty weak. Overall, I think this is just one of the better entries we have gotten in the franchise in the last decade or so.
I went into it with some trepidation, because thanks to the way the trailer was cut and my experience of 2006's The Beginning, I was expecting a movie that focused on gore for the sake of gore, which I find hard to stomach sometimes. Luckily that is not what was presented. Don't get me wrong, there is still some good gore in there. There is certainly more overt blood and carnage than the original (which is not near as graphic as people seem to remember), it's just not the main focus of the movie, which is probably my favorite thing about it. It's obvious that the filmmakers were mostly concerned with telling a good origin story for this horror icon, and I think they succeeded.
What appeals to me most about this film is just how unexpected it is. What I mean by that is it would have been so easy to hit certain notes and deliver a movie that was enjoyable but predictable. They could have chosen to make Jed (Leatherface's real name) a violent kid with mental issues, which is what I think most of us expected him to be based on his later appearances. They could have chosen to make him a victim of his family who just kills because he is told to. In other words, they could have done what a few other entries in the series have already done. But they didn't. They portray Jed as a fairly sensitive kid who happens to be part of a blood-thirsty, backwoods family, and who ends up punished for their actions. At the end of the film, you come to the heartbreaking realization that under any other circumstances, Jed could have grown up to lead a normal life.
Part of the reason this works is the red herring they added of Bud, who, as a hulking, seemingly handicapped young man, spends much of the movie as the most likely candidate to become the skin tailor we know and love. When he dies in the third act, and it's revealed that handsome, kind Jackson was the missing Sawyer all along, it's a genuine shock. The idea that the protagonist you were rooting for the whole time becomes this monstrous being is tragic, and the surprise of the reveal just adds to that feeling.
The other thing that makes it work, at least for me, is how much sense it actually makes when all is said and done. Jed's separation from his family, his loss of a surrogate brother, and even his horrific facial injury all combine to explain how he gets to where he does later on. It explains his need to wear masks, his mental state, and his unceasing loyalty. It goes so much deeper than just a mentally impaired kid who doesn't know his own strength, and I love that depth.
I also have to applaud the filmmakers for the brave choice of not redeeming him at the end. When Elizabeth, his supposed love interest up until this point, is pleading for her life, a lot of movies would have gone the sentimental route and had Jed release her as one last act of humanity. But no, Jed slices her head off with his chainsaw and uses her as part of his first mask. It's a bold choice because it leaves what was for most of the movie a very likable character with no redemption. He is gone, and he isn't coming back.
I also have to applaud the acting, because without it, none of what I just listed would have worked. Lili Taylor is amazing as always, and Sam Strike really nails his emotional ups and downs as Jackson/Jed. Even Stephen Dorff turns in a good performance as the sheriff, making the character incredibly easy to sympathize with, but also hate.
The only real critique I have is that a little too much time is spent on that in-between period, when the three protagonists are being dragged around by their kidnappers. It just felt a little out of place for a TCM film and didn't necessarily add anything to overall story of Leatherface's origins.
Overall, I just thought this was a good film, better than it needed to be in my opinion.",Leatherface
120,csharpforevermore,A decent prequel,7,6 June 2018,"I do not know whether it is because I did not see the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre first, or simply because I am a huge fan of horror movies, but this film is one of my favorites. The narrative is hugely entertaining, and the gore is believable and not over the top. This rates has one of the sickest films that I have seen, due to its over the top sex scenes and horrific violence. I would certainly advise anybody of a nervous disposition to avoid this film, but if you're like me and are never tired of being jump-scared by horror movies, then this is the film for you.I never quite understood the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre film, but I certainly understand this one. I feel that a lot of other reviewers are too harsh with their criticisms as being ""completely irrelevant and grossly disappointing"". This film was a lot better than many other horror movies on IMDB that have higher ratings, in my opinion.The character's dynamics are succinct and well-acted. There are some gratuitously violent or gory scenes but what do you expect from horror movies these days? I feel that if you approach this film without any expectations, and without contrasting it against the other films in this series, then you will be able to get a satisfactory amount of entertainment from Leatherface.",Leatherface

I wasn't sure what to expect if I'm honest, but got drawn into it quite quickly. The premise of the story is to explain the reasons why Leatherface became so horrific and twisted. The plot shows a young child, Jed, facing systematic abuse from his deranged family. Following the murder of a local cop's daughter he is taken to an institution, where his identity is changed. Jump forward a few years and we see a young nurse starting at the same institution. She meets a few very diverse and challenging characters, who escape, taking her hostage, wreaking death and destruction on the run. This ultimately leads to a confrontation with the pursuing scorned cop from the earlier third of the film. Due to Jed's identity being changed I found that I was guessing who might end up becoming Leatherface! Gore-lovers will love it, the movie pushes the boundaries a little in some scenes, but then it has to, to allow Leatherface's character to be explained.",Leatherface
124,jcpierre96,Unworthy of the Texas Chainsaw franchise! Boo!,3,16 June 2018,"This is one of the worst horror movie I've ever seen. With the premise of a chase between a group of psychopaths and a cold, violent sheriff, I expected something along the line of ""The Devil's Rejects"", a movie at least entertaining in terms of action and characters. But it was not.The characters are dreadful. Leatherface is useless most of the movie. The psychopaths act in the most idiotic ways possible, even on psychopath standards. I won't even dignify to explain how mental illness is represented in this movie. One would expect, at least, a part of mystery and chaos in the antagonists, but they are only pseudo-edgy, dumb cardboard stereotypes. The ""good"" guys are predictable and hollow. I only added 3 stars for the sheriff character, who is played well by Stephen Dorff, and the old cars, which are cool. All in all, the characters come and go, meet one another at a random pace, until there is nothing left in the viewer's mind but confusion.The cinematography is dreadful. The good old ""yellow taint"" by day and ""blue taint"" by night to give a dirty feeling are well worn-out by now; it's unoriginal and boring. The gore scenes? Yes, there are a few. Most of them are only based on cheap squishy noises and CGI blood. Boring and truly worthy of a direct-to-video movie. Add to that shameless rip-offs of iconic scenes from other movies (I won't spoil anything, but you will quickly understand this reference).The scenario is dreadful. It never goes anywhere. It's suppose to be a HUNT, but it somehow manages to be boring! Were the screenwriters on a vacation? 
Here are some other issues I won't develop: idiotic Texas accents (and I'm from Europe!), cheap music, bad sound effects... In the end, you will be thankful to see main characters killed: at least, they're a change from the rest of the story.My advice is: stick to the most iconic Texas Chainsaw movies. Leave a part of mystery in Leatherface's character. And, most importantly, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!",Leatherface
125,cyberray1976,"If you're a fan of these characters, stay away. Far away.",3,22 September 2017,"Leatherface (2017) Review. Will contain spoilers so read at your discretion. I really don't know where to start with this movie. I honest to God really tried to give it a chance. I tried to give Leatherface the benefit of the doubt. Sadly I was disappointed due to a number of factors. I'll start with what I liked because there isn't that much to cover. I enjoyed how they recreated the farmhouse. I think it's cool anytime we get to revisit the Sawyer farm. I'm happy that they were able to tie elements of 3D into this movie with the inclusion of Verna Sawyer Carson, her lawyer Farnsworth, and Leatherface keeping the name Jedidiah. It was neat to see the original Sawyer Clan again and I thought we'd see more of them. That being said, the few positive factors did not save this movie for me. Leatherface turned out to be the skinny kid that was talking as a teenager. I could possibly see Leatherface being skinny in his teenage years but he absolutely does not talk. Maybe he talked a little as a child but at the age he was at during the majority of the movie he shouldn't have been able to talk. Leatherface is not a cliché buff slasher, he is a large heavy set guy. If you want to make Leatherface skinny that's one thing but don't put him right next to someone with the exact same looks, and mannerisms that Leatherface should have. It's not a neat twist, it's a ""fuck you"" to the fans. Possibly the worst thing they did is say he wears the mask due to a facial disfigurement. Saying that a killer wears a mask because of a disfigurement is the laziest backstory ever! I have given credit where credit is due. It was neat seeing Leatherface come out of the basement with his chainsaw brutally killing Hartman. The classic chase through the woods with the chainsaw was lazy and played out and was not satisfying at all. Despite the cool nods to the original I don't think it's worth the watch. It is absolutely the worst film in the franchise (I don't count the remakes) This movie was unnecessary and absolutely lacking in character development. It's a desperate attempt to make a profit doing what they want with only some nods to the original to keep it somewhat afloat. I'm very disappointed because I don't see the franchise bouncing back from this atrocity unless they do a sequel to 3D. I wanted to enjoy any Leatherface movie but I just couldn't enjoy this one. 3 out of 10. Not worth the watch. Spare yourselves the disappointment.",Leatherface

I mean, sure, there was Bud who resembled the most of Gunnar Hansen, but he was the most obvious red herring ever. It was clear from the beginning that Jackson will be Leatherface, since he was the only not psychotic one.

Leatherface has more in common with Bonnie and Clyde than TCM.. The story centers around a teenage Jed aka Leatherface escaping from a mental hospital with two Bonnie and Clyde wannabes and another inmate, also kidnapping a young nurse. From there, the trio and the nurse take a incoherent road trip into hell.. This movie is not good at all, and in the process sinks TCM brand further in to mediocrity.. I didn't have high hopes going in to it, but the flick did have director Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury going for it.. The duo behind one of my favorite horror films of all time INSIDE.. So I did have at least some hope.. But it was not to be, I don't know what went wrong.. Maybe to much studio meddling? Who knows.. Anyways Leatherface offers absolutely nothing when it comes to good story telling or likable characters.. I'm not going to into spoilers, but when things to come ahead.. It some of the most (all of a sudden) bullshit I've since, ugg.. Never mind.. Positives: some good gore effects, we do get a little bit of boobies.

They nailed it with the practical effects and the deaths scenes. Satisfying for a gore lover, after all these toned down sequels in general lately. 
All 3 main characters go from one dimensional to ""I'm gonna do whatever it takes to escape"" and actually become.. smart? Wait... there are smart characters in a slasher?!! Yup, but the problem is once half of these characters are developed, they're either instantly killed off or vanish rate off the radar. 
The movie itself feels like it doesn't know what it wants to be. For a fan, you'll be satisfied with the deaths and action it had but you might be disappointed with the choice of pacing and direction.

With an approximate running time of 1hr and 24 minutes, it managed to fit all of the main characters into the film. I believe the gore hounds will be a bit disappointed. There is not an abundance of explicit violence. By that I mean the bloody scenes are not dwelled upon, which in my opinion is a plus. We even get to see how Leatherface achieves his deformed looks, as well as his muteness. Please don't listen to the naysayers, or the so called 'professional' movie critics. This is a great film as a prequel. I hope they do not attempt to remake the original again. This 'Leatherface', as well as the original from 1974 should stand as they are, and if another TCM movie is made, it should continue from when Sally Hardesty escapes in 1974. Watch this movie. It has action, gore and suspense. Again, you won't be disappointed .",Leatherface
144,stephanechauvet,A very good prequel,8,6 September 2020,"A lot of important scene missing in the final film producer's cut. For fans, see the cut scenes on the BR and the original ending preferred by the directors. A watered-down film to please the greatest number.",Leatherface
145,mywebstorage,"Boring, predictable, dumb and shamelessly rips off scenes from other movies",1,16 December 2017,"Here is your classic lazy script cliche movie, with stupid victims who are too dumb to escape no matter if they are full on running and the chaser is walking, classic ""tripping"", classic ""broken twig while hiding in the woods conveniently revealing your location....And, was it just me? or did anyone else notice stupidly obvious and lame rip offs of wannabe copies of famous scenes from actual good movies!?

Hannibal (pig scene)
American Story X (mouth stomp execution scene)
...and I would venture to say they wanted to copy as well the ""mommy"" thing from Friday the 13th...I was not expecting a great movie, never been a big fan of the franchise, but I was certainly not expecting such a lame film... sorry for those who are (or were) fans, this movie certainly is an insult to them. Watch it out of curiosity if you have absolutely nothing else to do with an hour and a half and feel like ""meh""... but that's about it.",Leatherface
146,apriloish,Leatherface 2017 review,7,22 September 2017,I had been anticipating this movie for a while.Horror fans know it was finished for a while but called back for re shoots.Well is it any good well yes.Any horror fan that knows the franchise will tell you the first is a masterpiece the second is a black comedy an a good movie.All though the comedy is hit or miss with people.Chainsaw 3 was hurt bad by the ratings board but in its unrated cut is all right time killer.Next Generation is one of the worst films ever made.But is so bad its good an has become a cult film because of its terribleness.The remake was good but lost the social commentary of the original.The prequel to the remake is OK but doesn't offer much.Then lastly the 3d one which ignores everything except the original is a bad film.An the second worst of the franchise.The time line of these movies is interesting as each sequel other then 2 ignores the movie before it.Which brings us to Leatherface a Chainsaw prequel to the original film.The movie has little boy Leatherface taken from his family an placed into a mental institution were he eventually breaks out on a road trip with one hostage an a crazy cop on his tail.He goes on the run with a group of other patients headed to Mexico.The acting in the film is good but has some rough spots to start with.The boy playing the character that becomes Leatherface is the best actor of the kids.There's gore in the film but not as much as you would expect but when it hits the screen its gruesome.The film becomes a road trip movie for the majority an in doing so feels different then what we have come to know as the standards in the franchise.But its still fun but doesn't feel like the Texas Chainsaw franchise.By the 3rd act though the film becomes Texas Chainsaw again.Now don't get me wrong the film gels well but it is different then what the franchise is known for.But after 6 films a franchise needs shook up.All in all a good film an easily better then 3d an next generation.Also better then the remakes prequel an Texas Chainsaw 3.Its as good as the remake comes close to being as good as part 2.Its a good horror film an worth a watch in a franchise that has run out of steam.,Leatherface
147,worldweaved,Interesting Story of Origins,8,8 February 2021,"An interesting story of origins, featuring solid acting and a vicious but intelligently told confection of dark and depraved ideas underpinning the heritage of the Leatherface character. Home is where the heart is...Typically, this film was almost universally savaged and ripped apart by the unrestrained legion of self-appointed critics and horror fans, many of whom sadly demonstrating their deficient understanding of the horror genre as well as the very unfortunate posturing and bravado that afflicts the crowd of so-called horror loyalists and hardcore purists. Almost as pretentious as a lecture on the philosophy of mind.It's been said that critics, self-appointed or otherwise, don't like sequels. They have prejudged the material prior to viewing. This is correct, and verges on fanaticism when prequels enter the equation. Meat and potato. Too bad the critic rarely if ever conjures up any creative material of their own. Immersed in the pure passivity of viewing consumption, criticism is their only attribute. Very regrettable.Comparisons to the original are irrelevant. A modicum of restraint with respect to expectations and a degree of open-mindedness to the possibility that variations on a theme can be interesting. This should be sufficient enough to enjoy this brutal and horrific recent rendition of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre universe.",Leatherface
148,coolistgee,Not what I was expecting but not bad,6,31 December 2017,"I thought Leatherface 2017 was slightly above average. The opening scene made it seem like the movie would be a blood bath so I was disappointed when the movies slows down shortly after. I thought the acting was good and the gore was good. The major complaint people have about this film, that it does not tell a great story about the main character..I agree with. I was wondering near the end of the movie (before the surprise twist) why the movie was called Leatherface. Speaking of the twist to the film .. I thought that was great because I can't remember the last horror movie I've seen that wasn't predictable. I'll go ahead and recommend this movie to horror fans. Watch with tempered expectations and you should enjoy.",Leatherface
149,sexbunny67,The greatest and darkest 'Texas Chainsaw' Film Yet!,10,22 September 2017,"HOLY SH*T, whoa. I just watched this movie and this was beyond spectacular! The darkest, most gut-wrenchingly icky version of the origin story EVER. I've gotta hand it to the make up/ special effects department on this one since it's absolutely and fantastically gory! Unbelievably R-rated to the maximum here (I mean it's already technically a foreign film!) There are many epic sequences of violence that are awesomely intense and graphic as hell (There's also a sex scene you'll NEVER be able to unsee). This film just drags the viewer through a metaphorical sludge of utterly disturbing character development and filth until the credits roll and it's perfect!Makes you seriously consider taking a shower after viewing, but I usually need one anyways. It's hard core realism like this that we need more of from Hollywood. I loved this and wanna watch it again now. It's like the very best of anything Rob Zombie has ever created and feels extremely disturbing along the exact same lines 'The Devils Rejects' did. THIS IS TOTALLY WORTH WATCHING for this is the chainsaw movie that us horror fans have all been waiting for!",Leatherface
150,johder,Don't bother,1,23 September 2017,Horrid. That is the best word to describe this 'prequel'. It completely destroys every previous time line and makes a complete mockery of the original films. Why it even got made in the first place is a mystery to me. Don't waste your time. Hopefully you didn't actually spend money to see it.,Leatherface
151,sb110882,i enjoyed the movie as a movie but it has zero ties to TCM,5,10 January 2018,"Okay, this movie was well done, it was fun and pretty exciting, the story was cool--- but it should not be called leatherface. because it HAS ZERO connections to texas chainsaw or leatherface... these charactors have aready had a backstory ex; jed was an unusual kinda inbred looking boy in the 2003 which took place in the late 60s early 70s... btu yet hes a teen / grown man in the 50s?? come on folks.... and leather-face, already had his back story told in the that he was born with some facial differences, in the 2006 film to a heavyset mother on the floor of a slaughterhouse in like the late 30s early 40s.., and he worked at said slaughterhouse as a teen and adult, until it went out of business in the late 60s... so these back stories have already been told, and also the time lines is all wrong for this latest movie, i am very disappointed because i think its misleading to say its part of the TCM series... no, its not, im sorry, it has no ties..... BUT that aside, it isa good movie and it is very entertaining, but it should be billed and promoted as a separate horror thriller movie, but it is by no means a prequel or has any real ties to the texas chainsaw / leather-face stories...it just doesnt",Leatherface
152,levelstudios,There a reason why this never made it to the theater,1,24 July 2018,"From the opening scene, it has the feel of a straight to digital movie. Stephen Dorff is awesome as usual, but aside from him, there isn't a single character to like or root for. I know these movies are gory but this one seemed a little over the top and unnecessary.",Leatherface
153,jillrefan1986,A Trip down memory lane with The Sawyers (SPOILERS),6,21 September 2017,"I was one of the many people who got to enjoy this through the Direct TV exclusive (but probably the only one who got it for free due to a glitch or because the service didn't recognize I rented the movie). I was really excited about seeing this movie for over a week. Sadly, it didn't live up to the expectations. Let's take a trip back down memory lane with The Sawyers.I first want to say that this review may contain *SPOILERS* and I will do my best to keep it to a minimum. The premise of the movie is that a few escape mental patients kidnap a nurse and take her on a trip to hell where we will learn who Leatherface really was as a child. The movie starts off in the 50's where we see a young Leatherface and family having dinner together. Which is a classic scene for anyone who knows and loves the TCM series, but soon after it starts to loose it's charm. After another scene, we skip to 10 years later where we meet our nurse, who is apparently new to the facility and wants to get to know the patients. We are then lead to feel that this nurse is going to be the saving grace and she will be the one to protect the Sawyer kids. It isn't too long that the patients start going crazy and all hell breaks loose!Let me start off with characters. I felt a little confused to who the characters were from 10 years ago, which the directors made sure to make you really think it over. Just when you think you figured out who the Sawyer children are, you are fooled later on in the movie. The two kids who are a couple really set the tone for the evil presents in the movie, but it's the other two kids who really take it to the next level and make you feel unsettled. The Nurse does a great job as her role and she does really make you feel her pain and suffering throughout the movie. Stephen Dorff who plays the sheriff, really makes you hate him, sorry to say. But one thing is that I am over the whole cops are the bad guys and the killers look awesome for hunting and killing the cops. This scenario is overused in horror movies anymore, but weather it's a statement or if it's just because the writers/directors think this is what audiences want to see, it just needs to stop for a while. I can think of 10 horror movies right off the bat that did this same technique and it just becomes a yawn. Vernon Sawyer doesn't see much of a huge role in this film entry, but her presence in this film was less than scary and just dull. I didn't know who were the other two Sawyers but they also didn't have much of a role in the picture, but when they were on screen, you knew things were going to get crazy! Moving on to story, it felt like it really dragged out at times. There was a lot of the patients wondering around and not so much killing. It doesn't really even fill in any information we already didn't know about Leatherface. We kind of get the same story with just a little bit of new information but nothing like ""ah...so that's why he was like this"" and in fact it raises more questions than answers (such as he was normal and talking as a kid that didn't want to follow Sawyers way, but 10 years later he just does?). We are also left wondering about 2 of the patients and their backstory which is never revealed in the movie. As far as the transformation from innocent kid to the insane killer, we are definitely given that information within the last 20 to 30 minutes of the film and it is pretty sweet. I was kept on the edge of my seat towards the end of the film and waiting to see if the Nurse gets away, but you'll have to see it for yourself and wonder if she does. All I can say is the ending was great!Finally, the gore factor! Some of the kills felt like they were just added so you wouldn't get bored of the movie, but others made you feel like ""oh....bleep!"". There is a lot of blood shed and some characters who you think would make it suffer in the worse way. The most intense scenes besides the chainsaw, was the characters who used guns and the beginning of the film. A lot of the kills weren't original but they did leave you want more gore.All in all, I might be missing the meaning behind the directors direction in the film and I really want to give the directors a chance because I heard the film Martyrs was excellent but this pretty much felt like a re-hatching of Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning. Which also confused me quite a bit as to the backstory. If the remake and the beginning were about the Hewitt family, than the original, Texas Chainsaw 3D and Leatherface are suppose to be about the Sawyers, do we just pretend 2 and 3 don't exist like The Next Generation? Also what happen to the men Sawyers from the original and why replace them basically with Vernon Sawyer? The film never really answered that question. I'm still giving the film a 6 out of 10, because the film is still enjoyable to watch but it is no masterpiece. Sadly, I really think the franchise is in trouble and either needs a whole entire reboot or a really good sequel that will make us happy.",Leatherface
154,karl_2897,Best Chainsaw film since the original,8,20 October 2017,"Leatherface is the new installment in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise and let me tell you that it is the best one since the 1974 classic. It's a prequel which I didn't like when I heard it, we've seen what happens when they try to explain much of the backstory of iconic horror characters. The best example is Rob Zombies's Halloween remake. Thankfully Leatherface doesn't make the same mistakes as did the Halloween remake they don't explain you much of Leatherface's childhood or any of that. The plot is fresh for a Chainsaw film, almost all previous films in the franchise have had the same plot, this one changes it and its quite interesting to see. There is plenty of gore in this film which is what I expect from a Chainsaw film and I was not disappointed, the performances were also good from everybody. Overall Leatherface is a nice addition to the franchise and it works perfectly as a prequel, you can watch it and then see the original and I think you will enjoy it even more. Forget Texas Chainsaw: The Beginning, because Leatherface is the true prequel.",Leatherface
155,abdulikram,Ignore bad ratings here,8,20 October 2017,"Wow lives up to its legendary original, really enjoyed this from start to finish. Enough gore! And entertainment! When you watch a movie in this genre aka slasher its just what you expect, gore stupidity with good production values. Ignore the reviews and judge for your selves. I did 😊",Leatherface
156,bartonconsultingvegas,Lily Taylor's performance is reason enough to watch!,10,23 September 2017,"This movie is a wonderful prelude to an already brilliant franchise of the horror genre. Lily Taylor demonstrates such a superb performance as the family matriarch. A family's misunderstood existence breeds both fear and hatred. A truly unique franchise that goes to show that blood is indeed thicker than water and there is no better way to serve revenge but ice cold and in the grinder. Much to look forward to is the rise of Leatherface! Bring on the next installment, we are waiting!",Leatherface
157,Eburon,"My thoughts on ""Leatherface""",8,1 July 2021,"I rated this film quite high. In fact I would never go above 9/10 for any film. Looking at the other reviews, I do get why ratings are not favourable in general. The fact of the matter is just I haven't watched ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" as of yet and thus I am not acquainted with any of these characters. I went in with no expectations whatsoever. As an origin story I think it is serviceable, but not the most intriguing out there I'd imagine.The film follows the lives of some young adults escaped from a mental institution called ""Gorman"", and a nurse they have kidnapped. They are on the run from the local police as they try to flee further away to freedom. We only spend a couple of days with the set of characters, but they are all very interesting and all actors give a very convincing performance. Especially the actor and actress that play Ike and Clarice are great in their roles of sociopath. As the film only takes place during a few days the plot moves fast and things start going south quite soon. I think, should the film have been longer, it would have given the opportunity to really flesh out Jedediah Sawyer's character arc, seeing as it is the whole point. But I'd also like to know more about the other characters. Especially Bud, who does seem to have an interesting past that is only hinted at. At the end of the day what drew me in is the story itself and I never felt bored during my time watching. Therefore I'm definitely recommending this to whoever hasn't seen the Texas Chainsaw Massacre yet.",Leatherface

162,HorrorClassic,"One of the BEST recent horror movies! Drama, Crime, and Horror!",9,18 January 2019,"I had major doubts about a new Texas Chainsaw movie, especially with ""leatherface"" being a teenager, but this movie exceeded my expectations big time!Leatherface feels like an adventure that you go along with, EXTREMELY brutal and bloody. I was definitely not expecting some of those kills. The acting is great from all the young actors and actresses, they play the roles convincingly. Its nice that this movie stays serious and has very little comedy. it keeps the tone great.The style and aesthetic of this movie makes it shine, from the way the kills are done, the angles, very original. Especially after the blonde girl is shot and it shows smoke coming out of her mouth, and in the diner when the guy shoots the waitress. They did not cut any corners lol.This is horror and a leatherface movie, but its almost like it could be multiple standalone movies, A crazy asylum, crime and drama running from the police, and then near the end it turns to horror. I was not expecting that ending with the nurse, and that is what makes this movie even better, its original and does its own thing. It also gives you an idea how the young man turns into leatherface from the trauma experiences he went through.They did a GREAT job with this movie and I would see it again for sure. This will be a cult classic in the future.",Leatherface

Despite its title it barely has anything to do with Leatherface himself. In fact, I didn't even know which character was Leatherface.

Watchable but forgettable.",Leatherface
166,londonannie,You call this a horror movie?!,3,14 October 2017,"This is a comedy, not a horror! Let's just forget that the setting of the story is in the 60s for a sec and they're all wearing millennial hill billy clothes, and tell me, just why in every single damn horror movie made after, let's say, 2005, has to have at least one pretty boy, at least one sexy girl, who like each other maybe too much (all reasoning aside) and an idiot that gets killed?Horror is something to feel in every second of the movie, not to be spooked by two or three gore scenes. Hellraisers, Poltergeist, Exorcist... those are horrors! This is stupid! You get two, maybe three (if the director is feeling generous)spooky (read: poop) scenes where you get a close up of a sexy girl walking backwards or looking around herself, only to find the bad guy directly behind her like he was waiting for her all night to come up at that direct spot where she landed. Yes, horror has to have s3x scene. ""That makes us money!"" The same watered down scenes with different actors (if I'm lucky), and the only reason I rated this as a 3, and not 1... is because of the dead body/sexy girl kiss scene that I laughed my bladder off!Do not waste money on this. I urge you. This rubbish has to stop!",Leatherface

I would not go into the theater expecting to see leatherface mess some people up the whole film, because it's not that; and I think that's why people seem to be disappointed by it. It's produced by Tobe Cooper so he obviously liked it enough to release it. When it started I got a sense that it was really thrown together out of the blue, they could of constructed it better and put more into it. For people talking about the mental hospital stuff with the nurse not being protected by security guards have obviously never seen what the inside of those hospitals look like. Because the nurses do stuff by themselves, they aren't followed by big strong men 24/7 lol. The movie was too short that is the only major flaw. I'd watch it again and I recommend it.",Leatherface
172,jediknight_1969,Deeply disappointing,3,24 October 2017,"If you film a story like this one, with one of the most insane, twisted, gruesome characters of all time, you need a deep psychological advised script. No way the character displayed on this movie could ever turn into the one portrayed by Gunnar Hansen in the original 1973 movie. This story needed to show the serious traumas that person could have suffered to become such a monster: not only a cold blooded killer but a grave defector and a cannibal. Nothing of that is here. Plus there is no continuity with TTChM: the beginning. Pity, because that one (at least) gave us a nice clue with the horrendous birth scene.OBS: the term ""bi polar disorder"" first appear in the scientific community in early 1950's.
