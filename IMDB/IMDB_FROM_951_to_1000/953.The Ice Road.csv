0,Leofwine_draca,Not bad for what it is,6,27 June 2021,"Another modern day action thriller with plenty of bad reviews. I'm convinced that audiences only care for superhero and comic book adaptations these days. In any case, THE ICE ROAD is influenced both by reality TV shows such as ICE ROAD TRUCKERS and the Friedkin classic SORCERER in the story of a convoy of trucks racing to rescue some trapped miners in an icy north Canadian province. A grizzled Liam Neeson heads the small cast, with the welcome Laurence Fishburne in support, and the acting is generally better than expected across the board. The film is over reliant on some slightly repetitive action scenes towards the climax (shades of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK) and has some very dodgy CGI at times, but otherwise it works quite well. It's fast-paced, character-focused, and has plenty of twists and suspense scenes which make it an amiable watch. Not a patch on SORCERER but not bad for a modern flick.",The Ice Road
1,SnoopyStyle,company non-sense,5,11 August 2021,"American trucker Mike McCann (Liam Neeson) is struggling to care for his mechanic brother Gurty (Marcus Thomas), a former soldier with brain issues. He gets a needed job opportunity from Jim Goldenrod (Laurence Fishburne). A diamond mine in northern Manitoba has a cave-in. Needed drilling equipment is getting trucked in over the ice road despite being weeks after the driving season. The ice is thinning and the operation is full of dangers. Tantoo (Amber Midthunder) is the third driver and Tom Varnay (Benjamin Walker) is the company man joining the trip.I don't see the premise making sense. There has to be an easier way to create a villain. As a cover-up, this is way too complicated and way too murdering. I do like the trucking action but the weird evil corporation makes no sense. The story could still work but it would work better with fewer bad guys. It's always weird when a random corporation has a professional hit team willing to kill on demand. It's also unnecessary to have the awkward underground drama. Keep it on the ice road. As for our main characters, there are a couple of uncomfortable scenes of Mike dealing with Gurty. Liam Neeson has an intensity which can translate into anger during times of frustration. That's a pitfall for him. All in all, the trucking action is better than I expected even with some pedestrian CGI but the story is much more problematic.",The Ice Road
2,classicsoncall,"""Mount up..., we're on a bull run!",7,10 July 2021,"Definitely a movie to set your rational brain aside and watch simply for the sheer fun of it. That seems to be Liam Neeson's forté lately, and he does it in overdrive in this flick. Call the movie bad if you want, but one has to marvel at the way the film makers produced all the disasters in the picture, the first of which removes Laurence Fishburne from the story in a pulse pounding scenario. I'm watching this with my wife and she's got a blanket over her face every few minutes trying to ward off the inevitable. The backdrop to the story involves corruption at a regional level in which a company skimps on methane detectors and pays its miners to shut off their sensors. The cave in that develops results in Neeson's character and his disabled brother (Marcus Thomas) in a high stakes race over the titled 'Ice Road' to deliver a wellhead that's needed to save the men from suffocating. Starting out they're not alone, but conspiracy and espionage undermine the effort and at the finale, it's a race to the finish that defies credibility, but you don't watch this for a credible story, just the adrenaline rush. The mission is completed successfully for the most part, but not without it's share of misery for the brother truckers.",The Ice Road
3,paul_haakonsen,"It is a long, cold haul...",6,13 July 2021,"I must admit that whenever Liam Neeson stars in a movie, then it is a movie that I feel that I must watch, because he definitely has a track record of some rather impressive movies these last many years.However, when I read the synopsis for ""The Ice Road"", I must admit that I wasn't exactly overly impressed. But still I sat down to watch the movie, as it had Liam Neeson in it, after all.And I must say that writer and director Jonathan Hensleigh actually managed to put together a good old fashioned thriller. And while the concept may have seemed a bit off, then it actually worked out well enough with having the movie take place in the frigid colds of northern Canada.The storyline told in ""The Ice Road"" is one that quickly lets its frostbite set in and director Jonathan Hensleigh doesn't let you go before the movie comes to an end. I have to admit that I was genuinely more than entertained by the story told in this movie.Needless to say that Liam Neeson does it quite well in this movie as well, of course he did. And he was joined by the likes of Marcus Thomas, Laurence Fishburne, Amber Midthunder and Benjamin Walker for a rather interesting and fast-paced thriller.""The Ice Road"" was definitely a surprisingly good movie, and it was one that provided me with proper entertainment.I am rating ""The Ice Road"" a six out of ten stars.",The Ice Road
4,sunwarrior13,Our Late Career Action Hero On A Rescue Mission,7,17 October 2021,"Even with an on-going pandemic, our late career action hero Liam Neeson will never be deterred for another of his typical action thriller for his fans in this movie known as ""The Ice Road"". Laurence Fishburne co-stars.In it,we get to see an ice road driver that must lead his team of drivers towards a rescue mission to save trapped miners. They contend with several obstacles to the success of the mission such as the ocean, wind,cold weather, and massive strom. He also has to have a team that have a set of problems with their own as individuals which would add obstacle to them working as a group. Later, they get to see that there is more obstacles that they have to contend with when they realized what the real villains are all about.As always, the movie was a typical of the ""Taken"" plotline just like most of the movies of our late career action hero in matters of storyline,predictability and contrivances. But nevertheless, Liam Neeson makes the movie serviceable as best being a talented actor that his fans continue to admire him as a late-career action hero that everybody loves. No question that Liam remains effective in these types of action thrillers and his fans (me included) will surely enjoy.",The Ice Road
5,zardoz-13,An Above-Average but Predictable Movie,7,24 August 2021,"Writer & director Jonathan Hensleigh's white-knuckled adventure yarn ""The Ice Road"" (**1/2 OUT OF ****), starring Liam Neeson & Laurence Fishburne, boasts enough thrills and chills to keep your attention as four intrepid truckers tread thin ice to haul heavyweight equipment to a Northern Canadian diamond mine. Twenty-six miners are trapped in a collapsed cavern gradually filling with deadly methane gas. Liam Neeson stars as one of the truckers. Each is transporting an 18-foot, 30-ton wellhead that cannot be flown into the remote camp. The truckers have a 30-hour window to reach the mine before permafrost kills the miners. In a violation of safety protocol, crooked site supervisors had convinced the miners to disable the methane sensors, so they could make bigger quotas. As a result, an explosion wrecks Tunnel Six, and the miners cannot escape. Literally, the clock starts ticking as the mining company orchestrates a rescue mission to deliver the equipment over treacherous ice roads into the mountains. Before they can start, the company must recruit drivers for what constitutes a suicide run. Since the ice is considerably thicker during the winter, the company drivers who usually ride these roads have a better chance of survival. Sadly, none are available, so the company must advertise for substitutes. Between the deadline and the deadly risks, the four drivers stand to bank $50 thousand each. If anybody dies, the survivors split those shares! While Mother Nature provides a formidable gauntlet, our heroes discover saboteurs had struck before they cranked up their Kenworth tractor-trailer rigs.Mike McCann (Liam Neeson of ""Honest Thief"") and his brother, Iraqi war veteran Gurty (Marcus Thomas of ""Drowning Mona""), who suffers from PTSD and aphasia evoke memories of the vintage 1937 John Steinbeck novella ""Of Mice and Men."" Like Steinbeck's migrant farmworkers George Milton and Lennie Small, Mike and Gurty are footloose vagabonds. Mike refuses to let others ridicule Gurty about his dire condition. After the mine caves in and the miners recover, ""The Ice Road"" shifts to a group of truckers bullying Gurty. They are tossing his Thermos among themselves just beyond his reach. The ringleader calls him a ""retard."" Gurty's older brother Mike intervenes. He decks the loudmouth ringleader with a punch in the nose. No sooner has Mike defended Gurty than their boss fires them. Meantime, Mike accepts an offer from Jim Goldenrod (Laurence Fishburne 0f ""The Matrix"") to steer a big rig out of season down an ice road. Mike brings along Gurty, a born mechanic, and Goldenrod asks Gurty to pull a rocker arm shaft. He times Gurty's performance. Gurty proves himself, and Goldenrod hires them. Goldenrod's plan calls for three drivers to drive three trucks down the ice road. He calls it ""tactical redundancy"" because he calculates at least one trucker will succeed. Goldenrod bails a Cree Indian activist, Tantoo (Amber Midthunder of ""Hell or High Water"") out of jail and commandeers the third truck himself. A last-minute passenger, Varney (Benjamin Walker of ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter""), an insurance agent, joins Tantoo for the ride.When they traverse the ice road, our heroes rely on bobblehead dolls mounted atop their dashboards to gauge their speed. Tantoo explains to Varney their quandary. If they drive too fast, they risk creating a pressure wave which will rupture the ice and deep-six the trucks. If they drive too slowly, the ice cannot withstand their weight and the ice will shatter like a smashed puzzle and swallow the truck. Occasionally, Hensleigh and ""American Sniper"" lenser Tom Stern heightens the dangers by filming the big rigs from under the thin ice of these fragile roads. Eventually, one of the rigs vanishes through the ice and drags a helpless driver to a frozen watery grave, while the two remaining truckers forge ahead, churning up considerable slush in their wake. When our heroes aren't contending with melting ice, they learn they have a saboteur among them. Predictably, the resourceful villains never let the heroes relax in their efforts to thwart them in this 109-minute, PG-13 rated suspense saga. Hensleigh doesn't squander a minute, and he stages some clever accidents with trucks jackknifing and flipping on ice. Comparably, ""The Ice Road"" is not as dramatically exciting as Neeson's 2019 actioneer ""Cold Pursuit."" Adrenalin-addicted, armchair action junkies who thrive on movies like ""The Wages of Fear"" (1953) and ""Sorcerer"" (1977), about truckers driving nitroglycerin on roads with craters, may find ""The Ice Road"" less exhilarating.A Netflix subscription is required to watch ""The Ice Road.""",The Ice Road
6,Calicodreamin,So bad,3,4 July 2021,Watching the ice road was like watching a movie in slowmo. The fight scenes were terribly coordinated and dragged out. For such a simple objective the actors spent a lot of time standing around and bumbling about. The script was poorly written and the plot was thin. Shaky science and lame CGI. A poorly made mess.,The Ice Road
7,ferguson-6,a particular set of driving skills,5,25 June 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Somehow, it's already time for Liam Neeson's semi-annual macho thriller. In this one, he gets to drive a big rig. Over a frozen river. He also gets to wear flannel, chew on a toothpick, and punch two guys (but no wolves) ... all while doing the right thing in order to save some trapped miners. And it's not about the money. Well, it starts out about the money, but in the end, it's not about the money!Neeson stars as Mike, a trucker whose spotty employment record is likely as much his own doing as it is that of his brother John/""Gurtie"" (Marcus Thomas), who is not just a super mechanic, but also a war veteran with some mental challenges. The VA hospital quickly diagnoses Gurtie with PTSD and prescribes multiple pills for him. Mike tosses out accusations and the pills, as the two brothers head to Winnipeg for a rescue mission.Jonathan Hensleigh also wrote and directed the 2011 film KILL THE IRISHMAN which I enjoyed. This time he serves up some nice opening shots that give us a real feel for the isolation and frozen tundra of the setting. When the mine collapses, trapping the workers, the oxygen clock starts, and Goldenrod (Laurence Fishburne) is charged with finding 2 other available and experienced truckers who can drive over the ice road and deliver the necessary equipment within 30 hours. Mike and Gurtie are chosen for one truck, and Tantoo (Amber Midthunder, ""Legion"") is chosen for the other. She has extra incentive, as her brother Cody (Martin Sensmeier, WIND RIVER, 2017) is one of the trapped miners.We do get brief segments with the miners, including Cody and Lampard (Holt McCallany, ""Mindhunter"") who are focused on saving as many men as possible. Of course, all of this is the fault of yet another big, bad corporation led by a profit-oriented GM (Matt McCoy, known by ""Seinfeld"" fans as Lloyd Braun). Along for the ride with the truckers is Varnay (Benjamin Walker, ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER, 2016), introduced as an insurance actuarial. And yes, there's more to his story.If you've ever seen ""Ice Road Truckers"" on the History Channel, you have some idea what's about to occur. Thrills, chills, and unforeseen obstacles come at a rapid-fire pace ... as if driving 75,000 pounds on 30 inches of slowly melting ice-covered rivers wasn't enough. This is a wild movie, so expect even more. The bobbleheads on the dash aren't just good luck charms, and everyone isn't who they seem. Big companies who cut corners and those who don't treat vets properly are the targets here, but it's to be enjoyed as a frigid and perilous rescue mission - and one more chance for Liam Neeson to prove he's a man's man.Available on Netflix beginning June 25, 2021.",The Ice Road
8,bombersflyup,Nope.,2,29 June 2021,"The Ice Road has a thin premise and thin characterization also.Now I liked 1977's ""Sorcerer,"" with Roy Scheider, but this is lackluster and PC. Dull characters, dull dialogue, dull sequences, entirely unevoking, it put me to sleep.",The Ice Road
9,mm-39,"Lame, but watchable!",6,14 October 2021,"Ice road truckers is a bit of a lame movie. More like the C B S Thursday night movie but Liam saves the film. Liam plays the flawed hero again with huge problems. The supporting cast is the redundant typecast characters. Evil business guy, evil insurance guy, trouble though gal etc. There is the the story development of how dangerous Ice road trucking added to a disaster movie story line. There is the conspiracy plot twist which is all so predictable. What makes Ice Road Trucker watchable is Neeson performance at his trade. Worth watching once!",The Ice Road
10,deloudelouvain,"Entertaining, with Liam Neeson, so no surprises here.",7,3 August 2021,"I don't agree with the negative reviews rating it the lowest score possible. For that there are countless worse movies than The Ice Road. I don't know what those people expect from a movie with Liam Neeson? Everybody knows exactly how a movie with him will end. Liam Neeson always wins so that's case closed. I thought the story was entertaining, with some good moments of suspense. Did it look realistic? No, certainly not. But it's a movie with Liam Neeson so what do you expect? I don't care about futile things like that, I just want entertainment, and that's exactly what I got.",The Ice Road
11,Cineanalyst,Ice Road Truckers Gets Carried Away,3,26 June 2021,"I have two main takeaways from this Liam Neeson action burger, ""The Ice Road."" One, they went overboard in trying to make the so-called ""reality"" show ""Ice Road Truckers"" exciting. And, two, there are easier ways to earn a buck. $50,000 for a couple days work isn't nothing, but when the job is described as a suicide mission, and it includes the clause that only the surviving workers split the payout--giving the perverse incentive to knockoff your coworkers--you might want to ask yourself if it's worth it. (And, geesh, it was like watching a heist flick with such assembling of the team and double crosses involved.) Moreover, that's the best bargain of the entire movie. Most of the rest of the cast do far stupider things for a bit of money.Long before the obligatory exposition dumps, it becomes readily apparent whom are the goodies and baddies. We go from ice road truckers racing against the clock to deliver equipment to rescue trapped miners, and not only is it past the season where it's relatively safe to drive on the ice roads, the wrench of sabotage is thrown in the works, and there's a bit of a drama over the miners arguing whether to kill off a number of each other so as to ration their air... and there's ice melting and breaking, storms approaching, but then it's getting too warm, and other people get trapped, equipment breaks, trucks get stuck, a bridge is strained under their weight, and dynamite, chases and an avalanche.I suppose it beats a scripted supposedly unscripted program with amateur actors yelling at each other, which is every reality show, instead of reliable professionals like Neeson, but it still comes across as desperate for attention. And what the heck is Laurence Fishburne doing in it. Oh well, I'm sure they were paid well. At least, it doesn't look like much of the budget went into visual effects or stunt choreography, and the score is generic and script riddled with clichés. What a waste of time.",The Ice Road
12,tabuno,A good first half that disappoints the rest of the way down,6,26 June 2021,"Liam Neeson stars in this action adventure about having to travel on the dangerous ""ice road"" in Alaska in a big rig in April in attempt to bring heavy equipment save some miners trapped by a terrible event. A fairly decent, captivating movie until the halfway point and then it becomes illogical and overextended, trying to do too much and inserting unrealistic, contradictory scenes that greatly diminish the entertainment value of the movie. [Spoilers: An Iraqi veteran who appears great with self-defense in an early scene then seems to forget how to fight in a later scene. Wasting time repairing one rig when another will do better. Needing an amazing thrilling avalanche when blowing up a road will do (how does one get back so fast to a snowmobile on foot anyway after surviving a crushing roll over roll crash in one piece?). And anybody with basic first aid training knows what to do if one gets punctured with a big object, except in this movie apparently. Then a villain able to just ride off in a rig that was left behind when it could have just been used to pull the load it was carrying in the first place instead of being switched out. The includes the ritual character sacrifices which in and of itself becomes pretty unbelievable considering supposedly how good these truck drivers are supposed to be. Even the climax is not well developed and cuts away from a death or live scene and instead waited too long for ""supposedly"" a better emotional impact.]. Even with the multitude of double-crosses that occur in this movie that bordered on unbelievable, the basic plot, direction, and acting held up pretty well until the chaotic, desperate effort to make the movie more than it could be. Instead the movie becomes a parody of itself. The movie ends up with just too much action of more or less crass thrills bunched up together making this movie more about quantity rather than taking the time to carefully craft more elegantly believable, on the edge of your seats sustained scenes. A good movie but a big disappointing last half of a movie. To avoid a rather tepid ending, audience members are greatly encouraged to watch instead Highway Thru Hell (2012 - Present, Television Series) a real documentary about real Canadian towing rescues rated an 8.1 on IMDb.",The Ice Road
13,ops-52535,extremely A-4 story...,7,28 June 2021,"Terribly scripted, and where against all odds oddly enough goes against the odd ones, where all happens without hesitations nor romance nor love , just a bunch of gritty ice truck drivers, ploughing their rigs through snow slush and ice, and where dying inside an ice sickle is considered to be the bravest way to die in these parts of america. It has an happy ending of course even though nearly all the heroes are deceased or badly damaged, but its the kind of stupid constructed ending that couldve made a film by itself. Its like the end of dantes peak and every other do or die movie, it flops like a bomb dive from 10 meters into your 3 feet AGP.But still it has got some nerve so its worth the time spent, even though some visual effects like taken outta toy story 1, i recommend youll devour this one with a whiskey on rotten rocks or ice or whatever. Liam neeson does still have some teeth left, just like the grumpy old man...",The Ice Road
14,cruise01,Feels like a cheesy 80s action film with entertaining action but forgettable script.,7,5 August 2021,3.5 out of 5 stars.The Ice Road is a pretty fair action film that brings Liam Neeson as a ice trucker. While on a desperate mission leading a convoy of ice truckers to deliver heavy cargo that can save several trapped miners.The film feels like a 1980s action film. Which is entertaining. Forgettable script and story. Just setting up things in motion with having Liam Neeson and his brother and two other truckers driving on icy roads. While facing against the icy backdrop. And a predictable bad guy that tries to sabotage there mission.The action sequences are exciting and thrilling throughout. Does get a little anticlimatic with Liam Neeson fighting the bad guy. And the visual effects were cheesy and terrible.Liam Neeson was decent with the character. Along with Lawrence Fishburne who had a forgettable role. Tantoo (Amber Midthunder) playing the other driver and on a desperate mission to save the miners. Her performance was also eh as well.The Ice Road has some entertaining action forgettable script and visual effects. May not be something memorable but does entertain for a short period of time.,The Ice Road
15,Floated2,Solid and thrilling,6,3 August 2021,Perhaps a lot of the negative reviews are from those whom expected a top heavy action film. This film takes it time to develop and build up and what we have is a very solid adventure type film with a lot of drama and light on action. Liam is his typical self while the character of Gurty arguably steals the show. Also Amber Midthunder does a very solid job as these type of roles she has done many times before.,The Ice Road
16,Tweetienator,No Candy Here,3,29 September 2021,"If the name Liam Neeson is thrown into the ring, I expect at least a solid action ride. The Ice Road is the first bad movie for quite some time I witnessed with starring Liam. The idea may not sound bad but the execution and storyline are not only unbelievable but bad too.

17,pmtelefon,The good outweighs the bad,8,24 July 2021,"Despite a few bumps in the road, ""The Ice Road"" is a lot of fun. The cast is good and the action scenes are really good. The story takes a turn or two it would have been better off avoiding but the actions erase most of those flaws. ""The Ice Road"" is a great looking movie with a very good premise and I was on the edge-of-my-seat most of the way. I'm not a big fan of Liam Neeson's movies but ""the Ice Road"" is a good one. I will be watching this one again.",The Ice Road
18,imseeg,Lacking punch...,5,5 July 2021,"I have seen ALL Liam Neeson movies and I watch every new one. Unfortunately this one is lacking punch. It is not a bad movie, simply never getting really suspenseful at all. Kinda boring to be honest, not something I wish for in an ""action"" movie...The bad: mediocre supporting actors, mediocre dialogue, mediocre photography, mediocre direction. Get the drift?Not any good? This is still a Liam Neeson movie in which he saves the day and becomes a hero. He is still the solid, good guy who will fight for the right cause.Not recommended though because there are many better other Liam Neeson movies out there.",The Ice Road
19,jtindahouse,Something a little bit different for Neeson and it works,7,25 June 2021,"For a little while there all Liam Neeson movies were starting to feel a little similar. Someone did him wrong, so he went out and took vengeance. It's a good basis for a movie, but it was getting a little tired. So even though it was a little disappointing to see a PG-13 rating attached to his new film 'The Ice Road', it was also good just to see him doing something slightly different - albeit with a hint of the old vengeance storyline thrown in for good measure.In spite of the PG-13 rating this may be one of the grumpiest characters Neeson has ever played, and that's saying something. He is a seriously angry man in this one. Early on he was actually particularly unpleasant. A character is making racist remarks right beside him, and instead of stepping in he basically goes along with it. There is almost no humour in this movie either. It takes itself very seriously.The film moves at a good pace. I was a little bit worried early on about how they were going to stretch a truck ride into a 104 minute movie. It really wasn't a worry though in the end. Throw in some major mishaps and a bad guy or two to throw some fuel on the fire, and you have yourself a pretty action-packed film.Some of the direction was a little choppy in some of the action sequences and I think they could have cleaned up some of the character development to make certain people more likeable. Otherwise though I had a decent time with 'The Ice Road'. 7/10.",The Ice Road

23,kluseba,Burning desire and duels in the ice and snow,8,27 October 2021,"The Ice Road is yet another action-thriller starring Liam Neeson in a typecast role he has played over and over again throughout the past two decades and counting. And this is perfectly fine.In this particular film, Liam Neeson plays a tough, resilient and generous truck driver who accepts the nearly impossible mission to deliver wellheads to a collapsed mine in northern Manitoba where workers are trapped and fighting for their lives. In addition to inclement weather and rapidly melting ice, parts of the mining company intend to sabotage the rescue mission by any means necessary. The truck driver needs to cooperate with his brother suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, a rebellious indigenous woman in constant conflict with the law and his severe but fair boss to save the workers under the most challenging circumstances.Even though the movie offers nothing new, it has been executed with great care which makes it one of the greatest genre entries in recent memory. It's very positive that an indigenous character is portrayed by an actual actress with indigenous heritage in form of the very convincing youngster Amber Midthunder. The idea to include a character suffering from multiple mental disorders adds a psychological depth that spreads the positive message that even people who are suffering from such illnesses are able to be clever, empathic and reliable heroes. The settings are excellent for this movie as it was shot in Manitoba and actually takes place in the Canadian province itself. Nothing is worse than movies that are shot in Toronto for monetary reasons but make you believe that the plot takes place in New York City. The movie convinces with excellent pace from start to finish without feeling rushed. The special effects are employed with care and feature truck chases, fist fights and explosions among many other elements. The light and sound effects blend in very well and are best enjoyed at your local cinema.Action-thriller genre fans should certainly appreciate The Ice Road for its characters, pace and settings. The movie is great at what it is without trying to add anything new to the genre. Grab some drinks and snacks, sit down with a few friends and enjoy this entertaining escapism on a slow evening.",The Ice Road
24,I_Ailurophile,"Far from perfect, but also better than I expected",8,1 July 2021,"Bless you, Liam Neeson.The man has been a workaholic in recent years - for very understandable reasons - leading to a late career resurgence as a minor action hero. That work ethic is a double-edged sword, as great quantity is no guarantor of quality. Thankfully, despite great imperfections, 'The ice road' is highly entertaining, and certainly among Neeson's more memorable recent features.It's worth noting the very first impressions we got, before the feature even premiered. The initial trailer immediately imparted that this was essentially ""Ice Road Truckers: The Movie,"" much to my amusement. And then I looked up writer-director Jonathan Hensleigh. He contributed to no small number of 90s action blockbusters - and most noteworthy of all was his writing credit for 'Armageddon.' If the trailer for 'The ice road' most readily recalled a reality TV program, a close second recollection was Michael Bay's star-studded apocalyptic marathon, especially in regards to the assemblage of a qualified team.The movie suggested by the trailer would have been an absolute blast. I'm pleased to say that the film as a whole takes a slightly different tack, and is better for it.To be clear, this is 100% a Liam Neeson action thriller. There are expectations and allowances that are inherent in that nature, and 'The ice road' definitely meets them by being rather heavy-handed and ham-fisted in the dialogue, and in the screenplay generally. This is particularly true nearer the beginning, before the action starts to kick up; it definitely feels like early scenes were forced through a bit haphazardly in the writing to get all the more quickly to the thrills.To that point, too, the escalating trials of the characters, and the dangers they face and survive, begin to wear on our suspension of disbelief after a time. None of this is helped by the fact that, for the first time in a long time among any movies I've watched, 'The ice road' employs one of the most tired, antiquated, and stereotypical tropes in cinema.All of that having been said - this is of a considerably better quality than I anticipated.Characters are fleshed out more completely than I could have guessed. While the picture moves along quickly, the sequence of events (however questionably intensifying) seems plausible in-universe, and scenes are written well. The thrills herein aren't ""edge of your seat"" nail-biters, but are suitably captivating. There is no posturing, no unseemly emphasis on grand heroics, no highfalutin celebration or finale. Even as suspense ramps up or decelerates as is emotionally appropriate from one scene to the next, the flow of the narrative is consistent in tone, and the ending is satisfying without being overdone.Moreover, for a film-maker best known for over the top action flicks, Hensleigh captures some shots as director that are particularly eye-catching. He's no slouch; nor is anyone involved in the production, as everything looks and sounds great from start to finish. I quite enjoy the original score from composer Max Aruj. Neeson's performance is of the exact caliber one should expect, if you've seen even one of his movies in recent years - purposefully rough, gritty, and hard-bitten, but solid. Laurence Fishburne is fine for the time he has on-screen; Benjamin Walker's relative stoicism feels appropriate for the character he's given.Among the cast I'm most impressed here with Amber Midthunder. Her turn as Tantoo is only a supporting role, but she carries a fiery passion and resolute presence that perfectly matches the enjoyable and commendable spitfire attitude of the character. I don't think it's unfair to say that Tantoo as a character, and Midthunder as an actor, stands out especially tall from what 'The ice road' has to offer.No one is ever going to mistake this for an award-worthy instant classic. This belongs squarely in a certain niche genre, beholden to a particular class of modern action hero, and these qualities together mean the film is sure to deserve criticism, but be solid nonetheless. Yet to be fair, it also never has any intentions of being anything else. Either this is the type of film you enjoy, or it isn'tGeneral audiences may or may not engage with it as much depending on personal preference, and the question mostly comes down to whether you're a Liam Neeson fan, specifically, or are broadly just looking for a fairly well-made action thriller. 'The ice road' certainly seems to me to be a hair above many of its contemporaries, and is worth watching if you're not especially picky with your tastes in cinema.",The Ice Road
25,masonsaul,Weak action thriller,4,18 July 2021,"Whilst it's not completely incompetent and pretty enjoyable, The Ice Road is a weak action thriller that's extremely predictable, forgettable and dumb. The action scenes are constantly ruined by consistently truly awful CG. The villians are terrible and it's pretty dull with a slow start but thankfully short run time. However, Liam Neeson gives a reliably great lead performance and Marcus Thomas and Amber Midthunder are both really good. The music by Max Aruj is also really good.",The Ice Road

27,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Ice Road,5,3 July 2021,"""Told you this wasn't gonna be easy"". That's a line from 2021's The Ice Road. Yup, suicide missions with trucks are never easy. You could honestly go under the crackling verglas at any moment.So yeah, ""Ice Road"" is about a forlorn ice driver who leads a crew over a frozen ocean to rescue some trapped miners in northern Canada. Liam Neeson stars and that extends his record of films that take place in the winter months and/or are released in the winter months. What can I say, Neeson just digs that frigid air. He also likes to appear haggard and 5 o'clocked as he gives us that Neeson, obligatory badass moment (a dude falls smack-down to the ground with one punch).Released in June of this year, distributed by Netflix, and featuring a brief screen appearance by Laurence Fishburne, The Ice Road is basically rawhide Neeson-ed personified. Yeah there's action but the polar discord aspect overtakes everything. Liam Neeson is the do-gooder, the scruffy dude with nothing to lose, the Irishman, and the Everyman. If you seen a lot of his movies (and I have), you're pretty much getting type-casting 101.But wait, ""Ice Road's"" director (Kill the Irishman's Jonathan Hensleigh) is the culprit here, not Neeson. Badly borrowing chase clips from The Fast and the Furious and The Road Warrior, he lets his scenes go on far too long. Yeah the flick does its ice trucking research and there's a few conflicting moments. However, things just never shift into second gear (that's a blatant rig reference). It also doesn't help that Max Aruj's musical score is over-dramatic and straight from the land of direct-to-video. I mean why be so serious and so slog-y at the same time. You could've had ""ice"" instead of 108 minutes of ""vanilla"".",The Ice Road
28,elliotjeory,Run of the mill action film,5,10 July 2021,"A pretty tame movie compared to Liam Neeson's previous work. It's not a bad film, it's just not great. The story could of been a bit better, apart from Lawrence Fishburne, there wasn't any likeable characters.The action was mediocre and its an ideal film to pass the time.",The Ice Road
29,arungeorge13,Yet another addition to the list of generic Liam Neeson actioners! [+47%],5,26 June 2021,"At this point, Liam Neeson is basically taking up every one-line plot that can be stretched into a 90-100 minute actioner. I'm not sure how many more of these he will keep churning out year after year, playing slightly different iterations of the same character - always a savior of someone, of people. The action itself features plenty of awful CGI and generic staging (corrected below). Apart from its intriguing icy backdrop, everything else (including performances, storytelling and thrills) is super basic. At 69, Neeson still looks the part of a very manly man who does manly things during high-risk situations. How I wish he went the Tom Hanks route instead and portrayed characters with vulnerabilities of his own!Update: I read that the crew employed practical effects (as opposed to CGI) to mount the action sequences, which is commendable.

Hardly any characterization and just another in a growing line of snoozers from the once venerable Mr Neeson.It seems his glory days of Taken are over and it's Vanilla thriller, all beige on the page with nothing to recommend or inspire - very sad to see such a good actor take guff like this when he might actually make a good James Bond even at his age!",The Ice Road

But good thing is realistic viewpoint on life, especially survival in various ways. I related to disability, relationships, joblessness and homelessness, or such possibilities. Also I related to experience with psychiatrists and mental hospitals. This movie is so bare and so real. It shows common problems that are present around us as we watch it, like corruption, disability, accident, enemy, money... Good inspiration for fighting for survival. High presence of nature, stunts, devices, wounds, so very graphic. Bit too negative.",The Ice Road
35,IonicBreezeMachine,"Neeson is as reliable as ever, but The Ice Road's premise is so thin it hurdles through multiple hoops to justify itself.",5,25 June 2021,"Following a methane explosion at the Katka Mine in Northern Manitoba that leaves 26 miners trapped with only 30 hours of Oxygen, the company contracts truckers to deliver the needed the equipment for the rescue consisting of consisting of brothers Mike and John ""Gurty"" McCann (Liam Neeson and Marcus Thomas), Tantoo Mantooth (Amber Midthunder), and Jim Goldenrod (Laurence Fishburne) must traverse not only the treacherous ice roads, but the unscrupulous mining company that is betting on them to fail.Written and directed by Jonathan Hensleigh and starring Liam Neeson, The Ice Road is the latest action film featuring Neeson and taking inspiration from the ice road trucking industry that uses Lake Winnipeg and Lake Manitoba in the winter months as well as the long running History reality series Ice Road Truckers. In an interview with BTLNews Hensleigh stated his intention was to create a modern day take on Wages of Fear that substituted the Andes Mountains for Manitoba Ice Roads, and while Hensleigh has assembled a capable cast and some fleeting moments of tension the material is so thin and the stakes and characters aren't hefty enough to support them.Neeson does well playing a world weary long haul trucker who has to care for his PTSD ridden brother and it seems like there's a pretty strong foundation to build on there (even if it does feel very Rainman in its execution) and Amber Midthunder's Tantoo is perfectly capable playing a more inexperienced trucker in contrast to Neeson. Laurence Fishburne is barely a factor in the plot as he's on screen maybe 10 minutes before being unceremoniously killed off and his function is basically just to get the ball rolling plotwise and doesn't give Fishburne much of a chance for an impression. Of course the movie isn't actually interested in exploring characters as it's shot, paced, and written like a typically action thriller. There's nothing wrong with making an action thriller, but if your premise isn't designed for extended action set pieces (such as the movie's inspiration Wages of Fear) then it leads to some rathe large leaps in logic to justify action sequences such as a conspiracy plot that is arguably more of a threat (and with more screen time) than the titular Ice Road. Once the conspiracy is revealed this basically just becomes another Taken-esque Liam Neeson action performance complete with a variation on ""It's personal"" line that I'm actually amazed is here since years of parody seem like that cliché should've been put out to pasture along with ""red wire or green wire?""The Ice Road has a few entertaining moments, but it's a strictly paint by numbers affair that is rather limited in what it can do in action setpieces with trucks and doesn't have strong enough characters to work on that level. It'll kill time for 100 minutes, but no guarantee you'll remember it.",The Ice Road

41,kuarinofu,A mix between Cliffhanger and Die Hard but with trucks,5,27 June 2021,"The Ice Road is a very bizarre film.The script feels very dated like it was written in the early 2000s or so.The description on the IMDB page does not reveal even a small fraction of what happens in the film.The film has everything, evil corporates, superhuman henchmen, impossible physics, and more.The first couple of scenes are bizarrely acted and just push expository dialogue, so I thought this was going to be a basic moderately-budgeted production of a survival type of story.But it's much more than that, and the film never ends, it just goes on and on and on.The evil corporate plan is stupid enough, but the ending solidifies the cheese. It's so laughable it almost feels like it was written by a kid.Some of the scenes are quite tense, although barely believable, and this makes the film at least watchable.I enjoyed all the trucker's stuff, yet I don't think miners would enjoy being treated like this. They are tough guys, but in the film, they act like it's their first day, and make absolutely nonsensical decisions. Their dialogue is also very cringy (and they don't exhale steam in a frozen mine, but it's ok).This would've been a stupid action film you could watch when there is nothing else to do, but the overcomplication of the story and all the stupidity makes it hard to enjoy.And yeah, the CGI is very noticeable, I don't know if it was easier to make it more practical, but this kind of CGI just hurts to watch.",The Ice Road

North Dakota...Liam Nelson returns with another action flick, but this time, he played a driver with a brother who had fluent aphasia. Now they had to team up with others to rescue a group of miners stuck in a mine, while discovering sketchy stuff about the company that hired them.The story had a unique premise. Driving truck carrying heavy stuff through ice should make for fun and intense thriller. For the most part, I did find some scenes entertaining, especially near the first half. The ice and the bobbleheads were used pretty well to create tension.Liam Neeson was pretty okay in the movie. There wasn't much action for him to do, and the dialogues were also mediocre. There were other big actors in the movie, although there's also wasn't a lot for them for work with. Because of this, I didn't really care much for the characters. They were straightforward and predictable.This is the same with the plot. Despite the unique setting, the progression was typical of an action movie. If you watch many actions movie you would already figure out who the bad guys are. The pacing was dragging and slow. I honestly thought the movie already finished 20 minutes before the actual ending. There were stakes in the movie, but I felt bored because I already knew how it would end.The worst aspect was the effect. The fire, explosion, and snow looked very cheap and were obviously fake.

45,trinaboice,Puts the CHILL in Netflix and Chill,4,30 June 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
This dramatic action thriller is now available on Netflix. I confess that I'm a Liam Neeson fan. I also readily admit that this is a pretty silly movie, but still liked it because Liam Neeson is in it. After a remote diamond mine collapses in far northern Canada, a 'big-rig' ice-road driver must lead an impossible rescue mission over a frozen ocean to save the trapped miners.THINGS I LIKED:
At first, I laughed when I thought that the aging Liam Neeson was going to be conveniently seated in a truck during the entire movie, but he actually has a lot of stunts and does what he does best: kick bad-guy butt. He's great at playing the Everyday Man with a heart...and a certain set of skills.I don't think I've seen Benjamin Walker in anything since Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.Amber Midthunder plays Tantoo and was actually in Liam Neeson's most recent film The Marksman. She played the gas station clerk who gave him the roadmap for free. I didn't recognize her at all.The movie was filmed in Manitoba, Canada.I never knew ice roads over the water were a thing. Wow. Yikes! I thought it was funny when each of the truck drivers placed a bobblehead on their dashboard. Then, I learned the toys actually served a serious purpose.I always love it when movies show the Aurora Borealis in the sky. Seeing that in real life is on my Bucket List! I had to cancel a trip to see it when Covid broke out, but I'm now rescheduled to see it by the end of this year! We're going to Iceland!THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
I thought the movie would be much better because it also had Laurence Fishburne in it. What is it lately with Hollywood stars showing up in terrible movies?Did you know Marcus Thomas, who plays Gurty in the movie (Liam Neeson's brother) was born in Belgium? Unfortunately, he sure doesn't know how to pick the right scripts. All but 2 of his movies have terrible scores on Rotten Tomatoes.Some of the acting is pretty bad.I don't know anything about ice road trucking or mining and even I knew how they portrayed those industries in the movie didn't seem accurate.I couldn't understand a single word Amber Medthunder said during the entire movie. She spoke super fast and slurred her words so much that it was annoying and then became laughable. Terrible casting.Some bad CGI moments with obvious green-screen shoots.Very predictable.Terrible script with completely unrealistic scenes that defy the rules of physics.Awkward dialogue.My husband and I laughed out loud many times because the movie is so bad. Still, laughing together is always time well spent.Unfortunately, it will be instantly forgettable.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

I can say this was the only down side to this movie. I was upset when Mr. Fishburne was tied up and no one thought to get out and help him until the very end when the girl cut the rope.

54,stevenrotherforth,A movie that will make you pray for global warming!,4,1 July 2021,"The Ice RoadMovie 4/10The Ice Road comes to Amazon Prime free as part of your subscription. Which is just as well because you would be pretty annoyed if you had paid extra for this below average movie experience.Jonathan Hensleigh writes and directs this tedious bore which is basically Ice Road Truckers the movie. Starring Liam Neeson in yet another dial it in performance there's not much I can say to big this movie up.A bunch of truckers need to get some parts over the icy wilderness (which is melting) to a collapsed mine in order to save another bunch of people. Labelled as an action thriller there's certainly nothing thrilling here. The action scenes are mediocre at best with some good stunt work involving large trucks sliding around on ice. The climatic fight scene with Neeson and the generic villain looks like two pensioners squabbling over arthritis medication. Sadly the whole movie is hard to sit through with some cheesy dialogue, minute by minute exposition ( treating the audience as if they are stupid) and lots of implausibility. It's not Fast & Furious levels of silliness but many a scene are hard to swallow. Particularly the one where our two heroes plunge into sub zero waters and emerge bone dry without a single shiver! Neeson may be charismatic but even he fails to light up this dimly lit picture.Picture quality 6/10As aforementioned the image quality is dark. Many scenes are crushed with shadow detail being nonexistent. Presented in 4K with High Dynamic Range this is the first time I have encountered a movie to look worse because of HDR implementation. The scenes inside the collapsed mine are mostly unfathomable. Even day time scenes fail to reveal any detail on the likes of clothing etc. There's the odd cinematic landscape shot that looks crisp but overall the image quality is disappointing.Sound quality 7.5/10Thankfully audio fairs much better. Prime Video are still behind their rivals. There's no object based audio here. A Dolby Atmos sound mix would have elevated the experience but for some reason Amazon are hesitant to offer the format. Still the 5.1 mix on offer gets the job done with some tremendous low frequency effects. The avalanche scene will shake you off your couch providing your subwoofers are up for the challenge. Surround sound effects are steered wonderfully creating an immersive experience. My only gripe is that Max Aruj's musical score can become overpowering and sometimes drown out the cheesy dialogue. Actually wait no that's probably not a bad thing!Final ThoughtsIce Road is one of those throw away movies. Sadly Neeson seems to be in too many of them these days.

I can normally accept it and imagine their final product as intended, but in this case, it is a detriment to the movie. Not only because of visuals, but because it is a tell that the things that will happen.. would normally wouldn't or it would be too expensive too shoot, ruining the experience.I feel like an average score is well deserved due to some scenes that feel weird, strange delivery from the cast, and general tone.

61,ginocox-206-336968,Wokeful pandering shatters willful suspension of disbelief,4,29 June 2021,"The Ice Road (2021) has some excellent elements, including Liam Neeson's performance, but squanders much of its potential with a series of tediously obvious efforts to appease the woke crowd, which shatter the audience's willful suspension of disbelief to remind them of the current socio-political debates they go to the movies to escape.The cast is diverse to a fault. Laurence Fishburne is the token black, channeling Morpheus as a sort of mentor character. Marcus Thomas represents the disabled community as a character with a sort of nebulous disorder that seems to morph to fit the exigencies of the script. At times he's developmentally impaired, autistic, a savant, or suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder; while at other times, he seems unimpaired. As there is no conventional B-story with a love interest, the buddy relationship between protagonist Mike (Neeson) and brother Gurty (Thomas) substitutes. The lone female in a key role is played by Amber Midthunder representing the BIPOC community as a Native American. As this film is first a tribute to wokefulness and second an action-adventure, she can't be a babe, like Raquel Welch in Fantastic Voyage. Instead, she is tough and independent, with a generous sprinkling of misandry, and fiercely committed to fighting for social justice.The villains are corporate executives who have retained a cadre of homicidal psychopaths. The villains are white, male, middle-aged, and clearly non-inclusive, as corporations would never engage in skullduggery if their boards of directors were more diverse. Considerable attention is devoted to a situation in which democracy fails and survival depends upon reliance on Pelosi-style autocracy.The movie could not be more obvious in its efforts to pander to proponents of wokeful ideology if it filled the screen with stock images of melting celluloid and cut to an image of velvet stage curtains parting as the director walks onto stage to announce that the movie is being interrupted so the filmmakers can present their homework assignment from an online community college course in social justice taught by professor emeritus Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It's as if the filmmakers feel compelled to compromise their script and casting decisions to conform to an woke version of the Hays Code.Despite the tedious and distracting proselytizing, the film has its moments. It explores the lives of an obscure and relatively unknown group of truckers with credible detail. The special effects are excellent. There is a lot more action than one might expect.But the audience is left to wonder how much better the film might have been if it had focused on entertainment, rather than indoctrination.",The Ice Road

63,movieman6-413-929510,Thrilling rescue mission across unstable ice roads.,6,22 August 2021,"The Ice Road is a new action thriller directed and written by Jonathan Hensleigh, the director of The Punisher and Bulletproof Gangster. This film has only been his first work as a director in ten years.In the film, when a mine collapse occurs in remote northern Canada, miners are trapped. Jim Goldenrod (Laurence Fishburne) must now arrange the suitable drivers to bring trucks of rescue equipment to the mine to save the miners before they run out of oxygen. For the mission, he finds drivers Mike McCann (Liam Neeson) with his war-traumatized brother Gurty (Marcus Thomas) and ex-con Tantoo (Amber Midthunder). This group must embark on a journey across unstable expanses of ice, over which they must travel in heavy trucks before it is too late for the miners.Despite some unnecessary long scenes in the beginning, this film manages to provide an exciting film. Under time pressure, the characters must travel through unreliable ice nature reserves, where the smallest mistake can break the ice. This way the film manages to maintain a good tension.The ice nature reserves are depicted in an appropriate way. Unfortunately, the visual effects are disappointing when there is an explosion or breaking ice in the film. This makes the film lose some of its credibility.Most of the film cast also all deliver good and appropriate acting. Due to the size of the cast, they also provide a bit more tension, because there are more characters who probably won't survive the trip over the teetering ice roads.",The Ice Road

-The crux of the initial incident occurs when a worker who should be safety focused casually throws a metal tool on power lines,
-That's not what aphasia is; Aphasia is not a cognitive disability, it is a neurological disorder,
-That's not what PTSD looks like,
-That's not what bullies are in the real world,
-Those shots of Winnipeg looked like a town of 1500 (wtf?!),
-Those aren't the test people are put through to qualify for supports if they have cognitive disabilities (which again, this character should not have if all he has is aphasia,)
-You can't domesticate rats,
-That's not what happens when ice roads collapse; ice cannot bend like waves without breaking,
-They were too lazy to use actual morse code so they invented ""tap code"" for the movie,
-Every bit of it that referenced anything aboriginal was racist and terrible,
-When big rigs tip over there is glass damage,
-That's absolutely not what triage is in hospitals; triage is not executing the sick,
-The suggestion that discussing murder with management somehow makes it not murder is an offensive as the depictions of disabilities,
-The suggestion that management would simply go ""wow crazy,"" instead of immediately ordering that no murders take place is as stupid as adding any elements of double cross,
-CPR does not bring people back to life,

There are a lot of little things that further the plot while simultaneously making the common non-trucker viewer think ""oh, that's neat.""

It's on *my* list of classics. This is nominally an action/adventure, but it is truthfully a *yarn*. A yarn is an old-fashioned sort of movie concept.

82,JurijFedorov,Why the low rating here? What's going on?,7,9 October 2021,"I see that this movie is panned HARD by reviewers and basically called a cinema mistake and users are not much better at all and seem to hate it even more. What's going on? I swear I watched the same movie this is a perfectly acceptable action flick that's way above average. This is even above average if you just take the Fast and Furious movies that have some huge duds among them. I frankly don't know what's going on here. It's not just me liking the movie I'm telling you there is nothing bad or terrible about this at all. I love action movies so I know what it takes to make a good one. Obviously this is for men seeking a simple A to B story with some clear action plot and some dramatic scenes. It's not some huge melodrama gunning for an Oscar. This is a simple guy flick. I get why you can't rate these kind of movies high, but in this genre this is one of the good ones compared to the average. It's a ton of fun and you just keep watching.Let's take the acting. The acting was great! Every single actor was good. The active bad guy was amazing in the role. This is Bond villain level acting. The 2 brothers are amazing. The chick is very good, super charismatic and suffers with her whole body so that you believe she is hurting. One actor was a bit below par, but nothing cringe at all. The dialogue is direct and plot focused, but never rushed of false. The acting overall here has no reason to be close to this level. This is a silly action movie yet everyone gives their all. Why is that? I frankly don't know, but they do. This is not just my opinion. Watch it and see for yourself. It's very emotional and has a lot of deep scenes in it.The plot is great! A to B with a ton of complications. What else do you ask for? You will like this if you love action. This is fun to watch no matter what else it is.Now, it's not an amazing movie by any means. The biggest issue is the editing. The action scenes are a bit overedited. We get short cuts and it's hard to fully enjoy the scenes as we see a lot of small cuts and fast pace. It's rushed for sure. It needed to be 10-15 minutes longer with the current scenes. A great shame, but even so the action is fun to watch. If they had edited it properly it would easily be a 8/10 movie.Then the plot, it's frankly a bit lacking. Not in that the story is not great, it is great. It just kinda jumps away from explaining everything. We kinda see things happens and then see the outcome. But there is a bigger plan here we don't clearly uncover. I think any viewer would have loved for it to get somewhere here. Create a new love relationship, solve old conflicts, get into the news, make some super happy. Instead it kinda goes in the opposite direction and doesn't want to solve anything so you wonder why all of that was set up if they don't bother going anywhere with it? This is why I can't rate it an 8. You'll understand my point after you see the ending. You get very emotionally invested, but the ending is lacking compared to the setup.Overall this is a fun small action flick that for action fans should be something you'll watch if you want some basic fun. It's not some classic, but it is quite the experience. It's not just me saying this because I love some specific thing about the movie. It's not nearly as bad as the rating makes it out to be, I swear. I do understand it's not amazing. But if you watch the trailer you will see EXACTLY what you get. You won't feel cheated in any way. Watch the trailer. If you think it looks fun then watch it. Why is this so hard? Who is watching this needlessly and hating on it?",The Ice Road

Had any of them watched even a season of Ice Road Truckers (real Ice Road Truckers), they could have avoided that. That being said, for those of us who watched the entire movie, it was quite good. There was the love and loss of a brother. The saving of yet another brother. Tales of bad guys. Tales of hardworking 'salt of the earth' guys. I really enjoyed. And, I'm one of those guys who worked on the big pipeline out there in my youth. So, I'm actually familiar with the environment there and the people who work the area.

The mission is sabotaged by the greedy owners of the mine who don't want evidence that they were not following safety measures and are responsible for the explosion and cave in that trapped the miners.In a nutshell this isn't a good movie in any way. It started off by trying to introduce some weak character development and then it slowly progresses into ludicrous action that makes no sense whatsoever. There are so many things that happen that range from implausible to impossible like one of the villains tumbling down a mountain, getting on a snowmobile, overtaking the protaginists and then setting off an avalanche to kill the protagonists. They survive obviously and there is more fighting. Another trucker gets a tree branch imaled into her chest but she is practically unharmed by it. Two truckers fall through the ice, get out and warm up in the truck as if it wasn't a big deal. And it goes on and on like that until the end. The acting is more or less passable, the CGI is not great but it could be forgiven if the story wasn't so dumb and illogical.

Baby boomers refuse to accept their age and look so stupid trying to pretend they don't have osteoporosis and stiff joints. They refuse to turnover the reins to the next generation and won't even stop making these ridiculous geriatric ""action"" films.Previous generation actors grew old gracefully and began accepting age appropriate roles. Robert Redford is a prime example of an actor who had no qualms with playing age-appropriate roles.Rather than be the beat cop older actors began playing the seasoned sergeant. Rather than be the private they played the captain then major then colonel. I love how Redford aged so gracefully in his roles vs forever trying to recapture his youth. Neeson could learn a lot from this and other examples.Sorry old people. I love you and appreciate your contributions, but age is more than just a number. You do not see sixty year old professional football players for a reason.

106,ramblingvagabond,Nice Action Flick,6,4 July 2021,"But I gotta wonder....where does a mining company come up with so many goons willing to commit murder on their command? I mean seriously, the willingness to kill someone isn't something most people have. But apparently when companies are constantly portrayed as evil by hollywood, the writers just assume everyone who works for big company is a murderer.And since we know those writers are never original, we know they believe in the power of the ""super duper bad guy"" who never dies the first time you try to kill him. Or the second or third time, either. He usually takes several tries, and normally will only die at the very end, at the very last second, when all hope is lost, and with a final dramatic one-liner from the hero. ""Freeze this, loser!"" or ""Sink this, meanie!""It started great but got more and more ridiculous as it went on.

But both seem to love the 1-man-show kind of films which have absurd and nonsensical stories.The Ice Road is...just another Liam Neeson movie. Obviously Nick Cage would have liked to be in this one, but Liam got there first.Realism went for vacation here. Trucks and truckers after having seen this film are probably furious with these completely wrong and unbelievable scenes.But, that's the Hollywood magic.So folks this ain't a documentary but an action film set in cold Canada involving trucks, mines, bad people and ice roads.In fact, it's an enjoyable action flick.It needs to be seen with the right amount of patience, to go through all the silly dialogue moments and the unreal truck scenes.Maybe the cinema experience helps too.So, switch off and you might actually enjoy it.5,9/10.",The Ice Road
108,waltermwilliams,Liam Neeson has acquired skills,6,19 August 2021,"I'm giving ""The Ice Road"" 6 stars out of 10 for the Action, Adventure, Drama, Stunts, Ice and Liam Neeson.Liam Neeson has acquired skills over a very long acting career.There's no truth in the rumour Neeson uttered this line in this movie and it got cut in the edit, ""I will look for ice, I will find ice and I will chill you.""
Honestly I was half expecting Neeson in the lead role of an episode of ""Ice Truckers"", but this is a big movie for the big screen not just 7's digital channel Mate.And if I am brutally honest I would have watched the tall Irishman in any movie he lends his name too.By the way is it just me or did Liam say recently ""The Marksman"" was going to be his last action hero role as a 69 year old Movie Superstar?Yet here he is again sliding down the Ice Roads of frozen tundras of Oceans in Manitoba using the biggest product placement of all time for Kenworth Trucks.Heck there's even a brochure for these massive Prime Movers pictured in several scenes.In this rollercoaster ride there is a race against time to save nearly 30 Diamond Miners trapped deep underground in far Northern Canada.Three Big Rig Ice Road Drivers form a hand-picked team to deliver a payload and try and save the day on this suicide mission...made yet even more difficult by corporate greed.Mike McCann played by Neeson couples with his PTSD Veteran brother Gurty (Marcus Thomas) who lives with Aphasia.Playing veteran trucker Jim Goldenrod is Laurence Fishburne and his protesting ex-employee, Tantoo, who needs bail money before she can even join the team to brave the elements.Amber Midthunder, who plays Tantoo also worked with Liam on his previous 2021 film ""The Marksman"".Together they are faced with the challenges of thin melting ice, arctic blizzards, rickety bridges, avalanches, greedy management, sabotage and more.Actor Benjamin Walker as Tom Varnay, a seemingly innocuous insurance man, makes a great, almost unstoppable villain.He also played a younger version of Liam in the 2004 movie ""Kinsey"".This time they get to battle it out on ice as arch enemies...get ready to rumble!Even though he's a prolific screenwriter this film sees Jonathan Hensleigh back in the directors chair for the first time in ten years when ironically enough he created ""Kill the Irishman""...which a lot of people try to do over nearly 2 hours.The ""Irishman"" also starred Thomas.Country music fans will love the films soundtrack full of Country and American song book classics.Autobots And Decipticons roll out because Optimus Prime, Nemesis Prime and Bumblebee get a reference in the trucks colours.",The Ice Road

112,RobTortureWright,What a let down.,4,26 June 2021,"""It's not about money now, this is personal""
A laughably cheesy movie line if I ever heard one. That's what The Ice Road is. A cheesy, over the top, Unnecessary film that takes the TV show ice road truckers and adds murder, explosions, bad storytelling and awful CGI into the mix.The first 30 minutes or so are actually pretty good (Minus that terrible CGi scene) the story is explained well and we see that a mine has collapsed trapping 26 miners inside and how the mining company decides to look for help getting them out. They turn to Lawrence fishburne's character and he starts to put a team together to cross the ice road with a drilling tool that will save the miners. After the crew set off this is where it completely falls apart.You have the inevitable cracking Ice scenes which were decent enough, I particularly liked how they took time to explain certain techniques that are actually used by ice road truckers like bobble heads and opening your doors to jump clear if the ice breaks and swallows the truck. However madness ensues when Lawrence Fishburne suddenly dies after his leg is trapped in a wire and he's dragged through the ice. They continue forward like nothing has happened but out of the blue we see the ""company insurance guy"" turn into a James Bond villain, revealing he in fact killed Lawrence and then proceeds to lock liam neeson and his brother in the trailer of a truck. The random villain now plants some dynamite that he's rustled up out of nowhere and drives off, Of course both brothers escape just in time to throw the dynamite aside before celebrating in one of the cringiest scenes I've seen all year. Random villain now speaks to one of the company men who instructs him to kill the final driver, the young rouge girl (I mean seriously, could her character have been more cliche ?)So the plan to kill miss cliche goes wrong because of course, a rat bites his hand before the girl hits him in the face with a fire extinguisher and escapes. I mean come on this sounds ridiculous but trust me watching it is even worse. Armed men on Snow mobiles now attack the two brothers and a game of driving perfectly while defending choke hold happens. They survive and go to help the girl, they arrive just in time to ram Mr bad guys truck of a cliff and he does 42 barrel rolls into trees all the way down the mountain but somehow jumps out with nothing more than a tight neck and a scratch on his cheek. Ridiculous.I won't go on any longer as I think you get the point of how insanely idiotic this film is, it ends with the bad guy taking a dip in ice water and dying, liams brother dying, but the miners are rescued and it's all happy ever after. Honestly a very insulting film that took a fairly decent plot line and messed it up completely with awful action scenes, crazy scenarios, CGI so bad it makes your eyes bleed and a lack of any reality whatsoever. Very poor film, do not recommend at all, dont waste your time on this one.",The Ice Road

117,Colbridge,This implausible action thriller is let down by clunky CGI and the defiance of physics,5,27 June 2021,"If it wasn't for the reliability of Liam Neeson and support from Laurence Fishburne this far fetched made for Netflix action thriller would be skating on thin ice and may have sunk without a trace, but it's Neeson's persistent scowl of a character that keeps the interest as a group of Ice Road truckers have to travel across perilously icy roads to come to the aid of a group of trapped miners after a deadly explosion takes place.It sets itself up nicely for action, drama and suspense and tries to make the most of it's icy setting but gets let down by clunky CGI effects and the defiance of physics. It's predictable, heavy handed and about 20 minutes too long but that said it does delivers some thrilling moments that just about keeps you watching right to the end.Ultimately then this is dumb, forgettable entertainment that has been done much more intelligently in films like William Friedkin's Sorcerer (1977) and may test the loyalty of the most ardent Neeson fan.",The Ice Road

With two great actors such as Liam Neeson and Laurence Fishburne, you would expect a blockbuster type movie, but that is not the case here.Every actor in the movie besides the two main stars and Amber Midthunder cannot act. It's cringe worthy watching some of the characters do their lines or show the wrong kind of reaction in every scene.Really, the absolute worst part of this movie is the writing. The idea is good and had me intrigued, but the lines are awkward or out of place in a lot of scenes.There is one scene in the movie were Amber Midthunder is asked by the guy riding with her, what she is like when she is really hungry.

As a Netflix production ""The Ice Road"" suffers from the same illnesses that plagues many of their studios, mostly due to tight budget limit, such as cheap CGI, no connection to reality at parts, quick production that leaves erroneous shots (truck models that switch etc) and not being able to keep highly-paid actors for the length of the film.HOWEVER, if you ignore all that and grab some popcorn and a drink, this movie is action packed and is a good thriller filled with relatable, albeit clichéd, characters, such as his mentally struggling brother and the female trucker. I really enjoyed these characters and the overall acting level is excellent from all actors.As an action movie I think it gives F9 a run for its money and probably overall is better, if you get upset by impossible movie action, this movie is probably not for you, but for pure action flick I give it an exact score of 57 / 100.",The Ice Road

As mentioned in other reviews the effects are quite poor at times but if the rest of the film was involving you might be able to get past that. Unfortunately its not.The soundtrack has every cliched song about trucks you could think up, Six Days On The Road, I've Been Everywhere etc. Are we really supposed to beleive that these people drive around singing along to these songs , maybe that was supposed to be funny, I'm not sure. It also drags out every 'action' scene long past the point where you care what is happening, I think you could edit this down to 90 minutes or even less and end up with a (slightly) more entertaining film.I thought this was maybe someone's first film but it seems the director has made films before that were quite good so I don't know what went on here.

It was fun to see Mr McCoy play a bad guy (I've only seen him play an understanding father in a family film), and Ms Midthunder has a nice screen presence.

The movie is non-stop thrill ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat throughout and has real heart too between the two brothers in the leads and the central female character.Having scanned through the comments on this IMDB page and the tomato meter, I just cannot understand why there's so much negativity surrounding this film. It's supposed to be a piece of pure 2 hour entertainment and escapism, not Citizen Kane! I've seen complaints about the CGI and accuracy of being on an ice road. As someone prepared to suspend my disbelief for a film, I can honestly say the effects were more than convincing and the scenes in the ice road were extremely tense to make a random observer overlook their accuracies.

It came very much out of the late eighties-early nineties mold of the rough-and-tumble crowd signaling a transition to a newer dynamic between tough and tender. It enlightened audiences to the notion that the good guy can sometimes become fire and brimstone but can also display male-to-male affection. A movie that comes to mind is Over the Top 1987 starring Sly Stallone, which was a father and son bonding. It is a fraternal connection in this case.Even though the movie is called the ice road, it's about much more than just that perilous journey. And if you didn't know, the ice road itself is the real deal. It's actually called the Tibbit to Contwoyto and is opened for a brief window every year starting either February or March. It is used to resupply Diamond mines. So whether you're from that era or not, I'm almost sure you'll find something about the film that intrigues. For me, specifically (spoiler warning maybe?)

167,Silicone54,Sharknado was more believable,3,27 June 2021,"Attention: This film was brought to you and funded by the Kenworth Truck Company.I don't normally get miffed by product placement ie a can of Coke, a new James Bond car and etc. But when the whole of the movie contains references to Kenworth it gets annoying real quick.Is that a new Kenworth? Yeah its the latest Kenworth. Can your Kenworth do it? Yeah my Kenworth can do it. Let's get this Kenworth moving and save the day. Thank god we are driving a Kenworth!If that isn't enough every truck scene has Kenworth name front and center. Ok enough of the rant.The movie is bad for several reasons and I hate to be anti-woke but let's get on with it. The cast ensemble is the usual white hero, black commander, female heroine and of course villains are white. I accept that this is the current Hollywood format. But did they really have to expand on it to another degree? They seriously added an autistic brother into the mix. The female lead is supposedly a Native American and she looks like a junior in high school but according to her story line she's been driving ice road trucks for a while. Why can't a movie just be based on good writing instead of shoe horning biases where they're not needed.The story was kinda over the top as if a normal day in underground mining and ice road trucking wasn't dangerous enough. Let's add espionage and explosions to really test out these Kenworth trucks. Did you think I forgot that Kenworth trucks are the stars of this movie?As the story plays out you realize how ridiculous the plot is. The villain is an insurance guy but yet he's got a certain set of skills...wait that's Liam's character. The villain is indestructible for the most part but we don't know if he's a trained Navy Seal or MI6 or Iranian Revolutionary Guard. He's just the bad dude that needs to die.The miners who are trapped underground and the whole reason for this movie to exist but yet they are the forgotten plot line. These tunnel rats have no survival gear or safety zones or emergency protocols? They just give up right away and snarl at each other. Some of these workers claim they knew of management's purposeful negligence and even sabotage but they took a bit of cash to keep quiet? These are the same guys who are now trapped in the mines. UgghThe action scenes are not the best but are good enough to keep your eyeballs glued as the Kenworth trucks perform admirably in every impossible scenario.

There was a very boring actress with a stereotypically bitter and angry at all men, especially white men, role, and a guy playing a mentally challenged ex-vet. Oh, and a cute pet rat. The rat was pretty good.There are one or two tense moments with the ice and driving over it (or not driving over it, more to the point), but overall I just couldn't invest in it or really care what happened.

179,ashishagupta,Action-Thriller that kept me engaged despite some flaws,10,27 September 2021,"While I think this movie deserves a 6.5 rating; I've given it a 10 to offset in some small measure many of the 1/10 from the overtly non-woke folks.Pros:
(1) The movie remains suspenseful till the end.(2) There are under-currents of support for the typically disenfranchised people (Indigenous folks; miners; truckers; people with disabilities).(3) Without giving spoilers; the writing does not pander, i.e. Characters are frequently in real harms way.(4) The movie shines a light on exploitative corporations; abusive work culture that preys on the weak.(5) Inspirational: with struggle, *sacrifice, and tenacity we can see an impossible journey to its end.* sacrifice of self for others and not sacrifice of others for self
(6) The IQ for protagonists and antagonists is fair. This was the most refreshing aspect of this action flick. A hero with the typical EQ and IQ of a trucker will not suddenly act with the IQ of a rocket scientist. The characters in a supporting role are not complete morons; which some movies do to make the hero seem more impressive.Cons:
(1) The movie has some glaring plot holes: light travels faster than sound; but they got that order reversed.(2) The movie fails to find a coherent principal protagonist and antagonist; is it a man or is it a force of nature. This debate is indeed a core aspect of this movie. Unfortunately, the script and/or editing fail to find harmony between these will achieving coherent plot and character development. A lot of other reviews complain of this aspect, but judge it too harshly.(3) It seems that the CGI budget was slashed after the script and screenplay was finalized; so some CGI is there but noticeably bad.(4) The main cast does a good job of acting but some supporting cast are really poor quality actors, which sticks out like a sore thumb.Summary:
Overall, this movie is a good depiction of a three-way clash between man vs nature vs man's nature. There is a watered down indictment of predatory corporate and social norms. Impressively the movie hints at the fact that there are no racist people, just greedy people and stupid people; the stupid people perpetually misled by the greedy people. Finally the movie is about ""the greater good"" - what does it mean to you and what will you risk/sacrifice for the greater good.Since there are topics of philosophical reflection that this movie engenders in the minds of people; the reflexive hate from non-woke folk as evinced in other reviews is par for course.",The Ice Road

In fact, the one they portray in this film are probably quite small by comparison to what's really going on. Methane over 10 yrs is FAR MORE HARMFUL to us than ny CO2 we would exhale.

It's a simple story of a guy who has to take a truck with rig to a certain location but is double crossed and he has to get the bad guy.

Started out great, will get you hooked from the get go. Back story of each character is well done and the story itself is good. So why the low rating, well its the believability of it all and they come one right after the other causing you to basically say ""Nah"", ""Nope"" and ""What kind of clock is stretching this out?"". You basically pile up so many unbelievable moments that by the end you are not invested in the story anymore.Great idea, purely executed. I do hope they make more movies like this just maybe get some trucker experts to help them out.

""it's hot out maybe the ice will have a physiological effect of cooling."" Ok I thought it most likely will have good cinematography which it does. Well, I was right as to the context and this is just another tired Liam movie. If only the wolves would have got him in The Grey.What a joke of impossible remedies to situations that just go from one to another. What an embarrassment to Paccar with their Kenworth trucks in this movie placement. A well-respected American engineering and manufacturing company involved in total unrealistic situations. Kenworth might as well as got a big ramp and had Liam and a Kenworth fly up the ramp to the space station. The Pigot family must now be in hiding.Movies by Liam are so predictable and unbelievable that he needs to find a different movie genre. Don't waste your time. Somebody should make a game based on this movie involving violations of physical laws with levels 1 through 3 of violations. There are probably 50, maybe a 100.Fishburne was lucky he checked out before the movie moved in a new level of ridiculous scenes. A lousy pulpy B movie at best.",The Ice Road
208,ghostjunk,Reminiscent of '90s Action Thrillers,7,18 July 2021,"There's not much that can be said about this movie without creating significant spoilers, as this is a pretty basic cut-and-dry film. Obviously, Liam Neason is back, the movie features a big truck driving through some icy terrain, and something unexpected happens. All things impossible to miss by simply looking at the movie poster.That being said, I would go in as clueless as possible as I can guarantee you the trailers will ruin any chance of feeling much excitement. While it might fail to compete with some older classics like Breakdown, featuring Kurt Russell, it's quite frankly a breath of fresh air in an era of reboot after sequel after whatever other form of recycling of old material Hollywood continues to churn out of its butt. (Ok, fine, not all of these are-imagined styled flicks are bad, but you get what I mean).What else can be said except Liam Neeson never seems to disappoint, and I'm sure older fans of his other movies will enjoy a brief escape from reality as they reminis of the films the golden years of R-rated action thrillers from the '90s. But what's to expect from a film written and directed by the same writer of awesome films like Die Hard: With a Vengeance and Jumanji, which both came out in 1995. I think it's safe to say that this was a great year for American screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh.The Ice Road might not deserve a huge tip, but this meal was good enough to create a great ""Netflix"" night out with some great friends. A solid 7/10.",The Ice Road

An set up the enormous 30 ton equipment and save the day. Correct me if I'm wrong but they'd all be dead if left to that time window. It's also incredibly Valkyrie lit.

232,ramonbattershallrecover,Road to Nowhere,1,26 June 2021,"It's becoming a bit of a theme for Amazon to hire talented actors and Gerald Butler in films that nobody would possibly watch otherwise. Geostorm is the perfect example of this, but that at least had a certain it's-so-bad-it's-good goofy charm, but this is horrible.The plot, such as it is, involves some utterly one dimensional - or zero dimensional in Larry Fishbourne's case - characters driving some machinery type stuff to save some miners by blah blah blah and something. Oh, and and an evil company is trying to stop them because, to quote Tim Robbins in Team America, ""They're evil, and they like money.""Up against them are a crack team of cliches including grizzled working man Liam, a permanently angry Native American, Liam's brother, an Iraq veteran with some mental condition that makes him talk like a cross between Dustin Hoffman in the Rain Man and Yoda, and Larry Fishbourne, who you don't even register because you know he's going to have even less screen time than Andy Garcia and Ed Harris in Geostorm.Despite these two undoubtably fine actors, this is basically a Steven Seagal film - to the point where you expect someone to say ""They say he's the best"" before giving his Special Ops backgound and the arrival of the porcine preener himself. The effects are awful, the dialogue crass, and the plot incomprehensible, but it's totally lacking the entertaining lunacy you often get with straight to DVD flicks.Worse, for a film that's about the essence of speed, they seem to stop every 5 minutes to moan, provide obvious plot exposition that actually makes things even more confusing, or do mechanical things that are about as exciting as they would be in real life. Neeson also looks too old for this sort of thing now, particularly when diving into freezing water and improbably dragging his heavy-set brother out, and when doing those sort of pat-a-cake martial arts fights with people half his age that have been the staple of all these things since the first Bourne film.Anyway, eventually some stuff happened and it ended, but I'd completely zoned out by the end and failed to understand, yet alone care, what happened. Still, it finished, which was a relief, and I could rest assured in the knowledge that I'd never have to watch it again.

The miners walk out of the mine perfectly fine despite being short on oxygen and practically dead. However, how many movies have I seen where the character should have died or been severely incapacitated and they weren't? Plenty. It's a Hollywood trope, and I'm fully capable of setting aside disbelief for entertainment.Nothing shocking or earth-shattering here, though I was surprised they killed off the character played by the famous guy so quickly.

I don't know what happened to those days, and I am feeling old now that I've seen this movie.The acting, is as you guessed it, cheesy, and in some parts just FORCED.The CG was 'okay' if you're used to B movies with a sub budget.The plot was LAUGHABLE. They somehow turned a trucking movie into a two hour long ""action"" movie. I'll get to this a bit later.The props were rather disappointing as even I knew that half of this stuff would be impossible at those temperatures.Now getting to the crux of the matter. If you turn off your brain, the movie itself is hilarious. Laurence dies to his leg being trapped in between that ""hard steel"" rope. The ice, which was VERY thin at the part where they ALL stopped, magically stayed whole for the entire death scene too. Despite Tantoo saying that stopping on the ice is basically a death trap.The fight scenes in this movie are horrendous. This was like scooby doo villain methodology going on. There can be no gunshots, we're going to wave them around and shoot sometimes but no one will die from the bullets. Because apparently that's a big ""no no"".And Gurty and Liam getting stuck in the cab. That was hilarious. We're going to pick up this 300 lb piece of machinery and use it to ram open a heating unit. I mean,.... what? They could barely lift that thing, so there was no way in hell they'd get enough momentum to do that. And the TNT on the ice? Let's throw that three feet away, that'll definitely blow up nicely and not cause issues!The moment when Liam's character ""figures out"" that it was a doomed mission from the start had me absolutely rolling. Like,... it was pointedly obvious that the guy was baiting and playing sides to turn you against each other. But sure,... believe the guy you just met over the woman you just met. Why? Who knows! Of course she sabotaged Laurence's truck, because reasons!They did Gurty dirty too. Why shut that flimsy gate, when he could've done the traction pads. You know,... the thing the one armed chick managed to get out of the vehicle, set up, and pull away from barely touching the fence to do?Turn off your brain and you might have a good time. It got 3 from me because Liam, made me laugh and it killed two hours.As a serious movie though? Fails miserably. False tension, unnecessary drama, evil villain which makes little to no sense.

Makes no sense to me. I mean why did they go over it so slow in the first place that they had the risk of getting stuck? Really no sense of urgency when they were almost at a time to save the minors. What was the purpose of the thing they were delivering? Never got a good sense of what they were delivering was even for. Lots more things I could list.

Dreadful acting & preposterous story line (even by 'action movie' standards). I had thought that Liam Neeson had reached the low point of his rather checkered career with the 'Taken' franchise some years ago, but I was wrong. Is there an Oscar category for 'most inept movie'?

There are quite a few surprises (not outlined here, lest the comments become spoilers), so the plot is not particularly predictable. The all-too-common 'hyper-angst' that is frquently used in such movies is kept reasonably in check, so the action, and plot twists are at the forefront.

Characters, are all pointless!The fight scenes. Wooden as hell! Neeson's final punch is something out of a carry on film! The technical aspects of ice and how they drag 2 fully Losded rigs up from on their sides without a fulcrum at height is impossible. How they tie a winch to a perfectly sized pole they just happen to find in the back of the trailer along with a boring machine, and use that to winch their way to safety when the head of the trailer, with a 3tonne engine sat in it, is buried in a freshly collapsed hole in the ice? Nonsense!Every scene inside the mine was a Complete waste of time. Who cares that they might have to kill a few off for the rest to survive.

Three trucks with trailers have the exact payload with the intention of getting at least one with it's cargo to the mine site.They will have to make the trip from Winnipeg. Canada in thirty hours and if they don't make it, twenty-six miners will perish.One of these drivers is Mike McCann - (Liam Neeson) a down on his luck man who has spent his last eight years caring for his brother Gurty - (Marcus Thomas)The other drivers are Jim Goldenrod - (Laurence Fishburn) the owner of the trucking company hired to make the trip to the mine and Tantoo - (Amber Midthunder), a trusted driver for Goldenrod.Also joining them on the trip is Tom Varney - (Benjamin Walker).

The writing and delivery are fine, but come across as mediocre at best when pairedwith such mediocre direction and editing.Points for actually shooting out in the cold, rather than a soundstage and adding in breath afterward. There are also some fun practical effects, but that's really the only saving graces.

He makes a Canadian fairytale starring him, along with, his Man-child Brother, Morpheus and the Bank Teller from ""Hell Or High Water"". This movie is so bad that it makes the TV show ""Ice Road Truckers"" look like Emmy Award winning entertainment. Why does Hollywood keep making crap like this? Is it because studio executives are now made up of Millennials and Gen Y-Z simpletons? Or is it that the audience has devolved into drooling, mouth-breathing, knuckle-dragging masses that will watch just about anything? Like the movie ""Idiocracy"" has come to fruition. Much of the content reaching mainstream is insulting and moronic at best. This movie is simply terrible. Where do I start? Well, the acting is laughably bad. A one dimensional woke mob consisting of, yep you guessed it, a black guy, a woman, a disabled man and a bunch of B-movie actors with bad Canadian accents eh... There was no LGBTQ character, so I'm sure this movie will get cancelled soon. It's packed full of toxic masculinity (hehe). The story is... Well, there is no story. It's a ridiculous series of disjointed plot points that confuse and insult the viewer's intelligence, to the point of laughter. It takes suspension of disbelief to an absurd level. A freak show, carnival act that will leave you wondering if COVID killed off all the talent in the movie industry. Yet another shining example of the decline of motion pictures made in America.

347,ajp2012,Is Liam Neeson Desperate For Work?,2,19 July 2021,"This movie had potential, a decent cast and a fairly original plot for a movie, although Ice Road Trucker fans may disagree. Those are literally the only positive comments I can make. The most obvious fails were the awful cgi, script and most unlikeable characters I have seen in a long time. There was clearly a tiny budget which showed throughout the whole movie. That's not always a bad thing, but in this case, resulted in a barely watchable shambles. For me personally the worst thing was the cgi trucks being completely different from the in-movie trucks, clearly indicating that whomever created this trash didn't really care, and it's actually kind of insulting to the viewers ""assuming"" we wouldn't notice. I just feel bad for Liam Neeson for accepting such a terrible role. There was once a time where you knew a movie was going to be great if he was lead actor, but seems like his career is going in the same direction as Bruce Willis and Nicholas Cage. Not really much more to say about the movie itself other than it is complete garbage. I only gave it 3 and not 2 stars, merely to give some credit to actors, for being handed a terrible script. There are clearly people upping the score as it was at 2.7/10 last week and has jumped to 5.5/10. It is truly horrendous movie not worth anyones time. Now I think about it 2/10 is all it deserves.",The Ice Road

You shouldn't be rating a movie unless you watch the whole movie. Yes it took some time to lay down the backstory for the main characters but once they hit the road, this movie got going fast. Plenty of action and a conspiracy to boot (though they really didn't flesh that out as well as they could - might have made for an even better movie). Regardless of the role, Liam Neeson always gives it everything he's got. He never just mails in a performance so if you're a Neeson fan, you will like this movie.",The Ice Road

Especially after viewers have been exposed to around 10 years or thereabouts of the FAST AND FURIOUS franchise. Why, We're lucky Gurty didn't use his tools to rig up a Kenworth jet ski to shoot across the waves and deliver the goods.I remember when I was really little and in the early seventies when me & my older half brother - who was a trucker - would pop some popcorn and sit down to watch Sonny & Will in another exciting diesel fueled adventure in MOVIN ON. Without fail in every episode my brother would call attention to some crackpot idea dreamed up by the two heroes to get the job done. He would explain to me, in detail, why these stunts dreamed up by the script writers would never work but every week we always sat down to watch Sonny & Will once again overcome another stubborn obstacle to keep their semi chugging down the highway into the sunset.At least with THE ICE ROAD we get some enthusiastic participants who are willing to shout, scream and get dragged around by big trucks. Our chosen few never quit when faced with frozen waves chasing them, or unkillable killers determined to stop them one way or another. The chase scenes aren't MAD MAX caliber either but there is some good stunt driving and scenic outdoor location shooting. Also, when somebody pays the ultimate price there's at least a reason for their sacrifice.This flick ain't no BREAKDOWN but it's better then those musical action movies from India.",The Ice Road

They repeatedly tell you they only have 30 hours to deliver and go out of their way to keep pushing that idea. I suppose they thought simply repeating it would build some sort of suspense???? The characters had no sense of urgency at all. And you know from the beginning that it's the type of dumb, predictable action movie where the miners get saved in the end and everything is resolved. One of the dumbest parts is when Liam Neeson says they need $200,000 to buy a big rig and then immediately gets an alert that they're looking for drivers and what's the reward??? $200,000 lmfao!

The audience never had any time or reason to connect with him.Then about Liam's speech issue brother dying; extremely unnecessary. What I mean by that is, I don't think even a 10 year old would fall for this crap. He dies because he's trying to close off a gate that is unnecessary; simply moving out of the way would've been fine!Even if the gate somehow has an automatic Open-Back function, it would've opened and hit the truck's back: so it would've just closed off again.He died for nothing, and in a really dumb way.As far as I know, he was supposed to be smart and all.

This movie just doesn't make any sense at all.I don't want to give an spoilers, but suffice to say that the ""conflict"" part of the narrative is just such nonsense at to make it hard to even care about the plot. What's more is that the writing and the acting are really subpar.The main problem is that the movie tries to sell itself as one where the characters actually have some emotions for the situation that's going on.

Americans working to save Canadians and using the ice road five weeks after the season had ended (so dangerous) and the greed of corporate big wigs that want their secret to die with the miners. I thought the use of wenches and cables was enough for the average watcher to get the idea.,The Ice Road

The rest of the movie with the evil corporation and the impossible task and the hidden bad guy and the terrible stunt work is adequate to kill a couple hours on a plane. What is next for Liam ?

My absolute least favorite part in the movie which i thought was very unnecessary and very melodramatic was the brother's death. Why? After successfully making it through all these crazy encounters and attacks and phases and after finally succeeding in doing this entire mission impossible... Why would they suddenly just kill him off in the most lame way just for the sake of killing him off. I felt like it was unnecessary. I would have rather seen him get his speech problem fixed (which they actually did right before he died) but without killing him off. That way he can go back to a normal life after becoming a hero not only as a veteran but as a civilian. Other minor parts i didn't particularly enjoy were some of the fight scenes which could have been done better. They seemed kind of lame like they could have made Liam Needing fight a bit smarter or more aggressively. I understand he was portrayed as a nice character but if someone is trying to kill you being aggressive is justified so it could have been slightly better. Otherwise i enjoyed the movie.

In one unbelievable scene, which will stand out to you if you're a fan of the Wile. E. Coyote/Roadrunner cartoons, I laughed out loud and realized that that's exactly what this was patterned after.Their only real mistake was to set up the first third of the movie as a serious drama. When they drop that part of it and go all in on the campy action, the shift in tone is jarring. And the scenes with the miners are just a distraction.If you're looking for a reasonable plot, or pathos, or anything else ""serious,"" you'll be disappointed. But settle in to watch a Canadian coyote chase an Irish roadrunner across the ice, and you'll have fun. I do wish they had stamped ""Acme Co."" on some of the equipment as an homage.

It was not bad at all, in fact. I was excited to see this movie. For months I waited for it to come out. Ofcourse, as I always do , the day after it aired on Netflix I excitedly pulled this film up on imbd to see what people thought before viewing. What did I see ? I saw pages of 1 s and 3 s using descriptive vulgar language which stated this was one of the worst films they had ever seen. As I saw this it took a bit of the wind out of my sail of my enthusiasm to see this film. In the past I have not chosen to watch films if that film gets enough poor ratings on imbd. Lucky for me ,thanks to the stellar advertising of Netflix , and some positive ratings on imbd I decided to watch this film anyways. From the begining to the end I was glued to the screen. I tend to be very ADD about switching programs . There's so many option out there. I have no problem turning a program off within minuets if it's not entertaining. However this film had me hooked. Sure is it maybe as excellent of a film as Taken or walk among the tombstones? Perhaps not. Was it an awesome entertaining way to spend an afternoon , yes it was. To be honest, I really enjoyed viewing this film more than either of the of the two I previously mentioned. This film had a steady plot broken up by great intense action scenes. I urge anyone interested to watch this film despite the awful reviews. I gave this film a 10 because it made for a great Saturday afternoon of entertainment, the way any film should.",The Ice Road

They had zero character development and barely any background plot. This is important because it gives you a reason to be stressed during a scary situation, but when a situation occurred, I just didn't care and was bored. Also can I comment on how dumb the way the veteran died was? Also the fact he was able to talk afterward. He would probably be in shock because of his shattered rib cage and crushed lungs. Plus why did Liam Neeson have to fight for control of the truck? The logic is awful. He already shot once and missed just shoot him again. And don't even get me started on the CGI. I am a CG artist and deal with this type of work daily and the CGI was absolutely AWFUL. The dust particles were fake, the trucks are easily seen as fake the minuet you see them, even from far away.

But it does suffer from what many flicks nowadays suffer from; trying to be 3 different movies at once. A disaster flick, a rescue flick and an action flick. Half expected Patrick Swayze to leap onto the cab or trailer with a shotgun poised at the ready. Another star for the Black Dog flashback.Sure, those 3 elements can work together, but in this case, combined with hit and miss CGI, it did loose some steam. The first part, focused on the actual Ice Road, had actual thrills. But once that part is through, and the next 'Movie' begins, it looses it.

624,charleskubly,There's not enough steel cable to suspend the amount of disbelief for this movie.,1,30 June 2021,"This is by far the worst Liam Neeson movie I have ever seen, and quite possibly the worst movie ever. I would have to rewatch this wreck to point out all the technical flaws and I am not going to do THAT. The acting if you can call it that was below the standards of a third grade school play, While Neeson and Fishburne lend their star power the rest of the cast is filled with unrecognizable and nameless faces who will probably never work in the business again. To call the acting ""wooden"" would be an insult to marionettes. When lines are spoken it's as if each actor suddenly remembers they are in a movie and the lines dribble out of their mouths like spittle from a punch drunk boxer. To say the plot was thin would be a complement, there is no plot at least not one that's remotely believable. Every hackneyed trope is used to elicit SOME emotional involvement but even age old conflicts aren't enough to keep the viewer enticed. I stayed to the end just to see how it got worse and I was not disappointed. Shockingly this movie continued it's downward trajectory right to the very end which was unimaginable given the first half hour. I can only guess Neeson and possibly Fishburne must have owed some people money and this was their only means of repaying their debts. Maybe they lost a bet, maybe this movie is some absurd inside joke that only a few people are in on. I really can't say.

Though guy Liam Neeson (Schindler's List) and Lawrence Fishburn (Pee Wee's Playhouse) take a predictable ride through a world of easy-to-understand danger and artificial pathos. There's a hot girl who's as tough as she is beautiful, a heroic, intellectually impaired sidekick, an evil corporation, and a villain who won't stay dead.Judging by the fact that the title is easy to translate into multiple languages, this seems aimed primarily at the foreign market. Neeson and Fishburn were likely well paid and hopefully both will now find better projects to lend their names to. The big winner here was Kenworth, since the whole movie was one long commercial for the trucks they manufacture.My favorite part was when one of the characters is lost under the ice and the shadow of a mic boom is visible in the shot.",The Ice Road

However, when I am watching movies I tried to pay real close attention to every movie I sit in front of. At the beginning of the movie shows Liam Neeson driving down the road in a Kenworth sleeper truck. I can tell that not only because of the logo on the steering wheel but also the gauges on the dashboard and all of the switches. I myself am a truck driver and have driven every kind of truck possible. When he gets out of the truck in the beginning of the movie, the hood of the truck is not that of a Kenworth, it is of a Volvo truck! Usually I don't say anything about things like this but being a truck driver since 2001 and have been j to trucks even before that, you tend to notice things.

No tire chains + semi truck + flat ice = stuck. Guaranteed. Also, an unhooked truck, chains or not, would never be able to pull a loaded truck and trailer on hard pack snow. I laughed out loud when I saw that. Also, the way the drivers drifted these trucks around without any effort? Absolutely not. There were so many scenarios where these trucks would have flipped. And using a winch to pull a truck upright thats overturned on flat ice? Never. It would just slide. And then driving them afterward? Hell no. And these trucks had a 25 ton load but couldn't cross a bridge rated for 75k? No way. My full steel 5 axle trailer and nearly full steel semi weigh 25000 full of fuel, no way a three axle and brand new semi full of fiberglass, aluminum, and plastic would be more than that.

Most of the time they are portrayed as low life bums, murderers, criminals, drug addicts and rapists. This is not the trucking industry that I know if Hollywood elites would actually leave thier bubble they would know this . Every profession has some bad actors true, but most are hard working Americans trying to provide for thier families in a under appreciated and difficult dangerous job. They get a 10/10 for showing the main characters as heroes rather than degenerates which is so played out and boring.

Very next scene Liam Neeson and his brother are offered $200,000 to do a job wow what a coincidence. The movie ends with the brother dying and then the nurse running out his way we found this with your brother and hands Liam the trash of a pamphlet. Yes okThe scene where they ran out of gas and I have to save in gas and put it into the other semi truck they pour gas out of a gas can that is not even close to being able to pour.Liam has a gun shoots gun, then decides to have a fist fight instead of keeping using gun.The

733,erykdirks,"No masterpiece, but a good watch",6,13 August 2021,"TL;DR: This movie isn't Oscar worthy, but it's not dog-crap like a lot of people are saying. The plot and dialogue is serviceable, and the acting is really good all around. Bad guys are cartoonishly villainy with no redeeming qualities in a movie where bad guys are probably not necessary to have, but other than that, not a bad watch.Story Criticism: The story is pretty predictable, but that doesn't mean it's bad. Character motivations are established, and they act as you think they should. The Antagonists are cartoonishly cliche in terms of motivation, bad guys cause bad, and kinda come out of no where, despite being very easy to spot near the beginning of the movie. Also the movie probably didn't need a bad guy, but oh well, they serve their purpose.Some minor plot contrivances and some odd moments, but overall it makes sense. More eye roll moments than plot holes.Story Complements: Straight to the point and simple to understand, no convoluted nonsense. Story has a clear beginning, middle, and end.Character Criticism: I said the bad guys were cartoonishly cliche, but that also applies to the characters. The only one who isn't imo is the mechanic brother. His character is rather unique and I think was the most interesting in the movie. I wish he was explored more.Character compliments: The main characters, especially the brothers, and like I said the mechanic brother was the most interesting.Dialogue: Mostly alright, some very cringe lines every now and then. Mostly from the bad guys.CGI and effects: Passable. Not good, but passable. Things look like they need to; noticeable but not distracting IMO.Acting: Very well done, the actors do very well with their roles, and is probably the best aspect of the movie. Even if their dialogue can be a bit cringe-worthy at times.",The Ice Road

The script is just horrible, acting is mediocre at best and in the first 15 minutes you will be laughing out loud at how rediculous some of the lines are. The whole premise of the movie makes very little sense. Why would an insurance company send an agent on the ""bull run"" (ends up being a lie but still)?

Instead it tries to be a bit of everything - thriller, drama, sabotage, action - and ends up cobbled together in a way that is just about bare able to see through to the end.

And not even a mirror broken!?Dropping a trailer on ice when it actually was sitting on 10 wheels now it sits on two legs but does not sink?I could go on for every scene, when you make a movie hire a guy there are millions of truck drivers that will help you with pleasure so you could make a more believable movie.",The Ice Road

I've watched so many badly reviewed movies and thought they were just fine. But this movie. Oh my gosh. The plot. The script. The delivery. It gave off the same feeling as a really bad highschool play. It made me cringe so hard I didn't think I'd be able to finish it.I honestly can't believe the actors accepted the roles.Special mentions for the Disability and Native American story lines: I couldn't tell if they were trying to be woke and failed miserably or if they were just flat-out bigots about it.

Hey, it's not a documentary or a reality show, right? I am here to be entertained, thrilled and excited. And I was! Yes, we know who our villains are almost right from the start, and so what? Liam Neeson is a lovable guy, he brings humble, quiet humanity to every role he plays and this one is no exception. It is a pleasure to root for him and the rest of the ""good guys"" as they face incredible odds. The action is non stop and I wasn't bored for one second.
