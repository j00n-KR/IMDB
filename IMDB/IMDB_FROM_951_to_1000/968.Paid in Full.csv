0,claudio_carvalho,The Rise and Fall of a Powerful Drug Dealer,6,8 January 2006,"In the 80's, in Harlem, the simple Afro-American worker of a laundry, Ace (Wood Harris), is seduced by the easy money of his friend Mitch (Mekhi Phifer) and when Mitch is arrested, he becomes a drug lord. Later, her joins Mitch and his new-friend Rico (Cam'ron) as his right arms, ruling the neighborhood. His kingdom is destroyed one year later, after successive betrayals.Based on a true story, I found the first part of ""Paid in Full"", showing the powerful and wealthy drug dealers' lifestyle, an apology to crime. However, the strong plot point really destroys this image, and shows how short are the empire and power of these nasty criminals. Most of their friends and women are bought by their money, and in the end they are only a part in the wheels of crime. Here in Brazil, we have the same situation in the slums: one day, a drug lord dies, on the next day there is another one in his spot. The cast has great performances and the direction of Charles Stone III is amazingly real. ""Paid in Full"" is highly recommended for fans of films of gangs. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Ouro Branco"" (""White Gold"")",Paid in Full
1,kosmasp,Drug game,8,7 June 2021,"I have to admit, I was surprised watching this the other day. This would be one of the movies I would have loved to watch back when it was released ... I don't know how I missed it. But I watched it finally the other day and it was ok to do so - I know many players now.If you like realistic views (characters are based on real people too), this is one to go. The Wire is still top notch but this is a really good movie about how the drug game can ... drag you down. Great performances all around ... and a killer song to boost to: Eric B and Rakim with the titular song.",Paid in Full
2,valleyjohn,This pulls no punches!,7,19 July 2021,"This is based on a true story set In the 80's, in Harlem. It follows an Afro-American worker of a laundromat, called Ace, who is seduced by the easy money of his friend Mitch and when Mitch is arrested, he becomes a drug lord. Later, her joins Mitch and his new-friend Rico as his right arms, ruling the neighborhood. His kingdom is destroyed one year later, after successive betrayals.I liked this .It's not a story we haven't seen before 2002 or after but what makes this really good is the acting .Thanks to that acting done of this cast went on to star in The Wire , one of the best TV shows ever made .Wood Harris is the stand out actor .He's incredibly impressive and you have to wonder why he's career hasn't really taken off since , although he has appeared in some big films .This movie pulls no punches . The characters on show will do anything for money , including betraying , kidnapping and murder and you don't at any stage have much sympathy for those who carry out the crimes . It's the families that inevitably suffer .",Paid in Full
3,DunnDeeDaGreat,Very good movie,10,28 October 2002,"Any hip hop heads know who Rich Porter, Alpo and AZ. The movie tells their story subiting the names for Mitch, Rico and Ace. The film is told through the eyes of Ace played with great vigor by rising talent Wood Harris. Ace see his boy Mitch (Pfeifer) in a great performance living the high drug life. After Mitch gets  locked up Ace decides to take over but he isn't your average dealer he's cool and laid back. While in prison Mitch meets Rico (Cam'ron in a breakthough debut) a hot head who decides he wants someone of the action. On the streets the trio run thangs but greed and betrayal thretan everything and the film has some shocking twists that are hard to believe. The eighties slang, clothes and life are portyaed very well. Producers Jay-Z,Dame Dash ( who shows up in a cameo) and Brett Ratner did their research to make the film look true to life. Regina Hall,Chi McBride go good supporting performances and the direction by Charles Stone III is impressive as is the script. I give it **** out ****.",Paid in Full
4,jpschapira,"Lies, drugs, money and betrayals in real life (the movie is based on a true story)...",8,15 May 2005,"Charles Stone III knows where to put his characters and how to handle them. He knows where he wants to tell his stories because he has filmed in similar places in his movies. He knows about directing actors, about keeping the spectator focused on the filmHis writers know about the way the characters talk, and about creating an interesting story that comes from real life so the viewer doesn't get boredThe team knew what they were doing messing with ""Paid in Full"".This piece comes in the groove of the movies we see from time to time about life in the neighborhood (""hood""), black people and their relationships, money problems, hard life, ""this is how we do it here"" and the other stuffPhrases and situations like this are all over this film; combined with an appropriate sense of reality and personality.There wouldn't be success in these movies if it wasn't for the characters. They're so important because they have the responsibility of making the story different. It's always the same things, what usually happens; but the characters are the ones that change and we get to know the life of every one of them. And that's probably the magic the movie achieves, because it's about these raw-written, really developed and peculiar characters. It's about the way they are talking, saying ""my n..."", ""this n..."", ""my man"" and lots of other expressions. It's about changes in a place that seems to be the same all the time, from the outside; but it's different from the inside. Changes that occur because of (and I come back because it's the way it is) the characters.The movie starts as many others these days, giving a glance of the present. Quick, simple, for you to contemplate a character bleeding as he sees (or imagines) notes falling from the sky. Then we are taken to the past; to see what happened before the ""glance"": in the beginning. Like most of the times, the situations in the past take more time of the film than the ones in the present. I won't mention anything about these situations that involve, among other things, a guy who worked in a dry cleaner but then became the king of money and drugs; another guy who had the money to help his family and to buy nice things before he screwed up, a guy who is fascinated with money and can't control it; the women that celebrate or suffer for the men's actions.Wood Harris plays Ace, the one who tells the story; and there's a reason why he tells it: in his story things will go right or wrong to the people, but they will all experience something because everything is connected. Harris finds the perfect note for the role, with the correct tone of voice each time he's saying something, and the mix of innocent and intelligent looks. I saw him in ""Hendrix"" so I recognized his face; but this is another performance by a promising actor. Mekhi Phifer consolidated his name in Hollywood long ago. He shocked me with his role in the powerful ""O"" and I couldn't recognize him as Future in ""8 mile"". He adds up another powerful performance to his list as Mitch; we'll be seeing Mekhi around. Newcomer in the acting scene, Cam'Ron, screams too much and puts arrogant faces, and I can't know if he's doing it right because I haven't seen him before. He didn't seem out of place, but it was kind of awkward. I should also mention Chi McBride wandering around the scenes with a lot of style. The rest of the cast (female and male and younger), achieved amazingly by pros Kerry Barden, Billy Hopkins and Suzanne Smith (experienced in casting people for films of this type), accomplish decent performances just to match everything with the story.What's left for director Charles Stone III is to give some revealing and profound shots in the movie's most dramatic scenes, lead his actors to their glory and generate a realistic environment that traps anyone who sees it. The film editing is also remarkable. All work of the team, messing with the film.Because the characters in the film mess with each other, and it's a messy film, you don't know why Ace keeps seeing notes falling from the sky, and from where he is telling the story he narrates. We just listen to it; but in some way the movie could be also messing with us.",Paid in Full
5,mikayakatnt,Gritty and larger than life,9,19 March 2020,"One of the most underrated growing-up-in-the-hood movies out there. A Phenomenal and powerful crime drama.Paid in Full is based in 1980's Harlem and portrays the rise of a reluctant drug kingpin and his two partners. The film captures the grittiness of Harlem in decline and the people involved. The film shows both the promises and curses of the drug business. The low-budget nature of the film adds another layer of reality to the entire film.Paid in Full's cast lineup couldn't be better. Every actor portrays their role well without breaking suspension of reality. Character flaws are shown and how it affects their drug dealing business.Artistic scene building choices are jaw-dropping. We see scenes interlaced with Scarface, dialogue mixed with action, beautiful use of colors, etc. This movie plays like an A++ film.For all that the team had with creating this film, they made a masterpiece.4.5/5. This is a must-watch for fans of the genre. Hands down.",Paid in Full
6,casablancavic,A Story Of Stupid Greedy Selfish People,5,26 May 2020,"So many of the characters have to say things 3 or 4 times in order to say something. So many of the characters have to say things 3 or 4 times in order to say something. So many of the characters have to say things 3 or 4 times in order to say something. So many of the characters have to say things 3 or 4 times in order to say something.It becomes repetitive. The dialogue is so boring and tedious and over repetitive that so many of the characters have to say things 3 or 4 times in order to say something. You get what I'm sayin B? So many of the characters have to say things 3 or 4 times in order to say something.This movie is about a bunch of drug dealers whop have no idea on how to maintain a low profile, keep themselves out of problems or become smarter than a brick or a log of wood.They are greedy, show offs who think that they rule the streets and people like them and value them.In all the time that they operated, they never learned to keep a low profile, they never learned to speak sentences, the never learned to invest their money into businesses and become something else - aside of the selfish, ignorant, bloated idiots that they were from the beginning.The never learned a new vocabulary and still spoke like unintelligent, incapable, uneducated morons with a grade 5 level choice of words and the need to repeat themselves 4 times in the smae sentence to make a statement.They were stupid and greedy and deserbed to get arrested or killed.In all that time, they never learned anything about business or people in order to effectively grow and build their lives for the better.They flashesd their cash like total idiots and talked about their deals in public to be even bigger idiots.They had to be among the dumbest drug dealers ever - to maintain such prolific status and never think about what it could do to them.They never took their money and moved away from the dumps they grew up in, the never changed their dress or attitude, they never made benefits to their future.They were stupid as stupid could be - and every bullet they took and charge they were given by police was well deserved.There was so much swearing in this movie that it took away and retracted interest from the film. These individuals appeared as total idiots and losers and no amount of money or jewellry could cover that up.Anybody who operates like they do in this business or any other business - legal or otherwise deserves to be shot or imprisoned.Selfish and greedy idiots don't deserve to walk around.When your whole network of retailers end up putting you at risk on every single day for every single occasion they do anything...it's time to put them out of their misery.With that much money, they could have turned it into hundredws of millions in a legal empire and kept it goping for years upon years - only to grow and grow - but they were so blinded by theri gold, they were unable to see anything else aside of their need for flashing their cash to impress the people on their block.Knowing that these people actully existed, I do not feel sorry for what happened to them and only wished it happened sooner.When you have that much money from your illegal activities, it's time to change your operation and entire persona - otherwise you become a statistic that is well deserved for your actions.Oh yeah, the dialogue was also so repetitive. So many of the characters have to say things 3 or 4 times in order to say something.",Paid in Full
7,whoTheFuqRyou,this one shines....,10,6 February 2003,"I saw this one a while back in the end of 2001, and I was very interested as it was the true story of the drug game in the mid eighties.  This movie is actually AZ's side of the story(AZ is Ace played by Wood Harris[Above The Rim, Remember The Titans, The wire]). well, it tells the story of drug kingpins AZ(Ace), Rich Porter(Mitch)and Alberto ""Alpo"" Martinez(Rico). Cam'ron really displays some actin' skills in his part as the trigger-happy, O-Dog reminiscent Rico(""alpo""), Wood Harris gives a very different performance from his previous roles in Above The Rim and The Wire as the laid back Ace. but this one belonged to Mekhi Phifer(8-Mile, Clockers) as Mitch(Rich Porter) he really came out and busted out Rich to a ""T""! the certain flare that was necessary was there... And havin' DJ Brucie B all in the movie really put the icing on the cake for a rugged street feel, VERY Authentic...underrated movie - this needs to be seen10/10",Paid in Full
8,francoischristana,Based on a true story!,10,28 September 2021,"This movie is an example of the street code never show love, love will get you killed. Ace had the right idea to not trust everybody, but he was too generous with putting everyone in the neighborhood in a position to get money. His munificence got him shot which no one cared they just wanted the product to continue to be distributed. Greed caused people to do evil things.",Paid in Full
9,momjessicaandjordan,Stupendous movie!!,8,8 July 2021,I remember first seeing Paid In Full a few years ago on my Dads DVD and I was super surprised. I got about half way watching the movie and I had feeling this was based on a true story and I was right. The acting was amazing especially Cam'ron he was arguably the best part of the movie. Wood Harris and Mekhi Phifer had good chemistry in the movie. It's hard for me to say that Paid In Full was better than other movies like New Jack City or Menace 2 Society but I would say it's a class of its own. A solid 8/10 for me.,Paid in Full

I loved all the twists it had.Great directing Charles Stone III!It was really cool how it cut back and forth from scene to scene.Interesting to see it was based on a true story.It's odd I have never heared of this film before.

12,fewald139,"A cautionary tale of drugs, money, and murder",8,27 March 2020,"Paid in Full is the true story of three drug dealers in '80s Harlem, and the screenplay is written by the real-life protagonist. It follows the rise and fall of Ace, a young man who does honest work for a living before getting caught up in the drug trade. The film does a great job at showing how appealing this criminal lifestyle would be to impressionable young men struggling to live in poverty. At first, the flashy aspects of the lifestyle are highlighted: brand new cars, being a local celebrity, wads of cash. Once Ace gets himself directly involved, however, the unfortunately brutal consequences to such a careless line of work quickly catch up to him.Paid in Full wisely avoids glorifying the crimes within; in fact, many of the real crimes claimed more victims than those shown in the movie, and only one crime is changed for effect (the revenge murder of a character near the end). Ace is the perfect protagonist; he plays the game but understands its danger, choosing not to flaunt his wealth or status and avoiding doing drugs himself. Still, one is left to ask: why? Why get involved in such a trade that you know puts your entire community in danger? This is also the purpose of the writer, who has written one heckuva cautionary tale. As he says late in the film of the game, ""It's all fake."" The money, new clothes, cars, and hordes of women mean nothing when so many lives are at stake. The characters here are real, with understandable motivations, particularly Ace and Mitch, played by the always-fantastic Mekhi Phifer. My only complaint of the movie was that it was at times hard to understand, given all the street lingo; yet, because this was to be expected, I can't fault the movie for its realism.This movie was a surprisingly good crime drama that has a lot to say. Rather than glorify drugs and the lifestyle involved, it serves as a dire warning.",Paid in Full
13,TimeForLime,A nice update to NEW JACK CITY (1991),5,4 August 2003,"This is the story of a soft-hearted drug dealer, as far UP the chain as you can go before you leave the Harlem neighborhood.  The NEXT level is the guys, not part of the story, who deliver it in multiples of kilograms, and sell it the Afro-Americans, one community at a time, for breakdown and distribution.There is one exception to this structure.  Early in the film, we meet one super-dealer, played by NYPD-Blue station chief Lt. Tony Rodriguez (2001-2003), Esai Morales.  (Morales seems to have gained so much ""gravitas"" between this film and the TV series you wonder if this film has been in the can for awhile.)The name you know in the cast is Mikhi Phifer (he plays DR. GREGG PRATT on TV's ""ER"") but the name you will come away with is Wood Harris. You might have seen him playing third fiddle in REMEMBER THE TITANS (2002), the Denzel Washington feel-good film.  Like TITANS, this is another true story, by the way.The film tries to link itself to SCARFACE (1983) and even goes so far as to have the characters view that film on the big screen when it first came out. Trust me: this is not scarface.  It is not Florida, not Cubano.  AND ......  The scale of their operation, their life-style, ambitions, family orientation, neighborhood emphasis, and sheer abilities puts them much more on a par with Wesley Snipes NEW JACK CITY (1991).Realizing that JACK CITY was supposed to portray a dealer who went a little power crazy, I found Snipes' performance over-heated, and didn't enjoy THAT film even the second time around.  Wood Harris has a more moderate part to begin with, and he gives a credible performance as an underwhelming street kid who keeps on growing sufficiently to meet the demands of the job.  Even though he is ultimately selling death in little glass bottles, you want to like him, want him to prevail over his more hot-headed, flash- and violence-oriented competitors.""Maintain and stay low"", he says.  That might have been good advice even for corporate giants like Drexel Burnam and Enron.But, like all bio-corporate organisms, the rule is, ""Grow or Die.""  Wood's character makes the mistake of reacting the way you or I might in similar circumstances.  Harlem is my beat.  Harlem is enough.  Why do I have to aggrandize, to bloat, to grow ever bigger?  Can't I just be top dog on my own turf, he asks.Rent the film.  Find out the answer.",Paid in Full

16,bradtheman18,Movie was great. Watch it,10,6 April 2012,"Once again, Wood Harris kills it in another great movie that doesn't get recognized. Such a good actor. This is one of the best Gangster movies ever made. I'd rate this over goodfellas and godfather. The story is very well done. Acting was great. It starts slow and just picks up speed and doesn't stop. This is one of my favorite movies. It's a shame that it wasn't promoted well and got no recognition. From beginning to end, their is nothing bad to say about this movie. Cam'Ron (from the hip hop group Dipset/Diplomats) really impressed me on this one. Each character is cool in his own way and like most hip hop movies, this one has an explosive ending. Unlike most of Wood Harris' movies, they actually put a lot of money into this movie and gave it an actual budget. I was surprised about how good this movie was. Only reason I watched it was because Netflix recommended it to me. It's upsetting that not enough people have even heard of this movie. I can't imagine anyone not liking this",Paid in Full

19,Bring Da Ruckus,I was waiting for this...,9,21 January 2002,"I am very happy that the life story of Alpo, Rich Porter and AZ has come out, I saw the movie and I was mezmerized.  Mekhi Phifer(Rich Porter) and David Sherwin Harris(AZ)(Above The Rim, Remember The Titans) do great as the legendary drug kingpins AZ and the now deceased Rich Porter. It really tells how crack cocaine blew up the way it did in the 80's and how ""REAL"" the crack game really is- How the up can make you feel on top of the world and how fast one can hit rock bottom in the game.  The surprise came from Cam'ron as the now incarcerated druglord Alpo. This was a great movie and I also recommend the street documentary ""Game Over"" hosted by AZ which is also based on the lives of Alpo, Rich Porter and AZ.A street classic 10/10",Paid in Full

It shows the ups and downs of the drug game and is focused mainly on AZ(David Sherwin(Wood) Harris).  The surprise came from rapper Cam'ron as Alpo(but is called Rico).  I don't want to give it away but for those people who checked the street documentary, ""Game Over"" would really understand this movie as well as those who knew AZ, Rich and Alpo personally and those who know the legacy of these hustlers.It gets a 9 from me, I loved it",Paid in Full

In the beginning of the movie the main character Ace is seen as a quite kid from Harlem who works for a local tailor. Surrounded by the distribution, consumption, and glorification of drugs. Ace resists the temptation as he sees his friends become involved, but soon falls victim to his surroundings. Personally I had no interests in watching this movie. But it seemed like EVERYONE had seen it. (so i finally sat down and watched it) Surprisingly I really liked it. I don't think anyone should follow the path presented in this movie but I do think it can teach lessons. Such as the easy road isn't always best, or not to trust the people around you.

Also, I didn't see the point in setting the film in the mid 80's even though the events are based on a true story the fact that it took place in the eighties is of no consequence. But the part that I truly got a kick out of was the Esai Morales character. He just decided out of the blue to give the dry cleaner the best available dope on the street because he kept to himself, talk about being lucky !!

25,zac414,Solid portrayal of 80's Harlem and the American Dream,9,10 April 2004,"I wrote a review on this film years ago and had to edit it... Still one of my favorite ""hood"" flicks 10 years later... Based on the true story of the childhood friends: AZ, Alpo and Rich Porter... The fictional names used in the movie Ace Boogie (Wood Harris), Alpo (CamRon) and Mitch (Mekhi Phifer)... I suggest seeing the documentary Game Over or read up on the real life characters to get an idea of what this film really is about. What impressed me so much about this movie is its authenticity with regards to imagery - you look at these infamous photos of the three back in the day and they're accurately replicated in live action in the film, creating a special vivid realism. That coupled with RocAFella production, superb acting, and DJ Brucie B on the score with classics - this movie never gets old. Not to mention the soundtrack bangs... 2 discs - one dedicated to 80s hip hop heard mostly throughout the film, and the other featuring the 2002 RocaFella lineup - that includes what was my first time hearing Kanye rap on the track ""Champions"" - with Dame Dash boasting... classic hood sh#t.",Paid in Full

27,jtheproducer23,"""Money is the root to all evil"" (Based on a True story)",8,28 October 2014,"Based on a true store of Azie ""AZ"" Fasion, Alpo and Rich Porter are urban legends in New York. These teenagers ran the most sophisticated drug ring on the East Coast in the 1980's. They were major players in the New York drug trade. 2002 film ""Paid in Full"" Azie Fasion wrote a story based on the lives of his crew and ""Roc-A-Fella Films licensed the story and brought it to the big screens where notable actors Mekhi Phifer and Wood Harris would portray the lifestyle theses teenagers were lavishly living until tables turned and one is betrayed by his own and would lead to the fall of the Harlem kingpins. ""Paid in Full"" released in October of 2002, a drama action film directed Charles Stone III. An R rated Film for its content of violence, pervasive language, some strong sexuality and drug content. Some of the production Companies that contributed to this film was Dimension Films, Loud Films, and Rat Entertainment. On Opening Weekend This film was shown on 268 screens across the USA and generated over a Million dollars. Filming was shot in Harlem. Main character Wood Harris acts as narrator in this film. The Directors uses various techniques of Flash- forwards and flashbacks in this film so the viewer can make a connection between the characters in the story and how they transform. Director incorporating some great cinematography in this film which lead to impact scenes and the success of actors. The Movie Shows how two characters and transform due to the success of the drug trade and lead to a major shift of street creditability and eventually table turn. As Ace the Main character played by Wood Harris the Protagonist character in this film character traits of the quiet one who quits his job at the dry cleaners to make some fast money. It seems like Ace has to take the role of which his friend played and supply the street with the latest and best product that customers can't resist buying because they were getting better quality product for a lower price. He has watched his close friend get rich quick and have the latest car, clothes, jewelry, and the power in the streets. Ace's humbleness saves him from the dangers of the street in the long, but other suppliers cross his path to try to take what he has and threaten his family and friends. One of the key moments I noticed in this film and where the film kind of made a turning point is when Ace's moment of surrender comes when he returns a rock of cocaine he finds in a trouser pocket of another neighborhood drug kingpin and the dealer slyly suggests that he peddle it. Ace becomes his street connection and later his replacement (after he's found dead). When Mitch is released from prison, the best friends join forces with Rico (Cam'ron), a paranoid, hot-headed pal of Mitch's from prison whose idea of fun is to show home videos of himself having sex in a local dance club I think this movie is good for young kids growing up in the city to see. I think its a good representation that selling drugs and having all material things can lead to the quickest fall and then your life is gone because you vale the streets more than getting a career or job and going about life making the right choices. I think if majority of the audience can relate to the experiences that they see theses characters have to go through they will understand and appreciate the film for what it is. I think this deserves a 4 out of 5 rating I think overall it was well composed, the music related to the era, and the director did a fine job of representing the characters.",Paid in Full

29,honeykiss2901,Why is this being compared to New Jack City?,7,11 September 2005,"I'm trying to figure out why this movie is being compared to New Jack City? Paid if Full is about 3 real life teenagers who made the drug game in Harlem huge. Azie, Alpo, and Rich Porter weren't fictional characters. I gave this movie a 7 because a lot of their story was left out. To get the full story including interviews you must see 'Game Over'. I know that only so much can fit into a movie's 2.5 hr time frame but there were so many things in their story that was left completely out. In an interview I read that AZ did with a NY newspaper, he stated that he was not happy with how the movie came out because it was supposed to be a movie that did not glorify the drug game. http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/movies/n_7905/ --> the website with the interview. These movies don't compare at all. Just because they both mention Scarface and take place in NYC and because they involve the drug game does not make the movies comparable.",Paid in Full
30,youngcorbin,Very Good Movie,10,29 September 2015,"This movie is one of my favorite movies. I rated this movie a 10 because I can relate to it. Growing up in Baltimore City you see a lot of activity such as in this movie, and like Ace sometimes you might be tempted to join the negative influences in your surroundings. Ace had a good job, making legal money, working at the cleaners. He always watched the drug dealers with the nice cars, designer clothes, all the girls, and lots of money. One side of him wanted to get money the legal way and work hard for it, although the other side of him wanted to live the lifestyle they lived. Ace wasn't making much at the cleaners, he was making just enough to get buy. While his friend Mitch was the top drug dealer in Harlem. One day all of that changed when Ace found drugs in the pocket of one of the customer's pants at the cleaners. He thought he was doing the right thing which was returning it to the rightful owner. The owner thought he was crazy for returning and insisted that he keep the drugs. Ever since then Ace became the top drug dealer in Harlem, although he had more money than working at the cleaners, he began to have more problems also. This is a great movie to watch. It's relatable and based on a real story which makes it all the more interesting.",Paid in Full

33,markkmorrison,A drug dealer progression in the game,8,23 January 2006,Very good film underrated no hype surrounding it but tight in the script realism and action. Before viewing the film I had never heard of Wood Harris I was surprised at how good he was in the role. Ably supported by Mekhi Phiffer who has gone on to bigger and better things his name alone was the draw for me watching the film. I was also curious to see how Cam'ron would be plenty of rappers have tried the hand and at acting only a few have been successful. I thought that he did a performed well in the role of an out of control street soldier. The plot ran smoothly all the way through the film and what made a nice change with this film the lead character always understood his limitation which gave the ending a realistic feel. If you have not seen it I suggest you do..,Paid in Full
