0,TheLittleSongbird,"Silly, but hugely entertaining film!",8,23 June 2009,"I enjoyed Rush Hour very much, yes it is a little silly, but what it is really is harmless fun. The two leads, Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are an inspired double act, though I will say, that sometimes Tucker's mouth runs away with him, so I didn't always understand what he was saying at times. The clever plot, involving an international kidnapping, actually allows Chan to do what he does best, but I did wish there was a little more of it. The script is irreverent, if only let down by what seemed like some improvisation from Tucker, that sometimes got off target. There are some excellent camera work and stunts, making this a hugely enjoyable film, not as good as Shanghai Noon, but a delight for fans of Chan. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",Rush Hour
1,Leofwine_draca,Pretty good for a buddy buddy cop movie,6,4 November 2016,"Jackie Chan's first breakthrough American movie is a fast-paced, non-stop barrage of comedy spills and action thrills, a solid buddy-buddy formula movie which never deviates from the rules, but nevertheless succeeds as a piece of entertainment for the masses and at least proved popular enough to spawn a sequel (and possible further sequels). A conspiracy kidnapping plot, double-crossing bad guys, east meets west tension, tons of action and jokes keep this one running throughout. Jackie Chan himself is the main ingredient of this film's success; although the film is very different in style and feel to his eastern movies, he still proves himself to be a very funny leading man, especially when dealing with all of the racial humour his character puts up with in this movie. In the film's many explosive fight sequences, Chan also gets to show off his martial arts skills, although I would have preferred a one-on-one fight with the blond-haired bad guy at the end.The comedy element is largely provided by the love-him-or-hate him Chris Tucker, an extremely overbearing and outrageous comedian-turned-actor in the Eddie Murphy mould. Truth be told, I'm not a great fan of sweary, jive-talking comedians but Tucker is undeniably likable here, and his persona sparks off nicely with Chan's more laidback, serious character. Expect plenty of the usual male bonding and some nice chemistry to develop between the two stars. Also expect to see plenty of familiar faces in the cast giving quality performances, not least Tom Wilkinson, who bizarrely goes from a comedy stripper in THE FULL MONTY to the imposing central villain in this movie.The action elements are kept varied, ranging from martial arts to shoot-outs, explosions and tense hostage situations, with the finale being particularly well handled. The film also never outstays its welcome and despite the violent, often profane subject matter, it never becomes offensive. The comedy is mixed well with the thriller angle so not only are there some very funny moments, but there are also some highly suspenseful, even dangerous scenes in the movie. Chan's knack for physical comedy is highlighted in a great moment where he attempts to hold up a priceless vase whilst fighting off two baddies. Although this isn't a superb film and can't hold a candle to the LETHAL WEAPON movies, Chan and Tucker make for a surprisingly good combination and the film as a whole is impossible to dislike.",Rush Hour
2,SnoopyStyle,all about Tucker Chan team,7,2 November 2013,"The young daughter of a Chinese diplomat is kidnapped. He insists that the FBI use his trusted Hong Kong detective Lee (Jackie Chan). However the FBI dumps him on LAPD detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) to babysit.Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker form a great team. Their chemistry is evident right away. Brett Ratner brings out all the hilarity with some culture clash humor and loudmouth Tucker.The story is passable. There isn't anything original going on here. It's really just an excuse for Chris Tucker to make an ass of himself, and allow Jackie Chan to do some crazy fighting moves.",Rush Hour
3,classicsoncall,"""Who do you think you kidnapped, Chelsea Clinton?""",7,27 May 2021,"Having just watched all the films in the Beverly Hills Cop series with Eddie Murphy, this story felt a bit underwhelming in it's attempt to capture the flavor of those pictures. On it's own, it's a decent enough buddy cop movie who's pairing of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker often appear to be a mismatch on paper and in execution. It seemed to me that they had to work at their chemistry while investigating the kidnapping of a young daughter of a Chinese Counsel official. Without a doubt, the highlight of the picture are Jackie Chan's superbly choreographed stunts and martial arts moves; the scene where he incorporates ordinary furniture into a spectacle of agility and athleticism will have you wondering how he could do all that without breaking his neck, while one of the outtakes during the credits reveal he does make a mistake in timing once in a while. Tucker is just a bit too brash and loud to my liking, without the self effacing humor evident in a comic like Murphy. On a different day I might have considered this movie in a better light, but with ""Beverly Hills Cop"" fresh in my mind, it came across as just a bit lacking.",Rush Hour
4,lee_eisenberg,buddy comedies ever after,10,7 April 2006,"Obviously, ""Rush Hour"" is mostly just another buddy comedy, but there's so much hilarious dialogue between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, that it's all worthwhile. When a consul's daughter gets kidnapped, Tucker gets hired to take the case, but Chan gets brought in from Hong Kong to assist. Naturally, they have a very hard time cooperating.I guess that a major aspect of these movies is that you shouldn't try to take them seriously; just accept them as completely crazy. With Chan doing his martial arts and Tucker being a loudmouth, it's a great time from start to finish. Also starring Elizabeth Pena, Chris Penn, and Tom Wilkinson. I liked the sequel equally.",Rush Hour
5,jboothmillard,Rush Hour,8,28 June 2005,"From director Brett Ratner (Red Dragon, X-Men: The Last Stand), this is one of the most recognisable cop buddy movies ever made. Basically the daughter of Chinese official Consul Han Solon (Tzi Ma), Soo Yung (Julia Hsu), is kidnapped by villain Sang (Saw's Ken Leung). Solon's close friend, Hong Kong Chief Detective Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) is being brought to the US to help get her back. To make sure Lee doesn't get in their way, the FBI hire loud mouth and glad to be rid of LAPD Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) to keep an eye on him and not allow him to get involved. For a little while, Lee not speaking English is trying to get away from Carter as much as possible to get his own way, but eventually they both form a little understanding. They realise they are both being cast aside from the real case, and they join forces to follow all connections to stop the bad guys themselves, including traitor Thomas Griffin aka Juntao (Tom Wilkinson), and save Soo Yung. Also starring Reservoir Dogs' Chris Penn as Clive Cod, Elizabeth Peña as Demolition Specialist Tania Johnson, CSI: Miami's Rex Linn as FBI Agent Dan Whitney and Philip Baker Hall as Captain William Diel. Chan with his martial art skills and Tucker with fast trash talking both make a fantastic comedy duo, and one of the highlights is their rendition of Edwin Starr's ""War"". Filled with plenty of action, chase and fight sequences and an admirable double act, this is an enjoyable near thriller martial arts action comedy. Jackie Chan was number 41 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",Rush Hour
6,rmax304823,Two Mismatched Cops in L.A.,6,22 April 2015,"If you want to see a lot of action -- dishes smashed, bullets through walls, falling bodies, bodies crashing through windows without a scratch, hot pursuits in automobiles, buildings exploding -- this is your movie.Jackie Chan is a detective brought from Hong Kong to help recover the snatched daughter of the Chinese Consule in Los Angeles. The FBI are handling the case and they figure Chan will be a nuisance so they assign a devalued cop from the L.A.P.D., Chris Tucker, to nursemaid the visitor and keep him out of the way. It all goes wrong.The plot doesn't need much description because it's of no importance. It only provides an excuse to hang the violent scenes on. But this isn't one of those cop movies that have realistic gore all over the place. For all the action, nobody shows much blood, and after they're finished swinging from fire escapes they're not breathing very hard, let alone panting, let alone dead as you and I would be.It's not a serious picture. It's an attempt at comedy. Chris Tucker is a clone of Eddy Murphy at his loudest and most grotesque. Jackie Chan has trouble with English but he makes up for it by combining the acrobatic ability of Burt Lancaster with the choreographic skills of Gene Kelly. You ought to see the guy roll and twist over furniture or rooftops or vehicles. It's superhuman, literally. He must have used wires.The gags are okay without being as spectacular as the stunts. What it is, is another mismatched cop movie, out of ""48 Hours"" by ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Black Rain."" A gang bang.",Rush Hour
7,Tweekums,A fun cop caper with Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker,7,21 September 2017,"When the daughter of the Chinese consul in Los Angeles is kidnapped he wants his old friend Detective Inspector Lee, of the Hong Kong Police, to be part of the investigation. The FBI don't want him anywhere near their investigation so palm him off to the LAPD which in turn partners him with Detective James Carter, who has no current partner because he annoys everybody else in the department. Carter is initially pleased with the assignment but soon learns that he is just expected to babysit Lee and keep him away from the case; Lee is equally unimpressed and is determined that he must help find his friends daughter. Inevitably it isn't that long before the pair are investigating the case and the FBI are thinking they are getting in the way.This film's story is decent enough even if the big reveal about who is ultimately behind the kidnapping is rather spoilt for anybody who reads who is starring in the film at the start anybody appearing third is surely not only going to have one brief scene in the opening minutes! That isn't much of a problem though; this is all about the laughs not the depth of the mystery. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are a lot of fun in the lead roles; they provide lots of laughs and develop a good chemistry as the film progresses. The action is well choreographed, as one would expect from anything featuring Jackie Chan; it might not be as intense as that in his Hong Kong films but that is partly to give room to the fast talking Chris Tucker to provide more verbal laughs. Overall I found this to be a fun mix of action and comedy which manages to avoid the sort of offensive material that might put off many viewers.",Rush Hour
8,paul_haakonsen,"Fun, action packed and enjoyable...",7,15 December 2020,"Well, let's just be honest here and say that the 1998 movie ""Rush Hour"" is definitely a classic action comedy of East meets West.Writers Ross LaManna and Jim Kouf managed to put together a story that incorporated elements of action and comedy in a very entertaining manner. And it was a story that was as entertaining as it was enjoyable as director Brett Ratner brought the story to the screen.Initially, back when the movie was first released, I was a bit skeptical about pitching Jackie Chan opposite of Chris Tucker, but the duo actually worked out well together, as they are quite the opposite of one another and the chemistry between the two just was marvelous on the screen. Whereas Chris Tucker brings the more classic comedy to the movie, in the likes of Eddie Murphy in ""Beverly Hills Cop"", Jackie Chan brought his usual impressive action feats and stunts while managing to put in his usual charm and comedy elements as well.""Rush Hour"" definitely has an interesting cast ensemble. Aside from Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, the movie also has the likes of Tom Wilkinson, Chris Penn and Tzi Ma on the cast list.Not only is the storyline and plot entertaining and fun, but the dialogue was also good, especially the banter between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker.This is a fast-paced and entertaining action comedy for sure, and it is one that manages to endure the passing of time. I have watched the movie numerous times since it was initially released back in 1998, and it actually still holds up here late in 2020.If you are not familiar with the ""Rush Hour"" movies, then I can more than warmly and highly recommend that you sit down and strap yourself in as you embark on a fast paced action ride in the company of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker.My rating of ""Rush Hour"" is a seven out of ten stars. This movie provides good and solid entertainment.",Rush Hour
9,michaelRokeefe,Action/comedy culture clash.,7,25 March 2000,"A Chinese Diplomat's ten year old daughter is kidnapped. The FBI doesn't want visiting Chinese cop (Jackie Chan) to be involved in the investigation. They employ an LAPD screw up,(Chris Tucker),to keep the visitor away from the case. Not only do the mismatched crime fighters get involved, but they actually rescue the girl and expose an art theft ring.
Chan and Tucker are funny and entertaining together. The funny quips and banter is blended with the action scenes to make for a fast moving film. Chan's stunts are amazing. Fun to watch.",Rush Hour

11,zardoz-13,"""Rush Hour"" Is Better Than ""Rush Hour 3,"" But It Doesn't Surpass ""Rush Hour 2.""",7,13 June 2008,"Martial arts top-kick Jackie Chan and jive-talking jokester Chris Tucker deserve better than they get in sophomore director Brett Ratner's ""Rush Hour,"" a moderately entertaining but uninspired chop-socky, action comedy about the abduction of a foreign diplomat's daughter. Not only is this jaded cop thriller thoroughly predictable, but silver screen producers Arthur (""Last Man Standing"") Sarkissian and Roger (""G.I. Jane"") Birnbaum also have scrimped on the budget. This forgettable yarn about the recovery of the Chinese consul's 11-year old daughter from the hands of greedy, vengeful, million-dollar abductors lacks both punch and momentum. Jackie Chan spends more time acting rather than fighting. The producers have consciously softened his image and relied less on the Charles Chaplin-esquire antics that made Chan's Asian actioneers so captivating and profitable at the box office.The Jim (""Gang Related"") Kouf and Ross (""Star Trek: First Contact"") LaManna screenplay qualifies as abject. The shoddy storyline is a standard-issue, fish-out-of-water, by-the-numbers, fill-in-the-blanks melodrama with no surprises and few revelations. The hopelessly complicated plot interferes with the action. Kouf and LaManna have borrowed bits and pieces from Walter Hill's ""48 Hrs."" and Richard Donner's ""Lethal Weapon 4."" Once again, in a role he perfected in Asian epics such as ""Police Story,"" ""Crime Story,"" ""Supercop,"" and ""First Strike,"" Chan plays an indestructible policeman, Chief Inspector Lee. Lee matches wits, mitts, and skits with maverick cop, LAPD Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker of ""Money Talks""). As Lee and Carter, Chan and Tucker bicker and bond, and they give ""Rush Hour"" its heart and soul. The star chemistry that these two guys generate enlivens this harmless, 97-minute crime thriller. For example, Carter's story about how the LAPD is so hated that his own mother tells her friends that her son is a narcotics pusher instead of a detective is hilarious.When Consul Han (Tzi Ma), the Chinese Ambassador in Los Angeles, learns that his daughter Soo Yung (Julia Hsu) has been seized, he summons Hong Kong's Inspector Lee. Han and Lee are old pals. Together, they broke the Junteo, a mafia-life Asian crime syndicate which and heisted millions of bucks worth of firearms, narcotics, and elegant Chinese museum artifacts. Meanwhile, the Feds take charge of the kidnapping. FBI Supervisor Warren Russ (Mark Rolston of ""Aliens"") and agent Whitney (Rex Linn of ""CSI: Miami"") have some initial misgivings about Consul Han and Chief Inspector Lee. Fearful of the consequences should Inspector Lee encounter injury, they assign LAPD Detective James Carter to 'baby-sit' Lee while he is in their jurisdiction.Obnoxious Detective Carter is the last man that the FBI wants on their side. A reckless cop like Clint Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry,"" Carter is a loose cannon on deck. In his introductory scene, Carter nabs Clive (Chris Penn of ""True Romance""), an illegal explosives dealer, in a car loaded with C-4. During an abortive getaway attempt, Clive dives out of his auto an instant before Carter shoots a hole in the trunk, blows up the C-4, and turns Clive's vehicle into a blazing meteor. Not only does Carter attract trouble, but he also prefers to work solo. He shuns his current partner, Tania Johnson (Elizabeth Pena of ""Transamerica""), and he cracks sexist jokes at her expense. Captain Diel (Philip Baker Hall of ""The Rock"") wants to suspend him for his destructive shenanigans when the FBI requests an escort for Inspector Lee. At first, Carter thinks that he has been rewarded for his model conduct. Later, he realizes that his captain loaned him out to the FBI as punishment. Now, everybody is laughing at Carter's expense. When he learns that the FBI is using him to keep Inspector Lee out of their hair as well as harm's way, he sets out to solve the case himself.Meantime, Inspector Lee adores little Soo Yung. She was one of his students before she left with her father for America. Lee makes finding her a personal quest, and he refuses to let Carter thwart him. You get to see the softer side of Jackie Chan in ""Rush Hour."" When Chan and Tucker team up to interrogate bad guy Clive, Clive rats out the bad guys when Jackie melts his heart with a photo of Soo Yung. Furthermore, Jackie doesn't kill anybody in ""Rush Hour."" What he does best is battle off huge numbers of thugs. Jackie's best scene occurs at the end when he splits his time between fighting the villains and trying to save priceless Chinese artifacts from destruction.The measure of any great actioneer is the villainy over which the heroes must triumph. Although the villains have outlandish monetary demands, they never perform mean-spirited acts of violence. Rarely do they serious jeopardize the lives of our police protagonists. Instead, Carter and Lee spend more time clashing with each other than the villains. The worst the villains do is strap the little girl into a vest stitched with C-4. Essentially, these adversaries pose a little threat. As one of Hong Kong's most powerful crime lords in the Juntao, chief villain (Tom Wilkerson of ""The Patriot"") only shows his audacity at the end when he guns down several FBI agents in cold blood. The antagonists barely make the grade with their adversarial behavior. They are a dull and dreary lot, noting like Jet Li in ""Lethal Weapon 4."" Brett Ratner directs ""Rush Hour"" with the brisk efficiency of a traffic cop. Indeed, Ratner keeps this East meets West potboiler on track, but he displays little visual storytelling flair. This would change with the top-notch ""Rush Hour 2"" and then reappear with ""Rush Hour 3."" Ratner, who shot 75 music videos before graduating to the movies, doesn't create much rhythm or punch in his film-making. Sadly, thespians such as Oscar-winner Tom Wilkerson, Chris Penn, and Elizabeth Pena are squandered n secondary roles. If you enjoy Jack Chan flicks, ""Rush Hour"" is tolerable, but it's a shame that the filmmakers didn't match the caliber of Chan's more lavishly produced pictures.",Rush Hour
12,Calicodreamin,Endlessly funny,10,20 July 2019,"One of my all time favorite movies. The dynamic duo of Chan and Tucker is timeless, you can watch over and over and still laugh. The LA laid back vibe of James Carter paired with the by the book badass ninja of Lee makes for an awesome experience. The most quotable movie of all time, ""it's not you all, it's y'all""",Rush Hour
13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,A good buddy movie,7,25 October 2003,"Even though this movie might be a bit conventional, it's thoroughly entertaining, with nice action scenes, cool martial arts fighting & a good sense of humor. I didn't find any of it boring. It's a good concept, to combine the humor of Chris Tucker with the martial arts of Jackie Chan. This movie is for anyone who's into action, martial arts & humor. 7/10",Rush Hour
14,view_and_review,Tucker is Hilarious,7,26 November 2020,"The Chinese consul to America has had his daughter kidnapped and the kidnapper wants $50M. To help find his daughter he requests Detective Lee (Jackie Chan) from Hong Kong. The FBI doesn't want an outside agency sniffing around their active situation, so they request a liaison (babysitter) from the LAPD. For the role of tour guide the LAPD sends them Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker).Carter is a loud mouth, a braggart, and generally annoying to everyone he encounters. If anything has gone wrong then usually he is the culprit. Lee is the straight man. He's by the book and he's highly effective. The two of them are trying to find Juntao, a crimelord from China who has brought his criminal ways to America. If they can find him, then they might just be able to find the consul's daughter.This was a breakout movie for both actors. Chan had been around a lot longer than Tucker doing mostly Hong Kong movies, but he'd never had a hit like this one before. Tucker had ""Friday,"" ""Dead Presidents,"" and ""Money Talks"" to his credit; good movies, but not blockbusters. Yes this may be another buddy cop movie, but Chris Tucker is hilarious. And that's the difference.",Rush Hour
15,anaconda-40658,Great comedic Leads. Lousy Screenplay.,5,6 November 2015,"Rush Hour (1998): Dir: Brett Ratner / Cast: Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, Elizabeth Pena, Tom Wilkinson, Ken Leung: Overrated action farce full of clichés. Title indicates my desire to leave the theatre before the presentation was over. Actually, it regards time and territory but unfortunately the plot is just an excuse for Chris Tucker to bad mouth people and for Jackie Chan to display incredible stunts. They investigate the kidnapping of a girl whom Chan is familiar with. What follows is an encore of wise cracks by Tucker and stunts by Chan. Directed by Brett Ratner with sets and locations that spark little enthusiasm. Ratner previously collaborated with Tucker with Money Talks. Chan and Tucker have an excellent chemistry together and it upholds the conclusion when they must work through crucial moments. This is a good thing since the rest of the film pretty much sucks. Supporting cast portray a host of stereotypes that are less interesting than the script their thrown within. Elizabeth Pena is featured, and Tom Wilkinson who is capable of better things than this. It exists as the umpteenth buddy flick and aside from the leads, this is hardly progressing forward. There have been examples where buddy films have worked even in the action genre but here only the two stars are left to support a lot of dead weight within a screenplay that cannot bare much. Score: 5 / 10",Rush Hour
16,FlashCallahan,I am not Carl Lewis.....,6,26 May 2013,"Detective Inspector Lee, close friend to Consul Solon, manages to prevent precious pieces of China's history being smuggled out of the country. Two years later, Consul Solon is living in L.A with his family, but a Crime Lord takes revenge on him by abducting his young daughter.

His assignment is to keep Lee as far away from trouble as possible. But Carter and Lee don't like being put aside in that way and start working the case on their own....Buddy Cop Movies were done to death in the eighties and nineties, and in my opinion, the benchmark is still Lethal weapon, and it's sequel. I didn't really have high hopes for this though. Chan is great, but at the time of this release, all of his back catalogue movies were being re- released for some reason, and Tucker killed the Fifth Element, so this was as good as rubbish to me.And while the film has an element of Deja vu to it, it entertains, and the two leads are pretty good in their respective roles. Granted, it's no lethal Weapon, in fact, it's no Tango and cash, as they don't need to rely on exposition to keep the narrative going, and are always good for a repeat viewing.This is throwaway stuff, tarnished by really awful sequels, but the fight scenes are great as expected.",Rush Hour

19,Smells_Like_Cheese,Chris Tucker at his best!,8,5 November 2003,"Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan, the best comedic duo since Lethal Weapon bring us Rush Hour. A classic action movie that brings great action as well as awesome comedy that makes you laugh every minute. Chris Tucker has always been one of my favorite comedians, even before I saw Rush Hour, so it was great to see him in Rush Hour. I know a lot of people find him annoying, but I thought he was just so funny. He showed off his talents in Rush Hour. Not only him, but this is the film that is making Jackie Chan into a world wide super star. His stunts are simply incredible. Rush Hour is one of those very fun action/comedy movies that I'm sure you'll enjoy if you love movies like Lethal Weapon or 48 Hours. The story was just pure entertainment and really kept me on the edge.Lee is a body guard to the Chinese ambassador and is also a close friend, he also is a teacher to his daughter, Soo Yong. The ambassador goes to the United States with his daughter, but she is kidnapped by an evil man of the Chinese Consol. They want 50 million dollars in return, but the ambassador thinks that Lee should be involved, so he sends for him, but the F.B.I. doesn't want him near the case. So they hire L.A.P.D. screw up, James Carter, to babysit him. But together, the fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west, they must learn to work together despite their complete opposite personalities and get the girl back.Rush Hour is a guaranteed classic down the lines somewhere, I'm sure. It's already spawned a sequel and it's been a success. Chris and Jackie are such a great team, I was really impressed with their chemistry. My favorite scene is where Lee plays ""War"" by Edwin Starr in Carter's car, and he doesn't know how to say the lyrics correctly, and Carter shows him some moves, it was such a classic scene that brought me down to the floor laughing. I highly recommend Rush Hour, it's all in good fun and it'll give you more than a few good laughs.8/10",Rush Hour

21,OllieSuave-007,A rush-paced and quick-action comedy!,8,17 February 2014,"This is one fast-paced and quick-action comedy, where Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker star as detectives where their cultures clash. Big-mouth and overly confident LAPD Detective James Carter (Tucker) thought he was working on a classified case to find the kidnapped daughter of the Chinese Consul with the FBI, but instead found out he is supposed to keep Hong Kong Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) from interfering in the case on his own term. What follows is a hilarious game of mismatch and quick humor as Carter and Lee try to get along with each other and attempt to join forces to save kidnapped daughter Soo-Yung.There is an endless supply of racial and racy comments coming from Tucker's all-talk and wise-cracking mouth but it's funny to see Lee counteract with his all-action and no-nonsense personality. But, both have great chemistry on screen together and will give you endless laughs and entertainment. This movie has a solid plot that I find enjoyable and good acting that keeps the film interesting.Overall, one of the best action-comedies I've seen and one that will keep you laughing and holding on your seat at the same time.Grade B+",Rush Hour

With just the first viewing (of future many) I wasn't let down. For a single minute.I sincerely love this movie, and ranks as my second favorite buddy/cop movie behind Lethal Weapon 2. Only some slight flaws cause it to lose a full 5/5 stars, but then rarely is a movie perfect.Super Cop Lee (Chan) in Hong Kong is summoned to the USA after Consul Han's (Ma) daughter is kidnapped. Since the F.B.I. doesn't wish to use outsider Lee's help, they team him with ""I don't want a partner"" LAPD cop Carter (Tucker,) not that anyone would have such a loose cannon.Yes, I realize this is predictable and as unoriginal as it comes, however, if not for the fantastic quick wit of Tucker and the fantastic quick punch & creativity of Chan, none of this would work.At any rate, they team, Lee fights and Carter uses every available to investigate the daughter's disappearance while uncovering a conspiracy. All to an exciting finale using both Chan and Tucker's charm and talents.I'm not doing this movie much justice, but suffice to say, each and every time I've seen this, I have been rolling with laughter and excited with all of Chan's enormously original fight/flight sequences. This is a must-see for fans of comedy, heart, action, adventure and, of course, buddy/cop films. I could watch this movie a hundred times and still get the same effect. I probably have already.",Rush Hour

Jackie Chan does a bunch of his terrific, Buster Keaton-ish fights, cleverly using props and unexpected moves. Chris Tucker plays his unwilling partner, who is an absolute idiot. I find Tucker a bit problematic, in that I found him annoying - he reads every line like a stand-up comic trying to wake up a 3 a.m. crowd - but I also found him really funny. A lot of what happens in the movie is really, really stupid, particularly in the way the movie gets Chan into fights that includes his inexplicably picking a fight with the FBI and a bunch of barflies making the unlikely choice to attack the weird guy at the bar who clearly had no idea what he was doing. A better script would have been nice, but the great action and frequent laughs make this an excellent bit of popcorn filmmaking.",Rush Hour

In preference between this and his previous film Mr.Nice Guy,the only thing I preferred about this was that Chan's voice was'nt horribly dubbed.The central story was pathetic. Everyone had a jokey,unbelievable and implausible attitude towards a young girl's life being held at stake.The moral banter was also crap,we even have to listen to Chan sing.

26,ThomasDrufke,Other Guys Meets 21 Jump Street,7,17 May 2015,"Yes, it did take me this long to see the movie. I was hesitant for so long because these movies are not my niche. I don't normally like goofy buddy cop movies, but this along with the 21 Jump Street series, has been an exception. With comedies, you need to feel fresh with your bits, and create a unique bond of chemistry between your leads. We have seen it fail too many times before so I was glad to see that Rush Hour nailed it for its time.Coming out in 1998, I'm not sure we had seen any black male and Asian male take the leads in a film together. Usually its a risk financially for studios (it shouldn't be, but it is). But Jackie Chan, being the international star that he was, and Chris Tucker being at the peak of his comedic stardom, it was definitely a good fit. And they ended up having a lot of chemistry. It was really funny watching the two learn about each others ways of living and the endless amount of inappropriate racial jokes. Some can definitely be considered offensive, but knowing its just a movie, I couldn't help myself but laugh a few times. I honestly didn't see myself liking the film after the first few scenes with Tucker. His voice is exaggeratingly high pitched and it was hard to get over at first. I think you just cant take the movie too seriously. If you just have fun with it and turn your brain off for 90 minutes, it can be an enjoyable time.Knowing that there are two more, and possibly a third on the way, of the franchise, I will watch the others shortly. There's nothing special about the film, but I had fun with it. Not to mention the fact that seeing Brett Ratner's name in the opening credits as the director was a big turn off (thanks for X-Men 3), but hey it was better than I expected.+Chemistry between Chan and Tucker +The dynamic creates funny moments/jokes +Mindless fun -Nothing too original -Tucker's voice7.0/10",Rush Hour

Well he was great with his English here as well as his physical action. Chris Tucker is also pretty good as the smack-talking black cop sidekick. I haven't seen much of him but he seems pretty funny.Basically these are about two cops who don't get along and their mission is to save the daughter of the Chinese consul.As I mentioned above, the acting is pretty good.

Chris Tucker was bad enough when he was in the Fifth Element but someone's decision to put him in another movie and pair him up with Jackie Chan was certainly a wrong one. It's cool to see and hear Jackie speak English but every time Tucker opened his mouth everyone in the audience squirmed. I haven't seen such nausea since THE CARE BEARS MOVIE 2.The plot (?) in this film is pure, unimaginative and uninspired trash and the title is also completely meaningless. There is NO rush hour and just because Jun Tao's sidekick says that it's rush hour in a very short scene (even when there's no traffic) there is no reason for this film to have such a useless name. The writers (did this have any) didn't care much about naming there baby.I would need 10 hands to count the amount of movies that I have seen that end with the bad guy's suitcase full of money (highly clichéd) raining down on the hero. The action is clumsy and badly handled. Even Chan's acrobatics lack the edge they have in his Cantonese movies. This may have been a cool movie if John Woo had directed it and dragged it out of the gutter but Brett Ratner cannot direct even traffic. Especially at rush hour.",Rush Hour

32,The-Sarkologist,Jackie Chan's first Hollywood Blockbuster,7,9 November 2013,"This is Jackie Chan's first big budget Hollywood movie and I think it succeeds in what it sets out to do, introduce Jackie Chan, a cult Hong Kong actor-director, into the world of Hollywood. Chan has appeared in other Hollywood movies, but this is the first that he is one of the major stars. Rush Hour successfully mixes Hollywood sensationalism with the fight scenes and the stunts we expect from Jackie Chan.Basically a girl, who is one of Chan's students, moves to the United States as her father is a Chinese Ambassador. Chan and this guy recently destroyed the assets of a major crime ring, Juntao, including retrieving millions of dollars of Chinese art. In response Juntao kidnaps the ambassador's daughter and demands fifty million dollars in exchange. The ambassador calls Chan over from Hong Kong to help, but the FBI doesn't want him involved, so they set him up with a rather pathetic cop (Chris Tucker) and keep them occupied while the FBI goes on trying to solve the case. As is typical for Hollywood, these mismatched cops decided to go and solve the case on their own.As is typical for most Jackie Chan movies, we watch it for the action, though this movie has been very Hollywoodised meaning that the action we expect from a Jackie Chan movie is not a prevalent as in something like Police Story. I liked the movie and thought that it did capture the essence of Chan, and co-starring him with a loud mouthed cop made a very interesting team. It is interesting they chose Chris Tucker because he is a relative unknown, but I guess it was so that he did not upstage Jackie Chan. If it was Eddie Murphy, which I reckon would have been even better, there is a possibility that Eddie would have upstaged Jackie. I did find that our attention was drawn more to Chris Tucker because he spoke too much. Yet, as is typical with Jackie Chan, there is generally one stunt with is seriously deadly, and it usually involves falling from a great height.The strange thing about this movie is that Jackie Chan did seem to be out of his element. When we consider movies like Project A and Police Story, Jackie seems to fall into place quite easily, but then he did direct both of those movies. With Rush Hour though he did seem to look a bit out of place. It is as if that Hollywood is not really ready for the style of movie that comes from Hong Kong, but with the exodus of filmmakers from Hong Kong to America, maybe there is going to be a change in the near future.",Rush Hour
33,briancham1994,I can't watch Chris Tucker,3,3 June 2020,"I get it, the whole point of the premise is the interaction of Jackie Chan's straight Hong Kong professional and Chris Tucker's irreverent Los Angeles jackass. They have extremely different characters and humour on purpose. But, I'm sorry, I just can't watch Chris Tucker, he's too obnoxious and loud. I did not find him funny at all. Other than that, the story was totally flat and predictable, so nothing else made up for it.

So its up to Tucker and Lee to save the little girl from the two baddies. But someone else could be behind it too?Overall I found this film hilarious. The cast was great especially Jackie Chan who is one of my favorite actors as he is an expert at martial arts and Chris Tucker literally stole everything in this movie with his high-pitched voice and his witty persona.The action sequences were great and bottom line I enjoyed it.If you haven't seen it be sure and check it out.",Rush Hour

These are the odd couple of buddy cops, since Starsky & Hutch, Lethal Weapon, and countless others. However it's more East& West. You got Carter(Chris Tucker), a quick-mouthed policeman who don't believe in partners. All the way from Hong Kong, you got Inspector Lee(Jackie Chan) who happens to be fast with his hands. Put those two together what do you get? Side-splitting comedy that will last you for a lifetime. First, they couldn't stand one another, but when they exchange their moves, a mutual understanding blossoms and the partnership is in the making. Though Tucker is no martial artist, he is a quick learner when his fists are not enough to tackle the bad guys. Ansd those leap kicks were good enough to wipe out the bad guys. I think going to Hong Kong would be best for Carter since he had such let downs in L.A. would best for him. This is a beginning of a beautiful friendship. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.",Rush Hour
36,thinker1691,""" I Never said I didn't speak your language, you only assumed it """,7,3 December 2013,""" Rush Hour "" is based on a story written by Ross LaManna and directed by Brett Ratner. It's a simple story about a newly appointed Chinese Consulate named Han (Tzi Ma) who's 11 year old daughter is kidnapped by Mr. Griffin (Tom Wilkinson, great acting) a disenchanted, scheming and manipulative former Consulate. With the help of Sang (Ken Leung) a Chinese crime Lord, the two conspired to hold the daughter for $50,000,000 ransom. Not trusting the F.B.I. to insure his daughter's life, Han recruits his own Chinese Police Officer named Lee (Jackie Chan). Assigned to rescue the girl, the American F.B.I tries to prevent the L.A. Police from interfering by selecting an obnoxious, loud mouth, street smart detective (Chris Tucker) to go on a wild goose chase with Lee. The two cops although begin as bickering partners, soon realize they must work together to save the kidnapped girl. There is much drama and suspicious intrigue between official law enforcement and the criminal gangs and this leads to an equal amount of distrust, violence and exciting confrontations by all. Indeed, there are fights, shootings, car chases, explosions and an abundance of physical confrontations. With Jackie Chan supplying his amazing mystical stunts and Tucker providing the wit and humor which he brings to the film, it's sure to create a memorable movie which should be enjoyed by all audiences. Recommended. ****",Rush Hour

Rush Hour was funny, Rush Hour 2 and especially 3 where horrible.Really it's like Lethal Weapon, or, in fact, it's like just about any buddy cop movie where the duo is salt and pepper and entirely mismatched. And those movies are usually always fun in any action or comedy genre... except when it comes to the ones with the dogs.So you have the chemistry with a solid cultural and language barrier ala Red Heat.The difference is that this amps up the comedy to, honestly, to a point that is utterly hysterical. Especially given the clear chemistry between Chan and Tucker. The timing is great and the out takes are even better. It's a hysterical pleasure to watch...... just stay away from the sequels because, honestly, I don't know what happened there.",Rush Hour

Almost nothing in the film is original, so we can't go walking into this expecting ""The Godfather."" And because the film knows this, it has no choice but to shift its focus to the comradeship between the two leads, Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker.The film opens in Hong Kong, as Britain prepares to return government control back over to the Chinese, and Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) is on the verge of shutting down the Juntao criminal organization, but his collar Sang (Ken Leung) gets away, as does the elusive eponymous crime lord Juntao.Fast-forward two months later and we're now in Los Angeles, where Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) messes up while trying to make a bust. He's later enlisted by the F.B.I. on a bogus assignment when the Chinese consulate's daughter is kidnapped, and Carter and Lee are forced to work together to solve the kidnapping.That's about all there is to the plot and that's all we need to know. The film's fun comes from the acting and leading charm of Chan and Tucker, who both make the movie all that more enjoyable and funny.

Juntao (Tom Wilkinson) kind of gave me the creeps. You'll understand why once you've seen this movie. I got really scared when Soo Yung (Julia Hsu) was kidnapped. To me, Carter (Chris Tucker) and Lee (Jackie Chan) were very tough and funny guys. In my opinion, the performances were top grade, the direction was superior, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the cast was perfectly chosen. Also, the soundtrack is really good, too. Before I wrap this up, I must warn you that this movie is very violent if you're going to see it, so viewer discretion is strongly advised.

43,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Good action and jokes for a film based on stereotypes,8,17 June 2012,"Buddy cop films are major attention grabbers for audiences who love odd pairings of individuals. For every movie that relies on this type of comedy, the two that star in this film require a trait that's totally different from the other. The other trait that these characters have is that they are both extremely good at their career. Once they recognize that they have that in common, character development occurs. Director Brett Ratner has this in the film, but it makes a point of being different from the usual.Rush Hour is the story of when two cops, from two different areas of the world, come together to solve a big case. Chinese officer, Lee (Jackie Chan), has been chasing down a crime lord until the man he works for has his child kidnapped by the villain and taken to America. American officer, Carter (Chris Tucker), has been nothing but trouble to L.A. police department. His last case almost got him suspended until he gets a call from the F.B.I. to do a special job for them. The job is the same as Lee's job, and that's how these two characters end up working together.Tucker is great as a self-centered, obnoxious, loud-mouthed jerk. Amazing enough is that his character is quite alluring for the amount of trash talk that he uses. So much of the talk is stereotypical statements: ""Don't ever touch a black man's radio!"".Sure that's funny. But replacing the word ""a black man's"" with the word ""my"", or ""Carter's"" is just as comical. There should be no reason to generalize statements. And Carter says more than just that. How is someone like that even hired into a police department? Police departments have moral codes for their officers. It even questions the standards of the L.A.P.D.Chan is always fun to watch. His fighting techniques are well developed and they're even funnier when he has to improvise on the spot. To come up with such ways of getting his way around, it's impressive. And although Chan is known for being the master of action, Tucker has his moments too. He may not have a fighting style but it's gratifying to see that screenwriter, Jim Kouf, allowed the characters of Lee and Carter to evolve in a mutual relationship. Carter even learned some new moves and he reciprocates them and even impresses his partner.Much of these exchanges are funny. Carter's mouth couldn't be any louder and Lee's hands couldn't be any faster. But audiences may still be lost in that their exchanges are not as hysterical as they should be. I had my chuckles and small laughs, but I never burst out laughing. I wanted to but the power of these two actors just couldn't bring enough laughs to the screen and it was disappointing. Lalo Schifrin composed the film score and it slightly reminisces the theme from The Mean Season (1985) with its trumpet in the background. It is another buddy cop movie, but its marginal use of stereotypical comments gives its audiences a different experience. However, it may not generate as many laughs as expected.",Rush Hour
44,Rob_Taylor,"Not half bad, even with Chris Rock",7,5 September 2004,"Chris Rock, or Squealer as I often think of him, is not one of my most favourite actors. His insistence on high-pitched nasal whining and eye-rolling wear thin quite rapidly in most films he's in.However, in Rush Hour he's not too bad. Or at least bearable. Plus he does get some genuinely funny lines and scenes to play out and doesn't have to rely on his manic expressions to get him through.Of course the presence of Jackie Chan makes even a dull film enjoyable, if only for his ridiculous stunts and fight scenes. They can never be considered boring. Coupled with Rock's madness this movies comes together quite well as an actioner and is never dull.Despite the enjoyable nature of the film I watched it with a little sadness also, because I can see, in Chan's stunts, a ""downgrading"" of the craziness from his earlier works (esp. Police Story, Armour of God etc.) in favour of ""safer"" stunts. Safer for him that is, but insane for anyone else. Nevertheless, this toning down surely marks the end of a great stunt career as Chan gets older. He's still great to watch, and funny as hell, but there will come a time when he just can't do the stuff anymore.In fact, a couple of recent films, ""Around the World in 80 Days"" and ""The Tuxedo"" surely mark the low-point of his career in terms of stunts, though the comedy is still there in abundance. I hope he is able to make the transition from action to comedy (if that's his plan) better than Arnold did with his attempts.But as for Rush Hour, it's a pleasant enough way to spend 90 minutes or so.",Rush Hour
45,PredragReviews,"""...which one of y'all kicked me?""",9,9 May 2016,"Chris Tucker makes this film. Although Jackie Chan is amazing, Chris Tucker is the real star, a real 'brother' with heaps of attitude and some of the funniest lines in film history. this video was the soundtrack to the summer of 2000. Tucker and Chan really seem to have enjoyed themselves, and they sort of live up to the American stereotype of a cop duo. Jackie's moves are beautifully choreographed and make it look simple, but every move is timed to perfection, making this look like a ballet rather than a dangerous fight with millions of Dollars worth of vase. Chris is also very good as loud mouthed Carter, who really does want to help Lee, but wants to be noticed by the FBI, and others around him. Great fight scenes make this a great film. The fights are superb, and also comical. The two cops (Chan and Tucker) are complete opposites of each other. Tucker has a quick mouth, Chan has quick hands.Probably the main reason for this films huge success is the brilliant teaming of Jackie Chan and the hilarious Chris Tucker. The fastest hands in the east, meet the biggest mouth in the west. Thus giving the audience exactly the right amounts of both action (mainly from Chan) and comedy (mainly from Tucker), and therefore providing for every type of audience. However, once Chan gets a chance to show us what he can do I'm more than happy.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Rush Hour

I liked the interaction between Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan. Tucker is very good as the loud mouth screw up who doesn't like to work with a partner and Jackie Chan is very impressive with all his moves. Together they are very nice as the mismatched crime fighters, not only fighting crime but also the culture shock between China and America.I wouldn't recommend it if you want to see a highly intelligent movie, but if you just want to have some fun, this is worth a watch.

48,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"While over-reliant on the classic clichés and tropes of the 'Buddy Cop' genre, ""Rush Hour"" rises above the rest with some great performances and a nice culture-clash plot.",8,24 November 2013,"15 years ago, director Brett Ratner and stars Jackie Chan & Chris Tucker unleashed the first film in the ""Rush Hour"" series unto the masses. And it is pretty incredible that looking back over a decade later, the film still holds up not only in terms of great humor and good performances, but also from a stylistic and craftsmanship standpoint. The film has an oddly timeless feeling, adding much to its appeal and charm as one of the better ""Buddy Cop"" films to emerge in the past 20 years.Chan stars as Detective Inspector Lee, a Hong Kong Police Officer who is brought to the US to help his friend, a Chinese Consul whose daughter has been kidnapped. However, the FBI, not wanting to deal with Lee, instead trick loud-mouthed and reckless Los Angeles Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) into becoming Lee's ""babysitter"" to keep him out of trouble. However, Lee's steadfast dedication to his duty soon brings the two mis-matched officers back into the case, and they realize they may be the only one's capable of saving the kidnapped child.Chan and Tucker's performances and chemistry are the beating heart of the film, and are what makes it function and come off so well. Chan is renowned over the world for his incredible martial-arts and stunt sequences, and this film is no exception to that. (Although I will contend that this is one of his tamer films in terms of stunts, although he still does some amazing things in it) But what many people seem to ignore is that he is a great, expressive actor with a Chaplin or Buster Keaton-like appeal and style. Chan is a joy to watch in this film, and he is able to deliver the thrills, laughs and suspense perfectly. Tucker is also a lot of fun as a wise-cracking, loud-mouthed, and foolhardy detective Carter. He does have a lot of good laughs, and is able to bring a balance to the table against Chan's more stoic style. He's also a lot more ""zany"" and almost cartoonish, which balances well with Chan's almost silent-film quality. The two actors compliment each other perfectly in this film, and are a joy to see together.Other performances are good all around. Tom Wilkinson pulls a great role as British Commander. Tzi Ma is sympathetic as the father of the kidnapped child, and grounds the film quite nicely, keeping the story centered and with an emotional core. Ken Leung is great as ""Sang"", an eerie, stoic villain. Elizabeth Pena is a lot of fun as Carter's fellow officer. Everyone meshes well in this movie.Production-wise, the film is fantastic. While director Ratner's reputation has been tarnished slightly in recent years due to some controversies and a few poorly received films, he is still a talented visual artist, and his choice of shots, compositions, etc. is top notch here. The one thing I will admit that I enjoy about Ratner's direction is that he tends to present things in a timeless, clean and well- composed way. He doesn't rely on cheap tricks or trendy camera work to tell his stories, which helps out a lot here. The music score by Lalo Schifrin is a complete and total blast, and very much aids the film's timeless quality, feeling both vintage and new all at once. And everything else, from the set and costume design to the script writing by Ross Lamanna and Jim Kouf works well. The humor is also mostly full of hits, making the film a fast, enjoyable watch.My only slight complaint is that the film never quite escapes from the tropes and clichés of the ""Buddy Cop"" genre of film. Which is a slight downfall in an otherwise enjoyable film- we know pretty much everything that is going to happen from the first few minutes, and it does rob some of the suspense. But even that cannot diminish the fun performances and good filmmaking behind this movie.""Rush Hour"" may not be the best film ever made, but it's a blast to watch, and has excellent entertainment value. While its reputation has been somewhat pulled down by two inferior sequels, the first ""Rush Hour"" is still a good bit of fun and is well worth checking out.

I mean I like Carter(Chris Tucker)but I hate Lee(Jackie Chan). Now I mostly hate Lee because Jackie Chan can't act. So he proved in every film he is in, like Rush Hour 2, which is the weakest in the series because Jackie Chan can't act. I think Chris Tucker is funny in both films, but Jackie Chan sucks. Jackie Chan is meant to do action, but there is the word act in action. So perhaps the studios and Brett Ratner, who is a bad director, mixed up acting and action. That means that you are a total idiot. The Rush Hour series would be perfect, almost, if Jackie Chan wasn't in it. Rush Hour is a likable film that is funny at most times of the film. I know it could've been better but it's the best in the Rush Hour series. It's silly at times but don't blame Chris Tucker or any of the other people, blame Jackie Chan and Brett Ratner.The Plot: Lee is a tough cop from Hong Kong. Carter is a loud mouthed cop from L.A. The two are brought together when Counsel Han's daughter is kidnapped.",Rush Hour
53,Angelus2,"""What did you just say?""",10,31 October 2008,"Jackie Chan before Rush Hour was already a cult phenomenon, an icon of Kung-Fu movies and a figure capable of standing toe to toe with Bruce Lee as one of the greats.Rush Hour is unlike any of Jackie earlier movies, here he combines his physical comedy with Chris Tuckers verbal and a force to be reckoned with is created in the process. Rush Hour is a buddy cop movie with tons of laughs; Lee is a Hong Kong detective who has been flown over to the USA to help the FBI in rescuing his friends daughter; a girl who is almost like his own. Here he is placed in the care of Carter, a cop with disregard for rules and so the two combined comb LA for the girl and the Triad responsible for kidnapping the girl.The laugh come one after another and will never cease to stop, Jackie Chan is almost out shone by Chris Tucker who is just plain hilarious with his one liners and his kung-fu impression....However Jackie does not disappoint, he wows the western audience with his amazing martial art choreography that made him an international star.This film is just plain hilarious and works.....The greatest Jackie Chan movie of all...",Rush Hour
54,areatw,"Watchable, thanks to Tucker & Chan",5,3 June 2017,"'Rush Hour' is an average, generic action/comedy movie that is saved by the duo of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan, who are frankly the only thing about this film that makes it somewhat interesting. The storyline is weak and lacking imagination, especially for an action film.Tucker and Chan's chemistry and their on-screen relationship is by far the best thing about this film. For a so-called comedy, the script isn't particularly funny and any amusing moments are mostly down to Tucker and Chan acting silly. That's as far as the positives extend, everything else about this film is very average.",Rush Hour
55,TheUnknown837-1,Jackie Chan + Chris Tucker = lots of fun and lots of laughs,7,27 January 2008,"""Rush Hour"" is the kind of comedy-action flick that I tend to enjoy above all others. It's not too serious, it's not too comical, it's right in the middle where the highest level of entertainment value can be found in a funny martial arts movie. The film is not afraid to be a little violent, but it's not calm enough to avoid it either. The two stars of the film, martial arts master Jackie Chan and comedian Chris Tucker make a great team for the big screen. Each one has their own particular and appealing quality that catches our attention. But when the two of them are put together on screen, the audience willingly embraces the film.The stunt work and action scenes in ""Rush Hour"" and magnificently done and stunningly realistic. The stunt coordinators and sound technicians combined their efforts to make every punch and kick appear to be striking the target dead on and there are some great moments where Chan would scale up walls, swing through windows from rails, use tolls in his environment for defense, and other great moments. There are also a fair share of shootouts, which look great enough. Hits look like real hits, but the violence doesn't overplay itself so that it becomes too horrifying for young children.There is also Chris Tucker's almost effortless performance at playing a funny character. Tucker's high-pitched voice, facial expressions, and well-written lines in the screenplay bring about several laughs which keep us entertained whenever there's not a karate fight going on before us.Bottom line, ""Rush Hour"" is a very effective comedy-action film that stands high above others that were made before it and still to this day try to imitate its effective style. The main point is that Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker make a great team for entertaining an audience. And under the direction of Brett Ratner, they do their job flawlessly.",Rush Hour
56,vithiet,"Good, basic buddy cop action comedy",7,21 June 2020,"This feels very typical of the late 90s with some added Jackie Chan flavor. I liked it when it came out and it hasn't aged too badly.

60,fernandoschiavi,"Despite some flawed points in the script, the film works because of the rapport between the Tucker/Chan duo, the humor and the excellent choreographed action sequences",7,17 October 2020,"The genre ""buddy cop"" had already proved in theaters that it was a formula that worked, with its greatest exponent being the ""Deadly Machine"" franchise, which, incidentally, arrived in its fourth and final episode in the same year that ""Rush Hour"" was released. "". The formula is quite simple: bring together two officers of very different styles and personalities and place you in the middle of an action-packed investigation. Rush Hour began as a specific script written in 1995 by screenwriter Ross LaManna. The script was sold by William Morris of LaManna's agent, Alan Gasmer, to Hollywood Pictures, a division of the Walt Disney Company, with Arthur Sarkissian added as producer.After hiring director Ratner and developing the project for more than a year with producers like Sarkissian, Jonathan Glickman and Roger Birnbaum, Disney Studios boss Joe Roth turned the project around, citing concerns about the $ 34 million budget and Chan's appeal to the American public. At the time, Martin Lawrence was connected to the project. Several studios were interested in acquiring the project. New Line Cinema was confident in Ratner, having done Money Talks with him, so they committed to a budget and a Rush Hour start date. After Rumble's success in the Bronx, Brett Ratner wanted to put Jackie Chan in a thriller, not as a co-star or helper, but on an equal footing with an American star. Ratner flew to South Africa, where Chan was filming and presented the film. A few days later, Chan agreed to star in the film and not long after flew to Los Angeles and met Chris Tucker. Ratner credited Tucker with obtaining his first feature film, Money Talks, and thought Tucker and Chan would make a great team.In Hong Kong, on the last night of British control over the site, Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan), a close friend of Consul Han (Tzi Ma), manages to prevent precious pieces of China's history from being smuggled out of the country. Two years later, crime boss Juntao (Tom Wilkinson) decides to take revenge and kidnaps Han's daughter, who now lives in Los Angeles as a Chinese diplomat. Since he doesn't trust the FBI, Han calls Lee to help him rescue his daughter. But FBI officials do not want any outside help in the case and, to prevent Lee from getting in the way of investigations, they appoint a rebel and talkative detective, James Carter (Chris Tucker), to accompany him. The FBI's intention is for Carter to keep Lee as far away from the case as possible, but he doesn't know that. Until, when Carter finds out the real intention of his assignment in the case, he decides to help Lee to finally find the kidnapped girl.Knowing how to explore the best qualities of comedians was a big hit in the inspired script by Ross LaManna and Jim Kouf. Jackie plays Lee, a trusted inspector for the newly appointed Chinese diplomat consul in the U.S. When the official representative's daughter is kidnapped in Los Angeles, Lee is called in to personally assist in investigations against the FBI's will. Jackie's arrival in America also marks his first role in the English language, a necessary factor to accompany the incessant chatter of Agent Carter, his partner in the feature. Tucker's character is a big-time member of the Los Angeles police department who is called to the case, but with the sole purpose of distracting and removing the unwanted Chinese inspector from the investigation. The ungrateful assignment touches Carter's pride, who then decides to solve the kidnapping alone, only with Lee in tow.Carter's surprise at discovering Inspector Lee's skills is similar to that of the large world audience, who until then had been unaware of Jackie Chan's work, since the reach of Asian cinema was not as great as that of Hollywood. The Chinese choreograph and perform their own fight scenes without any stunt, even in the most dangerous parts. Above that, his differential is still in the charisma of the shy smile and the awkwardness that appears both in the performance and in the style of the fights, when using any improvised object against the enemies and preferring hand to hand combat to the use of weapons. Such characteristics make Jackie's persona look like that of an ordinary man, favoring the identification of the audience and justifying his position as one of the most successful artists in cinema.
The director Brett Ratner does an excellent job, both in the comics and in the action. While the ""Rush Hour"" action revolves around Chan with scenes involving creative and extremely well-choreographed struggles, the comic center stays with Tucker, who fits joke after joke with his hysterical way of the well-meaning idiot who doesn't know how to stay quiet. As a spectator, it is difficult to differentiate when the expressive actor's memorable phrases appear from the script or are offhand, but the result is always hilarious. The chatterer lines up references to names, dances and pop culture songs and still has space to stage a reference to ""The Seven Samurai"", when he doesn't see where a coup like the drunken samurai from Kurosawa came from. Allusions to Asian cinema are also present in the setting up of the prologue in Hong Kong, in the instrumental composition of the score and, of course, in the plot and gags imported from previous films by Jackie Chan himself.The feature is different from others in the genre for being able to create its own style through a very interesting mix, which even gave rise to others similar, changing only the time and setting, such as ""Hit or Run"", also starring Jackie Chan shortly afterwards. In addition to the opposites that complement each other very well, the insertion of jokes and situations related to cultural differences gains space, as it could not be otherwise. While Detective Carter makes fun of the American way of living compared to Orientals, of blacks ""Never touch a black man's radio"", and of the periphery in general, Detective Lee shows a typical Chinese food for Carter to eat.The great chemistry between the characters of Jackie and Chris, both in the dialogues and in the action scenes, brings to ""Rush Hour"" a sweet and fun essence that sets it apart from other titles that combine comedy and martial arts. Brand of Chan's films, the display of recording errors (bloopers) during the credits, to end the film experience with a positive beat, here it wouldn't even be necessary due to the more than pleasant final result. The interesting thing is that years later, Chan stated in an interview that, when he did this first part of the franchise, he just wanted to test the North American film market and that he did not have high expectations: ""When we finished filming, I felt very disappointed, because it wasn't a movie I liked and I didn't want the action scenes involved. I felt that the action style was very Americanized, and I didn't understand American humor,"" said the actor in a blog on his website.Rush Hour was Chan's first film to reach $ 100 million at the box office, reaching $ 141 million., Making the film a box office success and received positive reviews from critics. The film has great action scenes even though there are some unnecessary ones that only serve to fill space in the duration of the film, such as the scenes in which Lee tries to get rid of Carter soon after being received at the airport, proof that the script is too simplified and moreover, it fails to have a cartoon villain and a climax that does not excite. But despite these flawed points in the script, the film works because of the rapport between the Tucker/Chan duo, the humor and the excellent choreographed action sequences. It is an extremely fun and exciting film that is always worth revisiting.",Rush Hour

No question about it, Jackie Chan's impressive action stunts and Chris Tucker's smart-@ss attitude combine to make one of the most entertaining films of the decade. But, there is a bad side to the legacy of this film, the horrid sequel RUSH HOUR 2 and then the soon-to-be trilogy, and all the many films that try to be just like this film. Example would be SHOWTIME. The film is highly entertaining and gives you some hard-core action sequences. The film is destined to keep everyone on the edge of their seat. Chris Penn, Philip Baker Hall, and Elizabeth Pena all deliver good performances. It is sure to entertain audiences for many years to come. Many of the jokes come off as racial or too crude for the liking of many over-protective parents who also complain that Tucker swears too much. I, myself, am not bothered by this but there are many people out there who feel that a film of this nature should have not been made. I feel that it should have been made by all means. People have the right to express themselves. And some of them do so through this film. RUSH HOUR gets 5/5.",Rush Hour
63,Tito-8,Chan makes it worth seeing,5,10 October 1999,"I got exactly what I was expecting from this movie...a great performance from Jackie Chan, but not very much good action.  Jackie is best when he's the whole show, and although Chris Tucker was okay, he isn't in Chan's league for comedy, and he can't possibly match Chan in action sequences. Jackie is the sole reason that the film is worthwhile, but it's still weak by his standards.

64,emm,Tucker wins over Chan in action thriller! Yeowwch!,6,6 February 1999,"Jackie Chan may still prove himself as the action-packed stuntman, but this time, things have reversed. RUSH HOUR is a reasonable combination of a suspense thriller with touches of hip comedy. Plus, it teams up both Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, the two whose attitudes are by no means the same. It looks like I'll have to give credit to Tucker, whose smart-ass superior personality is the reason to enjoy this. The movie wouldn't have been so much fun without him, as his comedic charms lighten up the action-style mood we're witnessing. As for Chan, well, don't expect a whole lot of his potential this time. It isn't that he still performs a few killer stunts, but there is relatively little that was done. You've seen Chan in kung-fu brawls before, so nothing is very special or different. Speaking of action, RUSH HOUR suffers from little of it anyway. Nothing is absolutely ground-breaking even with a couple of big explosions and gunfights. Tucker's blabbermouthing takes a huge chunk out of over one hour until the climax opens with Chan's daughter strapped with a bomb. The conclusion is stylishly amusing, though, and once again the outtakes are an added bonus for extra fun. Chan fans may be disappointed by the scarcity of his signature action routines, but the humorous magic remains. RUSH HOUR is an entertaining combo of all sorts, but don't take this one too seriously if you're into heavy high-impact action thrills. You may enjoy Tucker a lot more than anything else in the world.",Rush Hour
65,moviesleuth2,Outrageous Fun!,10,22 April 2009,"Buddy films can be great fun, if done well. There are a few things that need to happen (depending on what kind of buddy film it is), but the most important thing to have in a buddy film is chemistry. In other words, do the ""buddies"" work well with each other. ""Rush Hour"" has it, and that's why it works so well. Granted, the action is exciting and the comedy is hilarious, but ""Rush Hour"" wouldn't be as much fun as it is if Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker went together like oil and water.Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) is an LAPD detective whose ego is as big as his brain is small. When a Chinese diplomat's (Tzi Ma) daughter (Julia Hsu) is kidnapped, the diplomat wants one of his countrymen (Jackie Chan) to work with the FBI. The FBI doesn't like the idea, so they get the biggest dupe they can find to babysit the Chinese cop. Guess who they pick...The plot may be a set up for Chan's action skills and Carter's comedy (all though to be fair, they each get to do both), but the movie sticks pretty close to the plot. In general, ""Rush Hour"" switches between comedy and action, though they frequently come at the same time.Describing the film's methods would be pointless if it didn't work. But there's little (if anything) in the movie that doesn't work. Chan and Tucker work brilliantly together. While the supporting characters do good work, this movie is all about Chan and Tucker.Tucker came to fame with ""Friday"" (unseen by me), and first worked with ""Rush Hour"" director Brett Ratner in ""Money Talks"" (also unseen by me). Actually, this is the first movie I've seen him in, and I'm a fan. He's hilarious. According to IMDb, most of his lines were improvised, and if so, it worked. He never fails to get a laugh, whether big or small.Jackie Chan is a lot of fun, with his great martial arts capabilities, and his penchant for mixing it with comedy. Although Chan may be famous for his action movie skills, but he also knows how to do comedy (which is why he's frequently associated with Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin). Fortunately, director Brett Ratner understands that, and allows Chan to show this.The supporting actors are also good. Elizabeth Pena is great as the frustrated bomb squad member (who also has one of the best lines). Tom Wilkinson got his biggest break with role, and watching him here, it's no surprise why. Philip Baker Hall and the late great Chris Penn also have small roles.This isn't a ""classic"" film. It's never heavy and it NEVER takes itself seriously.

This is a far better movie then a lot of his other Hollywood flicks like The Tuxedo, The Medallion and The Forbidden Kingdom.I'm not normally a Chris Tucker fan since I usually find him to be really annoying but it works well here in this movie, Chris and Jackie have great chemistry together.

Rush Hour is a massive-hit film which is packed with entertainment. The film has a ton of action and lots of comedy and together, makes it a stunning film. It even keeps you thrilled in terms of the plot, as its difficult to be exact who was responsible for the girl's kidnapping and for what exact reasons. The performance of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker is what makes this film excel and are the right actors in playing their respective characters. For sure Rush Hour will not disappoint you one bit and is certainly a worthwhile film to watch. The success of this Rush Hour film has resulted in 2 more sequels being made that were also successful, so Rush Hour is certainly a must see action-comedy film, if you haven't already seen it. I gave this film a 10 because it was literally perfect in all aspects. The stunts were brilliant especially by Jackie Chan. Rush Hour involves lots of chasing and fighting and both Jackie and Chris were awesome at that especially together. Rush Hour is a great film with lots of action and comedy, has a good storyline and a brilliant cast. You won't find many films like Rush Hour. The closest must be the Lethal Weapon series but even then it is inferior to Rush Hour I feel even though Lethal Weapon was also a very successful action-comedy film series in its own right.

The movie does a brief introduction of all the leads and then the movie's pace picks up and the speed at which it carries on is one that is so impressive that I myself never believed it could keep up, but it did. Brett Ratner the director was on top of the situation and the blend of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan was masterful.The story/plot that the movie is based is one that you can point out the holes, some of the situations that these two were able to get out of were eyebrow raising, not to mention how both manage not to get killed is one thing that you must try to overlook as watch, because that is only how you can truly enjoy this movie.The movie starts in Hong Kong, when Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) was able to recover some priceless historical treasures. After the recovery the Chinese Consul Solon Han moved to America and while there, his daughter got kidnapped by a known Hong Kong crime lord Juntao. The Chinese Consul asked for Inspector Lee to come and aid the FBI in the investigations and recover of his daughter.Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) is a LAPD cop that finds it hard to just do anything right, so in form of a punishment his captain loan him to the FBI to be a babysitter to Lee and keep him out of their way. But selfish Carter wants to solve the crime and so does Lee so together both, did all they could to recover the Chinese Consul's daughter.Much of what they did seemed like they were moving 1 step forward and 2 steps back, but in the end it all paid off.Rush Hour 1 was a hit and it was well received. The combination of both actors (Chan and Tucker), made the news as all loved the mix, and at the very end made the movie a box office hit.Later on, two other sequels were made with Chan and Carter reprising their roles respectively as Inspector Lee and Detective Carter and we get to see them take on other crime lords and cause major chaos where ever they go. Rush Hour is a fine film from the 90s that even after you watch now, you will still be laughing hard, the movie came out same year that Lethal Weapon 4 was released, which also starred a martial art actor Jet Li.

76,Magow-Intermean,Rush Hour Review,9,12 April 2019,"When the Chinese consul's daughter is kidnapped he prefers to hire his old Hong Kong inspector, rather than rely on the FBI. The inspector teams up with an LAPD inspector, also sidelined, and the unlikely pair reluctantly go to work together.
Arriving on these shores with almost $130 million of US box office receipts in its pocket, Rush Hour's attempts to resuscitate the buddy movie genre have proven so profitable that a sequel is set to make its mark in multiplexes as early as next Christmas. And if Chan and Tucker don't have quite the same box office pulling power here, this glossy blend of amiable comedy and beautifully choreographed action should still keep up suitable levels of interest.The serviceable plot (for really it does just serve as a framework to showcase the manic energy of its leading men) has Chan, as Detective Inspector Lee, summoned from Hong Kong to LA by the Eastern city's US consul whose daughter has been kidnapped by Oriental crimelords. The FBI, however, far from keen to land in a diplomatic pickle if harm should befall the new arrival, employs the services of LAPD loose cannon James Carter (Tucker) to keep Lee as far away from the case as possible.It's a scheme that swiftly hurtles out of control; Lee is determined to crack the case, while Carter, aggrieved with his apparent babysitting gig, has his own plans to rescue the kidnapped tyke. Forming the de rigueur initially reluctant partnership, the two decide to take matters into their own hands.Despite its title, Rush Hour takes an uncomfortably long time to fully crank up, with much of the first half devoted to Tucker's love-it-or-hate-it sub-Eddie Murphy shtick. Given that his obviously huge talents are here given over to lame Michael Jackson impersonations and all the variants on ass-kicking related dialogue the script can muster, this soon begins to grate.Luckily Chan, imbued with all the gleeful innocence of a tourist abroad for the first time, manages to save the day, actually tempering Tucker's hyperkinetic behaviour with some of his own as the pair attempt to overcome their cultural differences to save the day.And here's where the movie really kicks in, because when Tucker is forced to stop whining and actually play off his new-found partner, he is far more likeable; and of course, this gives Chan a chance to break into the blistering, balletic brand of action that made his name. The set pieces that follow are masterly, as Chan sets about defeating the bad guys with snooker cues, bar stools and, in one vintage sequence, a set of priceless ming vases he's desperate to keep intact.In short, Rush Hour may be as brainless as they come, with its thankless support roles (Wilkinson as a British ambassador, Pena as an LAPD bomb disposal expert) ropey script, and entirely predictable outcome, but taken as an unfussy crowd-pleaser it amply delivers the goods.By the book buddy-buddy movie. This is a weakly scripted parade of set-pieces which aren't as exciting as regular Jackie Chan films.",Rush Hour

78,SonicStuart,A fun Action/Comedy movie!,7,28 May 2004,"Star Rating: **** out of 5Hong Kong was the last night of the British rulership. Detective Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan), close friend to Consul Han Solon, manages to prevent precious pieces of China's history being smuggled out of the country. Two years later - Consul Han is living in Los Angeles with his family - Crime Lord Juntao takes revenge on him by abducting his young daughter Soo Yung. Han does not trust the FBI to do a good job and has Lee flown in from Hong Kong to assist them. But the FBI officials do not want any help from outside and officially request help from LAPD, who are glad to get rid of Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) for a while, a big-mouthed work-alone cop who just can't be cool enough. His assignment is to keep Lee as far away from trouble as possible. But Carter and Lee don't like being put aside in that way and start working the case on their own. It was funny how Lee and James first meet, James was just talking and talking and Lee was just quiet and listening to him ramble. A quote I thought was funny was where James says when they are working in Los Angeles he is Michael Jackson and Lee was Tito but in the sequel it was the other way around when they were in Hong Kong at the beginning of Rush Hour 2! Most Action/Comedy movies always have a meaning to them that if you work together with the other person you might end up becoming best friends with them!BOTTOM LINE: ANOTHER 1990's CLASSIC HIT!",Rush Hour

Jackie Chan is amazing as the martial arts expert cop from Hong Kong. Chris Tucker is Hilarious as the fast talking cop from America. What happens when two people like this meet, Excitement and entertainment. This is Jackie's Best Hollywood Movie. I have seen a few Chris Tucker movie, this is his Best performance. I hope the third in the series will entertain as the First. If you have not seen this movie, then i recommend this movie. A great action comedy movie for all type of audience to enjoy.

81,Trevor-Kerensky,Good for those of you who like two of a kind,7,18 April 2018,"I'd watched a little of this back in the late 1990s and wanted to watch more. Its plot was decent and it wasn't meant to be taken seriously, but if you wanted to see Jackie Chan team up with an American police detective, this is your movie. Lots of funny moments and lots of action. It went on to have two sequels and while I'd only seen the second Rush Hour, I hadn't watched the third.

82,TheHonestCritic,Does Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in the same movie equal action and humor? Check out my review below to find out!,10,12 September 2020,"""Rush Hour"" (1998), this film is an action comedy marvel. I remember when I first heard of this movie. Seeing the casting of this film got me excited and I couldn't wait to watch it. Sure enough, it didn't disappoint! ""Rush Hour"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The storyline is your classic kidnap and rescue story. At first glance, it sounds kind of basic. But, for a movie of this caliber, the simpler the plot line, the better. It allows you to get more invested in the action and comedy! This film knows exactly what kind of movie it wants to be, it takes every advantage it can and has fun with it. As for the acting, it's superb from all the actors and actresses. But, the shining stars have to be Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. They are two of my favorite actors of all-time! Jackie Chan is one of my top 10 favorite action stars, and Chris Tucker is one of my top 10 favorite comedians. Putting those two together in the same movie was a brilliant stroke of genius. They both have perfect chemistry with each other on-screen and play off each other flawlessly. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are, in my opinion, one of the top 10 greatest movie duos in cinematic history. They are both so much fun to watch! All of the sets/locations are perfect and give this film a great atmosphere. You can't go wrong with Los Angeles! As for the special effects, they are all very well-done and still hold up today. However, there is one error in the special effects department. When Jackie Chan's character has that big fall, you can see part of the film crew on one of the balconies in the background. I saw it by accident when I put the scene on in slow motion. When I saw it, I thought to myself: ""wow, how did they miss that?"" Granted, the film crew are only visible for less than a second, but it's still a mistake. However, in the recent remaster and release, the film crew has been cloned out. So since the mistake has been corrected, the special effects get a pass. Finally, the film soundtrack is stellar and sets the tone for the movie perfectly. Lalo Schifrin is one of my top 10 movie composers and this score is nothing short of phenomenal. ""Rush Hour"" is a great achievement in the aspect of action comedies. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you're looking to see a perfect action comedy, go and watch ""Rush Hour"". I guarantee that you won't be disappointed!",Rush Hour
83,Emerenciano,Funny!!!,7,21 November 2002,"After watching this movie I am sure Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan really make a great duet. They are hilarious and they can greatly transfer that to their characters, two cop who work together on a crazy mission - get back a young girl who was kidnapped. ""Rush Hour"" brings us that successful combination of humour and action, that enchants audiences who look for some good time in a movie theatre or in the comfort of their living rooms. That's a great job done by director Brett Ratner.",Rush Hour

The chemistry between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker is excellent.  Those are probably the two most mismatched partners in a movie ever.  A fast-talking, cocky black man and a fast kung fu Asian man.

86,illbebackreviews,One of Jackie Chan's best!,9,9 November 2012,"I watched Rush Hour (1998) yesterday, and yes I certainly found this movie extremely entertaining. It had such great acting by both Chris Tucker and our beloved Jackie Chan! They shared such amazing chemistry and both their characters were lovable. The plot remains very basic and this is one of the strengths of this movie. Its a lot like 'Die Hard (1988)' where the plot is simply rescue the kidnapped/hostage against overwhelming odds. The action in this film was purely amazing and the dialogue was well written. I pretty much enjoyed every aspect of this film, in particular the comedy. **SPOILERS**I, in particular laughed hard at the scene where Lee is like 'Wassup,my ****"" It was hilarious and the action sequence that followed was breathtaking. I also laughed hard at the scene where Lee is trying to stop any of the things being broken and then as soon as he walks away, it explodes! ***END OF SPOILERS*** Overall, highly recommend this movie to all comedy/Jackie Chan fans!",Rush Hour
87,mistoppi,Fun and the chemistry between Chan and Tucker makes this an amazing action comedy,8,12 September 2016,"I saw Max Landis talk about this movie on Twitter, but I didn't pay much attention to the conversation. My dad and I were looking for movies to watch on Netflix, and Rush Hour popped up. Since we wanted to watch an action comedy, it seemed perfect. Rush Hour is absolutely hilarious! Most of the comedy comes from the clash between two main characters. There are cultural and characteristic differences, which are so much fun and cause a lot of misunderstandings and unfortunate but hysterical situations.Rush Hour is definitely a thrilling action movie. It just happens to be predictable as well. You know what's going to happen, because you've seen tons of movies like this one. What makes that better is that you don't know how it's going to happen, so Rush Hour - and all the other movies such as this one - may still manage to surprise you by taking you to the predictable destination by different means than you expected. And usually no one expects action comedies to be completely unpredictable, even if the old, boring ways are annoying. Action comedies are fun, and the movie being fun and thrilling is more important than it being unpredictable and completely new.Hand to hand combat scenes are a pleasure to watch. They are well coordinated and the choreography is incredible. Most of that is because of Jackie Chan's wonderful talent.Not only is Jackie Chan talented, he's absolutely charming. I've only seen him in the Chinese movie The Twins Effect (or Vampire Effect) in a small role, and this is the first time I saw him playing a main character. Of course the character he plays - Lee - is a bit typical, but still delightful. Chris Tucker, on the other hand, played a really typical character when it comes to a black man in an action comedy, but I'd rather blame the director and writers than him. I've seen him before in Jackie Brown and that one David O. Russell movie I barely remember watching. Both characters are lovable and their chemistry works. Different characters would've made the movie a whole lot different.I definitely liked this movie. My dad already asked if we're going to watch the sequels. Damn right we are. I don't know if the stories will be as interesting, but I love the characters more, and it will be interesting to see how their chemistry works now that they know each other better in the sequels.",Rush Hour
88,lib-4,Do you understand the words coming out of my mouth?,7,18 May 1999,"I am not much on action films, but I found this quite tolerable because of the humor.  I especially liked how Chan got into the song ""War""-- and the outtakes at the end.  If an action movie can be funny- this was because the 2 main characters played well off each other.  and I liked the running joke about taking guns away from each other.  Also the way that the officers seemed to really care for the welfare of the girl made the movie appealing.",Rush Hour
89,gitrich,"An action, thriller, suspense, comedy that falls flat!",3,8 November 1998,"It is obvious, judging from the out-takes at the end of this movie, that the cast had more laughs making the film than I did watching it. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker do deliver a few humorous moments but not enough for me to recommend Rush Hour. Teens, especially those that like car crashes, karate fights, and thrilling, though unbelievable situations might enjoy it. Chris Tuckers ramblings were entertaining at first but got old very early on. Do yourself a favor and pass on Rush Hour.",Rush Hour

This movie was better then most stupid Action/Comedy that come out now days. This movie has about 20 laughs in it altogether which is not bad at all for an Action/Comedy and even though there are not any as many as Shanghai Noon and probably as good as them it is still a movie that holds quite a lot of value to me. This movie has quite a lot of things in it that are good 1. they have all the action that an action movie.2. They keep the laughs coming and do not stop 3 quarters through like most Comedys do.3.

A curious Chinese inspector, who is placed on a 'case' that the other law enforcement, across the water, doesn't want him near. Yes James carter or when it comes down to, too much heat, 'Jimmy Carter the chicken-hearted' is just out of the Chief's office after being in 'trouble' yet again. You just know it has happened before, with him. After Explaining to his Chief, his 'cock & bull' story about a bust gone-aye-rye, destroying property, putting lives at stake, he is wondrously given, instead of suspension, a brand new assignment. Papa's got a brand new nag! He is sent to what he thinks is a major case, with the F.B.I. Instead of course, he has been set-up to 'babysit' this kindly little inspector, Lee. Well that doesn't set right with the self-proclaimed hero, James carter, no way! He wants to take the 'lead' on the big-case. A hostage situation. Well after meeting his contact 'Lee' at the airport and trying to figure out how to tell him what to do, after picking him up on the tarmac. These guys run back and forth on the trail of the dangerous with little more than a prayer, a fast handed martial arts master and a high and verbally profuse brand new partner. They stumble and bumble through the first part of this adventure and become positively lethal together. As they stand on 'Sunset Blvd' and Lee teaches Carter the 'dismount and disassemble' method, they have truly reached the 'connection' point with their partner founded friendship. The communication and then 'miscommunication' are driving the laughs all the way! These two did a fantastic job of making a 'mess' into a romping good show! I think this is a super idea, who's time has come and what perfect timing it was. Here's to many more great adventures in naive investigative work! This was a top comedy for me. Recommended Highly!

Chan is excellent in the fight scenes in this movie. There are lots of them, by the way. He's also a really funny guy, and his typical mix of kung fu and humour is really great. Even funnier than Chan is Chris Tucker. He is really funny in this movie, and I guess that the Rush Hour movies are clearly his best. That's at least my opinion. So, when Chan and Tucker teams up that means great action scenes, plus really funny situations and dialouge. The story is not the best that's ever made, but it fits this movie 100%.",Rush Hour

97,refinedsugar,One of the most memorable buddy cop duos ever,7,1 March 2001,"Take the two non-Caucasian lead actors and combine it with New Line Cinema's hype train that ran full force and what you get is Rush Hour. A once in a lifetime buddy cop film that mixed the fish out of water tale against a strictly formula kidnap ransom story and still managed to come out very entertaining. You might have been convinced that this is the best thing since Lethal Weapon. It's not, but don't discount it all the same.There is no denying Jackie Chan has the right stuff and all the broken bones to prove it and its nice to see him getting his North American due. While Chris Tucker with his loud-mouth all too smooth fast talker routine brings back memories of Eddie Murphy's rise in the 80's. From 'Friday' to 'The Fifth Element' to 'Money Talks' and now 'Rush Hour' - it has always been the same act. Time will tell if he can pull a career out of it, but he's brought his best game here. Some of Tucker's banter in particular is priceless. He almost steals the show. With such good chemistry and vastly different personalities, Chan and Tucker carry the movie. The story as I mentioned before is very pedestrian with little in the way of surprises or standouts from the supporting cast, but the action bits deliver and the laughs come at a good clip. This is Chan and Tucker's show. Fans have a bevy of moments or dialog bits to remember the film by, but it's real feat is its run away success.

The action sequences are excellent due to Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker keeps the mood comic, which is smart because this film could never be taken seriously.  Rush Hour is a good formula picture.  Put either actor alone in a movie and it wouldn't work. (I've seen other Jackie Chan movies, when he's not kickin' ass, it gets boring real quick).

But give it the benefit of the doubt. Remember that 1998 was a much simpler time. Both Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker were in their prime. And back then, putting together a Hong Kong National and a loud-mouth black cop from the LAPD was pure comedic genius. The clash of cultures comedy is atypical, of course, but it's still hilarious.

105,smashattack,An excellent comedy!,7,3 February 2003,"When I first saw this movie, I was a little disappointed because it didn't fit the usual quick-action that is Jackie Chan's trademark.  I was expecting his near-supernatural talent to take charge in this one as well.While Jackie does not use his skill as much, the excitement is recovered by the hilariously paired Inspector Lee and James Carter.  These two are so hilarious together, and the mishaps they get into are nothing less than pure entertainment.The plot is unusual for a Jackie Chan movie.  It's a GOOD one.  A Chinese consulate's daughter has been kidnapped and it's up to Lee and Carter to... take a hike.  They are in the way of an FBI investigation.  This doesn't stop them from conducting their own search for the girl, and the results are quite amusing.The humor is light and toned down.  It's not perverted like other movies--it's good, clean fun.  There are some nasty curses in the movie, which are a little detrimental, but overall it's pretty clean.The ending is an excellent way to spawn the sequel.  After getting used to Jackie Chan in a less violent role, this movie has become one of my favorite comedies.  Even the music, composed by Lalo Schifrin (the original composer of the Mission:  Impossible theme!) does a decent job.  The music doesn't interfere with the movie, yet is loud enough to add some character.Rush Hour is a movie that I would recommend to even one who despises comedy.",Rush Hour

107,margulanabutrlov,Rush Hour Review,9,23 March 2019,"When the Chinese consul's daughter is kidnapped he prefers to hire his old Hong Kong inspector, rather than rely on the FBI. The inspector teams up with an LAPD inspector, also sidelined, and the unlikely pair reluctantly go to work together.
Arriving on these shores with almost $130 million of US box office receipts in its pocket, Rush Hour's attempts to resuscitate the buddy movie genre have proven so profitable that a sequel is set to make its mark in multiplexes as early as next Christmas. And if Chan and Tucker don't have quite the same box office pulling power here, this glossy blend of amiable comedy and beautifully choreographed action should still keep up suitable levels of interest.
The serviceable plot (for really it does just serve as a framework to showcase the manic energy of its leading men) has Chan, as Detective Inspector Lee, summoned from Hong Kong to LA by the Eastern city's US consul whose daughter has been kidnapped by Oriental crimelords. The FBI, however, far from keen to land in a diplomatic pickle if harm should befall the new arrival, employs the services of LAPD loose cannon James Carter (Tucker) to keep Lee as far away from the case as possible.
It's a scheme that swiftly hurtles out of control; Lee is determined to crack the case, while Carter, aggrieved with his apparent babysitting gig, has his own plans to rescue the kidnapped tyke. Forming the de rigueur initially reluctant partnership, the two decide to take matters into their own hands.
Despite its title, Rush Hour takes an uncomfortably long time to fully crank up, with much of the first half devoted to Tucker's love-it-or-hate-it sub-Eddie Murphy shtick. Given that his obviously huge talents are here given over to lame Michael Jackson impersonations and all the variants on ass-kicking related dialogue the script can muster, this soon begins to grate.
Luckily Chan, imbued with all the gleeful innocence of a tourist abroad for the first time, manages to save the day, actually tempering Tucker's hyperkinetic behaviour with some of his own as the pair attempt to overcome their cultural differences to save the day.
And here's where the movie really kicks in, because when Tucker is forced to stop whining and actually play off his new-found partner, he is far more likeable; and of course, this gives Chan a chance to break into the blistering, balletic brand of action that made his name. The set pieces that follow are masterly, as Chan sets about defeating the bad guys with snooker cues, bar stools and, in one vintage sequence, a set of priceless ming vases he's desperate to keep intact.
In short, Rush Hour may be as brainless as they come, with its thankless support roles (Wilkinson as a British ambassador, Pena as an LAPD bomb disposal expert) ropey script, and entirely predictable outcome, but taken as an unfussy crowd-pleaser it amply delivers the goods.",Rush Hour
108,Sfpsycho415,One of the best action-comedies!----9/10,9,11 March 2004,"Rush Hour revitalized the buddy action flicks of the 80's and has become a modern classic. It is a movie in the tradition of 48 Hrs. and Lethal Weapon. And like those two movies, it has perfect casting. Chris Tucker is hysterical in his best performance since Friday. Jackie Chan is in top form, complete with incredible stunts, cool martial arts and hilarious broken English. The story is well-written and full of funny situations for both Tucker and Chan. Look for the scenes where Chan is in a predominantly black pool hall and Tucker buys some Chinese food from a cart. The chemistry between the two leads is probably what makes this movie so great. Tucker and Chan now go together like peanut butter and jelly. Great individually, but even better together. All this makes Rush Hour a guaranteed good time. 9/10",Rush Hour
109,thomas-hardcastle-2,"Two thumbs up, and rushing around for the first hour...",6,19 June 2008,"This is the only Rush Hour film where Chris Tucker is not an annoying idiot. In the other two, he is not funny, and gets on your nerves after the first ten minutes.Jackie Chan, in his usual, ""paired with the latest comic,"" role, plays the fish out of water well, preparing himself for more of the same in Shanghai Noon. As is the case with Jackie Chan in his American films, the kung-fu does not last as long as a fight fan would like, but is adequate enough to satisfy even the most ardent of Chan fans.The overall acting of everyone in this film is good, and Brett Ratner has made a decent film in this case. It's not brilliant, but good, and it's only really good because of the film's star, Jackie Chan. He fights well, and he holds the screen well when no fighting is involved. Even though he is an old man in this film, his charm and innocence draw the audience closer to him than the brash, trash-talking Tucker.Overall, this is a good film, but not a Chan classic, as so many people believe it is. Chan's best films were made in the late seventies and early eighties, with Drunken Master 2 (1994) an exception.",Rush Hour
110,HanShotFirstGR,A very entertaining classic action comedy!,8,22 December 2020,"Plot:A loyal and dedicated Hong Kong Inspector teams up with a reckless and loudmouthed L.A.P.D. detective to rescue the Chinese Consul's kidnapped daughter, while trying to arrest a dangerous crime lord along the way.Analysis:Buddy cop movies have been a major source of entertainment for so many years. Rush Hour was a very clever experiment of combining Jackie Chan, who's been known for his fighting skills and Chris Tucker, a naturally funny guy with a gift to produce comedy that seems spontaneous. The result is a movie with surprisingly funny interractions, well-executed comedic fighting and great chemistry. Step by step without aiming for anything more than cheap laugh and almost politically incorrect jokes that actually worked pretty well.The key element to this movie's success is the amazing chemistry between the two protagonists. Tucker and Chan seem way too different to connect this well, Chris Tucker has a stand-up comedian style while Jackie Chan brings laughter mostly with overly stylized martial arts. This movie was the combination of both of them and despite the big risk, it actually turned out to be really enjoyable. Every interaction between the two of them is pure comedic gold, every joke works, every scene is interesting and casually funny and they do all of that without having to change their style of entertaining the audience.The plot has some problems that don't affect the experience but you can easily spot them. From a very basic plot of a kidnapped daughter and an FBI negotiation, to bad agents' stereotypes and exaggerated physic laws, Rush Hour is a huge mess on a techincal level that was mostly saved by how funny it is. There are questionable choices from characters, predictable villain and villain plan, many plot conveniences and some unbelievable moments, a pretty big list of things that you must accept to enjoy this.This is one of those movies you should shut down your brain and just relax and let yourself to laugh, don't process any plot elements just deal with them and leave them behind, this way you can enjoy all the great chemistry without being distracted by obvious stupid choices. If you are looking for a smart comedy with top class humor and clever lines, Rush Hour is way too far from what you want. The humor is basic and cheap (although it really works), the action is as good as any Jackie Chan movie or even a little worse, the direction isn't something new, just a usual approach, so the less you try to explain this movie the more you will find it amusing.Maybe, the jokes are a little juvenile, there are many racial refferences that are used in a non-offensive way as a satire, Tucker uses his natural gift to bring out a style for his character that you can't stop laughing and the whole movie counts on this to be successful. Most of people seem to like Chris Tucker's funny acting but if you don't, this movie will be a way less entertaining experience. It's really a hit or miss movie that will be a major success for the casual audience, but for those who have seen a great amount of comedies the success will depend on their willingness to shut their brains down for this film's runtimeConclusion:Despite any faults and rushed choices, Rush Hour manages through the natural humor and chemistry between the protagonists to perfectly entertain the viwers. Memorable cheap jokes, an iconic buddy cop duo and a mission for them to complete are a pretty good recipe for success when Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan are part of the cast.Rating: 7.5/10",Rush Hour
111,Rumples,Very ordinary movie,6,28 June 1999,"Well, there's nothing new in this movie. In fact, it is a relatively weak effort all around. Chan has been rather limited in both his ability to showcase his fun personality and his impressive fight choreography. If you like Jackie Chan's fight scenes you won't see enough to entertain you. If you like his sense of humour, you won't see enough to entertain you. If you find Chris Tucker extremely annoying, you will see plenty to reinforce your point of view. In all, this movie was a waste. Apart from a few good parts it takes a classic story idea and a master actor in the genre and produces something limp and lame. My vote 6/10 and mainly because I'm a Chan fan!",Rush Hour
112,JohnnyPHreak,An action comedy classic,8,9 August 2000,"Rush Hour, when it came out was the sleeper hit of the fall and for very good reason. This is like a homage to the action comedies before it (Lethal Weapon, 48HRS). It has everything an action comedy needs and much more. Jackie Chan's first American film stars him as a Hong Kong cop in the opening sequence busting the biggest crime lord in Hong Kong. Enter two months later, the daughter of a Hong Kong counselor is  kidnapped and he sends for his best man to come to Los Angeles. But when he's met at the airport by one of the LAPD's finest James Carter (Chris Tucker) he doesn't realize what he's just gotten in to. This is Jackie's film from the start and he has now officially become an American action star. He's so funny and so amazing at the same time you can only think ""Is he human?"". This film also makes Chris Tucker a full fledge movie star. This man is like a mix of Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock. His is just a great comedian and proves that he can do the action too. Him and Jackie are a one-two combo. They're like Mel and Danny but maybe a tad bit funnier to watch. Because they're so different it makes their chemistry so great. Brett Ratner's direction is perfect. His music video background has helped him out very much. There are bright colors and loud music emphasizing that this is an action film. There is a lot of action too. Of course this is American so there are lots of guns and explosions but the fights are superb. They take care of the eye candy for this film. If you haven't seen Rush Hour you really need to. In the spirit of Lethal Weapon and 48Hrs, Rush Hour is a buddy cop action comedy that has great chemistry, loads of action and will keep you laughing for hours on end.",Rush Hour
113,RunningFromSatan,One of the most hilarious movies ever!,8,28 February 1999,"Who would've ever thought that Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, the most diverse people partnered up in a movie, would do it?  I didn't.  This movie is so funny!  It is also filled with action, too, so don't miss out on that, either.  The part that gets me most is when the father of Soo-Yung says ""America is a great place"" and then they cut to Los Angeles and Chris Tucker yelling out ""Move out of my way, ***hole!!""  That got me laughing so hard. The outtakes at the end were hilarious, also.  I recommend this movie to anyone.  If you don't laugh, than you are pretty boring!",Rush Hour
114,Mike Astill,"Fun buddy cop movie, although Jackie should have been let off his leash.",6,18 July 2001,"Nice to see Jackie in a well-produced Hollywood yarn, although there's something a bit wrong with the billing if the two stars are considered to be equals. One's a respected stuntman actor, producer and director, the other is a bloke with an irritating voice. Doesn't seem quite fair, somehow.Still, it's a funny film, although most of the fun is derived from Jackie's rubber-limbed flailing with whatever comes to hand (pool cue, steering wheel, bomb, etc). It does seem like his fight scenes were restrained unfortunately, perhaps to make sure Tucker didn't seem superfluous?
The out takes over the end credits and on the DVD are good value, showing that all concerned had a great deal of fun making the film. That the infectious good-humour carried over into the movie itself is a relief, because otherwise all that remained would have been one of those tiresome buddy-cop movies. And there are more than enough of those already!
For all my indifference towards Tucker, his by-the-numbers rebellious loner LA Cop shtick does at least give rise to some of the movie's funnier moments, especially against his long-suffering former partner.Things bode well for the sequel then, when hopefully Chan & Tucker will be able to pick up where they left off.",Rush Hour

It certainly owes a lot from 48 HOURS, LETHAL WEAPON and various other buddy films, but it ranks up there with them no problem. The company, New Line Cinema, is clearly happy to have this series of films in it's catalog, seeming how they're just as popular as their ""LORD OF THE RINGS"" and ""Austin Powers"" series.

It is filled with trash-talk, action and comedy sequences that will keep you laughing until the end. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker make a great team and they will make you laugh in every scene they are in together. Every age group will laugh at at least one scene in this movie. It is impossible not to laugh. This one of my favorite comedies of all time. I thought it was a great movie. It was funny listening to Jackie Chan trying to speak English. That was definitely the heart of the movie right there. Chris Tucker was insanely funny in this movie as well. If you put them together, it is the most dangerous comedy duo of all time.

They have laughter and tension, and action plays are not very addictive, but comedy plays are funny enough.

But you will NEVER find a movie with two characters as different, and as funny, as this one. And its not just about two people, its also about two different cultures (Chinese and American) which explains why this film was so popular, internationally. In the global village just about everyone has some personal experience with clashing cultures.

Later, when Consul Han, played by Tzi Ma, is in America, his daughter, Soo Yung, played by Julia Hsu, is kidnapped in retaliation.  Lee flies over from China to help in the investigation, but the FBI don't want his help.  So they enlist the help of Detective James Carter of the NYPD, played by Chris Tucker, to keep him out of the way.  Carter takes the assignment reluctantly, but decides to try and solve the case himself.This is a surprisingly good action-comedy, with good action and good comedy, but it did have a lot of violence which was irrelevant to the story, for example, Lee trying to get to Consul Han and in the bar when he fights the guys near the pool tables.  Good plot and good ending with the secret identity of Juntao revealed, Rush Hour is never boring.

Chris Tucker (""Do you understand the words that are comin' outta my mouth?"") was delightful as the LAPD cop who really just doesn't get it. And Jackie Chan was the perfect foil for his humor. The casting was pretty good. It is always fun to see Jackie Chan work his own stunts. A few parts are ""I know they thought that was cool when they wrote it, but it just doesn't transfer"", but mostly this is a good script. This is not Oscar quality (what Chris Tucker movie is?), but it is an enjoyable experience. Sit and wait for the one-liners. The situational and physical comedy in this one will leave you rolling.

125,Sharkey360,Feels rushed...a disappointment!,4,29 June 2000,"OK. This is Jackie Chan's highest grossing film, but that does not translate into goodness. Rush Hour is a disappointment overall, and it always has that rush feel into it, like the makers did not bother to add more quality or essence. RH lacks a lot and needs work. Example, the story's main frame just does not have enough events and character development to it. Chan and Chris Tucker are unwilling partners mostly, a la Lethal Weapon, and if you look closely, they don't do well in terms of chemistry. The ""Fastest hands in the East meets the biggest mouth in the West"" idea was obviously forced. Chris Tucker is NOT a good screen partner for Jackie since he's so annoying and his act is corny. The medicine for the sickness: Chris Rock. Rock's a better partner for Chan. Jackie Chan on the other hand, has a lackluster role here since he has to share the spotlight with the ever-blasted Tucker. He's got action but there's a huge lack of it. His stunts are obviously lessened or toned-down, and this hurts his appeal. Chan is the man to watch here, although expect a major drop of his exposure.RH obviously is a Lethal Weapon rip-off, and the story simply lacks originality or fresh concepts. RH is best viewed only when you like minor entertainment, but if your taste is for high-enjoyment, ignore this film. Better watch Shanghai Noon or any other Jackie Chan film instead of this.",Rush Hour

127,schmimic,"Jackie Chan brings us the action, Chris Tucker brings us the loud-mouthed moron.",9,23 April 2005,"Starring: Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker I remember when this movie first came out. Bryce and I went to see it in Swift Current. I really had no idea what to expect due to the fact that I had not seen any previews. But I definitely enjoyed this movie.What it is, is a rock 'em sock 'em action-comedy. Jackie Chan brings us his trademark martial arts skills as detective inspector Li, and Chris Tucker also give us his trademark skills playing James Carter as the world's most obnoxious and loud-mouthed schmuck.So here's the deal. Chinese Consulate Hahn and his family move to America, and shortly after moving, his daughter is kidnapped. The FBI are on the scene immediately, but Hahn wants to have one of his own men on the case. So he flies in detective Li. The FBI don't want Li's help, and they don't want some foreign agent to get his head blown off on American soil and make it a big international incident. So they decide to get someone to babysit Li. At first they plan on using one of their rookie agents, but then they decide, quote, ""If we're going to embarrass someone, may as well be LAPD."" Carter is already in trouble down at the precinct for screwing up a case pretty hardcore, so his chief is all too eager to hand off this crappy assignment to him. Carter has no idea that he's being sent over to babysit Li. All he knows is that the FBI want him to work a case. So Carter gets there, the FBI tell him to take a hike and watch out for Li. And since Carter doesn't really want to be suspended for two months without pay, he complies.The rest of the movie pretty much follows Carter and Li around while they talk to different people, collect information, kick a few butts, and work on solving the case. Jackie Chan's martial arts skills are as good as ever, and Chris Tucker is well, annoying. How can anybody have a voice that high? Several times throughout the movie I kinda wished that he'd get his mouth duct-taped shut.All in all, the movie has some great action and some great laughs. If you haven't already seen it, it is worth a view. If you like Jackie Chan, and if you feel you can tolerate Chris Tucker for ninety minutes.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth a look)",Rush Hour
128,thetyvonlesure,The Last Great Buddy Cop Film,7,7 July 2019,"Rush Hour is peak cinema for the Buddy Cop sub-genre. It perfectly matches action and comedy by placing together the oddball duo of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan. Chris Tucker carries a majority of the comedy with his delivery of quotable dialogue, and his character's witty way of attacking conflict. Jackie Chan carries the action with sequences that are taken straight from his King Fu flicks, and reimagined for an international audience. Both interchange with each other throughout the film, further displaying their great chemistry. Despite a simple storyline that comes full circle, Tucker and Chan are the film's main life source.

130,amahlanand,Welcome to 'Blackinese' Comedy,10,11 June 2012,"Police Story meets Lethal Weapon in Brett Ratner's directorial emergence to the big time. A fairly odd couple join forces to solve a kidnapping and what a ride of endless comedy, superior action and crazy entertainment it turns into. We've seen Black movies, Chinese films, but who would have envisaged, as Chris Tucker coins it, something 'Blackinese'? It's so poles apart from convention, but that's the essence of Buddy Cop Comedy and the reason why 'Rush Hour' is a definitive chapter in this sub-genre's history. This pairing really worked because of the expectation that it was never destined to. Truth is though, this unconventionally bizarre couple sizzled. They fed off each other, giving one another motivation and inspiration for their respective characters and showing each other the ropes as they individually know it. The fun they had was so evident and that feeling came through the screen to the audience. In general, this was a really well constructed action film script. It had all the ingredients for a solid Hong Kong style action driven movie including a villain which is not just an everyday gangster, 'good guys' who aren't hapless yet are not overly capable either as well as, most importantly, a screenplay with effectively choreographed action sequences but interwoven with bouts of fitting light-hearted humour. Tucker excels tremendously as the brash and cocky Detective Carter, it was as if the role was made for him. He is gut-bustingly hilarious in his fast talking performance which will no doubt go down as legendary in the field of African - American comedy, a worthy follow up to his famous 'Smokey' in a style extremely reminiscent of one of his idols, Eddie Murphy. He in fact improvises much of his dialogue and it comes across as brilliantly spontaneous, particularly in Carter's interactions with (or otherwise known as his patronising of) Jackie Chan's Lee. He just flummoxes people with an ability to talk utter garbage (similar to the infamous Axel Foley) again and again. He talks and swaggers as if he owns this movie, and that attitude made if feel like he did. And just how great was his chemistry with Carter's self determined non existent trophy in Elizabeth Pena? They both nailed that, and it begs the query, why do you always need a stereotypical love interest? Pena's character worked wonders in conjunction with Carter the way a regular love interest never would. Jackie Chan finally brings his fantastic stunt work to the mass Hollywood audience and really forges a future in action comedy. You could really call him the more able sidekick. Much has been made of Chan's relatively shaky English but it is admirable to see a role which required that sort of casting. In other words, they needed the shaky English for the contrast in partners to work. And Jackie Chan makes it a point to let his words flow naturally and not try overly hard to make himself 'too Chinese'. He doesn't hesitate to give some of his own to Chris Tucker, even if he is outspoken most of the time. Hilarious but not treated foolishly, action filled but not action dictated, if you like African - American comedy, Hong Kong cinema and a bit of prejudice, you'll lap this up. And do hang on for the in credit bloopers. There were always bound to be many stuff ups with this formula, who doesn't find those funny?",Rush Hour
131,lucifer,Hype overload,7,12 April 2000,"Judging by the amount of hype that was generated by this being Jackie's first American feature since 1985 (barring his cameo in 1997's An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn), this was a big let down.Not enough Jackie, too much of Chris Tucker playing ""dumb black guy"", and no big fight scene with the villain/henchman.Elizabeth Peña is wasted in an awful stereotypical Hispanic role. Why she has to push her chest forward every time she speaks is beyond me. It certainly does not suggest ""attitude"". Considering her role in Jacob's Ladder and The Waterdance, this must have been a bill-paying role.Chris Penn turns up in a pointless minor role, looking inbred rather than tough. Looking at his usual roles, more could be expected of him.As for the actual script, dreadful dialogue and plot devices abound. The set pieces are good, but hardly earth shattering. Police Story and Project A easily outshine this effort.All is not lost, however, as John Woo took until Face/Off to get his feet steady in Hollywood, so let us all hope that Jackie comes up trumps next time.",Rush Hour

It says something that after 20+ years, it doesn't feel dated.Credit Brett Ratner with choosing the right original music composer and some timeless popular tracks, as well as not relying too heavily on pop culture references from the time, the downfall of many films, in my opinion.While it might not have Jackie Chan's best martial arts choreography, there are still some very impressive scenes and jaw-dropping stunts. Moreover, it's got a funny script and Chris Tucker's lightning-quick delivery. The pace is also admirable, moving along briskly, but leaving some beautiful pregnant pauses to give you a breather and a lighter moment.Is it formulaic? No doubt.

137,kenvandenbussche-2,The funniest martial arts movie ever made!,7,16 October 2007,"After the death of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, the search was on for an actor who could inspire audiences to the same degree. Every young martial artist was given a chance. Jackie Chan came on top of everyone else and was destined to become the next big thing. Early on: he decided to do things different than his former stunt coordinator Bruce Lee so he would be able to move out of his shadow. This very reason supported by Jackie's undying love for slap-stick and such actors as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, lead to the fact that his movies would always contain as much humor as possible. Fortunately: the fact that his English is as bad as that of Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't a disturbing factor at all.Buddy cop movies have always been about two (or more) entirely different characters being forced to work together in a situation that neither one ever wanted. This was the case with classic action-comedies ""48 hrs"", ""Beverly Hills cop"" and ""Lethal weapon"" and this particular style is also used in this action-packed comedy.But even though ""Rush hour"" shares many similarities with the above-mentioned classic '80s movies, there is however one important difference. ""Rush hour"" is just as much a comedy as it is a martial arts movie. And that's why this film feels so fresh. Because Jackie Chan plays a character in this movie which looks as if they mixed Charlie Chaplin and Bruce Lee into one and the same person. This character is very agile yet in a clumsy and comical way.As usual Jackie Chan does all of his stunts himself. Thus far he remains, to me, the greatest of all martial arts actors ... I have yet to see many films by Bruce Lee and maybe in time I will change my opinion. But right now I like Jackie Chan and his ultra-fast moves a lot more than anything else in the world of martial arts business. He has done so many extraordinary things that tangle the mind. His actions are a gorgeous combination of beautiful fighting choreography and entertaining slap-stick. This mixture is both innovate as well as very successful all around the world. Simply put: this extremely talented actor is a joy to watch fight. He can and will use every single item in this movie as a weapon to defend himself from several thugs attacking him simultaneously. Also: be sure that you don't miss out on the hilarious bloopers after this film has ended!Of course: ""Rush hour"" isn't just only about an exceptionally athletic man doing what he does best. He is only half the movie. The other half is filled up by the biggest mouth in the movie business namely actor Chris Tucker. This African-American comedian is often mixed up with Chris Rock and this shouldn't come as a surprise at all, because both these talented actors are considered the 'Eddy Murphy for the new generation.' Basically: they do what Eddy Murphy did back in the '80s. Even though I think Chris Rock is the better actor, Chris Tucker is quite good in this movie and delivers ... although neither one of them will ever be as great as Eddy Murphy.In ""Rush hour"", Chris Tucker plays the total opposite of Jackie Chan which means: all talk but hardly any walk! Tucker talks and Chan fights! That's how easily this movie and its main characters have been split up. But it doesn't stay this way forever and that is one of the smartest moves of ""Rush hour"". The lines between the one who fights and the one who talks start to blur as the movie develops. This is not only unexpected but also raises the bar on a humoristic level. It's a welcome change from the average buddy cop movie.Furthermore, there is British actor Tom Wilkinson who was one of the few main actors to keep his clothes on in the funny, British comedy ""The full monty"". He also later starred as the brilliant doctor in ""Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"" and a notorious crime boss in ""Batman begins"". Two other very familiar Asian faces make an appearance. Tzi Ma plays consul Han in this movie and will return for the upcoming ""Rush hour 3"" as ambassador Han. He played a volcano scientist in the ever spectacular disaster movie ""Dante's speak"" and also plays a minor yet vital role in ""24: Seasons 5 and 6"". The other actor is Ken Leung. He is most famous for his role in ""X-Men: The last stand"" where he played a mutant who was able to sprout spikes from his body (which obviously makes it very hard for anyone to give him a hug without getting hurt.)In short: A simple yet intelligent comedy which is slightly different yet becomes a very original buddy cop movie due to the martial arts by Jackie Chan. Altogether: this makes up for a very entertaining movie!",Rush Hour

Chan brought this whole movie together with his awesome fight sequences......... especially the one at the beginning of the movie. Tucker just gets annoying and you just want him to get off the screen for more Tucker time. I like the plot and the fact that it was in LA but the plot wasn't too strong throughout the film.

We bought this movie years ago, and on a snow day from school[kids were out for a week here] we let our oldest daughter watchboth RH 1 and RH 2 back to back for a couple of days in a row.  Wewarned our then second grader about how there is bad languageand martial arts moves in this movie that were never to besaid/repeated in public.  She swore she would never do/say suchthings.  And then she went back to school.That first day back, she completed a series of martial arts kicks onkids [mostly boys] on the playground.  And then she used the ""BWord"" on two boys and a girl during the school day [that's ChrisTucker's favorite cuss word in this movie].  Needless to say, she was grounded.  And she also was put on a""diet"" of G movies until she learned her lesson completely [about ayear].  This movie was excellent.  But don't be fooled.  Young children areindeed highly impressionable and do not need to watch thesemovies until they are old enough to understand fiction/reality. 
I gave this movie a 7 out of 10.  My husband and I find this wholeseries just wonderful.  However, I'd recommend this to adults orolder teenagers only.",Rush Hour
142,D Throat,A big disappointment,1,9 February 1999,"This movie was bad. Really bad. And that is too bad, too, for with Jackie Chan aboard a lot could have been done to make a good movie out of it. Beside the fact that the story is abysmal, the action sequences are not that good either, to say the least, and with Jackie Chan one can expect more.The greatest failure is the casting of Chris Tucker, who is not only an annoying sidekick, but also NOT funny. Shame on him for letting Jackie down like that. But it should have been clear that after the Fifth Element Tucker should not have starred in any movie again. Vote: 1",Rush Hour
143,mjuice,Beauty and the Bore,6,16 March 1999,"I like to pan movies.  It's fun. But today that's not my plan.  I think in Rush Hour, I got half my money's worth.  And that half was Jackie Chan.  Seriously, those of you who like Jackie Chan will like his part of the movie.  Unfortunately, Jackie Chan is a *CO*star in this movie.I don't think Christ Tucker is that funny.  This movie didn't help much. Okay, I laughed a bit, but he's a complete waste of time next to Jackie Chan.Jackie Chan doesn't fight nearly enough (he has two scenes, both of which are pretty good), but his choreography is definitely up to form.  On the other hand, Chris Tucker comes off as nothing - he's not an action star, he's not that funny, he's not some stone-cold cop, he's just kinda silly.Even worse, Jackie Chan is kinda silly too.  He's always been silly.  Thus, there isn't chemistry, because there's no contrast.  Chris Tucker and Bruce Willis had chemistry in The Fifth Element.  That was chemistry.If you want to see this, make sure you watch something more solid afterwards, because you're going to come away from it wishing there was more Jackie Chan.  I give it 5 out of 10.",Rush Hour

Chris Tucker isn't that bad (in ""The Fifth Element"" he was cool).. but Jackie Chan?? I HATE HIM!! he is good with karate and stuff, but he definitively  is NOT an actor!! I dont recommend this movie to anyone who likes GOOD movies.. this movie is just another really stupid action comedy (i hate action movies, are all the same) with a stupid plot. i really didnt like it and if you wanna see a good comedy, go see ""As Good As It Gets"" ,""South Park"" or ""There's Something About Mary"", but this one.. NO!!! I can't believe that there's a second part and even a third one.. i wouldn't see them for anything of the world!! anyway i think that is very probably that you'll like it, because most people like stupid movies with stupid situations... it's just my opinion that it's bad, and this is and advice for all the people who likes good movies, DON'T WATCH IT!!",Rush Hour

146,davidtkd-25249,Rush Hour (1998): The Fastest Hands in the East Meets the Biggest Mouth in the West,10,10 January 2018,"Rush Hour is a 1998 American buddy cop action comedy film starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker as two cops that have nothing in common working together to rescue the daughter of a Chinese diplomat who has been captured while also arresting a crime lord. Directed by Brett Ratner, the film features a ton of action and drama. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker's humor is phenomenal. This is a film you will surely remember. Rush Hour was made on a budget of $33,000,000. Rush Hour grossed $244,400,000, making it a huge success. Because of the success of Rush Hour, it was followed by two sequels, Rush Hour 2 (2001), and Rush Hour 3 (2007). Rush Hour's film score was conducted and composed by living-legend - Lalo Schifrin (""Bullitt"", ""Enter The Dragon""). The music is absolutely amazing and is one of the best if not the best thing about the movie. I could listen to this music forever and I wouldn't get bored of it. A perfect action comedy film. This film is a buddy cop masterpiece and one of my favorite films ever. 10/10.",Rush Hour
147,Aidy,The end of an era,6,17 December 1998,"Don't get me wrong, this movie did entertain me...but no more than any bog-standard Hollywood action film.  Jackie Chan is so reserved in this movie.  There is the odd stunt and some fighting but Jackie is obviously just getting too old for this lark now.Even his more recent efforts were miles better.  Rumble in the Bronx, [Mr] Nice Guy, we'll forget about First Strike.  This was bordering on lame.I'm sad to say this but Chris Tucker does steal the show and I found myself being entertained more by him than Jackie.  I'm a massive Jackie Chan fan but...come on in Jackie, your time is up.",Rush Hour
148,Rash,Slow down !,7,9 December 1998,"The film is definitely Jackie's best effort in Hollywood and is watchable. For a diehard Chan fan (ahem) like myself I didn't see anything new from his Hong Kong films but I enjoyed his more subtle, yet still hyper-active, role.I gave it a seven because half way through I didn't feel like getting up and leaving. The storyline was bog standard but was helped along the way with huge helpings of Chris Tucker. Soon we will all become tired of Chris' brand of shouting through a fight scene, but for now he is very funny.Go and see it now.",Rush Hour
149,Vaseal,Enjoyable Romp,7,20 October 2000,"Very Entertaining, Great Martial Arts (as one would expect from Jackie Chan) and a young Eddie Murphy (in the shape of Chris Tucker) Enjoy this Movie with a bottle of bud and a Chinese takeaway.  I did !!!!Watch out for Chris Tucker when he meets the brothers in the pool hall. Its a very funny scene.",Rush Hour
150,hawkeye56,Worth every penny!,9,17 October 1998,"First, I am not a martial arts film fan.  I am however someone who enjoys being entertained and this film does just that.  Wrapped around a thin plot it is a buddy/buddy film that works.  Just as Mel and Danny made the Lethal Weapon films work, Jackie and Chris fit together just as well.  The clips they show you in the trailers are not the only good scenes in this movie, the films full of them.  All in all, well worth the time and money.",Rush Hour
151,Carl Tano,"Incredibly funny, average action",8,3 August 2001,"Chris Tucker is one of the best comedic actors on screen right now and Jackie Chan is the best action star ever.  You mix them up and what do you get? Quite a rush. There are not as many or as long kung fu fighting scenes like in Jackie's good old Hong Kong classics like Drunken Master II or Project A. But on the other hand, those movies don't make you laugh like Rush Hour. This is without a doubt the funniest movie Jackie has ever appeared in. The movie does never have a dull moment, it's action and laughs, action and laughs throughout the whole thing. This isn't a movie for everyone but anyone who likes Jackie Chan or Chris Tucker will probably love it. I know I did.",Rush Hour
152,The Fox-2,Social commentary with a humorous (literal) kick!,8,28 September 1998,"Rush on out to see ""Rush Hour!""  Jackie Chan's latest English language work is his best to date.  The humor is rampant and audiences stay entertained.The expected ""east-meets-west"" angle is raucously hilarious without being overdone.  Chan's strait-laced Hong Kong detective and Tucker's streetwise LAPD loose cannon complement each other beautifully as they race to recover the daughter of the newly installed Hong Kong consulate, kidnapped by the minions of a shadowy Hong Kong crime boss.This is basically a ""buddy"" sort of movie with a 90's sensibility to it.  Tucker and Chan are much more than just an updated Axel Foley and Billy Rosewood (from ""Beverly Hills Cop""); ""Rush Hour"" introduces true diversity into the mix. Early on, after Tucker all but shouts himself hoarse, asking if Chan ""understands the words that are coming out of my mouth,"" Chan eventually speaks to him in clear English.  When Tucker reveals his shock at Chan's knowledge of the language, Chan replies that Tucker only ASSUMED that he didn't speak English. This sort of interaction is representative of the assumptions that we sometimes make about people whose cultures we may not be familiar with, and it lends a wonderful sense of realism to the film.Aside from being a quasi-social commentary, ""Rush Hour"" is a rollicking treat.  The action is without much of the cartoonishness that was present in previous Chan ventures, but remains just as entertaining, if not more entertaining than, his earlier works.  Practically every bit of this movie screams, ""FUN! FUN!  FUN!"", from the opening scene to Chan's signature outtakes montage during the end credits.  ""Rush Hour"" is one slick package.  Don't let it pass you by.",Rush Hour
153,Karthik,Really liked this movie,10,30 May 1999,"I didn't expect ""Rush Hour"" to be this good! It's one of the best Jackie Chan movies I've seen. Jackie and Chris Tucker are excellent. There's plenty of action, and non-stop comedy in this very very entertaining movie. Better than ""First Strike"" definitely.",Rush Hour
154,firedude440,Really good,7,16 August 2001,"I love this movie so much. This is an awesome movie. But the second one is better. If you want to read about the second one just click on my name. But I'm here today to talk about the first one. Now it's been a while since I've seen so bear with me. This is about a rich family and their little daughter is kidnaped and turns out to be Inspector Lee's (Jackie Chan) case since the kidnaping was in Hong Kong but they traced him back to L.A. Thats where Chris Tucker comes in as Detective James Carter.(But every one just calls him Carter, even in the second one.) He is assigned to be Lee's partner but takes matters into his own hands. Soon he starts bossing everyone around and it's his show.Thats all I'll tell you because frankly that's all I remember. Well it is a good movie and I hope you like it. 7/10",Rush Hour
155,Cress,"A great action ""buddy, buddy"" film",10,9 December 1998,"I've always liked Jackie Chan movies. I'm not especially a martial arts/kung fu movie fan but there's something about Jackie Chan that shines to the max in this film. When I'd read that Chris Tucker his partner in this movie was a wannabe Eddie Murphy with an annoyingly twangy high-pitched voice I must say I was put off a bit but I went to see it regardless and.......It's EXCELLENT, Jackie Chan's best 'Hollywood' film by far. Chris Tucker is not an Eddie Murphy wannabe, he's just the next generation Eddie Murphy. And don't forget you have that with everything. Matt Damon is supposed to be the next Brad Pitt, Matthew Mcwhatsit! (From A Time to Kill and Contact) is supposed to be the next Paul Newman, Skeet Ulrich is the new Johnny Depp, Neve Campbell is a young endangered Jamie Lee Curtis and of course the new generation brat packers (Christina Ricci, Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Love Hewitt etc) but back to the movie it's quite a simple plot Jackie Chan a cop in Hong Kong  runs some dangerous gangstas out of Hong Kong to America. There they kidnap the daughter of the Chinese Diplomat. He sends over his trusted Cop Chan to cover the case and the FBI wanting full control of the case get a local LA cop to ""babysit"" Chan In comes Tucker and the two themselves after a shaky (but funny) start decide to bust the case themselves with hilarious results. This is a superb film to watch and the fight sequences are amazing as usual when you have Jackie Chan on board. This is a great film to watch if you haven't seen Jackie Chan yet. And for the truly devoted Chan fans there are the usual hysterical out-takes at the end when the credits are rolling. Go and see it now, you won't be disappointed",Rush Hour
156,rcuppen79,A new action duo has stand up,7,18 April 2002,"Mel Gibson and Danny Glover were a great action duo in the Lethal Weapon movies and so are Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in Rush Hour.

One of the better action movies of recent years.",Rush Hour
157,mic90,A new age Beverly Hills cop movie which fit like punch on the eye,8,24 January 2010,"Rush Hour its a basic buddy-movie but with a new dimensions what comes to action. One reason why this was so successfully that Jackie Chan's and Chris Tucker's chemistry worked a perfectly And off course both live certainly in different cultures. And they are complete different actors. Basic plot that's kind of movies but who expeted more? This isn't Oscar film so don't take it seriously. It's kind of irony that Jackie is done these kind of movies since 80s but still his breakthrough happened much later. Okay there are differences but concept is a same.Action scenes were an typical Hollywood fighting those days ""straight punches and kicks"" but a little bit humor. Overall Rush Hour is one of the action comedy movies. The cast isn't A-list but worked a very well in this movie. If audience would forget that Chan's English skills aren't that good, his acting its a pretty good.Sometimes its difficult to say about Chris Tucker. He is in same time a funny, annoying and good comedian actor but also seem that he play himself but it isn't problem.",Rush Hour
158,max_tony,Sticks to the formula but delivers a fun movie.,8,10 September 2009,"I see this movie is not getting very good reviews. However, I very much enjoyed this movie. There is no ground breaking acting or film-making here...the same formula is in place...a buddy movie of action and comedy. I really enjoyed the first movie, but Rush Hour 2 was just a little more bland. Rush Hour was one of the first that coupled Jackie Chan with an American star to fuse his martial arts skills with comedy. While I am not a big fan of Chris Tucker, I found myself liking this duo. An African-American Comedian paired together with an Asian Action Martial Arts Legend for an action/comedy worked for me. Now on its third installment seemed on face value to be an uninteresting stretch of the original and only out to make a quick buck. However,after watching this as a rental I bought a copy. This movie delivered as an entertaining reworking of the formula. This movie finds them headed to Paris to find the assassin who attempts the Chinese Ambassador's life. We find out that Jackie Chan's character was in an orphanage and has a connection of some sort of ""brotherhood"" with another boy that turns to a life of crime. Now Jackie Chan is on a mission to bring down the Triads, despite his ""brother's"" involvement. Chris Tucker continues to keep things funny with his stylish dancing, singing and comedic cop blunders...Jackie Chan continues to impress with his still agile martial arts moves. Take this movie on face value...an entertaining action comedy that puts a slightly new twist on the same formula. If you liked the other movies, then this one will not disappoint.",Rush Hour
159,motherfu,Chris Tucker runs his mouth and Jackie Chan kicks butt in the best buddy-cop movie since the Lethal Weapons.,10,20 September 1998,"Rush Hour, Jackie Chan's first American movie, is a perfect vehicle for the Hong Kong superstar.  It's also a breakthrough for Chris Tucker, whose high-pitched comedy makes this one of the funniest action movies ever. Together, Chris and Jackie are so fast and so funny that the movie should catapult both of them into stardom, maybe even a sequel. Once American audiences get a look at Jackie Chan in Rush Hour, a lot of second rate action heros like Steven Seagal and Van Damme are gonna be on the unemployment line. There's not much to say for the story, it's a standard kidnapping and ransom plot. But there's plenty of room for Chris Tucker to do his thing, and he gets more laughs than Eddie Murphy has in the past ten years. There's also lots of Jackie's unbelievable stunts. Just watching him take a guy's gun away is more fun and more exciting than seeing Stallone blow something up.",Rush Hour
160,robert_montana,Rush Hour Don't.,4,10 September 2009,"I enjoyed the prequels, and found the relationship between Tucker and Chan previously hilarious. RH3, however, was a re-hash of the first two without the charm or humor. I think I may have laughed once - and it was during the NGs. Tucker was exceedingly annoying in this film, and his character didn't seem to have any purpose other than to bungle everything up in the most irritating way possible. Chan is always likable, but he seemed tired in this film. I was able to predict EVERYTHING - who the villain was, who the girl was, (SPOILER ALERT) who the good-guy-turned-bad-guy was, etc. I hope to see more movies from Tucker and Chan in their separate endeavors, but not in any more Rush Hour sequels. It's just too tired. I recommend a rental, but not a purchase.",Rush Hour
161,Zui Quan,Surprisingly good!,7,25 September 1998,"Surprisingly, this is effective and inventive casting. The tag line proclaims Rush Hour as ""The fastest hands in the East meets the biggest mouth in the West"", and then actually follows through on that promise. Tucker is nowhere near as annoying as he was in Money Talks (1997), and he works well with Chan, at one point holding one hand in his while using the other to hold his own against more than a few baddies. He is certainly a better partner than Danny Aiello made in Chan's last US film (1985's ill-advised The Protector). Chan is also in good form, doing much more than would be expected from him in an American film under an American director. True - he never does any major stunts, but I'll watch the man shimmy up a wall any day (and there are several terrific variations on this theme throughout the movie). The only negative thing I can say is that the camera needed to be back a bit during action sequences. Jackie moves fast enough; the camera shouldn't have to. This made it difficult at times to see who was doing what to whom. In short, Rush Hour is terrific fun, and it will do just fine until Drunken Master 2 is released here in the States.",Rush Hour

Chris Tucker belongs with actors/actresses who are funny, who sound funny and who can grab the audiences attention.",Rush Hour
166,Fieracha,Very good,8,31 January 1999,"I liked this movie. It was a good viewing experience, with a blend of action, comedy and story that we have come to expect from Chan.Its not an Oscar winning piece on the morality of man or some other, hoity-toity load of garbage that Hollywood usually inserts into a gorefest or 'art' movie. Its nice and simple - girl kidnapped, must be rescued.Jackie Chan is primarily an entertainer. His consummate skills in martial arts are evident throughout the film, but unlike his early movies relies on more than just his physical prowess (which has slipped only slightly since his youth).Chris Tucker is funny, but slightly annoying as the black cop trying to fit into Eddie Murphy's ""Beverly Hills Cop"" skin. I found his performance irritating at the start of the film, but managed to ease myself into it, with his wise-cracking and typical afro-american charisma. However I would warn directors off continuing this style of typecasting for these characters, it is becoming a little tedious.I gave it 8 out of 10, for sheer stunt, kick and action work.",Rush Hour
167,Shingle,Pure entertainment!,7,10 July 2000,"After Brett Ratner's hit Money Talks (not sure by how much it's a hit) he again teams up with fast talker Chris Tucker for another buddy movie. This time with the stunt supremeo himself, Jackie Chan.  The film starts after the handing over of China and the story has some top rich Chinese bloke moving into America. Sorry, he's the Eastern city's US consul when he moves into America with his daughter. On his daughter's first day at school she gets kidnapped by Oriental gangsters who obviously seem to know how rich her father is as they ask for a ransom of $50million. The FBI come in to help but are told that one guy from China is already coming in to help (Chan). The Feds want him as far away from this case as possible because as they say they don't want this thing to get ""international"". They decide to assign the worst LAPD cop (Tucker) to baby-sit him. This is what connects Tucker to Chan. Although they're both told to keep away from this case they end up becoming heavily involved as they decide to take matters into their own hands. It's here where the excitement starts to kick in.  The plot really is below average. But that soon becomes forgettable. This is one very entertaining action comedy buddy movie which is just so good that it puts the Lethal Weapon series to shame. You're given just the kind of over the top entertainment that you demand. Comedy from the fast jive talking Tucker and action from the fast stunt fighter Chan. You will be laughing out loud and you will be wowed over the stunts. Though the stunts from Chan aren't up to scratch as his earlier films, which might be due to age. The buddy' element between these two is just highly unlikely which is probably what makes it work so well. We also see the two of them gain things from each other with Tucker learning a few martial arts and Chan learning to be a little more cool and relaxed. The combination is just excellent. The weak plot really is just a silly excuse to see these two actors doing what they do best. The film also moves at quite a pace from one scene to the next to ensure that you aren't bored for a minute.  It may not be a masterpiece in many ways but with two actors on fine form, some stupendous action sets, quick-fire comedy, a great soundtrack and the chance to hear Chan utter a rude word, then this comes highly recommended. Plus stick around at the end, as there's some out-takes at the credits.My rating - 7 out of 10",Rush Hour
168,edmc499,An amazing Comedy-Action film,9,25 June 2020,The best part of this film is easily the comedy duo of Chris Tucker as Detective Carter and Jackie Chan as Detective Lee. With every joke making me laugh from the beginning to the end. The action was really good and it felt real with each punch and kick. The stunts are really impressive and make the action look so much better. The story is very well constructed yet simple. Only negative is the film could of had a more fearful villian. Amazing film definietly worth a watch,Rush Hour
169,Leviat,A great mix of Action and Comedy,10,20 September 1998,"What ""Rush Hour"" has best going for it, is the teaming of Chan and Tucker. Jackie Chan, Arguably the greatest Hong Kong Mega-Star, has a great on-screen rapport with Chris Tucker, and that makes this movie work.  From start to finish, this movie had me laughing.  I expected it to be funny, but not THAT funny.  Jackie Chan really shines in this, I think mainly because he didn't have to carry the film by himself, which most of his Hong Kong movies seem to need.  Chris Tucker is extremely well cast in this, and shows off his talent for fast-paced humor once again.  All in all, this film is well worth going to see, especially if you are a fan of Action/Comedy.  I give it four stars, and hope to see more movies like this in the future!",Rush Hour

OK, so it doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat the whole way through and it doesn't leave you breathless and it doesn't make you think 'Oh my God, they're gonna get sued!' (pity...) but it is great fun and will have you in hysterics a lot of the time. Thank heavens for Chris Tucker. He does a brilliant job as Carter and no one could possibly have obtained so many laughs from such a precarious script as he did. It took skill, serious skill. Yet we all know who stole the show... Who else but the incredible Mr Jackie Chan? Does this guy rock or what?! The martial arts are amazing and we all know it inspires us to practise our high kicks in secret when we're alone. Go on, admit it... He also uses the script to it's full potential. (I think the casting director should be given a special mention since she/he picked such perfect actors to fill these roles. Without them this film would almost have inevitably flopped.) Like I said, the script was dangerous but these guys managed to pull it off.

The Nice Guys is the only relatively recent movie that holds a candle to those past greats.If you want great action, funny comedy and some feel goodness thrown in for good measure don't go past this guy. I'm sure if this movie was made today it'd be rated an 8 or higher but as it was released when buddy cop movies were quite common it didn't stand out as much although it still was a success of course.

Jackie Chan plays second fiddle to Chris Tucker in this movie and this does not do the movie any good.  I really wonder what Jackie Chan is doing in this movie as he has almost nothing to do except playing a cliché fish out of the water character.

Chris Tucker is the most irritating man on the planet bar none and unfortunately Jackie is reduced to the role of amusing little foreign man which is unforgiveable.  The stunts and action sequences are forgettable, coming as secondary to the dreadful interaction between the two main stars.I feel quite gutted that Jackie Chan's bit Western break has come to this and it is sad that most people will be introduced to his vast talents with this truly awful film.",Rush Hour
179,zonayed123,Good film but action is less,7,10 June 2008,"I'm a die hard martial arts and Jackie Chan fan. That's why I saw the film but I was a little disappointed that where is the martial arts. Jackie should be involved in long fight scenes with his humoristic acts. Fight scenes were incredibly short in this film.On the other hand it has some funny materials. I like the scene when Chris Tucker meets Chan in airport and says, ""please tell me you speak English. I'm detective Carter, do you understand the words that are coming out my mouth"", That's really funny!! Chan and Tucker both are master comedians. Their chemistry was awesome but Hollywood should increase action stunts rather than focusing on relationship or comedy.",Rush Hour
180,KingFarticus,Rush Hour delivers some really funny laughs . Great Movie!!,7,22 August 2011,"Do you enjoy funny movies with a fresh style of comedy from a great cast and crew? Well if you do then I think that you should watch this. Rush Hour is a great comedy that is full of laughs and action. This was in my opinion the movie that made Jackie Chan known by fans. And this movie also made Chris Tucker(which was a rookie at the time)a good comedy actor. With Chris Tuckers fast and non-stop running mouth,having to team up with Jackie Chans impatient and know-it-all sense of humour. This is what makes the movie a great one. As the movie is recognized by Jackie Chan fans will be marked down to be one of the greatest buddy-cop films. So next time you go to BlockBuster then I suggest that you rent Rush Hour!",Rush Hour

After subduing his efforts in his first American outings (Battle Creek Brawl, The Protector, Cannonball Run 1 & 2), they finally let him cut loose in the film.Still, he's kinda held back, because there are a lot of conventions that must take place in Hollywood cinema.  But, at least you don't have an annoying whiny female co-star like in half of his other films.Not perfect, but just a fun film, and it does not aspire to be anything more than just a fun film.  Could've used a bit more action, but the humor kinda makes up for it.",Rush Hour

I'm definitely going to see this one again!",Rush Hour

191,nosoup99,Awesome,10,17 October 1998,"This movie was great. I really loved it. Chris Tucker is such a hilarious actor. I was laughing the entire time. He played his character great (the dancing, the way he spoke, and the idle sarcasm and humor).As for Jackie Chan, in this movie it actually looked like he was talking. In a lot of movies it looks like someone is dubbing in for him and that he is actually not even speaking English. However, there was nothing that spectacular about his acting.The stereo-types in the movie, were written and acted in such away that nothing seemed offensive but instead were funny. All in all I think the best part of the film was the comedy and Chris Tucker. Two Thumbs Up!",Rush Hour
192,JB007LTK,This is a very well done action movie that combines well choreographed martial arts scenes along with well written humor.,9,20 September 1998,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.   The martial arts expertise of Jackie Chan is superb.  He is truly a master, and it is displayed well in this movie.  Chris Tucker does a terrific job of playing the off the wall LAPD officer who is assigned to keep Chan's character out of the way of an investigation, but ends up helping him solve it in the end.  Chris Tucker is an extremely well disciplined actor, and seems to go very smoothly with the styles of Jackie Chan.  Not only is the action part of the movie good, the now common jokes in martial arts movies are all there, including many racial/cultural difference jokes (not necessarily making fun of races, but the cultural differences.  Ie; a scene where Tucker and Chan's characters go into a bar to get some information, and Tucker's character says to another person ""Wusup my nigga?"".  Chan's character not realizing what this would mean from a non black person to a black person says that to a person in the bar, and a whole chain of events ensue, which might I add was a well done bit.) and a whole array of other funny parts, a lot having to do with the communication of the languages.  I gave this movie a 9 rating, as it is a good movie, with few flaws, yet they are there.  The major flaw is that it is an action movie.  Action movies generally cannot be scored as 10's  as they do not contain the material that make a truly incredible movie.  I do recommend you see this and have a good laugh.",Rush Hour
193,Tom-152,"Fun, light movie",8,23 September 1998,A very fun movie.  Chan and Tucker had great chemistry. Great martial arts and even a plot surprise.,Rush Hour
194,BChase,"Good, but not typical Jackie Chan movie",8,28 September 1998,"My wife and I enjoyed Rush Hour a lot, but we were somewhat jarred by the Hollywood influence of foul language, and more bloodiness. For us, it was no big problem, but it means we can't take our friend's 5 year old Jackie fanatic to see it. We have both greatly enjoyed the lightness of Mr. Chan's own productions.",Rush Hour
195,elman,A very funny comedy-action movie,8,6 April 1999,"I saw many Chan movies before seeing this one and also knew that his previous American movies were crappy. Those movies, including the two Cannonball run movies, did not let Jackie BE Jackie. Those directors must have seen Jackie showing his stuff in his movies but they treated him like an ordinary ""Michael Dudikov"". Rush hour director Brett Ratner changed that by letting Jackie choreograph his stunts and action movies, but don't expect 10 minute fights or breathtaking stunts.That ""dangerous"" final stunt was obviously cheated (you SEE it when Jackie uses bluescreen and the stunt was not shown in one shot).For some reason the filmmakers were afraid that American audience would not accept the long fights, but every body who has seen this movie, including people who were introduced to Jackie with this movie, felt they wanted to see more of the action! So most of all this movie is a comedy a very funny comedy! Chris Tucker is hilarious, Jackie Chan is funny as always and the two as a team is as hilarious as Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in their best funny moments.Whereas all other Jackie flics have great action scenes to remember this movie has great verbal action(you see still action).Jackie saying ""Wassup my niggah"" with that funny accent is just hilarious. And you just want push the pause-button when Chris shows his badge. But I won't spoil any more of the comedy. There are some short but REAL action scenes which I can write down, because you can talk as much as you want about Jackie Chan fights but you have to see them to get it to be impressed!! Those action scenes are fast funny and the best is the one where Jackie fights the bad guys while trying to save some antique vases. And there are those ""how did he get there"" and ""he's so fast""moments. So check out this movie and for the fans or people who became a fan after seeing this movie:I read some stuff about making Rush hour 2, with more fights, stunts and with a budget of 100mln dollars!!!!!!!",Rush Hour

I loved Money Talks, but I thought this one was better because it had much more of a plot and Chan was a much better co-star than Charlie Scheen.  The whole theatre couldnt stop laughing and when they weren't laughing they cheered Jackie Chan on.  When the movie ended everyone clapped for like 3 minutes and pretty loudly too! Thats how good it was! I definitely recommend it if you like comedy!  9 of 10.",Rush Hour

199,Alec-2,A hilariously funny comedy (non-spoiler review),10,19 September 1998,"This film starring the well-known Jackie Chan and the comic Chris Tucker, is a great movie. It could be classified as a great comedy but also has a very well plot packed with a lot of ""cool"" action and adventure, such as Jackie Chan using his martial arts expertise to dispose of bad guys. Chris Tucker is a great laugh, as always, with Jackie Chan and others supporting. I recommend this movie to anyone. You will be in for a good laugh.",Rush Hour

It is not only a comedy as it is advertised as but it has a great plot too. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are the best team in an action flick since . . . well for a long time. The movie is hilarious and packed with action including explosions, gunfire and all that stuff. You don't even have to be a Jackie Chan fan to like this movie. Not even an action movie fan do you have to be. I can pretty much guarantee if you see this movie that you will enjoy it. Thank you.Alec-2",Rush Hour
201,Pat-46,"Great action movie, enjoyable to watch",8,20 September 1998,This movie is a really enjoyable movie.  There is a lot of action and a great deal of humor throughout.

202,xr75,Funny cop movie moves quickly through formula,8,5 October 1998,"Ok, so its basically a formula buddy cop movie.  But it is very funny. Jackie Chan provides the usual fighting, as well as good lines (he plays the straight man to Chris Tucker.)  If you laughed at the preview, you won't be disappointed, even though a lot of the best jokes are in there.  Fun and action packed, don't expect anything else (character development, subtext, etc) and you'll be happy.",Rush Hour
203,rotani,Well-executed action movie formula,8,4 October 1998,"Jackie Chan is at his best in this one, and Chris Tucker isn't as annoying as he was in _The Fifth Element_.  They work together almost as well as Danny Glover and Mel Gibson in the _Lethal Weapon_ movies.  The scene in the pool hall is one to remember.  If you're a fan of Jackie Chan, you can't miss this movie.  If you're any kind of an action fan, you'll find a lot to like, too.",Rush Hour

205,AznDreamCATCHA,A good and funny action movie about 2 totally different cops who team up,10,9 September 2001,"Rush Hour is a good comedy movie.  The plot is good and the action is fair, and Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan is a dynamic duo.  These 2 cops team up to find and rescue a Chinese counselor's daughter who was kidnapped. However, Chris Tucker is Detectice James Carter, a hotshot cop who has a big mouth and likes to fool around a lot.  Jackie Chan is Detective Lee who is a cop from China who can do some kung-fu ass kicking and has the fastest hands of the East.  Both of them hate each other in the beginning, but they gotta work together to find the girl.Rush Hour has some funny scenes like when Chan walks into the African American club and asks the bartender ""wazap, ma nigga!"" and he learns the hard way of what he said means.  Also when Tucker walks into the room with Sang and his gang saying that hes the half brother of Juntao.  Hehe, funny.However, Rush Hour still is not as good as expected.  I expected much more laughing and much more action.  Most of the time in the movie, Tucker and Chan are b*tching to each other about something.  The bloopers are funnier than the movie sometimes!  The action isn't much except for the restaurant fight and the final showdown at the embassy, but thats it.  You can count the bar incident too, but it still isn't enough.  As I said, most of the movie they b*tch about some things.Rush Hour wasn't as good as I expected, but its still worth a ticker or rental.Give it a 7 out of 10",Rush Hour
206,burke-gary29,Rush Hour amazes,10,13 February 2012,"Carter usually works alone...this time, he has company. Reluctantly, the Lee and Carter align together and a culture clash becomes obvious. The wonderful pair is drawn to a series of mishaps, conspiracies, and plenty of high kicking action and adventure! Carter shows Lee a tour or two around the city of Los Angeles; and the pair quickly become best buddies. However, Lee and Carter can't help but to interfere with the FBI's affairs. Lee cares only so much about the kidnapped child. He feels that he must help track her down before the nefarious villains murder her... Meanwhile, Carter ticks off a few of the locals before he faces absolute terror. Can Lee convince Carter to focus on this mission to rescue the Diplomat's daughter held for ransom? Or will it be too late? RUSH HOUR is one of the most jamming action/comedy mixtures ever. This film is one awesome venture with the presence of both Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker helping to create a winner for the action genre. RUSH HOUR is entertaining, a fast-paced cop-buddy flick. Part of this film's success owes to the eccentric chemistry between the two leading stars. For example, Jackie Chan's athletic capabilities are strikingly in contrast to Chris Tucker's overzealous, fidgety reactions. Chan's ability to maneuver high risk jumps, leaps, and other assorted dangerous stunts definitely keeps the energy going while Tucker's jittery silliness always creates a warm smile on the viewer's face. Tucker's motor-mouth is surprisingly compatible to Chan's martial arts prowess. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are a definite revelation! The cast in RUSH HOUR prove themselves worthy of their roles. Besides the two main characters, the supporting cast is terrific. Elizabeth Pena adds a touch of sentimentality as Tucker's unappreciated sidekick who turns out to be an asset to the police department after all. Mark Rolston (ALIENS) and Tzi Ma (CHAIN REACTION, RAPID FIRE) as a strategic FBI agent and Consul Han respectively all add credibility to their parts. Newcomer Julie Hsu is also fabulous as a hostage who proves to be more difficult for the bad guys than they can handle...RUSH HOUR has top notch stunts mixed with one-of-a-kind comical moments which help make this film an enlightening combination of action and comedy, with a dash of Chan's fantastic skill work.",Rush Hour
207,robertazzo,Chris Tucker is no Eddie Murphy,3,24 September 2018,"This movie would have been so much better without Chris Tucker. He didn't make me laugh once and with his creepy eyes he would be much more suited to do horror flicks. Any other actor could have pulled it off, Tucker falls flat. Jackie Chan's move were Bruce Lee quality as usual. Jackie Chan 's performance is the only redeeming quality to this slow-moving, yawn of a film.",Rush Hour
208,garylcamp,poor movie due to Tucker,4,17 February 2015,"We love Jackie Chan. We have all his movies. But Chris Tucker is just too silly and ruins Jackie's movie. Jackie should have used Will Smith or Eddie Murphy. The silliness detracts from the story. All 3 Rush Hour movies are the same for us, the worst of all Chan's movies, including Jackie's early Chinese work, which at least were consistent in the humor. Tuckers humor is High School clown and does not mesh with Jackie's. He should work with Jack Black or other silly comedians. You can not relate the movie theme to Tuckers off the wall immature humor.I am not saying Chris Tucker is not a good comedian as he has good wit, insight and humor in his own right, It is just he does not fit well with Jackie's self effacing Serious and clean movies. He acts his part seriously and Tucker is just ad-libbing off the wall jokes like he is on a talk show and it just does not fit in the movie. I give the rating 4 out of ten because of Jackie Chan and the other hard working actors doing the best they can while Chris cracks jokes that have nothing to do with the movie.",Rush Hour

The dynamic duo started of with Rush Hour which, since I like action-comedy movies, is one of my favorites. It's a really cool match between awesome a**-kicking moves, delivered from the famous Chinese actor Jackie Chan, and the clumsiness and stupidity from one of the funniest men alive, Chris Tucker. It has it all, when it comes to comedy and dialogs. ""I like to let people talk, that like to talk, and when they talk I can see how full of sh*t they are"" Jackie spits at Chris Tucker and just that sentence gives you a glimpses of what is too come.

He's paired with motormouth comic Chris Tucker, and, as a pair of mismatched detectives, they must try to rescue a young 11-year old girl who's been kidnapped. Besides the hilarious script, what makes ""Rush Hour"" work so well is the great chemistry between these two, and how well they play off each other. Chan is delightful, funny, and STILL the undisputed king stuntman. And Chris Tucker is, well, Chris Tucker, but he IS funny in his over-the-top, eager-to-please performance. My only criticism is that Tom Wilkinson, the lovable older stripper from ""The Full Monty,"" isn't given very much to do as the villain. But otherwise, ""Rush Hour"" is a highly entertaining film, and not just another run-of-the-mill buddy cop flick. Check it out and have fun! :-)",Rush Hour

Whatever you call the genre, this is a relatively strong entry.  The dialogue is funny as hell in parts, and the action is swift.  (In fact, I found the action sequences better than in most Chan films, because they were played at what I believe is real-time, as opposed to the slightly sped-up action bits in most Chan films.)I wasn't expecting much out of this film.

Car chases, explosions, gun battles occur with predictable regularity and with the patented Hollywood special effects. None of it is memorable or outstanding, but in general fairly entertaining. The movie will lose impact on a small screen, so see it in a theater.In my personal opinion, this is a prime example of the kind of violent entertainment Hollywood is producing by the truckload... The villains are shot, killed, mutilated, while the heroes run through hails of bullets with minor injuries. I really question what this kind of movie teaches our young, impressionable children and teenagers...  does it tell them shooting up people is OK?  Does it tell them that if you are the ""good"" guy you cannot be hurt or killed?  I suspect that for SOME of our younger generation(s) this is the perceived message....",Rush Hour

I love action and I love comedy and this has the perfect combination of both.When I first saw this about a decade ago it was a laugh riot, when I viewed again few years later it was equally entertaining. Although a simple plot the pace of the movie, dialogue, situations and above all the chemistry between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker is fantastic. Though many will disagree for me James Carter is probably the funniest character ever. I have rated movies which are superior than this lower but for me its a 10/10 keeping in my mind my expectations and judging it for the type of movie it is.

While the other one is a cool, slick cop who likes women and having a good time. This is a movie I always have fun watching. Jackie Chan does the fighting, Chris Tucker does the talking.

Chris Tucker becomes extremely annoying in the first 15 minutes of this pathetic film. This film was WAY too much like MONEY TALKS (also directed by Brett Ratner and starring Chris Tucker). The title is very misleading (had nothing whatsoever to do with rush hour). This was definetly not a Jackie Chan movie, for his fighting scenes were lame and tiresome.

Rush Hour has a pretty simple plot (a child kidnapping) but it manages to keep you interested and entertained (there's more to it than that, but I'm keeping it short).  For a Chan film, there aren't that many fight scenes, but they are very good and the same goes for the stunts.  This is the by far the funniest of Chans movies (thanks goes to Tucker here!) and the out-takes at the end of the movie are worth the price of admission alone! See it and have fun!",Rush Hour

He manages to make them funny, yet not offend anybody.  Jackie Chan sounds a little awkward with his English, but that's okay.  There could have been a little more martial arts fighting in the movie, but the comedy makes up for it.  I give it a 10",Rush Hour
231,jenius82,"Well, the trailer was good ...",1,31 January 1999,"An awful lot of people seem to like this film. I can't really see why. Maybe they never saw the trailer beforehand and consquently anything that took place in this film was a new feature for them.I can't say the same.Any redeeming features that the film had were packed into this trailer of normal length. Sure, Tucker is funny and Chan performs his stunts. I just expected Tucker to be funny more often and Chan ...well, okay, there was a lot of fighting, none of it particularly original.All this is hung over the averagest of average plots. The daughter of an official is kidnapped (there's no mystery to who the kidnapper is, nor do we really care) and they must rescue her. Not a single twist in sight.In my opinion, this could have been a good film and the pairing should have had some potential. Instead, spending my money on this was a waste of my time and a fiver.",Rush Hour
232,krank-3,the best movie for 98,10,1 February 1999,Rush Hour is the best movie for 98. It's hella funny and there's a lot of action. Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan worked good together on this movie. i rate a 10.,Rush Hour
233,joley,"Very funny, a laugh a minute.",8,4 February 1999,"I thought this film was brilliant, it had me in stitches. The jackie chan relationship with chris tucker was excellent, they worked so well together. I especially liked the 'war'scene where they were both singing the song. The whole audience was in fits. Not only is the film brilliant the soundtrack is also worth a listen. It includes Jay-Z and the talented Dru HIll. I recommend this film to anyone who likes a good laugh.",Rush Hour

Unlike Eddie Murphy, this guy gets played off the screen by Jackie Chan and an excellent supporting cast.  Tom Wilkinson as an Englishman in a Hollywood film predictably plays a villain, all be it very well. From the moment of the first explosion, you know you should have left your brain at home. Very missable save Jackie's excellent fight scenes.",Rush Hour
235,Bobski-3,Sensational!!!!!!!!!,10,18 September 1999,"This is a hilarious movie based on the chemistry between the 2 leading roles.  It really kept me going.  Jackie Chan did not do his best fighting skills out there, but he acted well, unlike 'Rumble In The Bronx'  Chris Tucker just mad me fall into histerics.  Honestly, this film is superb!",Rush Hour

And the fight scenes were great too!!!",Rush Hour
238,jamesgaos,it has two features many movies are missing these days: unbearable comedy and amusing stunts and fights.,10,6 August 2008,"this movie is beyond great. Chris Tucker and Lee are two opposites, so its basically comedy with action. and those two guys fit in very well in this buddy cop film. the storyline actually makes perfect sense. a British/Chinese crimelord and his men kidnap the consul's daughter and ask for a large sum of money in return for the girls life. the FBI help investigate on the case, while lee and carter do some investigating on their own; in bunches of hilarious laughs and kung fu stunts. the storyline actually makes perfect sense, the movie has something that makes u want to watch it over and over again. the point of this film is actually not the crime, but dialouge, comedy, and fights with the buddy cops. 10/10 excellent",Rush Hour
239,WillBeatz,Still after all these years is still fresh in my mind,10,13 August 2021,I have watched this movie more times than I can count every single time I watch this movie is like the first time. I watch this movie every year since it came out Jackie and Tucker are Hilarious together not a single scene I do not laugh and now my little sibling will continue to watch this movie till the end of time.,Rush Hour
240,Lili,This a great action movie!,10,7 October 1998,"I've seen Jackie Chan's other movies, and honestly, I was bored.  I had nothing against him personally, but the movies just seemed to be corny and never ending.  I was wary about seeing this one.  I was very glad I did though.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It had the usual kidnapper/hero plot with the cop theme, but I really liked the way it was put together. Way to go Jackie!  Now you've finally got it the way we want to see it! Chris Tucker was wonderful as well.  I really enjoyed this pairing and hope that they will make a sequel.  The length of the fight scenes was kept down so that the audience just got the intense blast of Jackie's fancy footwork, and the dialogue was witty and entertaining.  These two gentlemen seem to have a good rapport, and the chemistry really came off well in the movie. This was one of my very favorite movies this year!",Rush Hour
241,Jay-59,Good movie,10,23 September 1998,"i thought that it was a good movie but they could have used Jackie Chan more and not made him as stupid when it comes to America, but was a good movie.",Rush Hour
242,Ericson,Not so good,6,21 September 1998,In my opinion this film is nowhere near as good as other Jackie Chan movies(Who Am I? and Police Story). Chris Tucker just weighted Jackie down in this movie. His comic attitude didn't fit in with this action genre. The fights were good but not nearly as numerous as in other Jackie films.,Rush Hour
243,Kal El,This Movie isn't all it is cracked up to be...,8,19 September 1998,"I went and saw ""Rush Hour"" on Friday because I am a fan of Jackie Chan's. Unfortunatley, I was rather disappointed. His performance seemed to me to be forced as though he really didn't want to be IN this movie. I have never seen Chris Tucker in a movie before, but he did a very good job in ""Rush Hour"". I also felt he worked rather well with Jackie Chan.Not only was this movie ruined because they showed all of the good parts in the trailer, but it was rather predictable. Chris Tucker's wit and charm saves this from being a rather drab and boring movie.Hopefully Jakie Chan and Chris Tucker will work on another movie again sometime, and maybe they will even make a movie to fit Jackie's talents.Overall the Movie was OK... I would give it a 7.5.",Rush Hour
244,Truman-2,Pure entertainment.,9,19 September 1998,"I'll state right now that I'm a tad biased towards any Jackie Chan movie just because I like to see martial arts and awesome stunts, and everything that goes with a JC flick.  But this movie, although not the best for JC action, is certainly one of the best.  The mix of humor and action is done just right and the movie is extraordinarily entertaining.  Sure, it's not going to win any awards - but it's an hour and a half (or maybe a little more?) of pure enjoyment.  Check it out.",Rush Hour
245,Bad Mojo,It's like seeing Lethal Weapon 1 all over again.,7,20 September 1998,"It's easy to accept Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as partners after a hit movie and three sequels, but the whole basis of two people who are opposites fades after that first movie. This is a chance to see a fresh and hilarious buddy movie that allows the two stars to show how different (and alike) they are. This is no typical Jackie Chan all-action-no-plot movie, and it isn't even a total Chris Tucker laugh-a-thon. It's an excellent mix of both without either being dominant.",Rush Hour
246,shaky,"Excellent movie, Chan and Tucker work well with each other",9,19 September 1998,"This movie is very funny, and of course with Jackie Chan in, it is full of action.

248,Kingfish-2,The film succeeds with a BELIEVEABLE odd-couple pairing!,9,22 September 1998,"To all of those people out there who didn't like this film because it was a by-the-numbers, unoriginal, buddy-cop movie, LIGHTEN UP!!!  Yes, the script may be a little weak.  Yes, Jackie Chan's stuntwork is not as extensive or awe-inspiring as in his Hong Kong films.  Yes, Chris Tucker has Eddie Murphy's shadow looming over him.  But the fact of the matter is, this is a HILARIOUS film with some of the best actor stuntwork seen in an AMERICAN film in quite some time.  Those two elements COMBINED are what make this a great film.  Tucker by himself in this film wouldn't have worked, because Chan was the necessary straight man to set up all of Tucker's jokes and make the reactions just that much funnier.  Chan by himself wouldn't work, because the stunts given to him were not enough to carry the whole film, but when coupled with Tucker's looks of amazement at what Chan was doing, the stunts gained so much more.  Tucker was doing on-screen what so many audience members (who haven't seen a Jackie Chan film) were doing in the audience.  The nicest thing about this odd-couple pairing is that it's entirely believeable.  The two actors really did confuse and astound the heck out of each other, and it translated on screen.  I for one, hope a sequel will be in the works.",Rush Hour

250,pwain,Dialogue in a US made Jackie Chan film!,9,24 September 1998,"For many Jackie Chan's best work was the non-Western made films (Drunken Master I and II, Project A to name three). Sure there were some good action scenes in Mr. Nice Guy but the lack of plot and the general acting, well, to put it nicely, sucked.Rush Hour, to me, proves the Jackie can make a good film in the US. Okay so at times the plot is dead obvious but there is dialogue to make up for it. Chris Tucker is a much toned down (but still outrageous) and thankfully fails to steal most scenes from Jackie (but when he does its well deserved). And the song outside the restaurant needs to be seen to be believed!To my mind however there is one thing left that needs to be carried over from the earlier Chan movies: more actions scenes. Thats the only reasons I gave it a 9/10 and not a 10",Rush Hour
251,C-Rick,Jackie & Chris are awesome!,10,29 September 1998,"First off, I am a huge Jackie Chan fan!!!  I loved almost all of his ""real"" movies..  I was worried that this might turn out to be another ""PROTECTORS."" I was worried that the US might turn Jackie into that same guy in the eighties. Boy was I glad I was wrong!  This movie Rocks!  The fighting was awesome(it wasn't slowed down too much)and the humor made this movie a truly awesome buddy picture!  Jackie seemed to fit into this role really well.  He looked so comfortable working with Chris and they seemed to go so well together. Jackie had his share of humor but it was Chris Tucker who was a total riot! I really liked him after watching this movie.  I've liked him in all his other movies too (His role in fifth element, for me at least, saved that show).  But this time his character made me really like his work even more...  Just remember ""cigaweed!""  His off the top of his head lines were just awesome! RUSH HOUR is one of those movies that you have to see with a good crowd! Everyone will get into it and it makes you laugh out loud even more and you find that you are having an awesome time!  I know that I will see this movie again at least 2 more times!  Go see it in a really good theater too!  SDDS minimum!",Rush Hour
252,BradW,"More than what I expected, less than what I wanted",6,26 September 1998,"<mild spoilers>If you are a traditional Jackie Chan fan, then you'll be interested to note that there is a lot less fighting/stunt work in this movie.  The story line is still very good, and some of the stunts are just so totally amazing that you'll be glued to the edge of your seat (the final stunt, particularly, would give someone with a fear of heights something to cringe about).Chris Tucker is funny, but to the point of being annoying.  The few comical lines given to Jackie actually come off much funnier, especially the part where they are singing outside the Chinese restaurant.All in all, it was a better movie than the previews led you to believe it would be, but still not up to the standard that most Jackie fans will be expecting.",Rush Hour
253,Byte,Hollywood sell-out!,1,7 February 1999,"I wonder why people rate this movie so highly, for this isn't a Jacky Chan movie or even a decent action/comedy. It's a Chris Tucker movie and Jacky came along for the ride! And if you know Chris, you know the movie. I think he is an annoying bag of hot air with a faggy voice and Eddie Murphy style humor: I don't like him so I don't like the movie. As for the action in this picture: DON'T FILM ACTION SEQUENCES WITH A HANDHELD: KEEP THE SHOT STATIC (if they didn't, then they've moved the camera too up-close and too much)! Why? Because I couldn't follow the action except from the first scene: that one was quite good.",Rush Hour

I even heard claims like ""the best Jackie Chan ever"".  I was suspicious of Tucker, but as long as it was the new Chan movie it ought to be okay.Right ?Wrong !I found myself forced into one of the most annoying fake interracial buddy-buddy action/comedy blockbusters I have ever had the displeasure to had to sit through.Rush Hour is nothing more than a Chris Tucker Star Vehicle with Jackie reduced to a ""Chinaman"" sidekick.  That's all good and fine if you're under such heavy medication that you think Tucker is actually funny but after two minutes of him doing his little Eddie Murphy rip off routine I was ready to climb on a rooftop with an AK-47 and let justice rain from the sky.Throw in a mentally challenged plot, bad acting, the old ""where did all the money from the big budget go ?"" complaint and a director who couldn't direct an action scene to save his life and you got this feature length misery.If you're ready to see a real Jackie Chan movie, go to your local video-shop and rent Operation Condor.  Better still, you can rent any Chan title, it'll be better than this bowels loosener.Vote: 1",Rush Hour

For all you ppl commenting on that well then don't go see an action/comedy if that's the way you think! It's supposed to be FUNNY, not super-realistic! Since when do hong-kong cops go arresting people using karate moves?Chris tucker and Jackie chan make an amazing pair! I was laughing all through the film, so was the whole cinema.

I noticed that during some action scenes that it was hard to get a glimpse of what was going on. also the director wasn't creative enough, he needed to put some creativity into the film, more camera movement and wide angle shots.

This is an action comedy, not a drama 2. He is still funny as f*ck 3. Bruce Willis is a pretty bad actor but die hard doesn't have a 6.8/10 This is probably one of the funniest movies i've ever seen and Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan are a great match. Although the story is kind of predictable, you'll be laughing so hard you won't even realize. The action is great, the comedy is really funny, the acting (other than Chan) is good and there are so many great one-liners. If you are looking for a good laugh and some good action, i strongly suggest you check out the ""Rush Hour"" trilogy. The second is the best of the 3 in my opinion. The other two may be a bit repetitive, but are still extremely funny. I would give ""Rush Hour 2"" a 9/10 and ""Rush Hour 3"" an 8.5/10. No, they're not big blockbuster Die Hard, Tarantino, Fast and Furious movies. But they are very entertaining and something you can watch, and laugh at, time and time again.",Rush Hour
265,mohammedabulkalam,vote,10,5 March 2005,the film was awesome!!!!! i watched rush hour 1 couple of times and i also watched rush hour 2 couple of times. i liked the bit when Jackie Chan knocked all the bad guys in the museum and the funny bit is when all the money dropped from the air and Chris tucker puts in his pocket. i also liked the end when there both on the plane and Chris tucker spec's Chinese and Jackie listens to the song loud. my vote is to give 10 out of 10. i hope in rush hour 3 there are more fighting and stunts. i also hope it comes out soon as possible so everyone could enjoy the film if it comes in cinema i will book in so i will be the first person to see the film.,Rush Hour

And folks, let me tell ya, it was a HUGE disappointment.This is, without a doubt, Chris Rock's worst performance. At no point did I believe that he was one with the role, and his lines were terrible. How can a comedic legend of his stature be so bad at acting? His shrill voice got under my skin. I bet for most of the fight scenes he used a stunt double.With that being said, I am glad Bruce Lee went out on this note. This was a great way to end his acting career. He will be sorely missed.

268,tungbtse,It's nice comedy,7,17 January 2017,"Story of this film is so interesting that makes me can't stop watching it. As i see, the main story is saving the daughter of an ambassador from kidnappers. As an usual, in others film i have ever seen, it will have familiar motif such as thriller, dangerous, bloody scene and so on. This familiar motif makes me bored. But the longer this film lasts, the more interesting i feel. Not only that, it make me can't stop laughing during this film because of funny situation. A detective is unwilling to become a partner with a cop. Some situation is not to know whether to laugh or cry between two reluctant partners. Some thriller scene is added to the story make viewers feel nervous for characters. I still surprised in Thanh Long's talent although i have ever seen some his action film before. The film has happy ending. This little girl has saved safely, the kidnappers is arrested, others is injured or die. The detective and the cop also become close friend and make a perfect couple. Although the film ends, i can't get enough of it so i see it again and again. It's worth seeing",Rush Hour
269,anhnnse,it's so awesome !!,8,17 January 2017,"After watching the movie's name ""rush hour"", I'm just have to say that I'm so impress at the way the director created the story. Every body knows this movie's about a girl whom father's a rich person is kidnapped for money, with the help of 2 inspectors one from LA official and another's HongKong one that can help the girl out of danger situation. Along with the humor and thrilling at the writing style of two main characters by Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, the movie's become more melody and funny but it's also have some several fight scenes at the same time. About the detail which I impressed most is when the little girl in car and sung a pop song. Well, I think it's so funny and i had had a great time after watching it.On of the highlight in this movie's the way they create character personality. I'm totally interested in the ""black"" cop. He makes people believed that he's such a wise guy. Some people recommend about him as a negative personality because he doesn't help the case at all, sometime he just makes it more mess.But he's the most important to solve the case, without him the girl can escaped, his partner may gonna be died and so on. In conclusion, I love this movie at the way they ending it. No twist in this case that watcher don't understand, characters's all happy and the most important's it showed that ""justice always wins""",Rush Hour
