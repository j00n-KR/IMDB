0,SnoopyStyle,three great young stars,7,22 December 2015,"In 1952, medical science has found cures and by 1967, the average life span is 100 years old. Ruth, Kathy and Tommy are friends in the boarding school at Hailsham with headmistress Miss Emily (Charlotte Rampling). Miss Lucy (Sally Hawkins) is a new teacher at the peculiar school. She tells them that they are simple organ donors and is quickly fired. In 1985, they are sent to the cottages at 18. Kathy (Carey Mulligan) is in love with Tommy (Andrew Garfield) but he's with Ruth (Keira Knightley). Eventually, they donate until completion but there is a rumor for a love exception.I actually think the opening text and the first scene with Carey Mulligan reveal too much. There is no satisfaction in guessing the reveal. It's an interesting love triangle mainly due to the stellar young British stars. The film is filled with a quiet eeriness. Director Mark Romanek keeps the tone wistful. I don't completely buy the reality of this world. These are teenagers and many are bound to rebel. The great acting keeps it interesting especially from Mulligan.",Never Let Me Go
1,Horst_In_Translation,None of them will go to America,10,1 January 2015,"""Never Let Me Go"" takes us into the world of Kathy (Carey Mulligan), Tommy (Andrew Garfield) and Ruth (Keira Knightley). Usually, I am not too big on science fiction. Star Wars for example has never been my cup of tea. But this is exactly the kind of sci-fi I love. It surely helped that I like the trio of actors and also Charlotte Rampling and Sally Hawkins who appear in smaller roles. Mulligan oozes talent, a definite contender for best actress from her generation for me and she shines from start to finish here. She is pretty amazing in everything she is in. The film's title is a good choice for many reasons, first of all obviously the song used in the film. It refers also to the way how Kathy and Tommy never let each other go despite the obstacles. And finally, you could see the title in a more tragic sense how their fate will never let them go till the day they die. Or I should probably say ""complete"" as it seems that these people are not really seen as humans and are only there to fulfill a certain purpose.The last 20 minutes of the movie are among the saddest 20 minutes I have ever seen in the movies. I have seen this film a couple times already, but it never fails to make my eyes wet when Kathy tells Tommy in the house there are no deferrals or when Tommy leaves the car shortly after and screams like he did back when he was a boy and Kathy comes and holds him. Waterfalls coming. There are some genuinely sad moments earlier on as well, like Sally Hawkins' final speech to the children or Chrissie and Rodney asking the trio about referrals, but the end is just pure crying-your-eyes-out.The most interesting character of the film is perhaps Ruth. It is interesting to see how she adapts other people's behaviors in order to fit in. She seems a ruthless schemer and thus the main antagonist here. However, it is all much more about fear of being alone (that's why also the attempt to find her ""possible"") than about really cruel intentions. And she tries to make up for her wrongdoings at the end. Nonetheless, it looks like Kathy and Tommy cannot forgive her finally with that scene where Kathy tells her that they are going to apply for a deferral and then leaves with no further comment. Ruth eventually dies alone during surgery, with all the doctors gone in the end even.The film starts with a look at the trio's childhood for the first 30 minutes. Even with the three lead actors obviously still missing there, I enjoyed this part a lot. It is a great introduction and helps in understanding the characters and their actions. One scene that stayed in mind particularly was Kathy listening to the cassette Tommy gave her and Ruth stepping into the room and looking angrily at Kathy and Kathy looking back in disbelief. This was somehow the first time that Ruth got in the way of Kathy and Tommy (if you personify him through the cassette). Back to the grown-ups this movie is packed with scenes I could write novels about, so I will just stick to my favorites. At the restaurant, after they managed to order their food, they are asked what drinks they want and the way the trio looks at Chrissie and Rodney is just one of a kind. There aren't many funny moments in the film, but this one works oh so well. Then there are also more great scenes/quotes including the naked women newspaper and Kathy's true motivation for reading it, the quote about how it's best to wake up home, the introductory words right at the beginning which tell us about the world in which the film takes place and last but not least the scene in the forest where Tommy tells Kathy that deferrals with Ruth wouldn't work, but both are simply not ready yet to tell each other how they feel about the other and Kathy runs away screaming Tommy's name.It is a wonderful film and I as somebody who is not into reading at all even bought Kazuo Ishiguro's novel that this film is based on and that says a lot. On a side note, he also wrote ""The Remains of the Day"". Ishiguro's novel was adapted by Alex Garland (28 Days Later...). The film's director is Mark Romanek. You may have seen some of his music video works for Madonna, Michael Jackson, David Bowie, R.E.M. or Red Hot Chili Peppers. In terms of film work, he is not that prolific, but I highly recommend ""One Hour Photo"", an edge-of-seat thriller with a masterclass performance by the late (really hate to say that) Robin Williams. I wish I could mention all the crew and aspects from this film here because I loved it so much, but there are just too many. One thing which definitely deserves a notion though is Rachel Portman's wonderful soundtrack. And finally, I would like to say that this work should not be seen as a statement against organ donations. This is not even remotely what the film is about. Looking at Kathy's final quote, it is much more about making the most of the time that we are given, no matter how much it is. Kathy and Tommy tried to, but in the end could not overcome the obstacles to extend their togetherness. Thankfully, we do not face the same obstacles as the characters in the film. Let's make the most of it and share it with our loved ones.The 100-minute-long ""Never Let Me Go"" is the best, most creative, most overlooked and biggest tearjerker film of 2010. A true gem. Highly recommended.",Never Let Me Go
2,kosmasp,You might not be able to,9,26 December 2011,"At least you won't be able to forget. And it is very difficult to put this movie into a genre. I'm not gonna say more about this, just in case it might spoil the movie for you. I had no idea myself, what I was getting myself into (hadn't obviously read the book) and was more than surprised with what I saw.Awesome performances, great script and a story that keeps you guessing until the end. And it still didn't answer all my questions. It stayed with me and I had a discussion with someone else who went to watch it. There is so much you can see, find and talk about in this movie, that I can only highly recommend this. Hopefully the ban, the video stores in Germany have on titles from the distributor will vanish and people will be able to watch it there too",Never Let Me Go
3,jboothmillard,Never Let Me Go,5,15 April 2014,"From director Mark Romanek (One Hour Photo), I saw the poster and DVD cover for this film, so I knew the two leading actresses in it, but I had no idea of the plot, only that it may involve some love story. Basically in 1952 a medical breakthrough made it possible to extend the human lifespan beyond one hundred years, and in Hailsham, idyllic English boarding school, the explanation for this is that all the child students have been created as later in life they will provide donor organs for transplants after ""selection"", that is the sole reason they exist, there may be only one procedure, but some go through four or more. While they were at the school Tommy (Andrew Garfield) was emotionally angry and teased by the other boys, and Kathy (Carey Mulligan) fell in love with him, and now teenagers they share a cottage on a rural farm with their friend Ruth (Keira Knightley), they do not question the moral principles of their situation, but they are allowed to leave any time, but they are fascinated to see the humans they were ""modeled on"". They also hear that if a couple of clones can prove that they are truly in love they may be able to apply for ""deferral"", living extra years and avoiding ""selection"", Tommy sees that the artwork made by students at Hailsham was to see which of the children clones had souls, it appears now though that Tommy and Ruth may be falling for each other, becoming sexually active, but it does not last a long time, and Kathy becomes a ""carer"", who can avoid ""selection"" supporting and comforting donors who will give up their organs. Years pass and Kathy continues to work as a carer, having watched many clones ""complete"" with their organs donated, their deaths are referred to as ""completion"", she reunites with Ruth who has completed two donations and is frail, she helps also to arrange a reunion with Tommy, Ruth admits as well that she did not truly love him, as she was jealous and afraid of being alone, and since this seduction she has been consumed with guilt. Ruth believes Kathy and Tommy would qualify for ""deferral"", shortly after seeing them she dies in ""completion"" on the operating table, Tommy explains he has been creating artwork for years in hopes of getting a deferral, but it turns out there is no such no thing as deferral of any kind, the film ends with Kathy left alone after the ""completion"" for Tommy, and just two weeks she is notified her first ""selection"" will take place in a month. Also starring Blue Jasmine's Sally Hawkins as Miss Lucy, Charlotte Rampling as Miss Emily, About Time's Domhnall Gleeson as Rodney, Oblivion's Andrea Riseborough as Chrissie, Charlie Rowe as Young Tommy, Ella Purnell as Young Ruth, Nathalie Richard as Madame, Isobel Meikle-Small as Young Kathy and Kate Bowes Renna as Miss Geraldine. Mulligan is reasonably effective in her performance, Knightley is alright in her role as well, and Garfield before becoming Spider-Man proves a good British actor, the three way love story between them is just about interesting, the plot of the film certainly sounds like it would be good, but the problem is that it is not pulled off well enough to the point it does not compel you enough, there might be some great individual scenes, but it should be much darker and emotional, but I suppose it's not a bad romantic science-fiction drama. Worth watching!",Never Let Me Go
4,rmax304823,Dead Kids Walking.,7,14 March 2012,"The photography by Adam Kimmel can hardly be beat. It's chilly in England and every green leaf scintillates in the wan sunshine, and Kimmel gets it all. The indoor scenes are equally well done, if a little melancholy in their palette.The melancholy is well deserved. This is a fantasy by the noted British writer Kazuo Ishiguro, who also did ""The Remains of the Day,"" and, man, is it a downer. If there were a light at the end of the tunnel, Ishiguro would run out and buy more tunnel. Don't watch this if you have a box of arsenic in the cellar.What seems to be an ordinary English boarding school is actually raising the children in isolation to be willing organ donors when they achieve early adulthood. They're called ""carers"" and taught that this sacrifice is the only thing to do. When they're of age, they donate one organ after another, with recovery intervals, until they ""complete,"" and you know what that means. The mournful musical score doesn't need to remind us that this story is tragic.We follow three ordinary kids from childhood to blossoming adulthood -- Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightly, and Andrew Garfield. Knightly completes, but Mulligan and Garfield fall in love and pursue the rumor that, for a couple truly in love, and if they have some sort of special talent, a ""deferral"" is possible. In a pathetic scene, Mulligan and Garfield present his art work to a former teacher at their boarding school who seemed sympathetic. She may, in fact, BE sympathetic but the headmistress, Charlotte Rampling, is wheeled into the room to inform them that there never was a deferral program. Rampling scolds them gently for having no compassion for people with cancer and neurological diseases. The lovers passively accept their fate.It's queer to see Charlotte Rampling, who has played so many sex pots, in the role of a wheelchair-bound older lady. She's barely recognizable. Of course age takes its toll on all of us, except, oddly enough, me. I grow more radiantly handsome with each passing year.Keira Knightly is sensuous and dark. She looks voracious. She's a good actress but it's hard to believe that she would simply give up and allow herself to complete without some kind of squawk. Garfield is convincing enough looking desperate and a little dumb. Mulligan is perfectly apt in the role. Her features are not nearly as symmetrical as Knightly's. Her eyes are slightly askew. She seems to have a dimple on only one side of her lips. But her nose forms a nearly perfect geometrical arc from glabella to tip-defining points.Maybe the tragedy is not simply that these kids donate until they complete. Maybe the real tragedy is that there seems to be no escape, either within the system (""deferrals"") or outside the system (""running away""). But then maybe that's Ishiguro's main point. What I mean is that we're all going to ""complete"" some day and there isn't a thing we can do about it. These kids have an advantage over most of us because at least they have some choice about WHEN to complete. The carers and donors aren't THAT much worse off than the organ recipients, when you come right down to it.It's a beautifully executed story, but the story itself is so sepulchrally gloomy that I wouldn't recommend it for just anyone.",Never Let Me Go
5,Quinoa1984,"a film with an intriguing background, not-so-much foreground",6,15 February 2011,"Maybe I just didn't connect with Never Let Me Go. Maybe I couldn't key into the inner-pain and suffering that came with the three leads, Kathy (Carey Mulligan), Tommy (Andrew Garfield) and Ruth (Kiera Knightly). For some this will be enough to see that because of the restraint they show, because they stick to the 'plan' that has been laid out for them by some cultish group of people, it is just heart-breaking. For me, it just didn't do it for me, since the stakes are so high but it's all passivity. Maybe I like to see my film characters *doing* things, not just staring at each other in blank oblivion. Or maybe I like to see something else, better, done with a premise.The background of Never Let Me Go, this society, is very fascinating: an alternate reality in the late 20th century where scientists and doctors have figured out ways to keep people living long past their usual life expectancy by using organ donations... not the usual kind via organ- donor cards, but by using people from childhood, as if grown in school- farms, for the express purpose of not having a life inasmuch as awaiting to give their bodies away to other people. To be fair, and to director Mark Romanek's credit, this isn't really spelled out right away, and there is some mystery until a teacher at the school, Sally Hawkins' character, cant stand it anymore and finally lays it out for the students, who are so pre-programmed that it does not quite stick out to them (there's a nice little moment where after she lays out the details in the class, a paper goes flying from the wind and young Tommy goes to pick it up, a moment of subtle connection that works).This is interesting stuff, a good idea, yet I kept thinking as the movie went on and the next two acts after childhood went on in the story (it's told in thirds, split between 1978, 1985 and 1994) what the rest of this society is like. How much of it is just like the regular/real-world? Does the society end up more like in The Matrix where the machines start making babies for the express purpose of organ donations? What happens when cloning comes around (albeit that was expressed in the lessor but still not-bad movie The Island)? And why is every child so passive in this context? Are there uprisings or rebellions against the well-off organ-fine masters? And what about the person whom Ruth tries to see is the one that was her ""basis"" or whatever? Again, subtly, which Romanek is trying for here (and based no less on a book by one of those stuffy English authors who wrote Remains of the Day), is not a bad thing. But it's so passive and subtle, so restrained, that the life seems to be choked out of a film that needs drama and conflict. The cinematography is pretty, sometimes even brilliant, but it's more attuned to the music of the film, which can equally be stifling. The actors are also in a similar aesthetic, although (and I didn't think I'd ever say this) Kiera Knightley actually runs away with the acting prize, if only cause she has more to do. Carey Mulligan has shown in An Education (nay, the great Doctor Who episode 'Blink') that she can be a touching, effective actress, but her performance here is one-note, perhaps dictated by a one-note written person. And Andrew Garfield isn't much better, though there are a few scenes late in the film where he finally springs to life, albeit in melodramatic shoes.Never Let Me Go is a meditation on ideas of personal livelihood squeezed into a not-very-interesting love-triangle story, where we don't get much context as to how Kathy and Tommy, who seem to be all (child-like) lovy- dovy as kids suddenly split apart and Tommy and Ruth are together, only then to later somehow get together. There isn't dramatic thrust with that, so then there's the science-fiction angle, which is treated with delicate hands but maybe too-delicate ones. When I keep on thinking about what else is there in this world that the writer and director have created, and yet is never shown, it makes for some problems. Again, for some this restraint and passivity might be just right, maybe as the whole point of it. For me, it fell flat.",Never Let Me Go
6,sunwarrior13,Great Message About Living Life,10,24 December 2011,"Never Let Me Go is set in an alternate history and centers on Kathy, Ruth and Tommy who are portrayed by Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield, respectively. The three, who become entangled in a love triangle, are scientific specimens created in a laboratory to provide their organs to severely ill patients.It is a British dystopian drama film based on Kazuo Ishiguro's 2005 novel of the same title that was directed by Mark Romanek from a screenplay by Alex Garland.The sheltered teens mentioned: Kathy,Ruth, and Tommy all grew up at a remote English boarding school, and now they're hungry to explore the real world. Their dreams of freedom are soon stifled, however, upon learning that they are nothing more than clones created specifically for organ harvesting. Now, in addition to confronting their own mortality, all three must come to terms with a lifetime of emotions and unfulfilled longings while pondering their true purpose for being.Never Let Me Go is gorgeous. It's exquisitely acted. And depressing. It's romantic, profound and superbly crafted, shot with the self- contained radiance of a snow globe. And it's depressing that would really affect the viewer watching this film. It also gives the viewer about the what is important about life and how one values it. The cast were good enough to provide them through their convincing and sincere portrayal. Overall,this film is a must-see for people who want to renew their purpose for living.",Never Let Me Go
7,grantss,Disappointing,5,15 April 2016,"Disappointing. I really wanted to like this movie, and it started fairly well. The sensitivity and emotion are there throughout. However, the plot is so contrived and implausible that the whole story just feels fake and flat. Ultimately you feel the story could easily have been told in a better way. Surely the author, and screenwriter, could have found a better backdrop for a fatally doomed friendship and romance?Good performances from Carey Mulligan (especially) and Keira Knightley. Andrew Garfield is mediocre, verging on the irritating.",Never Let Me Go
8,neil-476,Good performances in a profoundly unconvincing and misleadingly advertised tale,6,18 February 2011,"It is not possible for me to make fair comment on Never Let Me Go without extensively spoilering. So, if you are keen on going to see the movie on the basis of a trailer which indicates a slightly dated and very English love triangle between two girls and a boy which follows them from boarding school to adulthood, and you don't wish to know anything else about the film beforehand, then stop reading now. Because the trailer completely misrepresents this movie.It is not a romantic drama. It is science fiction.Now, I don't have a problem with going to see a movie believing it's going to be one thing, and then finding out it is something completely different, as long as the movie itself works. And the problem with Never let Me Go is that it doesn't, but I don't know whether the reason lies with Kazuo Ishiguro's original novel or the adaptation. It doesn't really matter, however.The mildly ""off"" flavour which comes through from the trailer is because this isn't actually the England we know. This is a parallel England of a few years ago, where it appears that nothing digital exists - everything is lower tech than we are familiar with. In this parallel word there is a breeding programme for living transplant donors, and the school at which the three protagonists meet and grow up is specifically for such donors. So, yes, there is a 3-cornered romance running through the film, but the heart of the story is what becomes of these three individuals whose fate is to be carved up to keep other people alive.I had a big problem with this film, because I was never able to fully take on board the central dilemma as a realistic one. Are these specially bred donors people or not? This world, so very like the world I know, assumes they aren't. It is revealed at the end that the three main characters have misunderstood a key element, which is actually there to try to determine whether they have souls or not: to me it seemed self evident that they were proper, genuine people in every way which mattered, and the moral dilemma of whether or not it was right to cut them to pieces for the benefit of others was one which was so obvious that it need never have been addressed in the first place. Placed in a totalitarian regime, I could have suspended my disbelief (viz. The Island). Here, where they were allowed free rein subject to electronic ID tags, I simply could not accept that this was a realistic world in which these events could happen.And that's a shame, because there is potential in the idea, and the performances were generally good (with Carey Mulligan standing out). Sadly, however, I have to class this as a failure.",Never Let Me Go
9,ferguson-6,Neverlasting Love,7,26 September 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. Let me say that it's great to have Mark Romanek back directing films. His most recent feature was 2002's ""One Hour Photo"" which I found masterful. Here he has source material from the acclaimed novel of Kazuo Ishiguro (""The Remains of the Day"") and does an admirable job depicting this underground world of test tube replacement parts. Despite the numerous opportunities for moral and philosophical statements, the film does a nice job of staying true to the novel and avoiding the soapbox.We are introduced to Kathy, Tommy and Ruth. They are 3 friends being raised at Hailsham - a cross between an orphanage, boarding school and laboratory. The kids have no idea of their purpose in life and just go about their days as instructed - never really finding a need to question their existence ... though many ""stories"" of the place have evolved over the years.One day, a teacher played by Sally Hawkins breaks the code and explains to the children that their sole purpose in life is to be harvested for body parts. Sure this theme has been explored previously, but not really from the kids' perspective. Ms. Hawkins' character is instantly relieved of her duties by the cold-natured head mistress played perfectly by Charlotte Rampling.Flash forward a few years and the three are played by Carey Mulligan (Kathy), Andrew Garfield (Tommy) and Keira Knightley (Ruth). We see a romance develop between Ruth and Tommy, though it's obvious the real connection is between Kathy and Tommy. As they move to ""the cottages"" (a middle step in development), they learn a bit more about the real world.It's not until a few years later when we see how two of them have fulfilled their obligation, while one has delayed by playing ""a carer"" to donors, that we see just how bleak this existence is. The real questions are raised by Kathy as she wonders just how different their lives are than those in the real world. It seems both sides have regrets, unrealized dreams and a shortage of time. Here endeth the lesson.This film is gathering a bit of Oscar buzz from the critics, but I must admit that I found it leaving entirely too much up to the audience. There are too many gaps to fill and not really much conflict or drama. It is finely made and well acted, but comes up short of what I would expect from a true Oscar contender.",Never Let Me Go
10,gradyharp,A Haunting Version of a Fine Novel,10,3 February 2011,"Kazuo Ishiguro's best selling novel NEVER LET ME GO has been transformed into a screenplay by Alex Garland that condenses the novel but allows the mystery of the writer's concept to come shining through. Mark Romanek directs a perfect cast and manages to make the whole strange idea of the story seem hauntingly real. Through the mists of England develops the image of a tranquil appearing old school, Hailsham, a special school where the students are all selected, segregated from society to be taught and nurtured into becoming transplant donors. The school is run by Miss Emily (Charlotte Rampling) who is strict but also benevolent. The story focuses on three students - Tommy (Charlie Rowe), Kathy (Isobel Meikle-Small), and Ruth (Ella Purnell). Kathy longs for Tommy's affections but Ruth is the bolder of the two girls and makes her feelings for Tommy known. The only person who brings a semblance of reason and solace to the students is Miss Lucy (Sally Hawkins): she is dismissed as insubordinate for telling the truth to the students. The students age into young people - Tommy (Andrew Garfield) and Ruth (Keira Knightley) have become a couple and have also begun their donations of organs while Kathy (Carey Mulligan) has taken the role of Carer and follows the lives of the two friends. As Ruth approaches her third organ donation she expects to enter 'completion' and clears her guilt of having taken Tommy from Kathy by joining Kathy and Tommy in a romance that she hopes will lead to a state of delay (the school has always informed them that if two students are truly in love they will be spared their destiny for a while in order to live together). Tommy is an artist and thinks that by proving his presence of a soul that he and Kathy will be granted this choice. Hailsham has now closed and the two seek the art gallery curator for the school Madame (Nathalie Richard) to request permission, only to be met by both Miss Emily and Madame with the reality that the concept has been a false one all along. The destiny of the students is served. The trio of actors - Mulligan, Garfield, Knightley - is superb, seducing us into believing in the story. The supporting roles as performed by Rampling, Richard, and Hawkins are equally strong. This film, as the book, requires the audience to relinquish disbelief in the premise and instead bask in the beauty of the story, the acting, the lush cinematography by Adam Kimmel and the stunningly lovely musical score by Rachel Portman. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp",Never Let Me Go
11,zetes,A little too vague; never attains the emotional reaction it's seeking,7,9 January 2011,"It's kind of funny that one of the best modern novelists, Kazuo Ishiguro (The Remains of the Day) wrote a novel with the exact same plot as a film that came out the same year, The Island, directed by Michael Bay, of all people. I haven't read the novel Never Let Me Go, so I can only judge the film version. The Island is actually the much better film, and it's not (just) because Never Let Me Go has far fewer rocketcycle chases. There's just something major missing here. There's a vagueness to the whole thing. The film's very careful to keep things coming from the point of view of the ""donors"", as they're called here. We never really get to understand how the rest of the people live, what their feelings are, just how the world is with this situation going on. There are hints and brief appearances from non-donors, but there's really no impression given. It becomes frustrating after a while. The film instead focuses on the main three characters and their love triangle, which never makes a lot of sense, either. The characters in The Island were kept in a state of childlike innocence. In Never Let Me Go, they're allowed to fall in love, have sex (what about pregnancy?), all that jazz. It seems like that would be forbidden. The characters themselves are actually pretty vague, too, which makes their struggles sort of hard to care much about. The film's not a total disaster or anything, either. There's plenty of reason to watch it. Despite the vagueness of the characters, it's not a bad place to catch three of the best young British actors (Carey Mulligan, Kiera Knightley and Andrew Garfield). They mostly sit around being beautiful, and sometimes crying, but they're all pretty good at it. It's also beautifully shot, and, best of all, it contains easily one of the best musical scores of 2010, by Rachel Portman. If you burst into tears by the film's end, believe me, it'll have far more to do with Portman's gorgeous string themes than the story itself.",Never Let Me Go
12,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Never Let Me Go,10,27 February 2011,"It's no secret that I'm a big fan of the science fiction romance Gattaca and enjoyed that guilt trip which is Michael Bay's The Island, dealing with a bunch of innocent people living in utopia until being called to well, enter nirvana. With such elements combined from both films (sans Bayhemic levels of explosions of course), it's relatively easy for me to fall in love with Never Let Me Go, which is fast going to be a favourite that I will rattle off in any of my best-of list.Based on the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro (who also penned The Remains of the Day), this film spells lush on all counts, in its production values and the quality of the cast assembled to take on the three principal roles of Kathy, Tommy and Ruth, with Izzy Meikle-Small, Charlie Rowe and Ella Purnell playing the younger versions in the first third of the film set in the orphanage of Hailsham, before Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley taking over as the young adult versions respectively. Things aren't what they seem because it's set in an alternative reality with the introductory titles stating an advancement in medical science and on human longevity, while in the orphanage, technology like access controls and electronic registers, in the 50s no less, make it seem a little odd. But there are good reasons for this, with the film never making its intentions verbatim and explicit, preferring to rely on suggestion so on that same note I'll tread very carefully too.To compound the oddity, the students aren't made to learn life skills, only being given the fish than to be taught how to fish, as seen through their role plays in class for things as simple as ordering in a cafe, being told to submit art pieces on a regular basis, and being happy recipients of second hand thingamajigs which they have to use tokens, not money, to exchange for. And the title of the film comes from a cassette tape of songs which Tommy gives Kathy, and while you'd half expect them to hitch, in comes Ruth whose earlier disinterest seems to have developed into something more. When they finally graduate, we see Kathy still nursing a broken heart, and together with her friends Tommy and Ruth, they get sent to cottages outside of town in which they mingle with others of the same schooling experience, before Kathy decides to leave on her own and become a care-giver.Saying anything more with details will spoil the film, but in essence this is one powerful romance that will tug at your heartstrings, not because it follows the typical path of any weepy, sappy romantic films that the Japanese or Koreans can think of, but because of the many ethical and moral issues it raises through its narrative course, being thought-provoking in its theme of what makes us tick, our moral compass, and whether in today's reality, we do see these issues as show stoppers to what technology can finally bring us, and whether we can turn the blind eye to some existentialism issues in the name of self-preservation. But it doesn't do so in a formulaic, dry manner, but skillfully exerts its message through an achingly beautiful romance, that I'd have to admit made me bawl a little within when the end credits rolled by.And credit goes to the powerful performances by all three leads, each playing uniquely different characters in the same boat, though approaching the inevitable in their lives in varied ways, which leaves one thinking how one would react if passed a sentence or destiny which you know of, but having absolutely zero means to escape from. I haven't been convinced very much by Andrew Garfield, but probably the best scene he had here was this realization of hope being unceremoniously snuffed out - that look on his eyes had something defiant with helplessness all mixed in, that it hammers in great sympathy. Keira Knightley takes a backseat here, being that foil to Carey Mulligan's Kathy and coming in between her and Tommy, but understandably so and you'll probably feel for her reason of fear, of someone putting up false fronts to cover one's own vulnerabilities. And Mulligan is fast becoming one of my favourite actresses with her ability to portray strong roles, having to bookend this period piece. The young actors playing the schoolchildren versions of the characters also did convincingly well since they were the setup, as does Charlotte Rampling and Sally Hawkins, especially in their final scene together.It's pretty amazing how director Mark Romanek, whose One Hour Photo I had enjoyed and had this sense of creepiness throughout, was able to helm such a romantic film that didn't have to boil it down to melodrama that plagues many Asian ones that utilizes similar plot elements, with Alex Garland, longtime collaborator in many Danny Boyle films, ably translating both human drama and science fiction from book to screenplay, like what he did with Sunshine. And you can lull yourself with the hauntingly beautiful score created by Rachel Portman, as it provides an added dimension to the entire film altogether. There's much to heart about the film, about potentials of lives that cannot be lived or fulfilled, that makes this one of the saddest films I've seen to date. A definite entry into my shortlist of one of the best this year, and into my all time favourites list. Highly recommended!",Never Let Me Go
13,namashi_1,"Ambitious, yet Frothy...",5,19 July 2016,"Based on Kazuo Ishiguro's 2005 novel of the same name, 'Never Let Me Go' is an Ambitious & at times affecting film, that sadly, offers Frothy Romance. The setting is well-done, the performances are strong, but the film is not able to reach a point, where you're satisfied.'Never Let Me Go' centres on Kathy, Ruth and Tommy portrayed by Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield respectively, who become entangled in a love triangle. 'Never Let Me Go' is a dystopian alternative history romantic-drama, but none of it really compels you beyond a point. The Romance, as mentioned before, is frothy. Although there are some terrific moments, mainly when we see our leading characters as kids, the narrative begins to falter later-on. The emotions are genuine, but the tragic moments lack power. In short, 'Never Let Me Go' appeals in bits.Alex Garland's Adapted Screenplay begins fabulously well, but falls short as it progresses. The writing needed to be tighter! Mark Romanek's Direction is well-done. He's handled the film well. Adam Kimmel's Cinematography is extraordinary. The lensman has gone all out & has delivered terrifically. Barney Pilling's Editing is alright. Rachel Portman's Score is good. Art & Costume Design are fantastic.Performance-Wise: Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield, are in top-form! Mulligan is flawless as the protagonist, delivering a moving, brilliant performance. Knightley is perfection as the selfish & feisty women, while Garfield is sincere to the core as the unlikely hero. The 3 actors make 'Never Let Me Go' something to be seen. Of the supporting cast, The Exquisite Charlotte Rampling, The Magnificent Sally Hawkins & Isobel Meikle-Small (who plays Carey's younger self), deserve a special mention.On the whole, 'Never Let Me Go' could've been so much more. Nonetheless, watch it for the solid acting!",Never Let Me Go
14,JamesHitchcock,"Inadequate as a Dystopian Fable, Heartbreakingly Good as a Human Story",8,14 April 2021,"""Never Let Me Go"" is a dystopian fantasy (like, for example, Orwell's ""1984"" or Huxley's ""Brave New World""), but unlike most such stories it is not set in an imagined future, or even an imagined alternative present, but in an imagined alternative past. The action takes place between 1978 and 1994 in a world where a medical breakthrough in 1952 has extended the average human lifespan to more than 100 years. In all other respects, however, the technology of this world- its cars, televisions, computers, etc.- is the same as our own.The nature of the breakthrough is not at first explained, but becomes clear during the film that a special underclass of humans, known as ""donors"", are being cloned so that their vital organs can be harvested and transplanted into recipients. Typically, the ""donors"" start to donate their organs when they are in their twenties, and rarely survive more than two or three such operations. The words ""die"" and ""death"", however, are never used of donors, who are merely said to ""have completed"".The film is about three of these ""donors"", Kathy D, Ruth C and Tommy H. (Donors, it would appear, do not have full surnames). We first meet them as children in a special boarding school for donors, and follow them through their teenage years and into their twenties, when a love-triangle develops between them as Ruth begins a relationship with Tommy, with whom Kathy is also in love.I have never read Kazuo Ishiguro's novel on which the film is based, but if the film is a faithful adaptation there is an important difference between this story and those of books like ""1984"" or ""Brave New World"". Those two novels are both involve a central character- Winston Smith in the former, John the Savage in the latter- who is in revolt against the values of his society. It does not matter that their revolt is in both cases ultimately unsuccessful. What matters is that there is someone to articulate opposition to what Orwell and Huxley saw, and intended us to see, as inhumane systems. Such novels often also have a ""raisonneur"", a character whose dramatic function is to defend the system, exemplified by Orwell's O'Brien or Huxley's Mustapha Mond.There is nothing similar in ""Never Let Me Go"". Nobody expresses any serious opposition to the donor system. We do not see much of the general population, but are given to understand by Madame (a teacher at the donors' school and the nearest thing the film has to a raisonneur) that they support the system because of the health benefits and longer life expectancy which it gives them. The donors seem to accept their fate without any attempt to rebel or escape- the most they hope for is a deferment of a few years before they have to start donating- which struck me as both implausible and disheartening. There is even a hint towards the end that the film is intended as a metaphor for the human condition and the inevitability of death, an interpretation which seemed to me to be at odds with the purpose of a dystopian novel. The dystopian genre, after all, is supposed to warn us and rouse us to action, or at least to vigilance, against the evils which it depicts. It is not supposed to preach a message of stoical acceptance of those evils or that we should, like lambs to the slaughter, go gentle into that bad night.Despite my philosophical dissatisfaction with the film, I have given it a relatively high mark because it is so well done. The director Mark Romanek brings an appropriately sober- almost sombre- look to the film to match its downbeat, elegiac mood, with a palette dominated by greys, browns and dull greens, and few if any bright colours. The acting is of a very high quality, with excellent performances coming from Carey Mulligan as the film's heroine Kathy and Keira Knightley as Ruth, both Kathy's friend and her rival. Perhaps even better than these two established adult stars are the various young actors who portray the donors as children. Society might regard the donors as less than human, but these performances show us that they are just as human as anybody else. Seen as a dystopian fable, ""Never Let Me Go"" seems inadequate. Seen as a human story about love, friendship human relationships and tragically early death it is heartbreakingly good. 8/10.",Never Let Me Go
15,lasttimeisaw,Never Let Me Go,7,6 February 2011,"Adapted from the eponymous novel by Japanese-English novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, this idyllic sci-fi film deals with a post-clone era, sharing a similar backdrop from Michael Bay's fugitive adventure THE ISLAND (2005), delicately depicts the dooming destiny of human clone creatures intwined by a slightly hackneyed triangle love story. The pace of the film is slow rather than tedious, thanks to the enchanting score and graceful yet bleak cinematography, the chilly empathy infiltrates the whole film, indicates a pessimistic finale and indulges its viewers to dive into some indelible melancholy. 3 promising young British actors form the triangle, Carey Mulligan plays her leading role under a restrained cover to deliver a vivid impression as her inner confusion and depression of a clone's life being solely a medical donor for genuine human beings; the new spiderman Andrew Garfield gives a heart-wrenching performance as the apple of her eyes, he is adorable with some resemblance of his role is BOY A (2007); Keira Knightley offers a brave turn as the interloper, a not-so-welcome character, I admire Keira's courage to accept a supporting role for Carey (I recall in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (2005), it is Carey's debut performance as Keira's younger sister, who could imagine actually they are the same age?), what comes around goes around if you believe in karma, however the consequence is that unfortunately it didn't turn out to be Keira's breakthrough even though she had strived for it. The problem partly lies in the dialogues which are shockingly in lack of context, partly because the film set an unrealistic premise against common senses (a clear plot hole is that all these poor clones never fight or run away from their ill-fate, which doesn't seem to be too difficult if one stick to what the film shows), so as to that I feel a little bit detached from those characters as time goes by. The same thing happens to Andrew and Carey's characters too, the absence of a plausible annotation of their mental roaming injures the film deadly. I admit the film is quite depressive, which limits its popularity and potential quantity of its groupies. In the name of a worldly-famous novel, it is truly a pity that with whose reputation the film fails to match, nevertheless, think about the bright side, it certainly intrigues those who haven't read the book (myself, for instance) to chew on its original written material, which I assume will be more nutritional and gutsy.",Never Let Me Go
16,KineticSeoul,"Not as emotional or moving as I expected it to be, but still pretty good",6,3 March 2011,"I really didn't know what this movie was about, mainly because it wasn't marketed very well. But decided to see it because it seemed like a thought provoking romance movie and since it's been getting good amounts of positive reviews. There is three segments in this movie, but I enjoyed watching the first segment the most. And mainly revolve around a love triangle of a sort, one being sort of a anti-social boy and two girls and the conflict or fate they must face. I heard the book is better than this movie it was adapted into which isn't shocking after finishing but it's seemed like a pretty decent adaptation. It's a heartbreaking and yet a beautiful movie but a sad movie as well. The visuals is pretty good and the story is decent but a little dry. The is there isn't enough development like the pacing was a bit to quick or something. The first segment did a fantastic job as the build up but the movie sort of started to go a bit downhill from there, which is a shame the first segment also seemed to have the best visual. The characters just wasn't that engaging after the first segment nor did I feel all that attached. It just didn't have that emotional attachment or emotional direction I was expecting after the first segment. Some reviewers complain that the problem is that although the situation the characters are facing maybe harsh, but they don't do anything about it. But similar concept about the conflict in this movie has been done before and they face the conflict head on, but that just wasn't the direction or the story it was aiming for so it's passable and I can understand the direction for this part. Only if the movie did as good as the build up with more attachment it would have been way more heartfelt and very moving movie, but what a shame. I guess it just didn't deliver as much as it should have.6.8/10",Never Let Me Go
17,Hellmant,Life as we know it.,9,13 January 2011,"'NEVER LET ME GO': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A British science fiction drama based on the 2005 novel of the same name written by Kazuo Ishiguro. It was adapted by Alex Garland who had written the script and was showing it to producers before the book was even published. Garland's dabbled in science fiction before with his scripts for '28 DAYS LATER' and 'SUNSHINE', he also wrote the novels 'THE BEACH' and 'THE TESSERACT' which have been adapted into films. The film is directed by experienced music video director Mark Romanek and stars Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley.'NEVER LET ME GO' is a dystopian tale about a world parallel to our own where doctors have found the answers to all the world's medical problems by creating clones to serve as organ donors. The story revolves around three such donors; Kathy (Mulligan), Tommy (Garfield) and Ruth (Knightley) who all grow up in a school for clones called Hailsham, which is much like the typical English boarding schools of it's time. The story is narrated by Kathy at age 28, who is one of the few chosen to be a temporary 'carer', one who comforts donors as they're forced to give up their organs, before having to give up her own. She explains the love triangle the three went through and the horrors they had to face coming to realize their not so distant fates.The film is a very well made and moving tragedy. The acting, directing and writing are all outstanding and the film has a well thought out and effective message (a very true and depressing one). It's maybe a little too depressing and gloomy for it's own good but it definitely gets the viewer thinking. It's obviously an anti cloning movie but I think you can draw parallels to many other aspects of life and make the social commentary even broader. The clones can be used as a metaphor for all people deprived of many of the better things in life (in this case life itself) in order to provide more for the elite and privileged. It's a great example of the capitalist society we live in today. So many are starving or just scraping by so that the mighty few can live longer and more self indulgent lives. The question many ask about this film is why they didn't rebel and try to escape. They don't for the same reason we don't, out of fear and the accepted belief that this is just the way life is and we have to accept it.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKmmH2ftXQ",Never Let Me Go
18,Buddy-51,A masterpiece,9,26 August 2011,"Modern science fiction films tend to be big, brassy, noisy affairs, filled with bug-eyed aliens, intergalactic battle scenes, and sense-assaulting special effects. But ""Never Let Me Go,"" based on a 2005 novel by Kazuo Ishiguro, is here to remind us of just how profound and thought-provoking the genre can be when played in a minor key.Like ""Brave New World,"" ""1984,"" ""Fahrenheit 451,"" and countless others before it, ""Never Let Me Go"" offers a dystopic vision of a ""futuristic"" world that has profound implications for our present day. However, Ishiguro, rather than setting his story in the future, chose to place it in an alternate-universe version of the late 20th Century, when the life expectancy is now over a hundred, thanks, in no small measure, to the fact that society has found the means to ""cultivate"" clones for the sole purpose of harvesting their organs once they hit their early 20s. That means that none of these folk will live to see their 30th birthday.This haunting and heartbreaking tale centers on Kathy, Ruth and Tommy, three youngsters growing up in what first appears to be just another typical boarding school nestled in the British countryside. But soon sinister implications begin to emerge as we, along with the children, discover the truth about them and the purpose they will serve in life. The movie then jumps ahead to various points in the future as the three of them begin to fulfill their pre-ordained duty as ""donors.""On the surface, the film is an obvious indictment of the evils of eugenics, portraying a society so in dread of its own mortality that it is willing to forsake any semblance of personal morality or ethics to ensure its own longevity and health. The aging headmistress (played by the always wonderful Charlotte Rampling) even makes the case that, no matter how sympathetic the general populace might be towards the plight of these ""donors,"" people would never opt to return to a world filled with cancer and other deadly diseases. There's a wonderful scene in which guilt-ridden delivery men avert their eyes from the very children they know will one die day that they might live. But beyond the eugenics aspects, the film also functions as an allegorical illustration of the extent to which the privileged classes in general will go in exploiting the masses to get what they need in order to sustain their own extravagant lifestyles.Yet, it is as a human drama that ""Never Let Me Go' makes the deepest mark on our hearts. Through a trio of off-the-chart performances, Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley make us care deeply about these three people who seem strangely passive about their fates, yet who still strike out as best they can for a meaningful existence within the strict parameters assigned to them. Despite this dark cloud hanging over their heads, they still find time to fall in love, have sex, become jealous, enjoy their time together, and form lasting bonds of friendship. As Kathy notes near the end, everyone will eventually ""complete"" at some point or another (gotta' love those euphemisms we humans use to help salve our consciences when we know we're doing something wrong); these ""donors"" just happen to be doing so at an earlier stage than most.Alex Garland's screenplay is thoughtful, lyrical and restrained, and Mark Romaneck follows suit in his direction. As to the performances, there is one particular scene – in which Kathy and Tommy slowly realize that the slim hope they had for a postponement of their fate has been a cruel delusion - that should be shown to every student of acting who is serious about the profession. The complexity of thought and depth of emotion that Mulligan and Garfield are able to convey through sheer facial expressions alone is truly a wonder to behold. But then again, all who were involved in the making of this film can be immensely proud of their work here.I would also like to congratulate the original author for not doing what most writers of dystopic literature seemingly feel compelled to do, which is to turn it into another one of those damn chase stories where the characters spend most of their time trying to outrun the sinister forces out to get them (my biggest beef, in fact, with the good but overrated ""Children of Men,"" for instance). For that alone, I am profoundly grateful.Filled with unforgettable performances, ""Never Let Me Go"" is, without a doubt, one of the finest films of recent times.",Never Let Me Go
19,paul2001sw-1,"Mood is good, but you only need to hear this story once",6,14 March 2015,"Kazuo Ishiguro's novel 'Never Let Me Go' is a strange and delicate book. Over it's course, we learn that it's protagonists have been partially conditioned for, and partially protected from, an unpleasant and untimely end. The book asks questions about whether anyone is ever truly ready for death, and whether (and if so, how) there is such a thing as kindness possible towards those we have already decided to wreak irreparable harm upon. The book is also excruciatingly sad; but like all tragedies, carries with it a strong sense of the inevitable. And it's set in a future-past that seems innocent and nostalgic in sharp contrast to the subject matter. Mark Romanek's film is a pretty faithful adaptation, although I felt the early role of the gallery was downplayed in a way that may make its later importance seem less comprehensible if you haven't seen the film. On the other hand, the essence of the story is the slow reveal; knowing the plot, I didn't feel revisiting the story in a different medium added so much more to me. In fact, I think this is an odd story to adapt to the screen: what I'd really like to see is a version of Ishiguro's crazy masterpiece, 'The Unconsoled'.",Never Let Me Go
20,bowmanblue,"A hard watch, but worth it",7,7 April 2018,"I've just watched 'Never Let Me Go' for the second time and it's been a good few years since viewings. The reason being was because I was never sure whether I enjoyed the film on my original watch. I have to say that it left quite a mark on me and made me ask questions and picture what the world would be like for the characters in the story's situation. So, I guess it's certainly memorable, however to say it's 'enjoyable' implies that it's an uplifting and easy-going piece of popcorn-fluff. It's not.It begins in a 'fictional' 1960s where the opening text informs us that the society of the time has evolved enough to make certain leaps in technology, namely cloning. Then we join the students of a private school in Britain as they attend their classes. However, these children are all deliberately engineered for one thing: they're, one day, going to be used as 'spare parts' for those in need of organ transplants. Nice.Skip forward a few years when the kids are now late teen-ish and we see how they deal with their lot in life and how they go about their lives knowing what is to become of them. The first time I watched this I got quite frustrated with the characters. I felt they accepted their fate a little too lightly. If someone was going to chop me up for my eyeballs on my 21st birthday, I'd be taking the first flight to the location farthest away from the surgeon's scalpel. These kids just trot around the place, awaiting their fate with a slightly furrowed brow. I ever posted a few of these views on various Internet message boards and was given a fair few reasons for this which I won't go into. But, I think it's fair to say that I probably 'lost' that argument!It's set primarily in the 60s-70s and therefore the period detail of the time is excellent (if you can forgive the overall sci-fi premise, technically, not fitting in with the era). Plus you have good performances from the central trio of Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield and, of course, Keira Knightley. You will certainly want what's best for them and their - seemingly - hopeless situation against fulfilling their 'purpose' in life.Like I say, it's not a 'feel-good' film and you need to be in the mood for something dark, deep and heavy.

21,ThomasDrufke,Life Unraveling,8,13 March 2019,"Imagine having your entire life already planned out before taking your first steps, how messed up is that? Well, that's sort of the premise of 'Never Let Me Go', a brilliant small independent film released in 2010, before Andrew Garfield blew up, and at the beginning of Keira Knightley and Carey Mulligan's prime. Thought provoking and emotionally visceral & intimate, 'Never Let Me Go' beautifully captures what this Dystopian (but also perhaps semi-realistic) future may feel like. A touching love triangle amidst a heavy script from Alex Garland nicely fills out the rest of the film, as if it wasn't already intriguing enough to have those main 3 be top billing. Not that she has ever shown me otherwise, but it's always nice to be reminded just how powerful of an actress Carey Mulligan is. There's always a tremendous weight and gravitas to her roles that puts her on top of the game. Knightley and Garfield are great too, but this is Mulligan's film to behold.8.7/10",Never Let Me Go
22,inkblot11,"Never let it be that the movie industry quits making films like this one, so uniquely beautiful!",9,15 May 2014,"A medical caregiver named Kathy (Carey Mulligan) has a story to tell. After a brief introduction, she goes back in time to her childhood at an English boarding school. There, Kathy had two good friends, Tommy (Andrew Garfield) and Ruth (Keira Knightley). Tommy was quite emotional and had fits of anger if things didn't go his way while Ruth was sly but fun-loving, too. Kathy fell somewhere in the middle, being a good sounding board for the other two. All of the school's children were well cared for by the headmistress, Miss Emily (Charlotte Rampling) and other special teachers like Miss Lucy (Sally Hawkins). Slowly, the picture presented goes slightly off-kilter. For one, the children never go beyond the school's fences, not even if their ball goes into the fields beyond. No parents ever come for a visit and no one talks of brothers, sisters, aunts, or uncles. The children are told quite often that their health is extremely important, so vegetables must be consumed, while each seems to be wearing a very special bracelet. Its Miss Lucy who tells the boys and girls the ""big"" secret. That is, when they grow up, they will not be firemen or soldiers or school teachers. No, they are being raised for one purpose, to donate their organs to other human beings who are sick. Kathy, Tommy, Ruth and their schoolmates are, in short, CLONES. Despite this message, there is no mutiny, no running away, no protests. This life for them seems normal. Its understood that Kathy and Tommy love each other more and more as time goes on. Yet, Ruth wedges in. Its she who becomes Tommy's girlfriend and remains so, even when the trio graduates and moves to some seaside cottages. There, all lives are in transition, for the donation of their organs will begin soon. Kathy, needing to distance herself from the others, signs up to be a ""carer"", a person who looks after the clones after an operation. Leaving Tommy and Ruth behind, she embarks on a new path. Meanwhile, there have been circulating rumors for years that IF a set of clones are truly in love, they can postpone their surgeries for awhile. Will this be what Tommy and Ruth choose? It seems not, for several years later, Kathy meets Ruth again, after her second operation. Ruth is doing very poorly indeed but tells Kathy where she believes Tommy is residing. Should the three of them go sightseeing for a day? Or is something else possible? This uniquely beautiful, magical, extremely sad tale is from a book of the same title by Kazuo Ishiguro. Realities over the ages have changed a good deal; for example, torture, manifest destiny, colonialism, crucifixion and other practices were once considered normal. Ishiguro asks the reader then, not abruptly but with slow revelation, to accept a world where cloned humans are bred for one purpose, to save the lives of others while losing their own. The time is the here and now so although Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth initially appear ""normal"", their destinies are anything but so. How sad but, more importantly, could it happen? What a matter to ponder it is, very sobering. Mulligan, Knightly and Garfield are terrific in roles that quietly horrific. Rampling, Hawkins, and the other cast members are wonderful, also. The dreamy settings at school, seaside, and countryside exude more mystical qualities while costumes, camera work, script and direction are made to match for a story this special. Do see it, thoughtful movie fans everywhere. Its bountiful exploration of life's meaning should touch hearts and minds the world over.",Never Let Me Go

25,Rodrigo_Amaro,Beautiful and Melancholic,10,2 February 2011,"""Never Let Me Go"" is a dystopia and a sci-fi film that doesn't need special effects to tell its story. It uses a great deal of emotion and some romance in the memories of a woman reminding of her two friends during their permanence at Hailsham, a special place where they studied and lived during childhood and the experiences they had there and after getting out of it. Kathy H. (Carey Mulligan) is the narrator of her own story, reliving her good moments at Hailsham with her friends Tommy and Ruth (when adults played by Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley). They live in this school and they have a purpose which is not revealed that fast, and in the meantime they keep doing artistic paintings to be given to a woman known as Madam, who selects the best works. The other half of the movie deals with the three friends as adults, meeting a new world outside of Hailsham, losing their innocence without losing so much of their childish side, discovering love and more answers about who they are and their function as ""donors"". It's difficult to say something about what happens and the reasons why it happens without giving away details of the movie and spoiling the view so I'm gonna stop right here. But I can say that the film deals with deep questions about ethics, the science progress, and many other things that concern the human condition in this world and the way we deal with all that. These characters are eternal children that will never understand the world around them but they'll always try to believe that there's a way to change things, to make it happier or at least less sad than their destiny, the meaning of why they were brought to this world. The movie doesn't answer too much so here comes a suggestion to read the book (which, I confess, I gave up reading after a few pages because it took too long to something really happen in it, but I must say that for what I read, this film made a excellent job in recreating the moments at the beginning, it was very faithful to what the author wrote). I respected this project since I heard of it, another rare adaptation on the work of Kazuo Ishiguro (""The Remains of the Day"" is an excellent adaptation, and if you haven't read or watched it you must do both), and it's a perfect film for three young and outstanding actors to work with, not that Hollywood commercialized product where young actors always play the same role in some romantic comedy or similar. No, here they have challenging and difficult roles of a rare kind and they're all great, impeccable, very mature. And it's interesting that both Garfield and Mulligan landed in 2010 with this great work and other important roles in other mature films; he was in ""The Social Network"", and she was in ""Wall Street - Money Never Sleeps""; and that goes to show that they're in movie business not to just entertain but to make great and meaningful works. Mark Romanek's ""Never Let Me Go"" is a beautiful and original film that evokes an astonishing humanity and innocence that is very hard to find these days, whether in life or in motion pictures. 10/10",Never Let Me Go
26,tomgillespie2002,Touching study of humanity,8,21 February 2011,"Never Let Me Go is a film, like the novel it's based on, that seemingly mixes genres whilst almost firmly staying within the aesthetic realm of British period drama. You'd be forgiven for thinking that it is in fact just another 'costume' drama with Keira Knightly in it. I use the term costume drama loosely, simply as it is set in a period that is not our own. The film takes place in 1978, 1985 and 1995. Let Me Go portrays a dystopian 'past' which gives off an vague feeling of science fiction whilst firmly staying within the parameters of 'realism'; again a term used very loosely, as it is an alternate reality if you like.The screenplay was scribed by Alex Garland (previously known for novel/screenplay of The Beach and screenplay for 28 Days Later, amongst other works), based on the novel of the same name by Kazuo Ishiguro, which was on the Times top 100 novels since 1923. Ishiguro is previously known for the novel Remains of the Day, which was also adapted for the screen. Director Mark Romonek makes his second major feature work after 2002's One Hour Photo, which was an interesting piece of cinema, overshadowed in the media by the odd, but quite brilliant performance by a subdued Robin Williams. Romonek's other work is mainly in the music video world, along with adverts (whore! - I retract that comment if we ever accept adverts on this blog! - well....).Let Me Go tells the story of three children who are raised in what first appears to be a very English boarding school, called Hailsham. As the story progresses we realise that these children are raised in strict restriction from the real world as they are later to be used for their vital organs for the purpose of medical progression, and to restrict the spreading of serious diseases. It's never elaborated on whether the children are born of cloning or as test-tube babies. because of the setting I assume they would be test-tube. But again, as I have stipulated before, we are in an unsure mix of genre and an ambiguous state of reality.The film has three stages, first of which is the aforementioned childhood stage. This is where the characters Kathy (Carey Mulligan), Tommy (Andrew Garfield), and Ruth (Keira Knightly), cement their friendship. I'm not going to give too much away about the relationships, as I feel this is where the majority of the emotional and narrative drive comes from. As they grow and are dissipated from their every day, they move towards their twenties, and the last stages of existence; 'completion'. This is the stage in which they begin donating organs. Between these they each explore their sexuality and their place in the world, knowing all too well that they are only on the planet for a short period, not knowing where they came from. They always (particularly the girls), want to know who their 'originals' are. This, in me, triggers that concept that it is in fact a product of cloning. The performances by the three main characters are very noteworthy. They give realistic and emotional gravitas to the events and problems they all endure.I really don't want to linger at all on details of the narrative, or to dwell on the complexities of the relationships, as I feel this is one of those films everyone should watch. It encompasses the issues of science and duplication of people, as it questions the nature of the human soul. What does make us human? If we are replicated in a science laboratory, does this make us less human genetically/biologically? Whilst this idea is not wholly new in any way, it is a fundamental question when faced with the realities that we live with. After all, cloning is absolutely possible.The film is beautifully crafted; stunning, yet simple cinematography permeates the film, whilst also portraying the times they are set in perfectly. (We may well be in a different time altogether, but it 'feels' correct). A simple angle of the camera gives the nostalgia of time to the complete mise-en-scene. I rarely leave a film so touched, and so moved by questions of humanity and the importance of life.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Never Let Me Go
27,leplatypus,a real punch in my stomach (rental),10,30 April 2016,"If i had more informations about the movie content before, i would have never rent it : in short, it deals with my two biggest fears in life and i can't even name them now. It's been a long time that i haven't watched a so brutal movie for me and it has the disturbing quality of « the best of the world », « Soylent sun » and « V for vendetta » : a so British, quiet, cozy society that is at heart totally inhuman and eugenic. In a way this movie plays with a reality that is actually not discussed today : transplants market : actually, our society is even more hypocritical because there is no public service just a shadow service for the wealthy with the bodies of poor abused souls ! Sure, i forwarded the open sequence as it was unbearable for me. If i watched it afterward, it's because I just felt completely off tracks : it was unusual to stay in a school like this since « harry potter » and later with Keira and her friends, i think that it was just hope that kept me going. With that movie, Garlfied proves he is real talented and he could have been a great Peter Parker if he had got the right script and the right director ! You can really feel doom around the characters and it's as sad and painful as « Jude »! So really beware before watching it : this is a brilliant, disturbing movie but if you ask questions about your fate or you are hypochondriac or you have been traumatized resulting too many surgeries, this movie is definitely not for you !!",Never Let Me Go
28,howard.schumann,Emotionally Inert,8,3 October 2010,"Based on the acclaimed novel of 2005 by Kazuo Ishiguro and directed by Mark Romanek, Never Let Me Go is the story of an ill-fated love triangle between Ruth (Kiera Knightley), Kathy (Carey Mulligan) and Tommy (Andrew Garfield) in a parallel universe set in England between the late 1970s and the mid 1990s. The premise of the film is that science has found a way to extend human life and to eliminate disease by creating clones whose only purpose is to live until their early adulthood, then donate their organs to science. The children grow up secluded from human society and do not experience a context for their life, such as parents, siblings, history, geography, or politics and are shunned by the outside world.We first meet the three children in flashback growing up at a pleasant looking boarding school named Hailsham far away from any city influences. They play sports like other children - get into mischief, form friendships, (Kathy has fallen for Tommy but he is involved with Ruth and jealousies arise), yet have no idea how different they are. Although the children are well supported by ""guardians"", they are regimented, not taught to think for themselves nor exposed to the rest of society. There are ""carers"" and ""donors"". The job of the carers is to help the donors through the process until it is their time to donate their organs. After several donations, one is said to having ""completed"" their reason for existence but the word death is never mentioned.One day their third year guardian, Miss Lucy (Sally Hawkins), surprisingly reveals to the children the true nature of their purpose on the planet. For this disclosure, she is promptly fired the next day by the authoritarian head mistress (Charlotte Rampling). As the children grow up and leave Hailsham, they are placed in other homes such as The Cottages where they await their donations. Tommy and Ruth are together and Kathy is still on the outside looking in. Here they are allowed to leave the school grounds, at one time taking a trip to see someone that Ruth describes as possibly her original. One of the most powerful scenes in the film is when Kathy and Tommy (finally together) explore with their former guardians the idea that their status as donors can be deferred if they can prove that they are in love.There is much to stimulate the mind in Never Let Me Go, yet there is little to engage the heart. While the acting is superb and the photography outstanding, the tone is laden with a morose solemnity and the utter passivity of the young people is distancing. I applaud the implication that the use of science without morality is destructive and inhumane and we can all relate to the injustice of the swift approach of death, yet the logic of the genetic engineering suggested here is dubious and unclear.Although we can celebrate the fact that love is the key to the survival of the children in an existence destined to be short, there is no feeling of deeper meaning, no interconnectedness, no God, no joy, no hopes, no dreams, no sense that there may be something transcendent in the universe that everyone, regardless of their experience on earth, can access. Never Let Me Go is a solid translation to the screen of what is apparently a thought provoking book and I applaud the lack of maudlin sentimentality, yet for me the film remains emotionally inert and does not reach the heights one would expect from a fully satisfying work of art.",Never Let Me Go
29,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A brooding coming-of-age story with beautiful acting and direction,7,4 May 2011,"Never has a coming-of-age story been crossed with dystopian historical fiction, or however you might describe the world of Kazuo Ishiguro's novel ""Never Let Me Go"" and its film of the same title. The contrast in narratives works in an effectively haunting manner here: the youthful idealism of growing up with the exposed underbelly of a seemingly perfect world. Some people will not be able to accept the society created by the film, others will see it as an opportunity for unique character study, but Mark Romanek's work leaves a definite impression.Romanek (""One Hour Photo"") sets the tone of a period piece. Without the narration of Carey Mulligan's Kathy, we'd be left utterly confused. As she reflects on the past, the film takes us back to a boarding school named Hailsham in the '70s. The children are not brainwashed, but they're sheltered from outside influences. We only sense trouble through a peripheral character, a teacher played by Sally Hawkins, who takes it upon herself to tell the children they're being raised only so that they can serve as organ donors and that they might as well learn to love the little life that they'll get to experience.Miss Lucy is dismissed the next day, but the children don't seem to mind. To them, life is about discovering the opposite sex and typical pre-teenage things. Kathy in particular is drawn to Tommy, a boy who is made fun of and prone to fits of rage. They begin to form a bond until Ruth, Kathy's friend, goes after Tommy and the two become an item. The story continues when the trio becomes 18 years old and then again 10 years later. All the while, their fate becomes more and more prevalent to the viewer but almost never to them until it's too late.The toughest part about ""Never Let Me Go"" is having to accept the notion that certain children are raised only to be harvested for their organs. There is no typical sci-fi expository dialogue or other information provided through narrative. At the beginning of the film we are simply told that in the '50s a cure for all ailments was discovered and that eventually people began living to 100 with ease. Writer Alex Garland deliberately makes the choice to never satisfy our curiosity in hopes that we might focus more on the greater notion of Ishiguro's novel, which suggests to us what it is that truly makes life meaningful.Bringing this message home are three of the most gifted young actors working today: Mulligan, Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley. Knightley has the most experience of the trio, but she demonstrates an ability to act younger than her age quite well. We saw Mulligan do the same in ""An Education"" and Garfield also possesses a youthful quality (hence why he was cast as Spider-Man). In their expressions and reactions we feel that sense of life unfulfilled, of not truly understanding their lives, their unfortunate purpose and the consequent emotional void they possessed.That said, these emotions are not easy to relate to and occasionally the romantic subplot takes our attention away from truly processing their emotions. Romanek's camera gives the film the beauty it needs, but there are dull moments throughout. The pivotal scenes are quieter and brooding, asking us to open our minds more than our hearts in order to truly understand why the story was crafted this way.Mulligan's pitch-perfect voice-over dialogue at the end brings some needed clarity to the story and may prompt a second viewing, one less focused on plot and understanding the societal context and more interested in studying character. There's a beautiful notion about the insignificance of the length of our days, but the lesson doesn't feel perpetually in progress so much as we're awakened to it at the end. Nevertheless, the touching performances and delicate craftsmanship make ""Never Let Me Go"" a decidedly strong film.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Never Let Me Go
30,jtindahouse,A darker and more depressing film than I expected,7,17 January 2021,"You can often tell a movie is based on a book by the different way the scenes transition I find. The ones based on books tend to be a lot more choppy, while screenplays written directly for the screen tend to have more drawn out scenes. 'Never Let Me Go' was indeed based on a book and you can tell very quickly. This isn't necessarily a bad thing and can often actually mean the pacing of the film is better than with the alternative. I'm always let down when I've read and enjoyed a book and then see the film so I'm glad I saw this first.The movie has three very talented lead actors, however the extended opening of the film requires the characters to all be in child form. This is a daunting thing for the film to take on because the kids have to carry the film for all that time. They do an okay job, nothing special. The best thing they did though was find kids who looked exactly like their older selves. Carry Mulligan's child version in particular was uncanny.The film is pretty grim in nature when you think about it afterwards. It certainly isn't a feel-good film. It leaves you with some thoughts about the purpose of life and some conscious thoughts that mankind might have to deal with one day in the future. I wouldn't say I loved the film, but it was solid and enjoyable enough to sit through and not look at my watch.",Never Let Me Go
31,Turfseer,Robotic organ donors bore us to tears inside nonsensical UK dystopia,2,2 February 2011,"If there is one film you should avoid like the plague in 2011, it's ' Never Let Me Go'! Based on a pretentious novel by the Japanese novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, it's a story set in a dystopian England roughly between the 70s and the 90s.The story begins with three children, Kathy, Ruth and Tommy who attend Hailsham, a boarding school, run by an autocratic headmistress, Miss Emily, well-played by Charlotte Rampling. The children are brainwashed to accept the idea that when they grow to adulthood, they will become organ donors, in order to save terminally ill patients.When we finally flash forward to when the three children become adults, they continue to passively accept their fate as organ donors. In this film, we're asked to accept the idea of a world where there is no free will and adults walk around like zombie-like robots, simply waiting to accept their preordained fate.As the story unfolds, Kathy, Ruth and Tommy end up at a place called 'The Cottages'. There Kathy is turned off by the physical relationship between Ruth and Tommy. Ruth here is the antagonist, who taunts Kathy for her inability to accept her sexuality. Later, Ruth starts the organ donation process and begins to physically deteriorate. A rumor has been going around for a long time amongst the organ donor people that a couple can get a 'deferment' if they prove they're in love. Feeling guilty, Ruth gives Kathy and Tommy a contact address where they possibly can obtain a deferment since Ruth is no longer in the picture to drive a wedge between them. When they arrive at the house, they meet the old headmistress (now in a wheelchair). She tells them that the deferment was simply a myth and they can't get out of being organ donors.On a deserted road, Kathy stops the car she's been driving and lets Tommy out; he breaks down since he realizes he can never have a relationship with Kathy. Soon enough, Tommy's organs are harvested and we fade out as Kathy awaits her turn. Unbelievably, that's all there is to this ludicrous story! The only real significant conflict is between Kathy and Ruth over their affections for Tommy. They never attempt to revolt against the 'system' which would have made the film more exciting and interesting. Instead, the principals' ongoing passivity is a big bore and the love triangle is ordinary.While Carey Mulligan is certainly pleasing to look at it, her taste in scripts is highly questionable ('An Education' was only slightly better than 'Never Let Me Go'). The cinematography here was impressive and the soundtrack had a moody, haunting quality to it. But why do we hear the soundtrack almost continually throughout the entire movie? Could it be that the story is so inert that the director had to rely on the music underneath to suggest true emotions? 'Never Let Me Go' is perhaps one of the most 'one note' films I've seen in recent memory. Avoid this one at all costs, unless you enjoy waiting around to see your main characters have their body parts extracted without the slightest protest!",Never Let Me Go
32,freemantle_uk,"A bleak, alternative dyspotic story",8,24 June 2012,"In an alternative version of England they has been a medical breakthrough back in 1952 where scientists are able to cure most diseases and people are able to live to 100. But a cost is a new underclass of people has developed, breed for a dark destiny. Three of these people are Kathy H (Carey Mulligan), Tommy D (Andrew Garfield) and Ruth (Keira Knightley) who grow up together in a strange boarding school, Hailsham and a love triangle between the three starts to bloom and causes tensions between the three before they face their donations.The adaptation of Never Let Me Go sets out a very bleak society, where people are institutionalised into a system where they are breed to die. Even the prospect of a deferral would only offers people a respite from their fate, it did not stop what happens and nor do the character even attempt an escape because they accept what will happen to them. This is a more realistic view on this type of sci-fi scenario and this dyspotia shows a world that there is no need of controls to keep the clones. A complex world was created where people bury there heads in the sand, they know what is happening and pretend not to see it. The clones are dehumanised, they are not given surnames and they used in the system in a constant cycle of comfort. Normal people try to pretend the clones are none people but they are human, they feel, they love and it is a film that also has a theme of nature versus nurture.This film also have damning look at a dark version of the medical establishment, that they are willing to save people by taking the life of another and how they are willing to accept this system. This is an issue of medical ethics and general one where are what point are we willing to accept suffering of a group if it meant a better life for the majority. Should the pain of one person be tradable for the pain other another. There is lot of moral issues to consider with this film. I am sure that the Bristol Heart Scandal and other medical scandals were used as influences for the final third of the film.There is a great cast and director who worked on this film. Mulligan and Garfield are both very talented actors who were believable in their roles. You felt for both their situation and relationship in the backdrop of world. Knightley played a colder, harsher character but she does well in her role. The three child actors who played the younger versions of main characters were all very talented as well and played very complex roles of being children who have a very strange upbringing. One of the big themes is that the characters only have each others, they do not even know where they come from and have the realisation they are modelled on the undesirables of society and not knowing where they come from.Never Let Me Go uses a traditional three act, set in three different times of the character's lives. Mark Romanek brings a deliberately cold style of direction which was fitting to the sad situation that this film tells. He brings nice little touches throughout, from the period setting, the run down look of The Cottages, the old toys the children are given, the way ordinary people avoid contact with the clones and how the clones act when they are finally introduced into the real world. For a film that is rated 12A there is a surprising amount of nudity and sex.There are plenty of dyspotic fiction created in British in film and literature. The adaptation of Never Let Me Go is not the best but it is still very good film, telling a bleak story and a setting out a harsh world for a underclass. It needed the strength of the director, the writers and the actors to make this film work.",Never Let Me Go
33,dee.reid,"""Never Let Me Go"" - Never Let Go of this film...",10,5 March 2011,"""Never Let Me Go"" is one of the most distressing and depressing films I've ever seen, so it's easy to imagine why this film, despite a wealth of positive reviews, failed at the American box office so badly last year. What people are missing, however, despite its grim subject matter (including one of the most upsetting, yet profoundly moving endings ever), is one of the most intelligent, thought-provoking, and well-acted films in recent memory.Music video director Mark Romanek has had a somewhat easy transition into the way of feature filmmaking (he made his debut in 2002 with the creepy Robin Williams thriller ""One Hour Photo""), and ""Never Let Me Go"" is easily the director's best work. Screenwriter Alex Garland adapted Kazuo Ishiguro's novel of the same name, and the plot centers on three life-long best friends who are also wrapped up in a love triangle. Kathy (Carey Mulligan) loves Tommy (Andrew Garfield), but Tommy is currently engaged in a loveless relationship with their mutual friend Ruth (Keira Knightley, in what is easily her best and in my opinion, most tolerable performance yet).Their tangled love affair is set against the backdrop of a revisionist history beginning in 1978 and ending in 1995, when the three are young children being raised at a prestigious boarding school called Hailsham somewhere on the English countryside. Over the course of their growing up together, they gradually learn the horrifying truth about the school and the grim significance of what their lives really mean in this world, because, as they also discover, their predetermined lives on this Earth will be short and they have very little time to understand each other and what life and love really mean.To really describe the plot any further will be a great disservice to the true-to-life performances of this film's three daring young leads and the filmmakers. ""Never Let Me Go"" is a daring combination of heartfelt drama, romance, and dystopic science fiction. The latter film genre serves only as a backdrop and never once does the picture descend into pointless action scenes and special effects as a means for its characters to try to escape their fates, or ultimately responsibilities to the rest of humankind. (In fact, ""Never Let Me Go"" actually has more in common with Rob Reiner's 1986 comedy-drama ""Stand by Be"" than anything written by Philip K. Dick.) No, although these three characters have accepted the inevitably of their incredibly short lives, they are still determined to enjoy what time they have left together and that is the whole point of this powerful and emotionally-driven film.Anyone who dismisses this film because of the negative reviews (yes, there were a few) saying it's too bleak and depressing are selling themselves short. They'd also be missing one of the most powerfully acted and ultimately moving films I've ever seen. They'd also be missing one of the greatest films of 2010, that's for sure, and that's the real tragedy of ""Never Let Me Go"": that so many people ignored such an incredibly great and brilliant film about life, love, and humanity.Never Let This Film Go.10/10.",Never Let Me Go
34,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Unconventional, eerie romance",8,24 August 2015,"Never Let Me Go is, unlike a lot of romance films out there today, a smart, empathetic, cold yet compassionate look at the hardships that befall a trio of children in a mysterious boarding school in the early 70's. They are not normal children, although the film only throws vague hints as to the nefarious program they are a part of, that is until a sympathetic teacher, (Sally Hawkins, phenomenal) imparts a secret to them before their developmental stage is ready for it. They grow up essentially with a ticking clock on their lives, a sad, limited existence that they try to get the most out of, yet the same tragedies that befall normal youths happen to them, they just have less time too deal with it, and are essentially expendable, but the film begs the question: Does this fact make their challenges, emotions and sacrifices any less potent or important? Carey Mulligan is staggeringly amazing as Kathy, a quiet, intuitive girl who silently rages against the dying of her light, and is deeply in love with Tommy (Andrew Garfield, superb). A rift is formed early on by Ruth (Keira Knightely) a wound up, scared girl who seeks love whether it's genuine or not. The story checks in on them every few years and meanders through their times at the school, later on in shadowy 'recovery centres', and everywhere in between, shaping a lyrical, free flowing story that has all the freedom and air to breathe of an upbeat film, but suffocates any hope or happiness with an uncompromising narrative that refuses to let up or give in to the 'happy ending' clause. The three leads are dynamite, investing incredible care into their work. Their child actors who play their counterparts at the boarding school are equally stellar, especially young Kathy, played by Izzy Meikle-Small, a true find who not only is a dead ringer for Mulligan, but pulls off impossibly complex emotional work for an actress her age. At times I wish the film fleshed out its story a bit more in terms of what's going on in the world to require such extreme measures, but then I remind myself that this isn't that type of film. It's an intimate look at three individuals tossed amongst a world gone off the map, and yet the film insists upon following these three, faithfully, to whatever end.

35,3xHCCH,Tries Hard to Be Positive About a Very Negative Premise,6,27 February 2011,"The movie ""Never Let Me Go"" is very British in atmosphere and color. It is melancholic and slow, with a very pale look to it. It starts with the main character and narrator, Kathy H (Carey Mulligan), who calls herself a ""carer"" looking on as Tommy (Andrew Garfield) is being prepared for surgery. As we are brought back to their childhood in a strict isolated school called Hailsham back in 1978, their teen years in the Cottages in 1985 and their adulthood in 1994. We slowly realize what sort of school Hailsham really is, and the sad fate that awaits its students when they grow up.I watched this movie primarily because of its stars. Carey Mulligan confirms her talent after her Oscar nomination for ""An Education."" Her portrayal of Kathy is very heartfelt and sincere. Andrew Garfield's performance as the strange Tommy is a bit uneven. Keira Knightley, as the senior member of the lead triumvirate, is a bit disappointing as the tragic Ruth. I feel she did not handle the character well enough, or maybe it was the way the character was written. Charlotte Rampling and Sally Hawkins were also memorable in their brief roles as Hailsham teachers.As someone who has not read the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro nor any idea of what the story is about, I was surprised as the story gradually and unexpectedly moved from fuzzy childhood puppy love into the realm of cold science fiction. The treatment of the story by director Mark Romanek was very methodical and philosophical. This is a another movie that will not easily be popular because of its controversial and morbid subject matter. It does make a valiant effort though to create a positive meaning out of the intrinsically negative premise. But maybe a lot of people will be turned off when they find out what the movie is really about midway through.",Never Let Me Go

This is the story of 3 friends who go to , what seems at first , a perfectly normal boarding school , but it's not long before we realise that these children are not normal at all . These children were never destined to live beyond a certain age so that others could benefit. This is a very emotional movie . A movie that you soon realise is not going too end too well and because of that , it puts you through the ringer . Any film that brings out the viewers emotions is a good one in my book and this certainly did that to me. It's not perfect by any means because there are some glaringly obvious questions that go unanswered such as why don't the donors just disappear and why are they so willing to stick with the programme?

First, I think it's too vague; many things of this movie have no explication and we never know the reasons of anything, and that's a sad thing since the spectator can't figure what is going on writer's mind. The story could be thousand times more intense with such emotional subject, but the filmmakers preferred to just look at it superficially. Sometimes I also felt the story was boring and the director was out of plot; I could easily just turn it off and I wouldn't mind for what would happen to the characters anymore. It feels it's just a cheap movie trying to be smart, but in the end it's the same thing. The ending is reasonable, but I do not indicate this for anyone....",Never Let Me Go
40,Matt_Layden,I wanted a bit more from this one.,7,13 March 2011,"I honestly expected this film to be a lot more emotional than what it ended up being, much like Conviction. I went in knowing what the children were, so I don't know if that had any impact on my initial reactions and thoughts. My main problem with it though, and this might be the fault of the source material, was the relationship between Ruth and the other two characters, Cathy and Thomas. I think that if her relationship to the other two were different, I would have had a more emotional connection to the characters and their problem. We see that Cathy likes Thomas when they are kids. We also know that Ruth knows this and she 'steals' him away. Then we are suppose to all of a sudden jump on the Thomas/Cathy love wagon at the end when they have been together for such a small amount of time? I would have rather had Thomas and Cathy get together when they were kids and have Ruth be in love with him too, but neither Thomas or Cathy knew. This would create more of an emotional connection to Ruth, which was missing for me the entire movie. Also, when they go to declare their love, it would feel more genuine and not an excuse to live longer.Sorry, that was my biggest problem with the film, minor complaints come in because a lot of it was dragging on and it seems to be rather slow. Despite having some terrific performances and great direction. Andrew Garfield continues to impress me, here he plays Thomas as the socially awkward, emotionally unbalanced kid who doesn't really grow up. Carey Mulligan is the anchor of the film, we follow her and feel her pain for both her friends. Keira Knightley gives a good performances as Ruth, the bitchy friend. Her latter scenes are more heartbreaking enough to forgive her for whatever she did prior, even if she is unsure about her actions. The very thought of your existence is in question here, for these characters. They are suppose to do one thing and one thing only, they can't live normal lives. The story takes place in an alternate universe, so for me that immediately has some kind of disconnection from the beginning. I kept wondering why none of the characters would run. Sure, as kids they are threatened with horror stories, but they are somewhat free when they are older. The bracelets they wear are only shown and never really explained. You are left to assume that those are the things keeping them from running, but this isn't Blade Runner.A very unbalanced film of emotions. For me, all the right ingredients are there for a depressing movie, but there is that disconnect, which is enough to make it not seem depressing at all. I know I should be sad for these characters and I am, only a little though. I should be upset and full of tears, but I'm not.",Never Let Me Go

Kathy (Carey Mulligan) and Tommy (Andrew Garfield) show the first signs of love at an early age, but Ruth (Keira Knightley) inserts herself between the two, altering the short lives of all three in a profound way. Beyond the obvious talents of the three young lead actors and the quality of the novel the movie is adapted from, the biggest strength of Never Let Me Go is the remarkably gorgeous locations where it was filmed. The cinematography is haunting and memorable, and if you're anything like me, you'll pay just as much attention to the settings as you do everything else. While I found the performances, aesthetic beauty, and general story to be great, I thought that Never Let Me Go was occasionally lacking in depth. The idea of clones being used essentially as farms for organs because they aren't viewed as humans with souls, is one that has endless potential. This potential was only occasionally touched on, and I would have loved to see the ramifications of this kind of a society explored at least a little more.",Never Let Me Go

It's Not as Perfect as the Novel Was yet it has Manage to Create the Intensity, Cruelty & Depression of the Novel. There are many things movie has successfully adopt from the novel, like creating the Era, the Hailsham and most importantly perfect casting for Kathy, Ruth & Tommy. Creating the perfect atmosphere and moments is an achievement but their were things in which movie lacked too. For example, firstly, the emotions portrayed in the novel when they were children were lot more stronger than shown in the movie plus each and every character in the novel was important like Kathy and Ruth's friends in the Hailsham. But in the movie they were hardly mentioned. Secondly, There were lots of powerful moments in the novel, I wanted to see them in the movie, but somehow they didn't it in the movie. E.g (1) Kathy dancing with the pillow on ""Never Let Me Go"" song and Miss Lucy walked in on her was one of the most powerful moments in the novel. (2) Miss Lucy acting completely paranoid in her room when Kathy & Tommy sneak on her. (3) Kathy and Tommy fight in the cottages when Ruth tells Tommy that Kathy was making fun of his painting and theory about Deferrals. (4) Kathy & Tommy Sex scenes were beautifully written in the novel, because it shows that they made love for the first time after secretly being in love since the Hailsham days. I wished these things were shown in the movie, and then it would have been Perfect. Although, absence of these things makes me sad but the thing makes me happy while watching the movie was the performances and the atmosphere. Just like while reading the novel my eyes were wet all the time, same happened during the movie too, it was heart wrenching. Now let's talk about the performances, Carey Mulligan is such an inspiring actress and again in ""Never Let Me Go"" she proved that she is one of the finest actresses around to play in-depth roles like Kathy H. Keira Knigthley was amazing, her portrayal of Ruth was cunning & mean and during every scene she proved why she is the best British actress ever in Hollywood. Andrew Garfield pleasantly surprises me every time and it's truly inspiring to see him playing Tommy. The young actors playing Kathy (Izzy Meikle-Small), Ruth (Ella Purnell) and Tommy (Charlie Rowe) did a decent job. Sally Hawkins, Charlotte Rampling and Kate Bowes Renna did justice to their parts. Overall, ""Never Let Me Go"" is not a typical Hollywood Sci-Fi movie, and it's actually a Haunting Sci-Fi drama, which is not for everyone. You need to have deep emotions to actually understand what these clones have to go through for the Humanity's sack.",Never Let Me Go
43,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,"Melancholy, Disturbing but Amazing",8,15 August 2014,"A group of kids go to a secluded school and unknown to them they are destined to be murdered. They are forced organ donors to whoever can pay to have a transplant, however the kids are donating vital organs that they need to live, so it's a tragic but certain death sentence. The three kids, in order to survive a few more years, have to prove that they truly love each other.This movie first-off was undoubtedly disturbing, a disregard for human life. The kids are looked down on as inferior, being raised like cattle to be used and cut open like a mad science experiment. Unfortunately there is a rig of truth to this film. While organ donation in North America is usually done in safety and only by consent of the donor, the black market illegally kidnaps and kills people all the time for organs, a crime that the police are still always trying to control and end.Not only is this film sad and disturbing though, it's a story of finding hope in the darkest of times, of true love and friendship, loyalty and rebellion. The friendship amongst the three kids never fades. This movie had great acting and great soundtrack, was based on a spectacular novel I read in school a couple years ago. The story within the film is more amazing and beautiful than any Disney princess movie or vampire romance novel.Simply put, I highly recommend this movie. Everyone I'm sure can remember a time as a teenager when they rebelled, obviously not against something as severe as organ harvesting but maybe abuse, school, bullies, society, anything. It's a traumatic drama that will stick with you the rest of your life, similar to recent films like Antiviral (2012) and The Help (2011). Never Let Me Go is definitely worth checking out.",Never Let Me Go
44,napierslogs,High quality film that was interesting and crosses into various genres,9,15 October 2010,"""Never Let Me Go"" is an interesting, haunting and affecting story of love and jealousy. The story that we see occurring on the surface is fairly commonplace of friends growing up together and falling in love. But the backdrop of this film, which eventually takes over the main story, is science fiction like. It's dark and tragic and thought-provoking.The world the film is set in is 1980s England and it looks very similar to the real world. But it's not our world and I had a hard time fully realizing all the characterizations for characters in a world that I don't quite know and understand. But it's just such a well done film that my interest was piqued and the story had me captivated, or at least curious, from beginning to end.The film was incredibly well shot, making dreary England look spectacular but still getting the feeling of damp and cold across. It was also really well cast. The kids playing the younger versions of Keira Knightley, Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield looked and sounded just like them and were able to carry the beginning of the film. As others noted, Garfield also really stood out for me and his character moved me.I recommend ""Never Let Me Go"" because of the high quality of film-making. The science fiction elements are rather subtle so it's more for fans of romantic dramas, but it's an interesting enough film that it can cross into most genres.",Never Let Me Go

The movie has an interesting premise; it wants to be a tale about profound, true love and the actors are giving good performances. But the whole thing feels very detached, cold and devoid of emotions, as if someone was just writing a perfunctory summary of a beautiful story. Maybe this very clinical approach was intentional to match the story but I didn't feel like it worked for me; it has qualities so it's quite hard to explain why I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it either.",Never Let Me Go
46,sarastro7,Give me strength...,2,4 May 2011,"Tell me, is there anything more boring than a story that you have essentially seen done better many times before, which painstakingly slowly just keeps going exactly where you know it will be going? I was very disappointed with The Island (2005), but compared to Never Let Me Go, it was a near masterpiece. Okay, I admit Never Let Me Go has good actors and good production values, but that's where my praise ends. This is a movie which is trying to sell a many decades old science fiction idea to mainstream audiences by wrapping it in a mainstream package. And like trained monkeys, those mainstream audiences go ""oooh!"" and ""wow!"" in response. I went ""argh!"", and was deeply, deeply bored.The big element that absolutely cannot be believed about this concept is that they would give these organ donors any semblance of ordinary lives. Why? Why?? In The Island they at least provided a very poor and insufficient explanation, but here there was none at all.For those interested in science fiction who would like to read a good treatment of this idea, I direct you to the 1987 comic book, ""World of Krypton"" by John Byrne and Mike Mignola. Here, of course, they do the only right thing (and it's just a casual and logical element of the story): keeping the extra bodies completely comatose from birth, never letting them have personalities or consciousness of their own. Anything else is utterly ridiculous and would never be perpetrated by any remotely ethical authorities.2 out of 10.",Never Let Me Go
47,Andy-296,"Interesting and provocative, but this science fiction film could have been better",6,19 January 2011,"Never let me go is an odd science fiction film is that it is set in the past instead of the future (strictly speaking, it is set in an alternative universe, but in the fiction the action takes place from a somewhat different 1970s to the 1990s and the clothes and the technologies suggest the action takes place a few decades ago). At the start of the movie, it looks like we have stumble into one of those quaint and boring films set in a traditional English school. But soon more fantastic undertones occur: as the story goes, we are told (this is not a spoiler since it is explained a few minutes into the picture) that these particular children at this school have been destined, without their consent, to give up their organs when they reach adulthood. Without any apparent family (whether they were cloned or how they were born is never told), they have been bred by the government to give their organs several times, so that their untimely death is inevitable. The movie soon centers on three of the children/young adults, two girls and a boy, who know what their ultimate destiny is and try to avoid it (having two beautiful actresses like Carey Mulligan and Keira Knightley play the two young women certainly helps the movie). What is never explained here is why they (or other young people in similar situation) don't escape. They don't like their fate, but they seem more resigned to it than they should. Especially, since the movie never shows the country to be a heavily militarized society in which escape to another country would be highly improbable. And in any case if you know your inevitable destiny is untimely and painful death as is it clear here, you would try to get away from this place anyway even if the odds are slim. The movie has many interesting and suggestive themes, but unfortunately it is never able to blend these themes into a very good movie, just an interesting one. And it bothers me a bit that organ's transplants which has saved so many people's lives in the real world, here are made to look so sinister.",Never Let Me Go
48,sharky_55,We all complete,7,29 September 2015,"Director Mark Romanek describes his film adaptation Never Let Me Go as ""a love story with fictional science context mixed in."" Well, that does seem accurate. It follows its novel pretty closely in plot, a low key sci-fi which pondered ideas of humanity, love and memory. I can't say Romanek prioritises this, and it's a shame because the novel, despite its rather conversational prose, does manage to get you thinking. Both start with the future; Kathy as a carer, her voice-over plunging the film into a extended sequence of reminiscing and wistful nostalgia for the childhood days of Hailsham. Isn't that act in itself a human one? The mistake that many adaptations make is cutting content, a very difficult process of course but one that time after time manages to mar the narrative. Here it renders it shallow because although Romanek shoots every crucial segment of the childhood, that is all we see. All the playful imagination, playground tantrums, teasing and bullying and important assemblies are all there, but it is almost too stable and accurate. The unreliability and rambling nature of Kathy's memory is a key element of her humanity and memory in Ishiguro's writing, but unfortunately here it seems very precise, very carefully planned. We witness the first kiss on the cheek between Tommy and Ruth, and the film is winking loudly as if to say, this will be important later. Later, Kathy is again the voyeur, catching a glimpse of the pair in bed through a crack in the doorway - clearly indicating that the love triangle is one of the film's key themes. How contrived. Ruth is in bliss, while Tommy's expression is blank, and again Romanek is being lazy; where is the gradual build-up of the tight knit friendships and rapports? Why is Ruth so obviously a villain much earlier than her confession, one moment a sneering bully, the next a bashful best friend? A half an hour extra might have done a world of good. It's a shame because Keira Knightley does pull off the bitchy role quite well, but it needs to be a more subdued and nuanced character opposite Kathy.Still, the film gets a few things right. The idyllic childhood is very well expressed, the child actors competent (young Kathy is impeccable cast). We get tender closeups of the modest yet comfortable Hailsham school, misshapen and rearranged dolls, chests of treasured belongings, artworks of all kinds, even before we have any idea of just what sort of terrible fate is behind the veneer. It's shot with a muted homely colour palette, and is instinctively inviting. When the sales announcement is made, the whole school trembles with excitement and not even the sight of a faded green van and two haggard men hauling in boxes of junk will dissuade them. The illusion is very real, the score as lively as the mood of the sales hall (it's more effective and bearable here than in the back end of the film where it hits melodramatic heights). The title cassette song is made wonderfully self- comforting as we listen with Kathy. And in the gentle and motherly performance of Miss Lucy, a desperately pained monologue reveals the true purpose of the unblinking children. She is promptly dismissed the next day. There is a great line in the novel that cites the reason for this as shattering the happiness of Hailsham's students. That in itself may be true, but reveals the complexities and issues that arise when treading such dangerous moral grounds with the advent of such technology. Suffice to say, it is not in the film. When they venture of out the homes, it is into the bright and harsh exteriors on a optimistic mission. The highlight is without a doubt the humorous ordering of the meals; the role-playing clearly was not sufficient as they nervously mimic each other's preference. That tells us more about the characters than the mission itself. When Ruth yells out in rage that they are modelled on human trash and that each of them think it in secret, it does not sound convincing. Has there been a inkling of self-loathing and contempt in the characterisation at all? Another nice moment is her faked nervous laughter and mimicry of the rubbing of the shoulders as seen on TV, which seems normal but is a conscious act in digging for that inherent humanity. But all it does is set up another argument which is another jigsaw in the messy puzzle that is Kathy and Ruth's friendship. This all signals potential that goes amiss. Never Let Me Go is almost too comfortable. The film is warmly shot, full of shallow focus and tender closeups and a wistful voice-over, and the score toes the line between melodramatic and authentic emotional tension. And in this it ticks the wrong boxes. A bleak passive statement in ""We all complete"", a very distressing sign of her inability to look past her purpose and forge her own identity, is overshadowed by the beautiful images of the garbage billowing in the wind and the stirring score. These relationships and experiences and conflicts are messy and harrowing and uncinematic, yet Romanek tries his hardest to do so anyway. Ruth dies alone on the operating table, while Tommy smiles beyond the glass window. How very poignant this ending could have been.",Never Let Me Go
49,KnightsofNi11,Beautifully haunting,9,16 July 2012,"Most of the time I consider it a good thing if a film is difficult to place into one genre. It adds intrigue and uniqueness to the film's story. Such is the case with Never Let Me Go, a film that is part drama and part romance, with a streak of fascinating science fiction running through it. It has the greatest effect if you know very little about what the film entails, so I'll try to be as vague as possible. Essentially, it is the story of three people and the love triangle that develops between them. We begin at their childhood boarding school where the three meet, and follow them into their young adult years as they grow up in a less than conventional environment, the likes of which we haven't seen before and it's doubtful you can guess what it is.Never Let Me Go is the definition of a truly beautiful film. It possesses astounding wonder and heart throbbing emotion underneath a dazzling aesthetic of a glowing picturesque quality. There are some beautiful exterior shots of beaches, woods, and sunsets that add to the somber and enticing beauty of the film. This all comes equipped with a moving classical score full of pianos and violins that makes every heart wrenching moment all the more powerful. These aesthetic elements combine to make this film a marvelous audio/visual spectacle.Yet, this pristine aesthetic quality isn't even needed to make Never Let Me Go a fantastic film. It's story alone can do that by being one of the most unique, fascinating, and moving stories I've seen develop on screen in a long time. It's vital that you know next to nothing about the story going into the film, so I won't go into any detail. Let me just say, it will take you by surprise and it will leave you amazed and awed. It has darkly intriguing elements that work so perfectly together to make an incredible tear jerker of a story.Never Let Me Go blew me away. There isn't much more to say than that. It's a brilliant film with a haunting beauty that doesn't miss a beat as it develops throughout the story. It's beautifully directed, superbly written, and the performances from Keira Knightly, Andrew Garfield, and Carey Mulligan are beyond excellent. This is a must see for any film fan of any genre because it is just pure unique genius.",Never Let Me Go
50,cultfilmfan,Never Let Me Go,9,25 November 2010,"Never Let Me Go is based upon the novel of the same name by Kazuo Ishiguro. The film follows three friends named Kathy, Tommy and Ruth while they are at an English boarding school and continues to follow them now as adults. I think the less I can say in my synopsis of this film would be for the better. I really do not want to spoil anything and I think the film would be more powerful and meaningful to one who maybe does not know all that much about it and goes into the theatre with an open mind, so for that reason I am no longer going to talk about the story aspect of the film. However if you have read the very popular novel that the film is based on, you should know what you are in for. How closely the film follows the book I can not say having not read it, or any other novels by Kazuo Ishiguro. I personally found the film to be quite powerful and at times quite poetic and even beautiful. More than anything else the main point to this film is the love story that is featured in the film and so much of the rest of it kind of focuses around that. These three characters we are introduced to are all a bit different in their personality traits, but with good character study we soon get to know more about them and see them put in difficult situations and how they grasp said situations and how they deal with them. The relationships between the three are believable and in a lot of ways there is still so much innocence to them, even later as they become adults, but in other ways they are very mature and ready to make way for themselves in the world. The love these characters have for each other and the memories of how they grew up together and everything they have experienced together is thoughtful in a way that it is like most of our youth days at school, or with our school or classmates back however long that may take us. We also remember that when we were at school there was always someone we thought we loved and whether it grew into something, or not, we still remember it and we also remember qualities and things about the schools we went to and the other people there, whether they were good memories, or perhaps not. As a young adult we can relate to trying to find ourselves in the world and making a name for ourselves. Often there is barriers though and things we have to overcome to achieve this. Through all of this though, we still remember the people who were with us and helped us to get through it and so do the three characters in Never Let Me Go. Because the film captures a certain nostalgic point of childhood and of our loves and friendships, it does so in a way that is beautiful because it shows us what is truly important in life and that whatever may have happened in the past has helped us to grow physically and mentally and to prepare for the life ahead of us. These characters do that and although their situations are slightly different, I think this film will bring back nostalgia for the viewers watching it and we can smile, or even cry at our own memories, but being able to do that, helps us to relate to these characters even more. The character study although subtle and done at a more leisurely pace is still really revealing and well done. The story is fascinating and powerfully done and will leave you thinking about what you saw long after the film is over. The cinematography of the film is gorgeous and always a pleasure to look at and the young actors who play Kathy, Tommy and Ruth all do a very fine job here. The screenplay is right on the mark with where it wants to take us and show us and it succeeds very well with that as well as the almost dreamlike and meditative state of the film's direction which adds to the more poetic and beautiful parts of the film. I think this is a film to see more than once to truly appreciate it, but on first viewing it is still great as well.",Never Let Me Go

52,ajs-10,A heartbreaking tale set in an alternate reality,8,15 January 2012,"I remember hearing about this film when it came out; I was slightly intrigued by it at first, but then I heard it was a bit of a love story and shelved it for a bit. Well, it resurfaced this week and, despite my reservations I decided to give it a look. You'll be pleased to know I was pleasantly surprised. Some really great performances are the highlight of this heartbreaking tale set in an alternate reality. I will tell you more after this brief summary.At an idyllic school called Hailsham in the countryside, three children; Kathy, Tommy and Ruth become friends. From the beginning you can tell there is something odd about this school it is not until one of the teachers, Miss Lucy, tells the students of their purpose that the audience, along with the children, begins to understand. (I will not say here what it is as I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the film.) The story is told through the eyes of Kathy and you can tell that she is attracted to Tommy, but Ruth gets to him first. At the age of eighteen they are allowed to leave and go to live in a place called 'The Cottages' with teenagers from other schools. By now Tommy and Ruth have become a couple and they begin to explore the world around them. They hear about something called a 'deferral' for couples that are in love (don't worry, that will make sense when you see the film) and Kathy can't bare it any longer and leaves to become a carer. She later hears that Tommy and Ruth had broken up. Little does she know but their paths are due to cross again and it is this meeting that will decide their fate. I will not say any more or the Spoiler Police (Alternate Reality Division) will be removing my organs (again).This film is beautifully made with a great musical score by Rachel Portman, it really captures the mood of the piece. Great cinematography combines with the great British countryside to give the plot the room it needs to breathe. The thing that stands out most though is the performances of the three main characters; Carey Mulligan as Kathy, Andrew Garfield as Tommy and Keira Knightley as Ruth all put in really great performances. I must also give a mention to their young counterparts; Izzy Meikle-Small as Young Kathy, Charlie Rowe as Young Tommy and Ella Purnell as Young Ruth were all excellent also. Honourable mentions go to; Charlotte Rampling as Miss Emily and Sally Hawkins as Miss Lucy.This is a bit of a heartbreaker of a film, filled with a lot of emotion because the audience are allowed to get to know these characters and become invested in their fate. I have to admit to feeling very sad by the end. It's beautifully made with great care and so hats off to the filmmakers for making it as enjoyable to watch as it was. As I've already said, it's quite heartbreaking at the end but still well worth a look Recommended.My score: 8.3/10.IMDb Score: 7.2/10 (based on 35,146 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 70/100 (based on 162 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 70/100 (based on 29,621 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).",Never Let Me Go
53,itamarscomix,One of a kind,9,19 May 2012,"I'd rather say as little as possible about Never Let Me Go, because I really benefited from watching it with no prior knowledge of the plot. I never read the book - if you have, you're spoiled in advance - but otherwise, you're better off just thinking it's little more than a British coming-of-age drama taking place at a slightly odd boarding school... then be taken off guard when it turns into something else entirely. A lot like the protagonists, who remain in the dark for the majority of the film.What I am willing to say, though, is that it's a very unusual film, and one of the most depressing ones I've ever seen. It's incredibly effective emotionally, a lot of it due to a superb performance by Carey Mulligan, who's shaping up to be one of the most talented young actresses of of her generation. Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield are less impressive but they both deliver. Despite some flaws the film suffers from - most notably, a slightly fragmented feeling that probably derives with too many segments of the book being cut - it's unique and shocking enough, and powerful enough on the emotional level, to be considered a must-see - especially for lovers of real speculative fiction, which doesn't delve into full-blown sci-fi or horror.

It is really scary, let´s suppose that tomorrow human cloning will be approved, something that ethically would be inconceivable. On the one hand, some want to reproduce certain types of humans, on the other hand, others look for a simple massive reproduction to produce organs as spare parts for those opulent who need them.

55,Imdbidia,"Thought provoking film, not for everybody",9,27 August 2011,"Never let me Go is the adaptation of the eponymous book by Kazuo Ishiguro. It is an odd science-fiction piece that happens in our past but portrays events that could be positively real in our near future. It follows the lives of a group of three friends from their school days in the English Boarding School of Hailsham to their mid twenties. It is a wonderful sad love story, and a reflection on the nature of love and the meaning of life.The movie poses very many dilemmas and interesting philosophical questions: 1/ Is it valid and ethical to create human beings with the specific purpose of saving other people? If so, wouldn't be fair to value the donor's lives by having sub-donors to save them? 2/ Who decides which lives are first class and second class, and on which grounds? 3/ Does the fact that somebody created me in a tube or cloned me, give him/her the right to decide my destiny and my future or the status of my soul? 4/ Is it life more valuable and fulfilling if you have the feeling that you are going to life for a long time, even if you don't, or if you know that your time on earth is short and live it to the fullest? 5/ If we all have to die, sooner or later, why do we need to extend our lives artificially? 6/ Will that make you happier and fulfill you beyond the obvious of saving your life? 6/Can a sick person be mentally and spiritually fulfilled and happy and and a healthy one not? There are so many questions posed in this movie, in such a understated way, that thought-provoking has a meaning here.Carey Mulligan is truly terrific as Kathy as well as Izzy Meikle-Small as Young Kathy, and the are the very soul of the movie. Kiera Knightly always plays her characters in autopilot, and it is difficult to separate a character from another as she does not seem to believe any of them. Despite being a superstar she turns out to be the weakest link among a cast of actors who really believe their roles. Garfield is good as the sweet insecure Tommy, and his child-like physique really suits his character; his performance is especially good at the end. The rest of the supporting actors are good in their performances.The whole mood of the movie is timeless, and although the time span goes from the 1970s to the 1990s, I would say it is more the 1950s and early 1960s than anything else. The cinematography (by Adam Kimmel) is wonderful, with a beautiful use of lighting, countryside bucolic summer images and beach painterly images (like the one of the old ship docked on the sand, which poetically echoes the sad docked lives of these young trio), which contrast with the aseptic cold images of indoor hospitals and desolated landscapes. The soundtrack by Rachel Portan is exquisitely lyric and gives its mood to the movie.Not having read the book, my main critique to the movie is the selection of Keira as Ruth, and the lack of personal background about the separate lives of the trio in their early youth, which will have helped to better understand Ruth's change of mind at the end.This is one of those movies that you get or you don't get, mostly because the premise is very real, disturbing, awkward and lyric at the same time. To see Never Let me Go, you really have let yourself go and decide that you are going to believe that this alternative reality is possible. Moreover this is not a happy story or a romance ""a la Hollywood"" and it certainly won't satisfy viewers looking for mainstream silly romantic films. The movie is beautifully filmed, moving and so thought-provoking, so it is difficult to understand the low ratings it has received and its poor distribution.The movie will make you think. And cry. Not for everybody.",Never Let Me Go
56,doctorsmoothlove,A Human Condition,10,14 December 2010,"Do you know anyone who isn't an organ donor? The topic isn't likely to arise in conversation, but really, why not be one? Unless your religion prevents it, you ostensibly have nothing to lose but your dead self. Some people even like to believe that they will ""live on"" somehow when part of their body is transplanted. That's a crazy idea. The only way to ""live on"" would be to transplant one's brain into another's body. No one wants to be that inconvenienced.What some advocates suggest sounds better on paper: growth of spare human parts. The problem is doing so requires raising a person only to slowly kill him as his body is robbed. And this is the basis for Never Let me Go, an evocative adaptation of a Kazuo Ishiguru's popular novel. It takes place in an alternative world where many diseases have been cured by replacing infected organs with grown ones. The story is narrated by Kathy (Carey Mulligan) who recalls her life right before her timely death.Kathy begins life as a student in Hailsham boarding school with her two best friends Ruth (Keira Knightley) and Tommy (Andrew Garfield). She and her friends spend a lot of time learning about poetry, making arts and crafts, and exercising. They need no technical skills. Kathy and Tommy develop an infatuation with each other that lasts throughout adolescence even as he becomes involved with Ruth. After graduation the young people begin living in a community setting and working occasional jobs. Kathy begins working as a nurse where donations are made, and Ruth's relationship with Tommy evolves into a deep bitterness between the women. The three don't see each other for a while, until their donations begin and Ruth dies. Tommy reconciles with his childhood crush and ascertains whether there is any way to delay their inevitable separation.Scenery assumes a crucial role. Like Raise the Red Lantern, the three characters are nearly always within defined spaces. They are either in school, their living community (a cabin), or the hospital. Only near the end do we see them outside of these confined spaces perhaps surrounded by the lives they never got to finish. Kathy being the central tragic figure is the only one with full mobility outside these spaces. From what we learn of popular opinion regarding farmed people, any outside presence may disappear. It wastes resources.The movie is aided greatly by its simplicity. This is a human love story with spices of Shakespearian tragedy revealed slowly. Viewers need to pay attention to comprehend it. The drama is made meaningful by its focus on the character's themselves. Nothing is contrived about the picture because it ignores a melodramatic ""great escape"" setup and it doesn't create a fantasy world much different from our own. What we get is instead a serious film about people forced to deal with an unfortunate issue.Key term, people. Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy all behave like real humans would. Ruth selfishly destroys the relationship between her two friends because she's an inexperienced person. She later regrets acting poorly and makes amends, even though they will have little impact. Kathy and Tommy can never be together because of a human development, and their separation is furthered by another human development. People aren't commodities even if their bodies are.Recommended",Never Let Me Go

58,samkan,Most Moving,10,4 July 2011,"This movie is neither a science fiction piece nor a examination of medicine's ethical issues. It is not even a LITTLE BIT of either. The film is allegorical and functions as an examination of full lives; i.e., our lives, and the compromises, guilt, regrets, misconceptions and loss we develop over time. The finer points of the film were neither judgmental nor condemning. The fact that the vehicle used was a somewhat contemporary setting seems, based on many reviews herein, to have misled many. Forgiveness should be granted as the predominant plot line; i.e., organ donation, cloning, etc., are topical and polarizing.If I have to spell it out : NEVER LET ME GO is about life condensed into a plot structure that allows our tragedies (see the above-mentioned list) to be concisely depicted, discussed, etc. NLMG is intriguing because; e.g., the virtues of sacrifice, true love and patience can be overtly contrasted with the guilt, regret, confusion, etc., we may experience later in life. Needless to say, our apprehension of death and the need to repent, make- good, spend our time well, etc., are at the forefront.These merits were wonderfully done with minimal story background and intrusion of the real world. One of the most moving and tragic devices in NLMG is Tommy's naive -and totally wrong- guess as to what we must do to distinguish ourselves and the extent to which other people may ""see us"". Indeed, many -probably most- of us die misconstruing what we've accomplished and the true value of our deeds (or lack of such). Very noteworthy is the guilt both female characters carry -and accept- regarding their imagined backgrounds, extraordinarily impacting on their existence and forming a basis for both to go gently into their respective goodnights. I know I'll sound like a snob to many who read this. I'm not. I'm just old. If I'd seen NLMG in my 30's, or even my 40's, I might not have picked up on what this film was trying to do. I'd recommend to many to watch this film again 30 or 40 years from now.",Never Let Me Go
59,sergepesic,"Creepy, Uncomfortable",8,16 March 2014,"Beautiful adorned mansion, filled with stuffy old-time teachers and surprisingly well behaved children. Clear, young voices joyfully singing school hymn, and just a little gentle ribbing and bullying among kids. That is the beginning of this creepy and uncomfortable movie based on the celebrated dystopian novel by Kazuo Ishiguro. In some parallel world these children are being bred for organ donations. To die prematurely that some strangers ( of course with a lot of money), can live. The movie moves from 1978 to 1994 following three of these doomed characters. What makes this bleak story so frightening is that everything else around them seems so normal, so British. Same subdued emotions, stilted social skills, prim and grim propriety. Just the same old world we inhabit in which some people lives and well beings don't matter. When you put it that way, not much different or more creepy than our planet, perhaps a bit more indirect and devious.",Never Let Me Go
60,brenttraft,Almost Perfect Adaptation,10,10 October 2010,"""Never Let Me Go,"" is an almost perfect adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's novel but it is going to have a hard time finding an audience because it is slow, sad, and depressing.I had finished the book 2 weeks before I saw the movie, so the story was fresh in my mind. I think that it really helps to read the book first because it fills in a lot of the gaps that are missing in the movie.Even if you haven't read the book, the film is still worth seeing for the performances of Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield, and Keira Knightly.The only reason the film does not rate a perfect 10 is that in the scene where they are trying to get a ""deferral"" from Madame, they left out what is probably the most important part of the story. In that scene in the book, Madame explains to them that the boarding school they went to was paid for by donations and fund raising so that they could be brought up like normal people. Before that, the clones were brought up in concentration camps and treated inhumanly. The whole point of that scene was that Madame and a few others were willing to make great sacrifices because they believed the clones had all the same rights and sentience as all other humans, while the rest of the world thought of them as livestock that were being bred for consumption.Even though that scene was left out of the film, the final line in the film alludes to the same message and it is a real tearjerker. Don't be fooled into thinking ""Never Let Me Go"" is a science fiction movie. It is not. It is a human drama with a science fiction premise. This is not like ""Logan's Run"" and it really does not go into the details of the science behind the premise. It is a sad and melancholy story about the human condition. If you go into it knowing what to expect, it is highly recommended.",Never Let Me Go
61,come2whereimfrom,Wallpaper movie,5,8 February 2011,"Based on the Kazuo Ishiguro novel and adapted for the screen by Alex Garland 'Never Let Me Go' is strangely meditive film. Told in three parts it follows the lives of Ruth, Kathy and Tommy as they grow from boarding school children into young adults, the film touches on love, life and loss against a very peculiar backdrop. Unfortunately it is so tepid in its portrayal I can only think of one word to describe it and that's plain. The film set against the idyllic English countryside is all tweed and apprehension as it unravels to its dreary conclusion. I don't want to put a complete dampener on it because I didn't hate the film I just didn't like it much either, it kind of existed in a space between, which sometimes I think is worse. Knightly still has a mouth full of plums, Garfield is just gormless and Mulligan seems to be an old lady trapped in a young girl's body. The film flits back and forth between the trying to be poignant and the simply bizarre, I can't say too much without spoiling the story so I won't bother. Although an interesting idea, stretched out over two dull hours it will drag for some and others just won't be able to bring themselves to care enough about it to form an opinion. Shame really but at least it's just a story.",Never Let Me Go
62,yris2002,harrowing and thoughtprovoking,8,28 March 2011,"After an uncertain beginning, that set in the English boarding school, perceivable as odd and surreal, as the scene moves to the cottages, the story gets more involving. There is a crescendo of intensity and depth while the story proceeds and the protagonists grow up, till the most recent events, when the movie gets truly emotionally gripping and leaves the viewer astonished and deeply moved. If I were told that the plot exploits an alternative contemporary reality, where some children are cloned and raised in order to give their organs to eradicate incurable illnesses, I would have probably classified the movie as a science-fiction and probably put it aside. On the contrary, the movie, based on the novel by Kazou Ishiguro, results extremely thoughtprovoking, in the way the unlikely plot offers many hints to reflect, upon love, time and life. Reflections upon the infinite possibilities of life, upon how our life could have been only if...., but in the end a final, typical Japanese (and the terrible recent events in Japan have proved this quite clearly) acceptance, not resigned but stoic and aware acceptance, of our reality, however absurd and incomprehensible it may sound. Reflections about love, about never lived relationships, that paradoxically remained perfect because unlived. Reflections about time, the quality of time, while men strive to live longer and healthier, and all end their lives with a sense of not having lived enough. All these thoughts emerge through short dialogues, long silences, an emotionally intense music, a wonderful photography of a melancholy England, a perfect and delicate direction. And the cast undoubtedly leaves the mark.Carey Mulligan as Cathy and Andrew Garfiled as Tommy get in the end to become the prototypes of true human beings, Keira Knightley as the tormented Ruth offers another highly talented performance. All the three protagonists are in the end capable of moving some very deep chords inside. You may like or not the movie, but you cannot remain indifferent or untouched.",Never Let Me Go
63,kijii,Enter an alternative dystopian world that will make you think -- and even feel,8,6 November 2016,"This slow-moving, but provocative, story brings together a great cast of British actors: Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield, Keira Knightley, and Charlotte Rampling, to name a few. The movie presents a late 20th century science fiction drama about an alternative dystopian world that starts with the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1952. (The first successful human kidney transplant took place in 1954.) First, I should say that I had never read the book on which this movie is based. Therefore, everything that I am describing is a result of seeing this movie and how its story unfolds to me from that source only. I found this story about Kathy (Carey Mulligan), Tommy (Andrew Garfield) and Ruth (Keira Knightley) to be engrossing and captivatingly conveyed. The movie is narrated by 28-year-old Kathy, in retrospect, in which she tells us that she has been a ""carer"" for 9 years and that she believes that both ""carers"" and ""donors,"" have made important contributions. She now spends her time looking backward to her memories: at Hailsham, at the Cottages, and afterwards. The movie (and her memories) is divided into these three sections of her life. Hailsham is an English boarding school for children of elementary school age (scenes from the 4th grade are shown in the movie?). We see the children playing, learning, and at assembly, where their head mistress, Miss Emily (Charlotte Rampling) makes daily announcements. We never see nor hear about parents or visitors from outside Hailsham. Miss Lucy (Sally Hawkins) is a new teacher at the school and notices that the kids don't leave the school's boundaries. When she asks why, Kathy tells her of all the gruesome stories she has heard about children that have left its boundaries, so no one would think of doing it. Miss Lucy then does some role playing with the children and later tells them that none of them would live past middle age and generally why. She soon leaves the school. At one assembly, Miss Emily tells them that there will be a ""bumper crop"" delivery of goods for those children who have carefully saved up their tokens (pieces of plastic ""coins"" in various colors which seem to have been earned by the children at the school). When the goods are delivered, they seem like trash from a dump to us, but they are valuable to the children: Tommy uses his tokens for a gift to Kathy. His gift is a romantic tape by Judy Bridgewater with the song, ""Never Let me go"" on it. The song makes Kathy feel romantic. When the children reach the age of 18, they are transferred to The Cottages where they will meet other young people from other schools around England. At the Cottages, while watching TV, they notice that kids, from other schools, behave differently than themselves (more advanced usually). Ruth and Tommy start imitating language and behavior from TV and things they see other kids do. Kathy starts to get jealous of Ruth because she just sees Ruth imitating others rather than showing true feelings. While at the Cottages, they can go about town and do more things, but they find they don't have some of the same social skills as other kids. (Since the movie does unfold gradually, I feel that going on with more description here may just reveal SPOILERS and that would defeat the reason for the review.) I can only say that this movie does make you stop and question many things, from bioethics to existentialism to the question of what, essentially, makes us HUMAN. The questions aren't always answered but they are posed, loudly and clearly, for anyone who wants to take the voyage presented in the movie (or book).",Never Let Me Go
64,Eternality,"In short, Never Let Me Go is a beautifully-shot film but it is never a wholesome experience.",7,7 March 2011,"To tell you the truth, I don't know what to make of the film adaptation of Never Let Me Go, an acclaimed novel by Kazuo Ishiguro that deals with the friendship and romance of three children who grow up to be adults only to be torn apart by a crushing reality. The film is at times meditative, at times languid, but it is always meandering, looking for meaning, but whatever meaning it has found does not appear to shine any light on the countless themes the film is trying to explore.Mark Romanek, who is much more prolific as a music video director than as an orthodox filmmaker, has only three film credits to his name, including Never Let Me Go. But judging from his work in One Hour Photo (2002) and in this film, he has quite a flair for creating a dense sense of mood. In the former, he manages to bring out a feeling of unease that slowly becomes creepy. In his latest work, he drenches nearly every scene with an unmistakable sense of melancholic longing.In a way, the film's cinematography is almost tragically poetic, as the camera captures the chilly breeze that ruffles the actors' hair and the perpetual gray sky above them with a sort of detached understanding that reflects an outlook that is clearly fatalistic. After all, the story is anything but optimistic. The major theme of Never Let Me Go is that of selfishness as the film explores the self-seeking attitudes of human character, and its consequences.Kathy (Carey Mulligan), Ruth (Keira Knightly), and Tommy (Andrew Garfield) are the three central characters in the film. Both Kathy and Ruth are fond of Tommy, but it is Ruth who gets the carrot end of the deal. She has a relationship with Tommy for most parts of her youth, even though she knows Kathy would be a better partner for him. But does love amount to anything for anyone whose life's fate is all but sealed?Born into a world where a selected few are groomed from child to adult so that their organs could be ""donated"" to other people, these three characters are that selected few, and while they experience the richness that life has to offer, it is clearly short-lived. The performances by Mulligan and Knightly are adequate but Garfield's seems shallow by comparison. His presence seems to render the general performance of the leading cast uneven.However, it is Alex Garland's (28 Days Later, 2002; Sunshine, 2007) script that lets the film down the most. Emotionally distant, it not only shows little interest in exploring the psyche of the characters, but also in fleshing out the motivation for the romance between Ruth and Tommy, opting for a more detached perspective that unfortunately loses sight of what matters most to viewers in these kinds of bleak, solemn pictures – the emotional connection to the characters. In short, Never Let Me Go is a beautifully-shot film but it is never a wholesome experience.GRADE: C+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",Never Let Me Go
65,eshwarmail,"Though artistic and well performed, this one required a lot more life to save the characters",5,9 January 2017,"Reviewed March 2012It comes across to me as a highly toned down and sensitive version of The Island. But the only problem here is that there is no plot building as it leaves nothing for the viewer to expect after a little while into the movie. The entire movie feels like one long dragging scene. Young versions of Ruth (Keira Knihtley) and Kathy (Carey Mulligan) are friends and classmates in a special boarding school which takes care of students who will grow up to be organ donors. Tommy (Andrew Garfield) is another student who is always picked on for his temper and slow mind. Kathy develops a soft spot for Tommy and becomes friends with him but Ruth being jealous of their connection barges in and gets Tommy under her whim. They grow and grow apart where Kathy becomes a carer for donors. She meets Ruth after 10 years during her regular job by when Ruth has finished 2 donations and in a bad shape. She comes to know that Tommy and Ruth are no longer together and goes to find Tommy. In the film's first scene they show how it is going to end. So it is one slow long wait for it to get formally completed. It features a visually excellent backdrop and the cast does a tremendous job portraying their characters. A single thread background music keeps repeating occasionally and it is quite good. The main culprit is the screenplay as it never builds up to anything and there is only so much one can emote with the characters singular problem. Though artistic and well performed, this one required a lot more life to save the characters.",Never Let Me Go
66,Ryan_MYeah,"Never Let Me Go is, in my eyes, an elegant and heartbreaking movie, but it's not for everyone.",9,15 December 2010,"Recently I got a chance to see Never Let Me Go, a film based on the acclaimed novel by Kazuo Ishiguro.I ask those who read my review to take it with a grain of salt, as the film is sharply divisive between love and hate. Those who love it say it's emotionally devastating, those who don't find emotion to be lacked. But from my point of view, I find it to be an elegant feature.Carey Mulligan stars as Kathy, a passionate young girl who is in a complicated love triangle that also includes Tommy (Played by Andrew Garfield), the not so secret love of Kathy's life, and Ruth (Played by Keira Knightley), a jealous woman who stole Tommy while the three of them were attending a mysterious boarding school known as Hailsham, where all students are bred for a specific purpose explained to us at the end of the first act.Alex Garland, the writer of films such as 28 Days Later, may not have been the most obvious choice to pen the script, but since seeing the film, I understand why. It may come across as a melodramatic romance, but at Never Let Me Go's core is an enigmatic Science-Fiction, make no mistake about that. Even if you don't find the passion to be translated effectively on screen, you can tell it was there on paper. The result is a captivating feature leading to a finale that, as far as emotions go, is heartbreaking to behold, but it wasn't overwhelmingly tragic.I also admired the performances. Not just from Andrew Garfield's fine performance as Tommy, not just for Charlotte Rampling, Sally Hawkins and Nathalie Richard making great use of their small roles, or even Keira Knightley's exceptional, and gripping performance as Ruth, the true driving force is Carey Mulligan. The Handling of her character is perfect, made even more so by her gentle performance of quiet passion.It's also a beautifully shot feature, sporting lovely cinematography by Adam Kimmel, as well as a lovely score by Rachel Portman. Although at times her score feels a little intrusive to the more quiet nature of the visuals, her strings score captures a strong essence of each character's emotional state.Like I said, take a huge grain of salt in regard to Never let Me Go, which I give ***1/2 out of ****",Never Let Me Go

To look deeper, it reveals a coming of age tale that is horrific as it is gripping. A film whose power is not in what is on its surface, but in the ideas and themes it suggests by offering a heartbreaking portrait of beings whose humanity is at odds with their purpose.

68,karlericsson,an outrage nobody seems to react on,7,28 September 2015,"Although it is spelled out quite definitely nobody óf the reviewers I've read on these pages (I haven't read all) seems to react on the outrage of involuntary organ donation. For me, this Movie is a very strong statement against all organ donation and, up to a Point, I fully agree. If I am to donate an organ of mine, which is just about all I have to give, I sure want to know who the receiver is and that my organ does not go to a rich guy whom I despise, for instance. Now, the probability that my organ would go to a decent poor guy is just about Nada in present society and so I'm against all donations of organs since I do not want to support evil. This Movie shows how decent people are fed upon by swines. It does so most vividly and I cannot understand how you could miss this most important thing about the film. Somebody commented that the film was bad because it did not explain why the dona-tors complied with their fate and the remark is correct but personally I just imagined that the donors were all loaded with microchips and could not run away without easily being caught. It's not in the film, I know, but it could have been and I allow for that. I can see the receivers not receiving organs and instead a final treatment with the guillotine but I accept that this isn't in the Movie either.",Never Let Me Go

The film follows the short lived lives of several of them from childhood up, in the most lifeless and dragged out fashion imaginable. There isn't much of a story here, in between the excruciatingly overacted drama and ponderous thought provoking (the term is used loosely here) clichés, that is. The premise is asinine (Do they transplant brains too? Can't they just create soulless bodies and put them in stasis until such time an organ is needed or something to that effect) and the execution vapid and nonsensical. Any interesting ground that could have been explored, was conveniently reduced to a heap of hopelessly boring platitudes about inter human connections and done to death ethics involving human cloning.

70,RockPortReview,Brilliant Young Actors. Overlooked Film.,7,3 April 2012,"Starring three of the best young British actors working today ""Never Let Me Go"" is a story of doomed love and ponders deep questions about science and life itself. It is based on the best selling book by Kazou Ishiguro, who also wrote ""Remains of the Day"" which was turned into a movie starring Anthony Hopkins.Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley are three seemingly average kids who grow up together in a boarding school called Hailsham. They are never able to leave the premises and live under the strict rules of Miss Emily and her staff. Something always seems just a bit off and strange about the kids of Hailsham. They wear bracelets that they have to scan in when ever they go back to their dorm rooms. Their bodies are carefully maintained and routinely checked for defects or contaminates. The arts are extremely important and every student needs to submit their work for a chance to be included in Miss Emily's Gallery. When Miss Lucy, a young compassionate teacher, tells her class who they really are and what their life's purpose is she is immediately fired. The students of Hailsham are clones raised only so they can donate they organs. They only live to their early twenties until they are required to start their donations until they ""complete"".We follow Kathy (Mulligan), Tommy and Ruth (Knightly) as they grow up and a love triangle develops. Ruth is jealous of Kathy and steals Tommy away from her. As teenagers they are moved to a compound called ""The Cottages"" a sort of self contained town. Although they do have the opportunity to venture out on occasion they still have to were their bracelets and are heavily accounted for. Feeling lonesome and unwanted Kathy applies to be a ""carer"", someone who takes care of another clone as they make their donations. She is also able to put off her own donations for a little while. After almost 10 years apart the group finally gets back together and not a moment to soon. Ruth and Tommy have already made two donations and are looking pretty rough. Ruth apologizes for what she has done to her over the years. Kathy and Tommy start bonding and their love is rekindled. Their is a rumor that if two people could prove their love was true that they could defer their donations for a couple of years. It turns out to be nothing but a rumor.""Never Let Me Go"" conjures up many of the deepest questions out there about fate, the existence of the soul, the ethics of cloning and the human spirit. This is all dealt with rather lightly and mainly focuses on the love triangle, and the eventual race for Kathy and Tommy to hold on to their love and lives. If this story was put in the hands of a director like Terrence Malick, we would probably have an instant classic. Although director Mark Romanek, who usually directs music videos, does do a decent job here. The acting is superb as well as the supporting cast. Charlotte Rampling as Miss Emily is perfect. Near the end we learn from her that the purpose of their art was to show Miss Emily that they had a soul. This movie is available on DVD and Blu-ray, but I would also recommend reading the book.",Never Let Me Go
71,perkypops,The depressing subject matter hides such wonderful optimism,10,23 January 2012,"This film attempts a seemingly impossible feat which is to turn a story the lives of young people born and bred to support their ""clones"" with donations of their vital organs into a feast of optimism about what our lives are really about. Through some compelling performances by a young cast and able support from older hands we are cast under the spell of what love really is, through both its unconditional and conditional themes.The screenplay is like a poem told in pictures, gentle in one verse, but more tense in the next, before allowing us to sink snugly into its deeply meaningful and optimistic revelations of what life means. It never turns sickly sweet or bitterly sour because the leading roles are too deep to allow that to happen. And there is the sumptuous warmth of the main characters to keep us from the cold snap of the underlying truth of donor breeding.The joys of these young people have to be simple because they have nowhere else to seek alternatives. And because they are simple they absorb our inner fears about never having enough in our lives. They demonstrate that when you touch something precious it may only ever be for a moment, and no matter how long a life is it cannot ever get any better than that.It may not be a commercial success because of this depth of thought about our depressing engagement with longevity or quantity as more important than short term quality. It is beautifully made and a wonderful piece of cinema which I, for one, will not forget.I thank all concerned for making me feel what they wanted me to feel and for giving me a glimpse of the truly wonderful gift we are given when we visit a cinema where this film is playing.Ten out of ten does not begin to do it justice.",Never Let Me Go
72,huh_oh_i_c,A beautiful allegory for present day America (please don't call this sci-fi),10,9 August 2011,"With a movie like this, the easy thing to remark is that it's all so unlikely because ""we, as a society"" would never do that to people! Unthinkable! Right?Wrong. We can be indignant about the societal injustice displayed here, but this story should be seen as allegorical towards that other hugely harsh society: capitalist America. Just like the film, America largely doesn't give a flying F... about it's underclass. Just like the film, Americans will gladly sacrifice whoever (Iraqis, Palestinians) or whatever (the environment) just as long as they can drive SUV's and eat burgers and fat fries. Up to a point this goes for the entire West, but the situation is much more dire in America, where apparently huge masses of people think it's completely normal that the rich don't pay their fair share in societal cost, taxes are evil (except when they're used to kill people) when directed towards health care, schooling etc. Indeed, one could make a good case that the society in 'Never let me go' is much more benign than present day robber baron capitalist America.We could also ask ""why aren't the clones revolting like mad?"". That is as useless a question as why the white poor underclass isn't revolting in America. They don't revolt because they've been sold a lie, they drank the Kool-Aid, they believe lies like ""Big Corp Will Save Us All"", ""Government is the ultimate evil"" (but still want to run it, odd...), ""the poor are poor cos so they're lazy"" (that one has been told since ... the 1263 A.D). Just like Kathy H. believes that they, the meatbags, and the receivers lead equal lives. What a crock of s...!And there are a few, like Miss Lucy in the film and Bernie Sanders et al. in real life, who are protesting and pointing out the madness. But most of us are numbed and too tired to fight the system.This film is very beautifully made, the acting is all superb, even from the children, but the greatest value of this film lies in the mirror it holds up to us: There are forces in society which sacrifice the weak and the poor without much thought, indeed with great indifference.10/10 The Melancholic Alcoholic.",Never Let Me Go
73,headly66,Here's a clue - just leave and you won't have to die.,3,31 December 2010,"Despite some good acting, good film making and good direction the plot of this depressing film is so confusing and silly it's really hard to get into it. The confusion starts with the date of the movie,1978. I guess we are supposed to believe that for years there have been boarding schools where children are raised for one purpose, to donate organs to some other people we never learn about in order to keep those people alive instead of these people. More confusion starts when we realize the kids are being lied to about their real destiny then a new teacher is hired who tells them the truth one day and is summarily fired the next for outing the school, but the kids don't cry or complain at all. I don't know about you but if I were told at age ten that I wasn't going to have no future and was just an organ donor who was destined to die young I think I might be a bit upset. Why this teacher from the outside was hired to begin with is also beyond me. And it seems easy enough for the kids to run away but no one even tries.It gets even sillier as they grow, a whole 3 way romance thing is going on which isn't very interesting and then we discover they can come and go as they please, they even have cars to use. There is this whole mentality presented that the kids, now 20 somethings all really want to die as donors, but then all they do is talk about not wanting to die or something. At any point any of them could have taken off and disappeared. Is there anyone to stop them? Who knows, all we see is that they have wrist bands and have to beep in to a monitor when coming home. You would think someone would at least try to escape, what's the worst that can happen?

This is possible because the state has grown millions of human clones whose organs are harvested when they reach their 20s. If a normal person gets cancer or loses a leg or eye in a car crash, the state goes thru its genetic database for the clones and finds a good match to donate the needed organ. After 3 or 4 donations, the clone has lost too much and ""complete"" meaning die.The clones are treated well in their short lives and given a good education and lead physically active lives. That may seem a waste of money but the state believes a healthy happy clone provides the best organs.The movie follows three clones from the age of 10 to their late 20s. Two young women and the young man they both love. Like all the clones, they are rather placid about their lot in life and don't object as much as one would expect. Towards the end of the movie two of the clones get the nerve to ask about the ethics of this program and are bluntly told ""If you ask the public to return to the dark ages, to lung cancer and breast cancer and motor-neuron diseases, they will simply say no.""

The characters become so familiar and close to heart yet feel so far. Usually this type of emotional hype is seldom seeing in science fictions. Science fictions are mostly technology driven and they have less space for a truly close to reality plot or beautiful performances. But 'Never Let Me Go' is one of those wonderful pieces of science fiction which will make you forget that you are watching something which is almost not true but still cannot imagine that it's not.The story starts to takes place in 1970's in England in an orphanage. At least it looks that way at the beginning. Just like any orphanage there are rules, regulations and procedures to follow. The plot mainly concentrates on 3 children who live there; Kathy, Tommy and Ruth who are friends. When their age starts to blossom Kathy and Tommy starts to build up a relationship. At least that's what they feel like but with the sudden intrusion of Ruth, Kathy falls back in Tommy's life.In the mean time they realize their true meaning of existence which is that they are born and raised in order to harvest organs. Not knowing anything about the free world or any other form of life all they want to become good donors as they are trained and to be. All they know is that their life is short and soon they have to leave this place and start donating their organs until they are not usable any more. While Kathy becomes a carer who is a voluntary line of work which gets her some time before she starts donating, Tommy and Ruth all goes separate ways in their lives. But things start to change for them as adults when they finally meet again after years under very strange circumstances. For them love seems to be more important now than never but bound by regulations Kathy and Tommy struggles to find a way out.What's really great about this love story is that it's different than any other I have seeing. With the wonderful performances of Carey Mulligan (Kathy), Andrew Garfield (Tommy) and Keira Knightley (Ruth) within a script with fewer words and more of emotionally driven acting, 'Never Let Me Go' is a very closely felt movie. Even though the movie is not labeled as a sci-fi in my point of view it perfectly fits there.

The children we see have only one purpose...they are spare parts for others.
And even the little hope that they could request an extension is a lie.
You may think that this only a science fiction story....well think again and read about the big buisness with illegal organ trafficking....illegal but every major

78,iantrader,Ultimately unsatisfying,4,17 May 2018,"This is dystopian sf without any sf trappings set, perhaps, in an alternative universe. It's dark, you may want to watch it but if you do, be warned, it's not always easy viewing, either for the emotional content or the story gaps.The 'reveal' is revealed within the first 15-20 minutes but the chances are you might pick up on it earlier.It's not totally original. Check out The Island and if you want to go further back, 1979's Parts: The Clonus Horror.It's based on the book by Kazuo Ishiguro and screenplayed by the usually-brilliant Alex Garland. If you want to delve into the antecedants, Michael Marshall Smith wrote a novel in 1996 called Spares.Given its heritage and gravitas, it seems like sacrilege to criticise this movie but my main doubts occurred early on with the characters' total acceptance of their situation (compare and contrast with The Island) and where the whole world accepts the moral and ethical compass and fortitude shown by their teachers and society. They're free to run around in the world but they have no idea what's going on.It's a big question which the plot studiously avoids.But if you accept it, as do the players, and follow the characters then you'll have an interesting, human, and perhaps even soul-searching journey. Unfortunately, I couldn't ignore this massive plot gap so much of the emotional drama of the situation was lost.Maybe the novel was more profound.

The movie's description itself, looks pretty interesting, so I was saving this movie for one of the last films that I'd watch. Sad to say, I was pretty disappointed.The parts that I liked the most were when the characters were young and still in school. I liked the budding romance between Kathy and Tommy, even though it was never really expounded on. I also don't get why Tommy went with Ruth with no second thought, even if it seemed like he and Kathy were going somewhere.I didn't get this movie. I know something about donating and there was a time where they were talking about Originals, so I figured they were copies or clones. But I never understood why.Weak plot. I didn't even feel that much sympathy for Tommy and Kathy when they didn't get their deferrals. I don't even know what deferrals do!

82,AZINDN,Disquieting and Unresolved,9,8 December 2011,"A film that is at its heart so sad and bleak, Never Let Me Go provides a haunting reality that remains with one after the credits roll. Tommy (Andrew Garfield), Kathy, and Ruth grew up together in a school which raised humans for transplantation of vital organs when they entered young adulthood. Set in the ahistorical now, the trio grows up and apart, all the while engaged within a non-eventful world of existing to donate and ""complete."" Kathy (Carrie Mulligan) joins the ranks of the ""carers,"" the responsible adult who awaits the return of the donor from surgical extraction of some body part, and tries to ease their transition to their inevitable end. After ten years, she again is reunited with Ruth (Kiera Knightly), who has not demonstrated the kind of heartiness the system would like in donors, and is likely to succumb with her next extraction. Together, Ruth and Kathy find Tommy who still remains the love interest of Kathy, and who Ruth had intentionally tried to separate as a precocious teen. Now, in her waning time, she apologizes to the couple for stepping into their true love relations many years past. Reconncilled and resolute to her finality, Ruth's death on the operating table is both gruesome and devoid of any heroic measures. She flatlines and is disposed.Never Let Me Go is unsettling in its quiet storyline that is both horrific and accepting of science and a society that regulated organ transplantation. Growing beings as future resources for medical reasons is an ethical dilemma which modern society addresses with moralizing religious rhetoric, but in this film, that emotionalism is thankfully absented. The only question that is asked is whether the Hallsham students possessed a ""soul"" that could be detected in the children's art. Yet this point is never fully explained until well into the film which adds to the richness of the storyline. To eliminate disease in society through the use of body parts becomes more than an ethical issue today, it is a moral quandary which Never Let Me Go puts forth with disquieting non-resolution. One quandary not discussed remains that of organ transplants for children. Were the youngest members of civilized society as depicted also served by farm-raised youngsters, or were only adults the recipients? Who were the carers for baby donors until their completion?A film that draws mature performances from the youthful cast, Mulligan and Knightly are excellent casting choices and put aside the physical beauty they are noted for to bringing a credibility and pathos to their performances. Andrew Garfield as Tommy is the sole male between the two women who he has loved since childhood. His is a role that is both restrained all the while sublimating the rage of his existence. This is a film that stands alone without necessitating a read of the novel, a format that is not necessary for appreciation of the work by a subtle director and aided by another beautiful musical score by Rachael Portman. Adult, small, and evocative, Never Let Me Go wraps itself around your conscience and draws its themes before the public with successful irritation.",Never Let Me Go
83,SeriousJest,A different spin on movies like The Island,6,7 April 2012,"This film takes a different spin on movies like The Island. Make no mistake, this is a chick flick, but it's done interestingly enough so that guys will enjoy it, too. Beware, it's often dark. It can also be a conversation starter about various deep topics, like morality, loss, redemption, guilt, love, happiness, sacrifice, acceptance, identity, death, science, ethics, resilience, art, friendship, hope, peace, and the human soul. To me, its message was, above all else, that we should use the precious little time that we have on Earth to pursue what we love most, and leave behind no regrets. The movie was heavily dependent on its actors' performances, and the entire cast was exceptional.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",Never Let Me Go
84,jburtroald95,Pretentious but truthful,7,11 April 2011,"Channelling the scholarly, restrained, sombre energy of Ninety Eighty- Four and all of its subsequent offspring, this purposefully wearisome analogy of humanity's progress is overall a very intriguing work of art, but doesn't offer the most rewarding cinematic experience. Set in an alternate mid-twentieth-century with enormous medical advances – ruthlessly exploitative developments, but ones in which it is believed that the the ends justify the means – the film centres on young schoolmates Kathy, Tommy and Ruthy who are among those that have been created and confined to serve as organ donors for the people of the outside world before dying at an age of less than forty years. The government appears to be cloning these people from lowlife criminals, people who won't be missed and therefore make the the practice more ethical. However, our trio were raised at Hellsham, the top boarding school for donors, and so rumour has it that they may stand a chance at delaying their donations if they can prove that they are genuinely in love with another. Upon hearing this Tommy and the two girls hope to apply, but first they must deal with a twisted love triangle that has long been present among them. The heart of the naiive but well-meaning Tommy has always truly belonged to the equally kind-hearted Kathy, but the sly Ruthy was much quicker off the mark and for years has managed to coax the boy away from Kathy with her feisty feminine charms.Like Orwell's aforementioned classic, the attention here is more on atmosphere and themes than it is on characters and plot; most of its merits lie with its delicate depiction of a world in which human greed and corruption has gone out of control. Perhaps a more intricate narrative is something that Kazuo Ishiguro's novel was able to do without, but its absence in this film adaptation results in the pacing and dramatic tension being rather lax, and this frequently makes the viewer feel impatient and lethargic. However, the cast does often manage to lend some substance and stimulation to these weaker weaker areas: recognition will of course go to Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley for portraying the three main characters for the bulk of the film, but due credit should also go to Izzy Meikle-Small, Charlie Rowe (The Golden Compass) and Ella Purnell who took care of the roles beautifully for the first half hour and provided the groundwork for the older actors; the performances of Charlotte Rampling as the school headmistress and Sally Hawkins as a teacher who takes pity on them are notable also. Unfortunately though, despite these efforts, the fine philosophical concepts is seriously weighed down by the flaws in their execution; therefore, in the moment of viewing of viewing Never Let Me Go feels like a slapdash wasteful stinker, but once it is over it leaves an audience member with plenty to think about and discuss. Although while it is a lost opportunity, it doesn't completely bungle darkness and solemnity like the atrocious 9 (2009) and the hopeless Winter's Bone (2010), and it is still worth seeing out of curiosity.",Never Let Me Go
85,charles000,"Maybe not for everyone, but time spent watching this is not wasted . . .",7,10 October 2015,"The concept of the story can be well appreciated, as it probes into one of the most vexing conundrums of medical and societal ethics ever attempted in modern times. However, there are various plot holes, which I won't delve into here, as such might provide unintentional spoilers. Other films, which are perhaps a bit more technically realistic and futuristic, have probed this same conundrum in their own context, and that may be the ultimate shortcoming of this production. Even now, medical science is progressing in directions which could eventually make this depicted scenario completely obsolete.Having said that, though, the caliber of acting and storytelling here is first rate. The focal point of this production is not on a sci-fi style of motif, but rather exploring the social complexities that this type of depicted scenario might create, and likely would create if something like this were ever to come to pass.As a character study of the human condition under extraordinary circumstances, this is a compelling enough production to hold almost anyone's attention. Everyone delivered their characters exceptionally well, but Carey Mulligan really shines here. As other reviewers have suggested, this may not be for everyone. No action scenes here, no glitzy sci-fi tech and all that, but as a compelling story remarkably well told and acted, the time spent watching this is not wasted.",Never Let Me Go
86,stermix501,"good filming, silly plot development",4,21 January 2013,"I was expecting a romantic movie. in the 1st part it had everything to become one. The pictures of the country side and school were appealing and feelings were slowly developing between the characters. Those kids' acting was really touching and great and this institution based on lies was seeming deserving nothing more than being closed down. And then there was this 2nd part of the movie which didn't make any sense at all. A new teacher explains to the kids they will be forced to be organ donors. This teacher disappears without giving us a hint of whether she was sent away for being frank to the kids or whether she felt disgusted or anything. Another matter that is not clear, is whether they were clones or simply orphans. It is also not clear, how the protagonist could have a driving license and driving insurance without having a complete surname. Leaving things unclear in a movie sometimes can be good, but sometimes it seems like an easy solution to escape from the plot's weaknesses. What a disappointment, so, to see that we just have to see a version of The Island (with Ewan McGregor, Sc.Johansson), but instead, those characters' instinct of self-preservation is limited to go ask for a few years delay while accepting to remain in some hospital waiting the inevitable. I wouldn't expect to shoot everyone or make huge explosions like in The Island, but at least they could try to fight for their rights via the legal system or to try to escape in another country etc. I don't care if the end would be dramatic or not, but not silly like what it was.

87,eastbergholt2002,Sad and depressing,6,26 September 2010,"Never Let Me Go is a dystopian tale set in 1980s Britain, in what seems like a parallel universe. Cloning has somehow enabled the human race to live longer and the film focuses on the lives of three clones. They have been created so that they could provide their internal organs to ""real"" humans once they reach their twenties. It is a sad and depressing story. The moral seems to be that clones also have rights. If you are looking for fun and escapism you won't find it here. It isn't really explained how transplanting organs would extend human life. How would receiving a new kidney or liver enable the average person to live to over a 100? The film is well acted and you feel sorry for the characters. However the clones do not seem very bright. They are gullible, naive and behave like sheep. What I found implausible was that they would just accept their fate without challenge or complaint like battery farm animals. If they were really human they would do anything to survive. The clones live a dreary life in a country which looks very drab. The film only has one gear and moves at a snail's pace. If you are going to make a serious film with an unhappy ending, I feel you have a responsibility to deal with some of the real problems of our time. If you demoralize your audience it should be for a worthy cause. One of the roles of film is to enlighten and explain complex issues few of us fully understand. Human rights for clones is an issue that lacks relevance. It just seems like indulgent nonsense. I came out of the film badly in need of a drink. Watching this film wasn't an enjoyable experience.",Never Let Me Go
88,thomvic,Stunningly beautiful story that combines sadness and uplifting emotions all in one...,9,25 March 2011,"In a world where some people are desperately in need of organ transplants for their heart, lungs or kidneys it all seems such an unpleasant topic probably because we know that someone will be giving up a part of themselves. Does this mean that we aren't whole as a person because are missing that extra kidney? But some people do it for the good of another person whose lives sometimes depend on it.Now from first glance at this title, you would think this is a soppy romantic melodrama with the usual ingredients. Boy meets girl, another girl is heartbroken, love triangle forms. I will tell you one thing; for those who have been consumed by Edward, Jacob and Bella's love fest, this isn't the movie for you. Why? Because while this is a movie essentially about young adults, it goes deeper than that. It talks about loneliness, the time spent together with an expiry date and also the search for normality in a situation of abnormality.The story is set in a time when scientists have discovered a new way of curing people who are in need of organ donations. They have created new life from original people and essentially made clones of these people to be reborn. We see Kathy (Carey Mulligan) who has grown up to be a carer of such patients as she reflects back on the past when her two best friends Tommy (Andrew Garfield) and Ruth (Keira Knightley) were back in boarding school in a special school called Hailsham. It looks like any normal school, where the kids all have sport activities, gossip like silly school girls and attend classes. Kathy, who takes a liking to Tommy, forms a friendship with him. Ruth, a girl who we see at first glance as somewhat of a girl we can't fully figure out, befriends the two. Here starts your love triangle.What we discover early on in the film, whereas in Kazuo Ishiguro's novel you slowly discover it halfway, is that these children are here for a special purpose. You probably guessed it from my opening. They will one day grow up to become organ donors until they are 'complete' which is a nicer way of saying to them that their lives are pretty much fulfilled and disappearing is not that big a deal. None of these kids will grow up to become actors, green grocers or anything other children can aspire to.The film is handled well and captures the essence and themes of the novel. This is a world where these students are treated almost as consumer goods, and the feelings of these individuals are ignored. Like Memoirs of a Geisha – girls who are practically taken from their families in order to be the entertainment of men, Never Let Me Go captures the feeling of loneliness and hopelessness a lot better than Memoirs, and is different in terms of story and subject matter and makes for a better film anyway. Perhaps because it doesn't get too lost in its surroundings and is fortunately more concerned about its own feelings.Perhaps a minor flaw is that it revealed the story's intentions too soon, but this is only minor since the audience is aware of this, but the characters are made aware slowly like in the novel. The music score I found quite soothing and melodramatic, fitting the scenes quite well.The stand out performance belongs to Kerry Mulligan who is able to capture the loneliness, longing and emotional depth that is needed in her character. Keira Knightley has certainly become a professional in dramatic in depth roles from Atonement, The Duchess and shows a lot of versatility in her characters. Andrew Garfield is just as equally brilliant in a sensitive role, and you could barely think this was him after seeing him in the Social Network as the mistrusting friend of Mark Zuckerberg.The cinematography is just beautiful and adds a sense of beautiful bleakness that is almost a representation of how we should value the things around us before we go. But the real heart of the film is its message; 'How do those who know there time will be up soon spend it?' Do we take it upon ourselves to be greedy in the face of adversity; do we want to complete our lives by spending it with those we love? How do we lead normal lives when we know we can't have one? I suppose the only choice for those is to treasure the limited time we have with each other, with the feeling of loss that you know will come in the end.Just as I had felt when I finished the novel, the film gave me the same feeling in the end. You start to think about those who do so much for others and yet are probably never recognised. Can our gratitude ever be extended to such people? We live in a world where we value celebrities and pop stars who give us entertainment but do they give us life? To live with choice and freedom of choice is something we probably take for granted. For those who are denied that privilege, one can only wonder how they feel when they have no choice except the only one given to them.If you are not moved by this film in some way, think about those who want a normal life and are confined to beds for at least seventeen or so hours a day, waiting for that good piece of news that a donor has arrived for them. How long however, do they have to wait?Final rating: 9.5/10",Never Let Me Go
89,Ladiloque,No SCI- all -FI and tears,3,21 September 2017,"Writing the 3-hundred-forty-something review on IMDb is not exactly a smart way to spend your evening but in this case I prefer spending the second half of the movie half criticizing and half watching this unbearable tragedy. I will not even talk about the director: he's a music video guy. He does his job well with imagery, music and expressive actors. Production value is good. Let's talk about the screenplay: the writer Alex Garland.The first of Garland's movies I watched was Sunshine and I liked it. Its dark atmosphere and sense of impending doom felt great. I hardly suspended my disbelief on the major premise (restarting an extinguishing sun) but naivety makes your life easier in most circumstances and I don't feel guilty in this case.Then I watched Dredd and... not bad but let's pass on this genre.Then came Ex Machina. I hated it at first: how can you stand such cheap sci-fi pretending it's 1984... I have to admit that some aspects were more subtle than I initially thought but overall it's far from a great script (let alone a great movie).Then this mindless tragedy received with awe and admiration... There's a whole lot of genres - especially for TV productions - focused on showing the most unbearable forms of idiocy, sorrow, injustice and helplessness. Evidently a lot of people love this. While I find it interesting from a psychological (and sociological) perspective I'm not (such) a masochist: being unable to believe to ""Never let me go""' 's main premises, this movie represents only a parade of heart-breaking and tear-jerking stimulating moments. Even accepting the premises, I find nothing more than that: if not the delusion that you suffer for ""some reason"". Of all the holocaust, native slaughters, slavery, helpless bullying movies I've seen, few felt as gratuitously painful as this one.Garland's artistic ambition and reputation (well, you need to pay the bills... but then don't complain if you get bashed...) will finally culminate in the coming ""Halo"" (from the video game) and ""Annihilation"" (where ""the laws of nature don't apply""...). Seen in the perspective of the writer's resume, I guess it's safe to say that this movie is bad. If you want to watch it I suggest you give some euthanized pets videos on youtube a try first.",Never Let Me Go
90,ihrtfilms,Beautiful and tragic story,8,6 April 2011,"Kathy, Tommy and Ruth spend their childhood in a boarding school, but this is no ordinary school and nor are they ordinary children. As they learn from a new teacher who feels it important they learn who they are, they are donor children conceived specifically to provide organ donations to the general population. Among the shock of this notion a bond forms between Tommy and Ruth, one that Kathy seems to dislike, but as the trio grow up and are moved to a middle house before they start their donations she lets the relationship continue. Kathy becomes a caretaker, someone who looks after the donors until they have completed (died) and it's during this time Kathy has an opportunity to have the relationship with Tommy she's longed for and if rumours are true possibly have a chance to live as a normal couple for some time.Based on the best selling book, this is a very intriguing story; it is set in the 70/80's in what is a alternate history to what we live in. The very notion that people are bred simply to provide organ donations makes for a very uneasy prospect and by the time they start to donate, it made me feel quite sick, the thought that you may donate two, three or more times, each time getting sicker and weaker. But it's also tragic that these people's lives have been already chosen and that there is no way out. The film works well really splitting it into two eras, with our trio of characters introduced to us as children and then young adults, we almost grow up with them which makes the outcomes even more the difficult.With it's wonderful recreation of the era, filmed with muted tones the film looks wonderful and performances from the young cast are excellent for the most part; I seriously dislike Keira Knightly - that mouth is annoying to watch, but this is not her film, it's Carey Mulligan and in this she is superb, playing the reserved Kathy. Sally Hawkins and Charlotte Rampling also have small but pivotal roles. The film falters a little because it doesn't explore the donation idea enough for the audience to understand, whilst there are hints that each donor has a 'double', it's left very ambiguous and the film never strays very far from our trio and their direct involvement.However this is startling effective, beautifully made film that is ultimately very tragic and at times very moving and is enough to give me the urge to read the book.More of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com",Never Let Me Go

What were they all thinking?
Depressing not because of the dystopian themes it pretends to explore but because of its completely botched cinematic execution.
Cloned or IVF babies raised to provide spare body parts for transplantation and everyone accepting this status quo as the most natural thing in the world?
Nah, just nah!
Nothing in this sorry affair gels, nothing inspires, nothing transpires. I watched in morbid curiosity to the end to see if the tone might change direction. Yeah, right! As flat as the constant grey drizzled landscape of this fictional dystopia. Suspiciously looking like somewhere in rural UK.
There's zilch psychological motivation or development.
And the voice over. OMG the idea that endless voiceover can somehow compensate for the total lack of cinematic and visual language.
Knightley is her usual annoying self, but the luminous Mulligan and Garfield have been deceived by the grown ups into accepting roles that are one dimensional. What a waste of talent for these two extraordinary young actors.
There's a single lesson in all this mess: if you're someone like Ishiguro, who writes cerebral novels do try to resist the temptation to have your stuff ""adapted"" for the screen all the time.

It's something we don't often realize since it's seemingly so far ahead in our lives, but we all face it at some point (unexpected or not). Kathy and Tommy have a special connection. One that takes time to nurture, to grow, to fully feel. They've been deemed lowly by a selfish society. But despite their shortcomings and utter disregard from the rest of the world, they try.Our time remaining in this Universe is countable. That's a jarring statement to some, but impetus to others. Kathy and Tommy had little time like all of us and struggled like we all do. But they tried. They tried to love and enjoy till the very end, and accepted life for what it had given them. Maybe the man who lives a 100 years is no better off than the boy that lives 10.

93,JRmf,A unique movie one will either love or hate,5,2 March 2018,"Beautifully shot and with a wonderful music score.. But as always, it's what the movie is about that matters. I didn't read the book, but one can only glean it is about clones who are bred to supply organs so the general population can live long and healthy lives. The story makes for interesting reading, will grab the attention and make the bestseller list, but is really fantastically unrealistic. The Hailsham ""clones"" as they mature and become more aware of their fate blithely accept it. There is no outrage, terror or horror. No jackboots or car chases here. Has the survival instinct, utterly embedded in the existence of every being on this planet, and central to evolution, and been utterly suppressed or bred out of them?The clones are able to drive and wander freely about the countryside, they feel strong sexual urges and even rage, but are apparently powerless or have no interest in overcoming their sheep-like death march. Wait, even sheep feel terror when they realize they are about to be slaughtered, it's just they were tricked into situations where they become lamb. So I guess on this basis alone one would conclude, these clones are not human.People who advertise on the Internet that they would love to be cannibalised and eaten are generally considered mad. Japanese Kamakazi cheerfully sacrificed themselves out of hatred for the enemy, but this.. The victims in ""The Island"" who were tricked into becoming organ donors to the Rich were rightly outraged. At least that was comprehensible, ""Never Let Me Go"" for all its uniqueness seems utterly contrived...As Madame of the Art Gallery says to Kathy near the end, ""You poor creatures.

Spare parts presumably for the richest who can afford to buy a few extra years life at the expense of children bred specifically to donate vital organs to those who can afford them once the children have reached the age when their organs can be 'harvested' It centres around three young people who were taught and lived in a school called Hailsham.The story follows these three from childhood to young adulthood and to the time they begin to have their organs taken. This was called 'Donations' SPOILER ENDSKathy, played by Carey Mulligan, Tommy portrayed by Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley, Ruth.The parts portrayed whilst they were children were played by Izzy Meikle-Small (Young Kathy), Charlie Rowe (Young Tommy) and Ella Purnell (Young Ruth).The writing and direction was sensitively done by Alex Garland and Mark Romanek. The movie was from the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro.All the parts were acted superbly and with great professionalism, particularly Carey Mulligan (Kathy as an adult), who also narrated the movie as it progressed. Those who played the parts as children were also very professional.I have no hesitation in recommending this movie but be prepared because it is extremely unnerving.Modern medicine and science have already discovered how to clone animals and I would not be surprised if this has not already been done with humans in secret.I am concerned that within a few short years this may actually start happening because human life no longer appears very important.This movie is along the same lines of 'My Sister's Keeper' which was based on a novel by Jodi PIcoult. Although the novel is supposed to be fiction an actual case of Anissa Ayala who at 16 was diagnosed with leukaemia and because there was no suitable donor her parents decided to have another child whom they named Marissa-Eve. Marissa-Eve became the donor of vital bone marrow to her sister Anissa.So breeding children for spare parts may not be that far away.",Never Let Me Go
95,joncha,Many unanswered questions,7,21 August 2020,"Not having read the novel on which this downer of a movie is based, I wondered if it answered any of the questions that naturally occur to a viewer, such as: do these children know they are clones and don't have natural parents? How are they tracked as adults and called in when it's time to ""donate"" an organ? Why, as adults, does it never occur to them to flee? It is possible to understand that they accept their role and fate, as they have been basically brainwashed in their school life. Accepting such a fate is not a new concept, from terminal cancer patients, to Roman Gladiators, to World War I fighter pilots, to basically everyone back when life expectancy was only to age 40 or 50. Still, you expect the desire to flee and live a ""normal"" life somewhere to overtake the main characters a la ""Logan's Run"" but it never does. Having created this ""donor"" group to provide organs that extend the lives of ""real"" humans, the society isn't sure what the donors are capable of in terms of ""normal"" human behavior. As a result, their education includes many efforts - such as art classes and sports -- to find out how ""human"" they can, or have, become.

I do not know the mans literary work and regarding film work, one of the better Merchant/Ivory films, The Remains Of The Day was based on an Ishiguro novel, so I was not unduly alarmed when I sat down.I also have, make that HAD, no strong opinion about the competence of director Mark Romanek and some films, despite the ""auteur theory"" are not director made.Never Let Me Go looked like one of those. What I neglected to consider was that a director could completely unmake a reasonably good story.This film is a torturous mess. It is dull looking, leaden paced and they really should have had one or two more story conferences to work out the stupendous improbabilities in the plot. Now, I understand that the film takes place neither in the future, nor in the past and that it is presenting a world developmentally different than our own, but please, this film makes no sense, even if you apply the generally absurd level of sense that is standard for the sci-fi genre.First, the ""surprise"" that these kids are being raised for the sole purpose of organ donation is stated verbally quite early in the film. But that's just for the slow members of the audience. In fact, the films ending, thematic point and character denouement are visually shown to us in the very first scene as a skinny, scarred Andrew Garfield is wheeled into an operating room to have his last useful organs removed under the watchful eye of Carrey Mulligan, the woman who truly loves him.Gee, thanks Carrey, I'm glad you love him. Imagine what might have happened if you hated him!But this whole organ transplant idea is just a clumsy allegory for something else because it makes no medical sense what so ever. The film makes some attempt at explanation for why this society needs so many organ donors, but it is a ludicrous premise.If these kids are being used for say, kidney transplants, and human kidneys still work the same way and for the same reasons in their world, than I can at least conclude some nominal comparability to our own world. And here the films central plot point crashes on the rocks of reality.For example, in the USA last year, 28,000 people were saved by organ transplants, out of a roughly 305,000,000 population. That's a very small percentage. Most of the diseases and accidents that can kill you are not fixable by simply getting a new kidney.Then there is the utter passivity of kids. I mean, they adamantly don't want to die, but when they are let out of their holding pens to go for a drive far into the countryside, they return on time and on schedule. It almost seems like they WANT to be carved up into all their little pieces parts.I don't even want to get into the utter stupidity of the film postulating that the third grade drawings of houses and cows somehow indicates that that person has a ""soul"".Trust me, there are better ways to prove your humanity than by the creation of lousy amateur art. It's a ludicrous conceit and whoever came up with it should be ashamed of themselves.So if you want to see a film with an improbable story by Kazuo Ishiguro, check out The Saddest Music In The World. But since that film was directed by the Canadian genius Guy Maddin, the film has wit, excessive eccentricities in filmic style and a huge number of belly laughs.Avoid Never Let Me Go unless you consider getting bored into a coma a fun way to spend an evening.",Never Let Me Go

You will read it, think about it few seconds then move to next page.",7,2 January 2011,"Never Let Me Go it's one of those adaptations that uses great technical execution in order to cover it's flaws in story's narration. The story revolves around this love and friendship triangle between Kathy (Carey Mulligan), Tommy (Andrew Garfield) and Ruth (Keira Knightley) formed while spending their childhood inside an English boarding school, that would keep the children away from their freedom in order to make them unaware of the true living outside the ""fence"". That way, by living in a proper environment, they were being prepared for the worst to come. They will never could have gotten the chance to live fully and experience life at it's fullest because they were raised as donors. After 18, in just a few years they were already ""programmed"" to donate their vital organs which would also bring them ""closer"" to death. Inside this school, the love triangle flourished and continued through years to come till the moment they would face the truth. While Tommy represents the marginalized, Kathy was the girl that always had true strong feelings for Tommy, always understood him in his own weirdness and always appreciated him and cared for him. However, Ruth, had find a way to ""catch"" Tommy into her net and formed for a very long time a couple. Things get a little bit complicated when they are being transferred from their school to ""The Cottages"", a place like a small village where all donors would have to wait for their time. Kathy had the chance to apply for being a carer and provide support for some of the donors. In time, all three of them somehow find out about a way of postpone with even a few years their moment of donation. The condition was that a boy and a girl would form a couple and really love each other. That way they would receive more time to spend together before their eventual deaths. The result? Well, the story obviously deals with strong issues, feelings and drama but the movie doesn't deliver much of that.The characters were also pretty poor written because you seem to not really care for anyone because there's no chemistry there... It's all blank and pointless. The acting looked much much better in the trailer, it looked more emotional and intense but it is definitely not the case. Keira Knightley (Ruth), thanks to the poor writing doesn't have too much to work with, Andrew Garfield as Tommy is a pretty much a silent character and I can't feel anything for him because there's a big lack of delivery. I'm not saying the performance was poor but it definitely was average. The real problem comes from Mulligan's portrayal of Kathy. Mulligan did a good job, definitely the best in the movie. You may ask, ""well Julian then what's the problem?"" and I will gladly answer you. It's boring. The acting itself isn't boring because it's pretty good, but the character is the same character Carey Mulligan usually plays. She picks roles that are too similar and what's wrong with that is that even if she gives a very good performance the audience will feel awkward and even deceived since they already saw that in at least 2 or 3 movies before. She is very talented in dealing with powerful emotions and she does a great job showing the fight within her and her inside pain but once you repeat that too many times in a small period of time people will get bored.Besides the narrative slow evolution of the story, the poor written characters and the lack of versatility in casting the actors, there are good things that need to be pointed out. The technical execution of this movie was great. The cinematography was very good, the predominant brown color used in the movie fitted the atmosphere (in the small amount that it was) and the contrast was perfect. It reminded me of Atonement or An Education. The soundtrack was also good but it became pointless at times.While the movie deals with love and selfishness, with spiritual and sexual evolution, with life and death, it fails in deliver all these elements.

100,kaaber-2,"Requires a whole lotta Kleenex, this one.",10,8 September 2012,"Actually, I detest science fiction. In the worst of cases, the make-believe worlds of the authors are so contrived that the dialogue is rendered idiotic because the characters have to explain their own everyday universe to each other so the audience can follow it.So what was a great relief to me about ""Never Let Me Go"" was that it was science fiction without the science. Not a word is breathed about how the clones are made. Ishiguro's (or, for that matter, filmmaker Romanek's) errand is not to blame science or society at all. The story is purely existentialistic. The tragedy is not so much the shortness of the young people's lives, as the fact that they manage to ruin them with passivity and jealousy.Based on another novel from Ishiguro about people who give up their lives to serve others (his breakthrough was ""Remains of the Day""), ""Never Let Me Go"" is also a story without villains. It's like a merciless Greek drama, leading our characters to their inevitable end. 'This brief tragedy of flesh', as Emily Dickinson would have it.The true tragedy in the film is that of Ruth (Keira Knightley), who, out of fear of being the one left out, steals Kathy's (Mulligan's) boyfriend. For some reason, Knightley's performance moved me to tears. Literally. And I'm not easy.But, that said, the acting is brilliant all over; Mulligan, Garfield, and yet another reunion with Charlotte Rampling whose career has soared in recent years.",Never Let Me Go

I remember watching this on a Christmas eve (2014?) and being drawn in by the 1970's period setting of the beginning of the film. This resonated particularly with me as someone who was of primary school age during this decade, the characters being the same.Without wanting to give anything away, the film (I think) questions our moral and ethical values regarding the sanctity of human life and what it is to be human, as great science-fiction does (cf. the writing's of Phillip K. Dick). The question this film left me with was: Could this have been (or be :-( )an alternate reality or 'adjacent possible' (see Complexity Scientist Prof. Stuart Kauffman writings) for the future.

105,ematerso,Just hated it,2,25 October 2010,"Gave this a two for acting and atmosphere. Atmosphere was unrelentingly bleak and dreary but at least it was consistent. This is an unbelievable plot. We are asked to believe that it is o.k. with the 60M or so citizens of Britain to sacrifice the lives of some thousands of young people who have been raised with the specific purpose of being ""donors"" for the medical needs that can be filled by the donors. . . that is corneas, lungs, livers, etc. It does not say how victims of melanoma or breast cancer or testicular cancer etc. are to be transplanted! We know only that the children (very pleasantly, comfortably and guardedly raised in at least one case, an elegant boarding school) are the product of some kind of engineering as they refer to their ""originals"" from whom they have somehow been reproduced. The word ""clone"" is never used but we are led to believe that may be the source. Further the young adults these children become reason that their ""originals"" are the dregs of society. Now an interesting question is. . . down the road should one of these ""originals"" need a transplant, would they be eligible?Rumors abound about ways to prolong the lives of some of the donors, but alas they all prove to be false as by looking at the children's art work; it is verifible that these children do not have ""souls"", I guess which lends some legitimacy to using them for body parts. . . and further having no delays in doing so. Some people wonder why the children did not just run away. I would ask why they just did not commit suicide in a way that their bodies would not be found for several days. That might cause such a scary society to question the morality of what they are doing.The most positive message I can read into this abysmal film is that perhaps it could create in some thoughtful minds a comparison to abortion. That is the denial of the humanity for one type of life force for the convenience of others.",Never Let Me Go
106,Reel_starz,A haunting and thoughtful portrait of life and love,8,14 October 2010,"In general, adaptations of prestigious or well-loved books are hard to pull off. Not only do film-makers feel the pressure to uphold their source's reputation, but they must also imbue the movie version with their own vision, their own style and personal touch. For director Mark Romanek and screenwriter Alex Garland, Never Let Me Go must have been as daunting a challenge as any: considered by many to be among the best books of the past decade, Kazuo Ishiguro's dystopian, coming-of-age drama features the sort of quiet, intimate power that rarely translates well to the screen. Much of the story and characters is revealed through narration, and the action is so subtle that, if it had not been crafted with such grace and skill, it would have felt static, almost nonexistent. However, Romanek and Garland face these obstacles head-on and, with the help of a talented cast and crew, defy the odds by making a film that - in spirit, at least - stays true to the original source and still succeeds on its own merit.For the most part, Romanek's direction is unnoticeable; it's not the self-conscious, mannered approach that plagues many indie, or even mainstream, dramas. Though he and Garland took some significant risks with the material, some successful (the reduction of the amount of exposition and narration) and others less so (the events and character relationships at Hailsham could have been more fully developed), he largely sits back and allows the story to unfold naturally. Utilizing a score by Rachel Portman that is reminiscent of Mark Isham's swelling, elegant music for 1999's October Sky and Adam Kimmel's bleak yet gorgeous cinematography, the film-makers avoid the stilted feel of many literary adaptations, instead creating something that is deeply emotional and thought-provoking.As the three leads, Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield are perfectly cast. Sporting shorter and blonder hair than in her breakout, award-attracting performance in last year's An Education, Mulligan manages to simultaneously convey childlike innocence and the grave maturity usually seen only in older actresses - or people, for that matter. Keira Knightley was someone who, even more than the other two, I could instantly picture in her role. She embodies Ruth, her crass selfishness, her longing and (ultimately) fruitless dreaming, and given her fairly limited screen time, at least in the first half of the movie, it is quite impressive that she was able to reveal the character's nuances as thoroughly as she did. Like in his other new film, the fantastic The Social Network, here, Andrew Garfield turns in a stellar performance. Though I admittedly preferred him in the former, in both movies, along with a much-hyped role as the lead in future Spiderman movies, Garfield cements his status as 2010's number one rising star.However, what sticks with me the most about Never Let Me Go, both the literary and cinematic versions, is the story, the way it manages to be audacious, intimate and contemplative all at once. Grounded in real human relationships and emotions, what could have been a mere 1984-ish cautionary tale instead becomes a poignant, sincere examination of friendship, morality and what it means to be human. Only in the final scene, where Carey Mulligan's Kathy H., bereft of all her childhood connections, both human and otherwise, stares out across the field that was once her beloved Hailsham, only then does the real message become apparent: life is precious, and in spite of all the medical and technological advances humanity throws at it, death comes to everyone, seemingly always too soon. There are no deferrals, no second chances.Romanek's Never Let Me Go isn't perfect or a masterpiece, but nonetheless, it has the kind of power and beauty that affects people long after the final shot fades away.",Never Let Me Go
107,Jona1988,Good moral drama,7,10 February 2012,"This is one really gloomy movie, but in a good way it has a message and makes you think. Still I wasn't as taken by it as some of the others I saw it with and not as positive as I've heard from several critics. The story has themes of moral dilemmas but it is no shocking stuff because at least for me they were thoughts that have been brought up before. I have not read the book which this movie is based on but I can imagine that this would work better as a book. Not just in the way that the book is usually better than the movie adaptations but the kind of heavy questions that is put forth here would work more as being told in the first person view. They have tried to achieve that in the movie by having several parts of voice-over by the lead character. But according to me it doesn't really succeed. And that brings me to one of the weaknesses of the movie which are the characters, one simply doesn't get that of a strong relation to them. Carey Mulligan is great as so often and her performance is pretty much flawless so I suppose the script is to blame for the somewhat lack of lack of substance. Andrew Garfield is also great and even if this isn't his most memorable role he is a star in the making. But Keira Knightley, I don't know if I just simply don't like her but she is by far the biggest weakness in the film. It's not just that her character is not likable but her acting just isn't believable. The story changes somewhat as the movie goes on. It starts better with an kind of mysterious tone and I sit feeling what twists will this take. But then it slows down and any surprises never come. At the end the story has gone from any real plot to just this gloomy moral question asking dilemma. The production values are brilliant they have really created the right feel and appearance. Still I can't help that this simply didn't get to me really. It's a good work but not more than good. It asks questions that are important but doesn't manage to create really interest and the plot doesn't go very far.",Never Let Me Go
108,archiecm,Zombies in Love,6,29 August 2011,"My summary/title is borrowed from New Yorker's David Denby who called the film a ""Zombie Art Picture."" I had problems with the movie and couldn't find a critic that felt likewise until Denby. Ebert liked it, as did O'Hehir, Richard Propes Sarah Ward, and Richard Gray.What bothered me was the kids were so accepting of their fate--they were so un-flummoxed at their gloomy future. I've lived in boarding schools and have tutored kids there as an adult. They are NOT happy to be away from their parents. They suffer a gaping wound while trying to cope with a world where no one hugs them, councils them, encourages them. An environment where there is discipline but no love will mostly bring about rebels, delinquents and depressives. At these foster kid group environments the numbers of kids who wind up in trouble is around 75%. Without the real means or philosophy to add true love and nurturing to the kids, the schools simply double down on the discipline which, of course, does not work.None of this is evident in the film. They would have you believe that human reactions have been bred or taught out of them. That's so far-fetched that it spoiled the film for me. They would compare themselves to other humans and ask why they had to go without. The kind of esprit de corps they show would only come from a background of a solid membership in something that had a bigger purpose and in which they were asked to be heroes for a great cause that benefited those they loved. We don't see that here. What we see, points out Denby, is, ""hideously becalmed ciphers . . . . metaphors of conformity and repression."" It bothered me that in all the talk of their donations, they never referred to the particular organs they lost. This is so unrealistic of what humans would actually do that it cancelled out any chance that this film was about humans with human DNA, be they clones or not. Since the film does show that they would like to prolong their stay on earth how could they not be interested in which organ they lost since which one disappears bears directly on their survival chances and longevity. A kidney might be easily absorbed but a spleen, lung, or eye, might be more severe of a loss. They WOULD NEVER JUST SAY, ""I've had two donations,"" without the listener wanting to know which ones. They are, indeed, Denby's zombies.One more problem with the school scenes: If Lucy (Sally Hawkins of ""Happy Go Lucky"") ""ruined"" things by telling the preteen kids the true nature of their fate then how was the school doing it before her? And why didn't Lucy's letting the cat out of the bag have any negative consequences? I got curious: What WAS in the actual speech? The one they DID use to inform the clones that they're just organ donors? Why don't we get to hear it since it was so much better than the one Lucy used? And why are they trying to teach these kids anything? Rampling and co. state that they're curious if these kids have souls. But they don't really want to know do they? Wouldn't that just make it all harder?I gave the film a half-decent grade because I liked the love angle, especially as it evolved towards the end of the film",Never Let Me Go

The intriguing storyline soon sucked me in and I remained completely absorbed throughout. As this is a spoiler-free review, I won't say too much about the plot, but it unfolds at an acceptable pace with a few nice twists and turns along the way. It raises questions here and there, but provides enough clues for the viewer to fill in the blanks without leaving him confused and, thankfully, without having to labour every point. The story is mainly centred around 3 characters, Kathy, Tommy and Ruth, and follows their lives over a period of many years. It's debatable which is actually the main plot - the love triangle, or the sci-fi/moral element of the narrative, but these two strands are woven together well and as well as being handled sensitively and with refreshing subtlety, they are also thought-provoking. The characters themselves are believable, a far cry from the usual stereotypical protagonists of modern film. I was also relieved that as this film progressed it didn't descend into clichéd action-thriller nonsense with the main characters being relentlessly pursued as they try to escape their destiny, as is so often the case. The film is also well directed and boasts some lovely cinematography, showing off some excellent scenery throughout. All in all, my viewing of this film was a most pleasurable surprise.

When they learned of the reason for the school keeping their artwork it expressed the general sentiment of the population, that they have no ""souls"" and are therefore not human. (Since humans don't have a soul either why was this idea permitted to judge the children?) How else could surgeons extract a vital organ that ""completes"" the donor without feeling any remorse or feeling any guilt at all? The headmistress of the school wanted the children to be human but even she had to express her disappointment in the end. It seemed the children had to take drugs every day in order to control them, but then that idea was thrown away when they left the school.I did not accept that there could be love between any of the creatures, because that would mean there would have to have been hate.

We had a pleasant evening planned; meal and a glass of wine in the upstairs bar followed by the movie on Screen 2, in the larger auditorium. The meal was good . . .It seems that a genre of films has emerged that might be called 'Misery Movies'. Just as 'misery memoirs' have become popular in the world of books, so the misery experience has spread to the world of film. 'The Road', 'Winter's Bones' and now 'Never Let Me Go' are recent examples; at the end of the screening you leave the cinema with relief and go away and do something to cheer yourself up.NLMG is enough to depress anyone's spirits as it is characterised by being filmed in low lighting or natural light (i.e. it's irksome visually), by drab costumes (all greys, browns, blacks), constant whining music in minor keys (I felt like shooting the cellist), and a monumentally implausible plot (enough said - I don't want to spoil anything). As soon as this drift of this plot becomes clear, made so in a clumsy and contrived scene, you want the movie to be over as soon as possible. But it limps its miserable way along to its predetermined end, before expiring in a few final scenes of hackneyed sentimentality.The movie is supposed to be about love – 'poignant', 'heart-rending', 'tales of love and deceit whilst avoiding emotional cliché' – but nothing resembling love is convincingly portrayed on the screen. Indeed, there is no sense of genuine emotion at all, despite several bouts of tears from Carey Mulligan. This essentially fake quality communicates itself to the viewer, and results in an absence of emotional involvement on the part of the audience. As for the stuff about 'souls', and artistic ability as an indicator of whether someone has a soul or not - what pretentious twaddle! There are a few good features: the outdoor scenes are particularly nicely shot, and Carey Mulligan's acting is excellent even with poor material. But Keira Knightley's performance is wooden.The underlying problem with this movie is that it attempts to be both an SF horror film (The excellent Village of the Damned (1960), based on John Wyndham's novel, The Midwich Cuckoos, come to mind) and an arty commentary on humanity, love, etc. It does not succeed at either.Overall, there is little to commend this soulless and really rather silly film.

117,darioilg,"A rushed story that ""completes"" at the end",7,1 May 2019,"Having just finished Ishiguro's book, I was curious to see how they could transpose that weird story into a movie. This film is quite a faithful adaptation, but it has something that makes it better than the book and something worse.What's good is that having actual people act out the situations written in Ishiguro's not-so-heartfelt style makes for a more emotional experience, and one where I was actually caught by the fear of death that the novel only barely touches upon. In other words, I liked the second half of the movie, where the adult versions of Kathie, Ruth and Tommy live the tragedy of their lives.The problem comes with the first part. In this case, the book did a wonderful job at giving small details out little by little, slowly getting the reader to realize the horrendous truth behind Hailsham, telling the story of the cassette Kathy listens to (and the dramatic moment with Madame), her having sex with countless guys to forget about Tommy, and so on. The movie is really disappointing on this point: Haisham and the Cottages are a synopsis of themselves, not letting the viewer really get to know anyone from then and ultimately making the epic reunion with Madame and Miss Emily completely pointless, since there are no dots to connect.",Never Let Me Go
118,Teebs2,Never Let Me Go (2010),8,18 August 2011,"A great tragic love story with a subtle sc-fi twist directed by the talented Mark Romanek and adapted from Ishguro's novel by Alex Garland. The central love trio are very well played both as children and young adults, with Knightley, Garfield and Mulligan all capturing their characters strengths and uncertainties in the face of their future as cloned organ donors.The film has a beautiful yet melancholy atmosphere with a muted earthy colour palette and moody shots of barren coastlines. The film wisely distances from any moralising about the sci-fi side of the story instead focusing on the characters' relationships to life and each other heightened by the limited lifespans of the characters although all the more poignantly applicable to our own. Some may find it too slow and downbeat, but if you can go with the pace it's also very rewarding.",Never Let Me Go
119,alexart-1,I Sing the Body Electric,8,9 October 2010,"Mark Romanek's Never Let Me Go opens with a scene of a woman staring at a man on an operating table. She stares at him through a glass wall and he stares back at her, a tear streaming down his cheek. It is moments like these that work so well in Never Let Me Go, a dystopian science fiction drama that is both tender and frightening all at once. Romanek's haunting imagery combined with some great acting acting really make this film work as a great adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's still greater book of the same title. While the pacing may be a bit uneven, a moving story with a purposeful emotional disconnection holds together quite nicely on the silver screen.Without saying too much, Never Let Me Go is a story about what it truly means to be humans. That does not mean that there are aliens involved, but there are other science fiction elements that are subtly blended with complex emotions. The story revolves around Ruth, Tommy, and Kathy, three children growing up at a school called Hailsham. Hailsham is bizarre in many ways, but the children simply take it as it is. The children eventually learn a nasty secret about themselves from a teacher. Ruth (Keira Knightley), Tommy (Andrew Garfield), and Kathy's (Carey Mulligan) lives change forever as they suddenly learn to live their lives differently. As they grow up together, they experience sex, sadness, and love in unexpected ways.Mark Romanek, who is probably better known for his work on music videos, has made this film look sad and cold. The cinematography fulfills the book's sense of depression through images of repetition. One especially beautiful shot is the closing one in which two pieces of cloth lie tethered, almost trapped, on a barbed wire fence blowing in the wind. The film's beauty lies in its color palette, which leaves out all primary colors. Romanek said in interviews that he borrowed the color palette from the excellent 1968 British film If..., a fitting place to borrow from for this movie.The acting from all three main actors is very good. The performances probably do not merit any Oscars, but they are still great to watch. Carey Mulligan shines for a second time here, although her performance is probably better in An Education. Andrew Garfield, a fairly new actor, does well as Tommy, playing his character with all the strange mannerisms that he had in the book. Look for Garfield in The Social Network. He definitely will be one to keep an eye on. Keira Knightley also is quite good as the conniving Ruth, although her performance is nowhere near as good as those of Garfield and Mulligan.The pacing of the movie was its biggest problem. The middle of the movie inches along a bit too slowly, whereas the book moved at a constantly brisk pace. Though the movie should and did spend a little more time on character development, it spent a bit too much time and could have easily lost fifteen minutes. The plot of the book has also been presented out of order, with the major twist revealed a half hour into the film. This will strange for anyone who read the book, for it makes the character development very different.Never Let Me Go is sad, depressing, and interesting in many ways. Though it is not bound for Oscar gold, it is brilliant in its quietness. It may not be enjoyed by people who have not read Ishiguro's brilliant book, but fans of the book will certainly appreciate Romanek's direction and the performances of Mulligan, Knightley, and Garfield. If any movie could make you sad for hours, it would be this one, so be prepared, and bring some tissues.As Never Let Me Go shows, coming into a person's life can be even harder than letting go.",Never Let Me Go
120,ken_bethell,"Huxley could never have imagined, or could he?",8,10 December 2010,"What constitutes entertainment? That is almost an impossible question to answer.Some would say that any film that can keep you enthralled for nearly two hours and leave you talking about it long afterwards would qualify and 'Never let me go' certainly meets that criteria. Not having read the book I had no preconceived ideas on what to expect and what I got was a contemporary horror made all the intense by the fact that this drama plays out events that we all know society could endorse in a not-too-distant future, events that we thought were pure science fiction back in Aldous Huxley's time. The film starts with captions eluding to great medical and scientific breakthroughs in 1952 and 1967 that advanced humanity in its quest to eradicate disease. In those captions alone the tone is set. For the unsuspecting I should point out that those years brought the discovery of DNA and the world's first heart transplant respectively but no specific reference is made of these events and I leave what is referred to as 'modelling' to your own imagination. A clever deception then follows with protracted scenes that appear to show an orderly life at a typical English boarding school. The narrative continually but subtlety indicates that all is not what it seems. The reality and the raison-d'etre of these children then slowly dawns on the viewer. Shocking and brilliant! The film is inspired, at least in part, by Huxley's 'Brave New World' where people are created for a specific function and live their lives in grateful resignation of their fate. Pathos is added by a menage-a-trois in which the principal characters have relationships against a background of impending doom. Not the most cheerful of films but beautifully crafted with first rate performances and a wonderfully sinister ambiance. If you liked 'Children of Men', and films of that genre, this is for you. Entertainment is after all a personal taste.",Never Let Me Go

122,benegesserit20,This movie left me speechless,8,1 August 2012,"The cold cruelty of this story is really shocking and poignant. The system in The Island seems a humanitarian act compared to this. There they at least tried to avoid the donors to be unique and to have a ""normal"" life (I don't say that it's much better, but I think that this situation is a perfect example of ""ignorance is bliss"").I got two main questions while watching this film. 1. How could happen that no one said a word against using flesh-and-blood, breathing human beings as donors? (Another example from The Island, there people didn't know anything about donor humans. Of course no excuse, but still...). I think I found an acceptable answer for this one. People simply want to live forever, mainly if they can do so healthy (fear and despair, mainly when death is coming, are powerful lords anyway). The fact that they don't have to see the donor makes it easier I guess. This way we can think whatever we want. A perfect example for this is this sentence from the former school headmaster: ""We used the gallery for proving that donor children are almost human."" (Sorry if the quotation is not exactly correct, I'm translating what I heard in Hungarian). 2. Why didn't the donors go against this system? The answer for that was there all along: they were raised this way from early childhood, they simply believed that this is what they have to do. This can be seen in their childlike and naive reactions even as adults. Besides, they were raised separately, so they couldn't reach a critical mass.If you are interested in this topic, I strongly recommend My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult (the book, not the movie!).This movie is very thought-provoking from many points of view. If you like movies like that, don't miss Never Let Me Go.",Never Let Me Go

Theme of the absurdity of human existence, love, lost hopes, illusions and death. Their unusual passivity, when their own fate is in question.

124,akkoziol,Is it possible to be human without being human?,9,21 February 2011,"I thought I was going to hate this movie but it was very thought provoking. Some elements of this movie didn't work for me and rather made me alter my perception of chronology and reality but I guess, after the fact, I see why the director does this.We are introduced to what appears to be a boarding school somewhere in the UK in the 1970s where a bunch of young children in rather drab grey uniforms mill about their studies, play like normal children, and so on...until you see them press their wrist up to a box which simply beeps and flashes a small red light. Your brow should lower at this point because everything appears rather anachronistic and pre-dated--as in, the 1930s existing in the 1970s---but yet there are these boxes and the kids put their wrists up to them? Hmm? Did I just see a small camera tucked back almost out of site? What's going on here? As the story progresses more we learn exactly what sad fate is to befall these children by a teacher whose conscience seems to get the best of her and she reveals to her students what waits for them down the road.While I was rather captivated by the premise once I figured out, it struck me that this movie was the antithesis to Koreeda's ""Wonderful Life"" (After Life for the rest of you). As the viewer and as a human being, we come to reevaluate what it means to be human and what we consider life. Is it our soul? Is it our ability to think for ourselves? Is it nature or nurture? We're told to always live our life to the fullest while we are alive because at any moment we could be gone. But change that equation and remove the ""our"" and you may get a hint of what you could expect when you watch Never Let Me Go. I though it was pretty good.",Never Let Me Go
125,cartman_1337,Compelling stuff!,10,23 September 2013,"I'm not into romantic movies, unless there's something else about it. I can take most romantic comedies because of the comedy aspect, but if you'd ask me what kind of category of film I'd be least likely to want to see, 'romantic drama' would be at the very top of the list. So what brought me here? Carey Mulligan... Simple as that. Since I first saw her picture, while promoting An Education, I knew I wanted to see as much of her as I could. An Education was great. Drive and Public Enemies were unfortunately not so good. Haven't gotten around to the others yet, but they'll come. So to be honest; I bought this movie simply because she was in it. That, and the fact that it had a good rating and reviews.So, I sat down to watch it. Skeptical due to the 'romantic drama' aspect, and I hadn't really read anything at all about it, so I had no idea whatsoever about what lay ahead of me.Rarely have I been more blown away by a movie. I didn't even know about the sci-fi aspects of the movie before putting it on, but therein lies the true qualities of this gem of a movie. True, realistic, emotional and scientific science fiction, not space adventure, mind you. The kind of fiction that makes you question our humanity and personal views and histories, makes us reflect on what we've experienced in the past and what options we actually have for future experiences, and makes us appreciate our friendships and relationships a little bit more. Real compelling stuff! All strengthened by a fantastic story, that surely has romantic aspects, but not the sickening in-your-face kind of romances that only Hollywood at its worst can produce. This delves more on the fantasies and hopes of the perfect romance, and as such is something anyone can relate to, even those of us who haven't had too much luck in that department in our own lives.This is a fantastically beautiful and thought-provoking film, brilliantly directed and with superb acting performances throughout. It gets my warmest recommendations! And if you can avoid it; don't read too much about it or watch its trailer. Just watch it, and let it take you on the emotional roller-coaster ride that it is.

I know I need to read the novel for a definitive answer, but I simply couldn't accept that a bunch of highly intelligent, thoughtful young folks would meekly accept their fate as organ donors, especially when they've been brought up in the (more or less) real world - or is some point being made about how cloistered is an English public school? Nevertheless, they meet outsiders and go on outings, in particular to Norfolk to see their 'models' or 'donors', as if to imply they have themselves been somehow cloned (but again, this is never adequately explained). I began to wonder if the whole thing was some protest about organ donation being made obligatory in the UK (opt out rather than opt in).

129,susanj50,Message?,7,24 September 2010,"Contains some unavoidable spoilers. Saw ""Never Let Me Alone"" with three friends at a private screening on Sunset early last week. My Jewish friend wondered why getting ""complete"" isn't done at once rather than in installments. My pragmatic Indian filmmaker buddy was deeply disappointed about the lack of entertainment value — depressing movies as ""Never Let Me Alone"" cannot possibly be successful — while as his wife dismissed the movie altogether as not worth the time watching or reasoning about. Loved the photography, and I always appreciate originality (although it did not strike me like ""Fahrenheit 451"" did when I first saw it as a kid 40 years ago). What I found scary is the intentional lack of attention to specific details -- on the big screen they popped up anyways. For example, the logo of the National Organ Organization or whatever it was called on a van, without ever getting closer on the logo, as if it were a well known issue, also to the audience.Apart of the seventies which looked more like the fifties -- but perhaps this is intentional in this dystopia -- what I missed in ""Never Let Me Alone"" is a more significant interaction of these doomed people with ordinary folks, maybe during a train ride. ""Aha"" moments would follow, the protagonists would question the need of their sacrifice. Imagine one of them falling in love with somebody outside their group, the wealth of drama, plot, action, despair, discovery, redemption. Imagine one of these other persons they made friends with being killed in an accident, and his/her organs being harvested because they fit. Imagine some of these doomed individuals miffed because this unqualified individual postponed their ""completion."" There is so much room for irony, absurdity, even hilarity with which to grab an audience's attention, even a distracted or potentially hostile audience.Finally, one may wonder if the hidden message of this movie is to remind people to put a donor sticker on their I.D. If so, and even if not, it is time somebody made a movie starting from the EPR paradox to bring the deeper implications of organ transplants to the attention of public opinion.

It's a subtle film, that feels like it moves gently like the wind. It's mournful undertones imply so much, and the tone makes this feature simply unforgettable.This not a film for everyone by any means. It's dreary, unfair and acute. This is a two-way affair more than other love stories, I was swept away not by action or aesthetics but from the mood and genuine character arcs this movie had. I have to praise Carey Mulligan because she was astounding.

131,espenshade55,A mixed reaction to an abridgment of greatness,7,17 September 2010,"As a fan of the book I had a mixed reaction to this adequate yet overall uninspiring adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's brilliant novel. Looking back at my viewing experience I was reminded of the early adaptation of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' from the earliest era of films, in which the filmmakers expected you to have read the book and simply showed you interpretations of various scenes. Alex Garland's screenplay boasted the ambition of including a little bit of everything from Ishiguro's 300 page book in his slightly under two hour movie. The result is a simple abridgment, we have time to realize the love brewing between the characters, the strained friendship between Mulligan's Kathy and Knightley's Ruth, and the dilemma of their caregivers at Hailsham. But the film lacks much the catharsis and the commentary that made the book so great.Romanek has proved himself to be a capable director, but here he made some negative decisions which really removed much of the impact of the plot. Adam Kimmel's cinematography is a stand out here, and given the competition so far I wouldn't be surprised if he receives an Oscar nomination for his work. The calm collection and stoic nature of much of the acting can be seen as insipid or uninteresting to some. But I found the acting to be quite appropriate, the tight lipped, proper British style of this movie provided an nice contrast and balance to a story which could have turned into a mindless melodramatic tear jerker if not handled correctly.In the end, I think active viewer-ship is of paramount importance to this movie. The film is never interested in simply handing the audience its ideas. Rather it called upon us to dig for meaning. I would say the plot itself served as a bit of a metaphor, and that intrigued me. And, despite some of the negative artistic liberties which were taken in this adaptation, I feel that it did well enough to create an involving, though provoking, and sometimes heartbreaking experience.Despite its flaws, 'Never Let Me Go' has been one of the few strong film that we've had this year. And, if your one of those people who goes to the movies once or twice a month, I'd say 'Never Let Me Go' is one of your better bets for an agreeable experience at the movies right now.",Never Let Me Go
132,donjeffries,Intriguing Premise Wasted,3,25 August 2015,"I was drawn to this film because of its interesting premise; that a group of children were being groomed as organ harvesters. However, this premise was never logically developed. For instance, we are never told why they-or anyone-is being forced into donating their organs. Who chose them? Why did they, and their families, submit to this maniacal program? And most importantly, who are the organs being harvested for?One can assume it is the very wealthy who are receiving all these organs, and living a much longer life span. This longer life span is briefly noted at the beginning of the film, which is curiously set in an already passed late twentieth century. It seems more natural to create a dystopian future. The screenwriter certainly should have explained something about how this scenario came about. Again, one can imagine an uncaring elite using these poor subjects for their own benefit, but nothing like this is ever even alluded to. Finally, while the two actresses who played the female leads at a younger age morphed into older actresses that looked much like them, the young Tommy was supplanted by a really unattractive actor that bore no resemblance to the good-looking youngster we saw in the early stages of the film. I found this distracting, and a thoughtless casting decision. I kept waiting for not only some background on this odious new world, but for the lead characters-or at least someone-to attempt a revolt. After all, they knew their fate, and had nothing to lose. Perhaps it's a parable on the mindset of the modern-day sheeple.",Never Let Me Go
133,richard-810,"Gentle, haunting, beautiful and poignant",8,20 January 2012,"I have to admit to knowing nothing about this movie when I caught it yesterday and was so impressed that I felt the need to look it up on IMDb and add my own comments. I see from other reviews that I am not alone in my reaction. Without wishing to spoil the latter stages of the tale for any readers, the main story gets underway at an idyllic rural British private school for boys and girls, the time being around 50 years ago. It becomes apparent that something is not quite right, why no parents, why are the children banned from ever leaving the school grounds and why are they taught basic skills like asking for tea or coffee, something they would surely have known by their age of 10 or 12? It soon becomes apparent when a renegade teacher explains that they have been bred as 'donors' for spare part surgery, they will be allowed to grow to healthy early adulthood and then donate organs two or three times until the process brings about their 'completion', their death. The story then follows three friends as they move through the various stages of the awful process.Strictly speaking, the story could be classified as sci-fi but what makes this so original is it being set in an alternative past, a kind of parallel world. It is the atmosphere of the film which really made it memorable for me, gentle, beautiful rural landscapes, the innocence of the subjects. It would have been so easy to have changed this to a more uplifting story, the 'donors' fighting the system and resisting the authorities who have created them for a specific doomed purpose. There is some attempt by couples to gain a 'deferral', a postponement as they are in love and seek a couple of years to enjoy the relationship but it is ultimately their quiet acceptance of their fate, their resignation as their bodies are pillaged stage by stage which haunts the horrified viewer.I appreciate that the melancholy atmosphere of this film might not be to everyone's taste but I strongly recommend it to anyone with an interest in serious cinema. I can't stop thinking about it and that for me is the best tribute to any work of art.",Never Let Me Go
134,synevy,Interesting story,7,12 January 2012,"A very important thing to know, before you watch this movie, is that it's based on a novel. A dystropian science fiction novel -as it is described- written by Kazuo Ishiguro. I'm a fan of sci-fi novels but, i have to be honest here, i'd never be drawn by a dystropian one This one included.Dystropia: is the idea of a society in a repressive and controlled state, often under the guise of being utopian (anti-utopia).In a few words, a messed up alternate universe where people are abusing and being abused by high technology but without having the spiritual self evolvement to face that kind of reality.Never Let Me Go tells the story of three friends growing up in a boarding school. Their characters are so diverse, facing the same fear in different ways as they find out the purpose of their predetermined life. The subject that's being analyzed in this movie is very delicate.Keira Knightley seems to be doing very well with acting mentally unstable -once more, if i may say so. Carey Mulligan is also making a nice performance, carrying the leading role. Andrew Garfield (The Social Network, The Amazing Spider-man) has an important and well played supporting role, too.A very good thing is that, in this film, the story has been put down in a very clear (yet mystic) way. Some questions might not be answered but some awareness may rise. The music is soothing, mainly constituted by classic compositions, the '50s and some traditional. And, yes, i insist on my opinion about the great photography that can be achieved in this UK scenery.If you decide to give it a go take it slow, as the plot itself is slowly unfolding.",Never Let Me Go
135,ilikeweirdstuffs,A two sentence metaphor for life being short expanded to feature length,3,28 May 2016,"I begrudgingly gave this a 3 out of 10. Because of the okay acting, and the whole metaphor being done quite well. This however is where the redeeming qualities of the movie end. Don't get me wrong, if you want to feel depressed and anxious without drugs, this is a great thing for that. But it's just cheap emotional manipulation. Even without having seen the initial title card about medicine advancing and thus being more curious about what was happening on screen than i would have been otherwise, everything was clear about 10 minutes in. No surprises, no twists from then on.I said the metaphor was nice, because in a way it is a perfect analogy, to how life is short and one never knows when your organs start to give out and you die. Yes, real life is a lot like as if you were allowed to be a conscious knowledgeable human being for a while before the higher ups decide that your time has come to depart from this world from which point you can cling on to life for a while, or not.This is where the analogy starts to fail though. In reality, this mostly happens when people have already lived a long, full life. Their lives are also not kept artificially bleak and horrible. How different would it have been, if the children had all lived an average life, and had to start donating their organs at age 60. Another good analogy was how people don't really seem to try very hard to prolong their lives. A lot less attention goes to longevity research than what would be natural considering old age is still cause of death #1. From here however the movie goes completely off the rails, and fails with every turn. Because, just like in real life genetics research and longevity research still exists, *some* people should actually try to do a slight bit more than get +3years. The whole analogy also fails, because there is no contrast for us in real life to compare ourselves to people with ""normal"" long lives, which was a major cause of the doomed feeling the characters had.Finally, for all the shortcomings of the metaphor of ""growing up to donate your organs away"" being life, the movie could still be good on it's own. Except it isn't. Not in the slightest. There is no internal logic whatsoever. As others have pointed out, growing people instead of organs is dumb. Then just harvesting the person, just like that, is unrealistic. Harvesting them for three organs, is mind-numbingly moronic. Facing no protest from anyone in society is ridiculous. Then still allowing the clone meat human interaction, human lives, and completely regular interaction with other humans is absolutely laughable and devilish. The ultimate spit in the face however, was the notion that the clones having grown up with a normal human education would then just flatly accept their fate in this completely non supervised system. They just walk to their death completely without much hesitation.C for a clever, but very limited and badly executed metaphor. F for the story.I was wondering if i might have missed something here, but i could not see anything else mentioned by anyone. My apologies to the creators of both the novel and the movie, but despite some nice details and effort, this was dumb. Really, really dumb. Probably not their best work.",Never Let Me Go

The cinematography is almost flawless, the pace is steady and calm and everything ties in splendidly with an excellent music score. In other words, this film is aesthetically rewarding.As far as the acting is concerned, it surely deserves some praise: Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield are two of the most promising young actors and they do a great job here, and so does Keira Knightley. Moving to the script, which is what seems to annoy most viewers in one way or another, my take is this:-""Is this kind of society even possible?"" Well, yes it is. Humans are, unfortunately, able of many cruel and twisted ideas which, in their respective time and context, might not even seem outrageous to the society they're part of (see slavery, genocides, Auschwitz) -""Why didn't they try to escape?"" When you have an established system that reproduces itself through the years, the people-products of this system do not even realise that escaping is an option. Remember the horror stories they were brought up with (about the children who tried to escape) and just think of how much brain-washing had been done to them concerning their purpose in life. And, to link it to the real world once more, think of how many unfair and cruel societies have existed through the human history (old and recent): did everyone try to escape/change the situation? No - even if some people did try, the majority accepted their fate...out of fear, lack of hope, lack of information/brainwashing etc.I'm saying all this to support the opinion that neither the premise of the movie nor the characters' choices were implausible, as some critics have claimed. On the contrary, the sentiments and the reactions felt familiar and realistic and that is why they were touching.Yes, it's true that it is not a heroic story and the characters don't inspire great ideas. It is rather a portrait of the average human life, the life of millions of people who have lived hopeless lives, lives during which nothing astonishing happened except maybe for love, which is by itself important enough to bring value to a person's journey. And, as the heroine says in the end, no matter the reason or even its actual length, everyone's life journey feels short and kind of hopeless, an idea strengthened by the beautiful visual metaphor of the ship that is stranded in the sand.All that, for me at least, is enough to make a great and pretty poetic film, which does not deserve the many poor reviews that it has been receiving.",Never Let Me Go

You don't even have to peel back layers to have questions. I expected some things to be addressed in the film, but they are not. We are just supposed to take the premise at face-value despite it failing anything resembling critical thinking. Even things which are directly discussed on multiple occasions are not actually explained (lookalikes being a big one).I wish they didn't open the movie with a scene used later on, taking away its impact.I didn't cry or anything, though I'm not prone to when it comes to films, and I'm certain I'll forget about this film, which is a shame. I was expecting a lot more. I didn't hate it or find it a waste of time, and I wasn't bored.

146,zhongzl-kelley2014,As good as it can get,5,18 October 2017,"This film has a really expensive cast, which does the original story justice, which was written by the Literature Nobel Prize winner Kazuo Ishiguro. Although Ishiguro moved to England in an early age, his story is heavily Japanese-flavored. Humanity, isolation, despair, love, those are very common themes in Japanese literature. Therefore I feel like a large portion of plot would be better suited for Japanese actors and actresses. It might not be that comprehensible in this side of the cultural gap. Even jarringly inconsistent. For example, the Japanese obsession with vagueness is unique to Japanese culture, and not translatable by language. It is very understandable for Japanese characters to not say something important, even those that must be spoken, in fear of spoiling the present that they so enjoy. Tommy wouldn't tell Ruth that he liked Kathy more because he was unsure of Kathy's feelings. He would be afraid that he would cause Kathy troubles if he rejected Ruth, since romantic rejection for her sake would clearly ruin Kathy and Ruth's friendship. But since Kathy already saw Ruth and Tommy kissing, she wouldn't tell Tommy she liked him in fear of hurting Ruth. Ruth, of course, cared deeply about both her friends, therefore the fragile balance could sustain. But none of those misunderstandings and subtle, beautiful web of love and friendship would be possible in the brutally transparent language that was used in the film. I think the difference might be that it is impossible to tell what an Asian person is feeling by looking at him/her/them, but it is for Westerners, therefore it would all be quicker and easier. Carey Mulligan, being a fan of the book, did a very precise and relatable interpretation of the book. Her performance would satisfy the fan. But Andrew Garfield made Tommy look like a total loser. He said in one of the interviews that Tommy was anxious, so he was trying to spice anxiety into his performance. It doesn't take an expert to tell that he was wrong. Tommy wasn't anxious at all. In fact, he was meticulous, caring, sensitive, endearing. He was powerless yet heartbreakingly firm about defending his love and friends and humanity. He wasn't supposed to make any audience resent or despise Tommy. If he had actually read the book, the movie would be entirely different. But I love his scream at the end. It was very heart-felt and soul-crunching. I was very inspired and shaken by that scream. At least he got that right.Keira Knightly went amiss too. Her Ruth was mean, manipulative, domineering. But a Japanese Ruth would be more considerate, more gentle, more smooth. She would not so openly, easily declare her affections, but would wait until it bursted her and tortured her more than she could bear that she spitted it out. She was supposed to feel like a friend worth having, but did the worst thing for caring. Keira Knightly said in an interview that she didn't understand Ruth's motives. Audience can sense that by watching, and those misunderstandings kind of tore the story apart.I am grateful that someone bothers to make the novel into a movie at all. To convey the cultural and emotional contexts of the novel, they were obviously trying very hard, but to a mediocre success. I can't say Japanese actors would do it any better, since some of them regard acting with a bizarre kind of sportsmanship instead of craftsmanship, pushing themselves into emotional and physical limits instead of thinking with clear heads what the characters were really supposed to do. So I guess it is as good as it can get.",Never Let Me Go
147,katie-sirles,Never Let Me Go to Hailsham,7,19 April 2011,"I feel like I went into Never Let Me Go in a good place. I knew nothing of the film other than that it had Keira Knightly, Carey Mulligan, and a new favorite of mine, Andrew Garfield. I went off of the knowledge that I already have about movies and what their titles generally insinuate. I used common sense theories and had it in my head that this movie was going to be a delightful romp that followed the stories of three young people who just wanted to have fun and get into mischief with a little romance thrown in here and there. I have never been more mistaken in all of my life. Unless you count the time that I went to see Transformers 2 and thought it was going to be good.This story of this film is incredibly frightening and almost nightmarish. The film begins with Kathy (Mulligan) who is recounting the experiences she had at a posh English boarding school. Garfield plays Tommy. He is teased and bullied by everyone but Kathy.They become fast friends and as their budding adolescent passions start to come out, in walks Ruth (Knightly) who steals Tommy away from Kathy. Oh no she didn't.Oh yes, she did.Let me fill you in on a bit of the story without giving away too much. Basically, the kids at Hailsham boarding school are carbon copies of other people. They are created for their organs. Yes, they are essentially harvested for their vital organs. I say it twice because it blew my mind the first time it was brought up in the film and I had to hear it again. I figured I would do my readers a kindness and share that thought with you twice. So the children are raised to a certain age and just before adulthood is reached they begin their ""donations"" of vital organs.To confuse things even more – as if organ harvesting weren't enough – there is a definite love triangle in this film. I must say that Andrew Garfield has a face that you just want to hold in your hands and stare into. His eyes are kind. I have always heard that expression that someone has kind eyes. I finally know just precisely what that means when looking at Garfield. But I digress Former students of Hailsham will give a number of donations before their number is up. Typically they reach four donations, but some ""complete"" on the first donation. If you can't figure it out, complete means die. The worst, most frightening part of it all is that they cannot escape this fate. Or can they? Rumor has it that there is a way to at the very least put off the process for a while, but if I spoiled that for you I would just be the worst? Try as they might, the children of Hailsham must come to terms with what is going to happen to them when they grown up. It is all in the name of science and it is done so that the life expectancy of normal people extends past 100 years. Like I said, I was expecting a romcom or even a dramedy. I didn't laugh once. Not one time. In fact, I think for most of the film I was sitting with my mouth covered and tears that were waiting to well up just enough that they would finally roll up over my bottom lid and onto my cheek. And this did occur on more than one occasion.This is not a light-hearted film and that is totally fine. It is brilliant for what it is and a concept that is rarely seen. I think the story is quite unique and I must say that it was fun to see Keira Knightly being a little nuts. Though this is a film that is hard to watch at times due to – for the most part – the anxiety level of the viewer, it is still a movie that deserves to be seen and heard. Such an idea is terrifying, but thankfully when I finished the movie and felt as though I had just woken up from a bad dream, certain verbal aggressions toward the television on which The Bulls are playing brought me back to reality. Then I had to deal with another problem entirely. Basketball, ugh. I'll take organ harvesting over that any day.Ms. Silver Screen founder of mssilverscreen.com",Never Let Me Go
148,ginobean,awful story,1,15 April 2011,"I found the basic premise behind the story to be revolting -- raising children in order to farm their organs..I think Ishiguro, the writer, totally took a major misstep with this storyline. This foundation is so fatally flawed and repulsive that it taints everything that follows from it.Technically, it seems to be fairly well done, but again, the basic premise revolted me, so I sort of tuned out most of the movie.If I were to compare this movie to one other movie, the one that comes to mind is ""The Human Centipede"", which also revolted me.Both stories are based on disgusting and awful premises, although ""Never let Me Go"" is technically better written and directed.Other than that, I think the two movies are about on the same level of palatability, at least to me.",Never Let Me Go

No background information whatsoever to explain on how this dystopian cruel society could possibly exist.

The love story is the perfect enabler to driving the main point of the movie. And it was done so perfectly, heartbreaking and poetic.I won't spoil how you must experience the movie so I won't get into details but I think you ought to see this movie and just forget the negative reviews you've heard about it. Without question, it's one of the best and perhaps one of the most underrated films of 2010. Casting is just excellent (it's just eerie how the young Kathy just resembles Carey Mulligan), each shot is just like a painted vivid memory, the screenplay adaptation was outstanding, direction was on point up to the tiniest detail and the musical score just haunts me. But the best part of the movie was the performances of Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield, Sally Hawkins and Charlotte Rampling. The best performance in the movie, however, I'd say was from Andrew Garfield. After seeing The Social Network, I was actually excited to see more great things from him and this movie just proved the fact that he is the real deal. Two scenes stands out to me: one scene is where he reunites with one of the character and gives her a long lingering embrace that just sent me to the brink of tears and the haunting scream towards the end of the movie.In an age where convenience has been a key commodity, the relevance of the movie's message couldn't be more timely. How much of our humanity are we willing to give up just to get a few more years in our lives? The movie and the book is spot on in portraying man's natural instinct --- we will let go even our compassion for the sake of survival.

154,bptr-1,Even Clones have thoughts and feelings,9,4 March 2011,"Seriously, most science-fiction books and movies are set in some alternate reality making it hard to become emotionally attached to the characters and situations. This film presents the science-fiction in a much more subtle way, set in a very real world - the damp and dreary English countryside. This makes the science-fiction aspect all the more chilling, since it hits home in a world we all know and live in. We are forced then to deal with it as a possible part of our own world and must consider all the moral and ethical ramifications that come with it.This backdrop adds all the poignancy to a very bittersweet love story, which is what this story really is - an unconventional and very original love story. We see the tragedy of our own existence written across Kathy's face and in her eyes in every scene. And the ultimate fate that we all must face is what Kathy alone faces in the final scene staring out into open space.I was blown over by Carey Mulligan's acting which, in my opinion, made this film as fantastic as it is.

The film had great sad and melancholic atmosphere and I really felt for all of the characters. Mulligan plays her silent Kathy who hides her feelings with a great subtlety. Knightley is also great as a bitchy but also vulnerable and frightened Ruth. All the other actors were also very good. This is in no way a very pleasant film, it is not only said but it tells us something about tendency of people to accept the fate no matter how bad it is. The whole clone motive in it is only a base for the author to illustrate this tendency. Now I did not read the book so I do not see changes against it but as the film stands I think it is very good.

156,FilmsFillMyHoles,I really don't think I've seen anything quite like this film.,7,21 June 2018,"Okay, so here I am at 4 am, struggling with a little bit of insomnia. I've lately been in the mood for a well-made cosy romantic film, hoping for something along the lines Before Sunrise, right? So when I came across Never Let Me Go in my watchlist it seemed to fit the bill perfectly. After I started the film I noticed that the screenplay was written by Alex Garland, the guy who did Ex Machina, Annihilation and wrote Sunshine. I found it odd, but I rolled with it: I love his work so this should be promising. The film began with the conventional childhood love story premise. It was charming and adorable, but something was a little off (mind you I did not pay as much attention to the first 5 minutes as I probably should have). As the film went on it got progressively weirder and weirder, At around the 40 minute mark I kinda understood Garland's connection to the film. I paused it and checked the IMDb page, and only then did I realize that I've been watching a pretty abstract sci-fi film. So going into Never Let Me Go basically blind gave me a very unique, mesmerizing and slightly frustrating experience that in my sleep-deprived state I definitely was not ready for. So I wasn't able to completely get what the film was trying to say, but mostly what I gathered or managed to interpret was that it's the portrayal/allegory of society's exploitation of its young, maybe? I'm not sure. Like I said I'll definitely need to return to this film in the future to fully get the picture. Despite the initial confusion of my viewing experience I kinda loved Never Let Me Go. The only major issue I have with it is that the narrative style and worldbuilding of the film is left a bit too ambiguous. Other than that it's shot gorgeously and acted beautifully, complemented by an exquisit score. Would recommend, but know what you're getting into.",Never Let Me Go

Give me strength. I am all for suspending belief in certain genres of movies but only where it merits this such as silly action or over the top sci-fi movies.But no our actors believe that the only way out is to defer the inevitable by proving their love for each other and thus delaying their fate by three to four years. So no one fights, no one escapes and and everyone behaves like sheep.I would have marked this movie about a five but marked lower to counter the crazy seven rating this film received in IMDb obviously predominantly by females who no doubt fall for the soppy story line in droves because lets face it females are suckers for this kind of dribble especially when actors can cry on cue.",Never Let Me Go

There are quite a few things that don't make a lot of sense, but they don't detract from the beauty of the movie. The author was using the setting to put forward his ideas and provoke a reaction. It's all about people and their interactions with one another, plus the more blatantly obvious.The acting of the three leads is superlative, in my opinion. They all have substance and are not just pretty faces. The rest of the cast is just as good. The scenery is beautiful and being set in Southern England many people will recognise various locations, head down to Bexhill-on-Sea, if you ever in the area (next to Hastings on the South coast).Ishiguro also wrote Remains of the Day, which was also turned into a movie.

The sci-fi premise, which can't be discussed in any detail without spoilers, is at least as old as Michael Chrichton's ""Coma."" But the storytelling is far more old-fashioned, reaching back to the weepy melodramas of the 19th century. Two girls and a boy who meet in a stereotypically menacing boarding school grow up as a tangled love triangle. As they drape and loll around glumly, we're reminded every frame that this is A TRAGEDY: every interior is dark and shadowy, every exterior a cloudy day, and every second of the film has morbid strings groaning and ululating underneath. All right, we get it! We're supposed to be sad! But we're not, because the three young people are such dull ciphers. The first act, when they're kids in the school, is the best. The kid actors are all surprisingly good, and a sense of foreboding and mystery builds for a little while -- until it crashes to a halt when one of the characters does a quick Basil Exposition and tells us, in a few short lines, pretty much the whole tale. Thus the 2nd and 3rd acts, where they're young adults, are anticlimactic and absolutely devoid of dramatic tension or narrative propulsion. After many slow, dark, rainy, shadowy, quiet scenes, the foregone conclusion is reached, the strings wail like a chorus of hired mourners, and it's over. Pffft.",Never Let Me Go

That would be the acting. It is uniformly sublime. Sally Hawkins continues to dazzle - her performance here is about as far as you can get from her role in 'Happy Go Lucky'. Too bad her role in NLMG is so small. It goes without saying that Carey Mulligan if fast becoming one of the finest actors in film. She takes a limp, passive character and breathes life where is so little. Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield also bring a little life to equally insipid characters, valiantly trying to enliven them from a walking dead state.The direction, while steady, is unimaginative and dull. Scenes take too long. Some inspired editing would have given the story more homogeny and quickened the deadly pace.

As it started to go through the first half, I was a little let down with the development of characters and the fact that so much of this amazing book was not put into the movie. They could have taken a little more time to give you some insight into these characters' lives. By the end I was crying my little eyes out, just as I had in the book. Though the movie is leaps and bounds away from being as good as the novel, it's nice to put pictures to words, especially when these actors are so brilliant in their work. My opinion, read the book first so you understand the characters, then if you'd like, watch the movie.",Never Let Me Go
166,ForVirg,Deeply moving food for thought,8,29 October 2012,"For me, finding this movie was one of those ""finding buried treasure"" experiences. I'd never heard of it, and no one I've mentioned it to in my day-to-day life has heard of it, either.But, after the first viewing, I find myself watching it every single time I come across an airing. Further, as I note some other reviewers have said, I find myself thinking about this story for days afterward. Sometimes it will pop into my mind randomly in between viewings.The one thing that keeps nagging at me after each viewing is an underlying idea brought up by the theme: (WARNING--BIG spoiler ahead) To me, as a big advocate of non-human welfare, this film's theme *should* bring to mind the human treatment of our sentient fellow animals. While the subject may not be happening at this point in time with humans, something quite similar happens every day with other animals bred and raised for human consumption and other uses.And, having personally witnessed the depth of connection and experience of bonds in domesticated species, I have to wonder, after seeing this film, if there aren't times when these other species do--or would, if they can--have similar experiences amongst themselves. Do cattle wonder if there's a deferral for those raised at Farmer John's? It's heartbreaking food for thought. Yet, at the end, one is left with even more grist for the mind's mill. Are we really all so different--us and donors? Or us and cattle? Or us and pigs? Personally, I think not--social mammals are so very much alike in many ways.",Never Let Me Go

I didn't expect to be hit with such shock and emotion all at once. And I certainly didn't expect to love it. A lot of times we go overboard with the struggles of humanity; but we're all human; we can't fix everything. But there's always the will to survive that keeps us going. Living in a unfair world, three friends try to make the best of their lives while they still have time. You can dodge and postpone, but the end is still always there. Life is much shorter for them and there's nothing really they can do about it; but that doesn't stop them from trying anyway. Their friendship is also like a love triangle. The strong emotions displayed by all three actors was phenomenal. This is as good of a story as ""Titanic"" in just about every way imaginable.",Never Let Me Go

This procedure is part of who we are as creatures - we go wondering about the boundaries of our knowledge and our imagination.Well, that doesn't mean that every single ""what if"" question can be turned into a film. Sometimes there just isn 't enough into it. The idea is there - and we can pick up quite clearly modern day symbolisms - but the execution is just plain weak. Probably because the story does not have enough to go on with - at least for a movie.The script is full of gaps and direction is such that we never get to become attached to the main characters and how they feel - mainly because their reactions to events are not believable. What's more, instead of understanding how they really feel (we should be wanting them to feel in one way or the other - I couldn't care less), eventually, we are explicitly told (by means of characters dialogue) what goes on.In my humble opinion, it is a poor effort, in terms of script and direction.",Never Let Me Go
170,jtprius510,Existential Stirring Romantic Science Fiction,9,3 November 2011,"The romantic characteristics of this journey through life are driven by the wheel of a very science fictional sub plot, making this one of the most heart wrenching sci-fi romances I've ever seen about nothingness.While a part of me wants to say that this can be considered another for fans of maybe The Notebook, Mark Romanek's Never Let Me Go goes beyond the boundaries of even today's most conventional romances, by pitting woman against woman, and man against environment, fate.On a surface level let's take an Orwellian, in some way utopist, out of this world concept into perspective and believe in a place where children are bred and raised to be vital organ donors. By a certain age these vital organ donors are expected to start donating until they have in their terms 'completed' their life spans. As vital organ donors neither of these three out of Andrew Garfield, Carrie Mulligan and Keira Knightly has much time left so while these two women Ruth and Cathy H already have their hearts set on who they want to die with, Tommy has to make a decision, a fact even he is oblivious to. The science fictional circumstances of its' plot are what allows Romanek along with his triangular cast to take subtle aesthetic liberties with both the film and acting.Out of Romanek's science fictional surrealistic imagery and the moving performances given by Garfield, Mulligan and Knightly I can't decide which out of these two keep me coming back to this film. All I know is that whenever I do I leave with something new. For something so simple, never let me go is heavy and this isn't the type of picture that you need any mental preparation to sit yourself down to.It just touches something deep, philosophically moving.",Never Let Me Go
171,Donny_Stay,"Brilliant performances, somewhat uneven film",7,29 September 2010,"Just got back. I'm afraid to say... I thought it was mostly enjoyable, but overall, not truly a great film. The film suffers greatly from losing Ishiguro's prose, and is largely reduced to a summary of events from the novel. As such, a lot of the moments lose their impact -- in fact, some of them threaten to become melodrama. Mark Romanek seems to be a competent director, and there are some affecting scenes, but he's not capable of overcoming the theoretical (shh, you know) aspects of the story. Those theoretical aspects will feel like the point of the exercise, and the emotional bits will seem incidental, especially for those who have never read the novel.It must be said, however, that Carey Mulligan is brilliant in the film. She's possibly deserving of another Oscar nomination, and if this turns out to be a weak year, she's practically guaranteed one. All the actors acquit themselves well (especially the child actors), but Mulligan in particular is outstanding.I dunno, I'm heavily biased, as I'm very fond of the novel, but overall I don't know if I can wholeheartedly recommend this film to those who haven't read the novel -- it might seem like flimsy science fiction. To those who have read it, you may well enjoy the film, but it is unquestionably an inferior experience.",Never Let Me Go

Douglas Adams' invention of the pig that wants to be eaten was a good joke but this film seeks to take the same principle to present truisms as profound insight. ""Life is short"" is about as profound as saying the sky is up there and the ground is down there. I have not read the novel (and nor will I after seeing this tripe) but I have read 'Remains of the Day' which was made into a good film. Maybe he has run out of ideas and has to scrape up plots from Hollywood blockbusters like 'The Island'.",Never Let Me Go
173,Spring15,"Quietly horrifying, but definitely worth seeing",10,2 January 2012,"This is an amazing movie. I recently watched it on DVD. While it was in theatres, I don't even recall hearing about it, which is a pity.It indirectly addresses the issue of the ethics of scientific research, but it is not preachy. It tells the story of three children who appear to be just normal children at a boarding school in England, who grow up to become young adults. Slowly we learn the truth behind their existence and the life that is planned for them. It is shocking and heart breaking at the same time. The acting is first rate by the three main characters Carey Mulligan (Kathy H.), Andrew Garfield (Tommy D.) and Keira Knightly (Ruth). The supporting cast is very good. The children who play the younger versions of the characters have also done well, particularly the girl who plays young Kathy.The movie takes place in an alternate universe. It starts by telling us about a scientific breakthrough, which would improve human life expectancy, and then we hear words like Carer, people making donations, etc. Those make sense as a little of the truth is revealed as the movie progresses. We see their lives through the eyes of Kathy, the narrator. We experience their joys and sorrows, their helplessness and sometimes their anger about their fate, their desire to do something about it, and finally acceptance.I developed a strong dislike for Miss Emily, the principal (I think) of the school, but she too was a pawn in the hands of those who created this cloning farm, to prolong the life expectancy of some humans. I did not see the movie as sci-fi. It's more like the story of humanity- the suffering due to old age, the fear of death. The clones also have the same fears, they too feel emotions. They too want to spend more time with their loved ones, but they cannot because they are trapped in their situations. It indirectly addresses the fear of old age and diseases, the fear of death which all humans- clones or not- face. In the end Kathy says - (paraphrasing) everyone ""completes"" which is a word used for the ending of life of a clone in the movie. The music is hauntingly beautiful, and English countryside is photographed wonderfully. Both add to the impact of the movie.This movie made me sad and disturbed for a few days after watching it. It's tragic and it made me think about scientific breakthroughs in a different light. The credit must go to the writer Kazuo Ishigura of the book, and to those who made this movie. I just wish it had been more successful at the box office. If you like thought provoking movies, this movie could be for you, but be prepared to feel many emotions even after the movie ends.",Never Let Me Go
174,rostsit,Avoid this,1,2 June 2014,"This is very sick film. Usually I would never write a BAD review - if I didn't like the movie or the game I would just leave it be - it's far better to use my time to praise some really good works than to bash the unsuccessful ones.But I'll make an exception for this movie - this is just how bad it is. I can hardly even imagine why I must give it even one point? OK, maybe operator work was decent enough, main cast did their job well and it was some feel of horrible dystopia there. That's it. But none of these factors compensate the fails of plot and story.And let's not even begin that I didn't get the ""message"" of this story. Oh, I got it pretty well. Clones are people too, they have souls, the society (shown in the film) is very ill and is an actual allegory to our own society and its possible future. Nothing new, nothing original, NOTHING, that would make you think, the movie is created to make you disgusted by said society for the sake of making you disgusted. Shock for shocking. And then of course there is the worst element of them all - the theme of ""acceptance"" of their own fate, ""sacrifice"" and ""non-resistance"". Sounds pretty good but implementation is just below LOW. Nothing is properly explained, and this isn't the case where ""you should make your own judgment"" because no judgment here will make any sense. All characters seem to have a kind of lobotomy in the early age. Yet they have some normal emotions, they can love, hate and envy, but they would just never resist the system for apparently no reason at all. They don't want to die, but they won't even try to run or hide despite they are FREE TO MOVE. And all these nonsense is happening in an incredibly slow pace.All in all, I don't now what was more disgusting to me - the System of that dystopian society, the main Character, who calmly watched the ""killing"" process of her beloved, or the creator of this embarrassment, who stole 2 hours of my life.",Never Let Me Go
175,dan-1315,Mood stays with you,7,27 June 2012,"There's many ways to judge whether a film is successful, and certainly or some things to consider is whether it evokes a mood and whether it stays with you the next day. On those terms, I think ""Never Let Me Go"" is successful. I certainly felt the sadness and the inevitability these characters suffer, and I still thought about their situation the next day. The film is also beautifully shot and the images are stark and haunting.But I do agree with the reviews that the science fiction elements of the story have been dialed down -- way down. The film chooses to emphasize the relationship between three friends who are taught from childhood that their purpose is to donate their organs in this alternative reality where apparently cloning was pioneered in 1952. Very little is actually explained about how this affects society except to keep everyone alive to age 100. Have the clones been totally brainwashed to accept their fate? Do none of the clones have the desire to run? Some of them seem to be child-like even in adulthood, is that the answer? And why are the doctors only taking one organ at a time? You would expect in a fully realized world at least some people would be protesting the use of clones for replacement parts and there would be a movement for the rights of clones. But there's none of that here. And that's the film's problem. It's big on emotion, but weak on science fiction concepts.

177,MichaelFab,Nice Looking Film Doesn't Know What It's About,4,1 March 2011,"Beautifully made with a suitable cast, this film is lost within its themes, The story needs more development. The title evokes a romantic thought, but it is, however, a dystopian society in the English countryside, reminiscent of ""Children of Men."" Three childhood friends in a love triangle will grow up to face their fate in a world controlled by science.Sally Hawkins, the only sign of humanity in their world, brushes the surface of explanation in her short appearance. She foretells her young students that soon their childhood will end and they will begin a life of donating their organs. So is this science fiction, a romantic drama, or are the characters just victims of medical science? If you're smarter than me, you figured out that they were lab experiments to begin with.Carey Mulligan, who lost her adolescent love, is the only friend not tested on because she volunteered to work in this practice. She narrates the film adequately, but on camera all she does is pout and look gloomy, and that becomes annoying.Andrew Garfield is the most interesting character, Tommy. Nervous and worried of his own mortality, he uses what energy he has left painting, hoping that his talent will ""defer"" experimentation and extend his life. Garfield is good when he underplays his role, like in Red Riding 1974.Kiera Knightly, in a subdued performance, is the girlfriend who stole Andrew from Carey. Initially possessive towards Carey about him, she later becomes fragile after being used for medicine and reconciles to her. Charlotte Rampling is nice to see, as the modest school headmaster, but her character is ineffective. I expected her to be sinister and evil.Adam Kimmel's cinematography is exceptional. But what's missing is sympathy, fear and emotional loss because we don't understand what the film is supposed to be.",Never Let Me Go
178,lauralmhs,Excellent cinematic adaptation,8,25 October 2010,"I just recently finished reading Never Let Me Go. I have very rarely been so intrigued by the subject matter of a book and at the same time so bored by its style. Never Let Me Go, the book, was deadly dull. Still, I was so intrigued, as I say, by the plight of these characters, that I was compelled to see how the book translated to the big screen. You might say I felt this novel and original storyline deserved a second chance.All in all, I give the movie adaptation a thumbs up, with one big caveat: I think those who did not read the book first would be left scratching their heads. While the book was slow and plodding (and devoted MUCH too much detail to certain occurrences in the storyline), nevertheless it offered the opportunity for reflection on the subtleties of what was taking place. Given the pacing of a typical movie, if you blink, you might miss something momentous and I think that was the case with this movie, so it certainly helped to have read the book prior to seeing the film. The screenwriters did an excellent job of condensing the book, and I felt, after having read it, that condensing was precisely what this otherwise compelling and poignant story required.Never Let Me Go was a lyrical and visually beautiful production. The accompanying musical score was appropriate to a sad and heartbreaking story. The acting was terrific - especially by Cary Mulligan whose sad eyes reveal the melancholy of her character, and Keira Knightly, especially in the hospital scene where she portrays a nearly depleted ""donor."" I didn't care much for the male lead, but his one outbreak of emotion upon having his hopes of a ""deferral"" dashed was very significant. And the character of Miss Lucy comes across as more sympathetic in the movie than in the book.My criterion for a good movie is this: If it stays with me once I hit the sidewalk in front of the theater, rather than evaporating like smoke, well, that's a good movie. Never Let Me Go has stayed with me. The ending left me with a feeling that although these fictionalized characters were little more than lab rats, we all, in a sense, share a similar fate. Life is short, loss hurts, live and love while you can. It rarely happens that I enjoy a movie adaptation more than the book on which it was based, but I would have to say that was the case here.

179,hellaszer,"Profound? Maybe. Motionless, depressing, pointless, vague? Definitely.",3,9 March 2013,"This is a big disappointment for me. I have been searching for the movie for ages, as it looked so promising. Well, it was in vain.I was hoping to see a breathtaking storyline (with a little science fiction spice to it), drama, love, scenery. The setting tells it all: the grey clouds of England settles on our minds, too. The story started out interestingly: I had chills of mystery, I had no idea what their destiny could be. Then boumm. We get to know they are born to die. They keep seeking their origins - did they have a junkie mom? Were they unwanted? We never know. They are certainly not from very bad background as their health is good enough to donate organs. But then the mood of the film settles to a depressive monotony: scenes happen, years pass. To be very honest even this ""love triangle"" didn't touch my heart, not the least. We never really get to know what they felt deep down, just the surface. They are walking around as robots, accepting their fate without and rebellion. They are not even TALKing about getting away, or what if....I was thinking at least they could have fought at the very end, when they got to know no, there isn't and there was never a possibility to live longer. Why didn't they call the media, stand on a roof, shout out that WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS and not machines and we have the power to choose about our lives and not you: and jump. At the end they - and us! - deserved a demonstration of some freedom and dignity. They didn't get one. And Tom screams. Impotant, angry and helpless - as this whole movie was. There is nothing we can find as a consolation for our urge to be humans, we lost our power. I guess it is still the kind of movie that makes you think. So I give 3 little stars. But I lacked all the rest that comes with a good movie: at least some good music, real drama, real dialogues and please anything but monotony (if not I flee).Maybe the book was more to the point....I can only hope",Never Let Me Go
180,rb-66,completely misses the tone of the book,3,26 November 2011,"I watched this film shortly after reading Ishiguro's astonishing novel an really wish I hadn't. The most important thing to be said is if you haven't read the book, READ IT, absolutely read it before seeing the film. The book is amazing.If you've read and loved the book, give the film a miss. Romanek and Garland didn't really get it. The relationship between Kathy, Ruth and Tommy is completely wrong. A critical aspect of the book is the bond that remains between the three despite their various fights and relationships. The film turns this into a simplistic and clichéd love triangle. This failure to capture the tone of the novel is repeated throughout the film. They even crucially changed the most important scene from the book, the scene that gives it its name FFS! To those of you complaining that the plot is implausible... firstly, do understand the concept of fiction? Secondly, the fact that the characters know their fate and don't try to escape apart from deferring IS PRECISELY THE POINT MORONS! But even despite that, the film makers (or maybe the studio execs) clearly predicted this response from brain-dead audiences and so introduced the bracelets, that were not in the book, to explain why they can't escape (a complete travesty by the way).It's difficult to work out what the film was aiming for. It diverges too problematically from the book to appeal to Ishiguro fans but the story was never really going to translate to a mainstream cinema audience. I guess its disappointing Ishiguro didn't realize this and refuse to let them do it.",Never Let Me Go
181,mediumyale,"""Never Let Me Go"" is a jewel of a film",9,18 October 2010,"I was in awe of the visual overtones in this gorgeously made film. Deep, subtle, beautiful and cryptic--""Never Let Me Go"" is sure to instigate profound conversations after the screening. Like ""Dead Man Walking"" (1995) and ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004) there's a social morale buried under this sumptuous love story.The film follows the friendship of three children growing up in a tightly-secured boarding school in Britain, beginning in 1978. They are cutoff from the outside world; a life without a choice, but a life with a designated focus. The story spans almost three decades, following them from childhood to adulthood. The surroundings are ever constant, even though the film follows them for three decades.I would love to reveal what these special individuals are modeled and raised for, but giving away that revelation wouldn't be fair to the viewers. I must say, it's a very unique premise; one that gives the audience a very improbable connection between images and content. ""Never Let Me Go"" struck a nerve. I felt for these characters, very deeply. I wanted them to realize what these young and loving individuals could've achieved in the world they grew up in. They were brainwashed into thinking they were isolated from everyone else, but in reality, there were no boundaries. They could've escaped from the life they were brought-up in and should've rebelled from the establishment. Angry, sad, sweet, longing, optimistic—I love it when a film channels these ambivalent emotions and allows me to ponder about an alternate direction for the characters to venture into. If a film does that, then it must work.After viewing this movie, I'm very curious about picking up the novel to see how the filmmakers translated the descriptions into these picturesque images. My guess is that the book is written on the same lines as ""The Horse Whisperer""—with deft metaphors and rich characterizations.As much as I wanted closure to the narrative, I think the film does a great justice by leaving the audience in the dark. It gives the viewer more room to think, and it stimulates an array of intelligent inquiries. ""Never Let Me Go"" dares the viewer to look beyond the beautiful imagery and delicate character interrelationships, and discover a multitude of hidden meanings and themes. Above all, this is an exquisitely crafted tale about love, loss, individuality, and the boundaries of life.",Never Let Me Go
182,joyfuljaymac,'Are We All Complete?,7,22 December 2013,"I've just finished watching 'Never Let Me Go' and i was moved to my very core.It starts of at boarding school called Hailsham House, where the three main characters, Kathy, Ruth and Tommy stay, learn and grow up into what they must become, donors and carers. The child actors did a brilliant job in setting up who the characters are, their personalities and relationships. We get an idea of who we expect them to grow up to be.When the adults take over, it's just as magical. Once they've grow up, the three get moved to cottages on a farm where they meet others just like them but with far more experiences. We then learn more about what donors and carers are and their role in society. We then see Ruth and Tommy's relationship become sexual, which puts more strain on their friendship with Ruth. We then learn that the 'clones' think that they are modeled after someone, they call them 'Originals.'and set off in search of Ruth's. They then learn about 'Deferrals', a temporary reprieve from organ donation for donors who are in love and can somehow prove it. But apparently it's all just rumors.We then see Kathy become a carer, and how she fits into society. She has watched many clones gradually ""complete"" as their organs are harvested. Kathy has not seen Ruth or Tommy since the cottages. While working as a carer, Kathy happens to meet Ruth again, who is frail and unwell after two donations. They then meet up with Tommy and go on a brief little holiday, where Ruth tells them that she got in the way of their relationship because she wanted a deferral. She then gives them the address of the madams who taught them. They got to find out if they can get a deferral. Are the rumors true?'Never Let Me Go' is a film of childlike wonder, romance, sacrifice and hope. The casting is amazing, as all three give outstanding performances and bounce well of each other.

183,JessyCritical,It will linger in your mind after watching,8,29 May 2011,"Never Let Me Go depicts the bleak story of three best friends who were raised, more or less, isolated from the rest of the world along with other ""special"" children. The reason behind their different upbringing remains a secret until over half an hour in to the film. The truth behind Hailsham is hinted at until then, but nothing is clear until Miss Lucy speaks up and announces the reality of their destiny. This tale of an alternative history, set in the mid 20th century is, at times, shocking and disheartening. The blunt references to ""donors"" and ""completion"" make for an emotional watch; what is really going on here? As this film is set in the past it makes it even more believable and seems even more able to happen today. With great performances all-round it is hard to criticise Never Let Me Go. Keira Knightley is completely credible as the envious and sometimes, unfriendly Ruth. Andrew Garfield portrays the uncreative, angry, boy stuck in the middle surprisingly well. The best performance definitely comes from Carey Mulligan who plays Kathy, the central character of the story. Mulligan creates an incredibly likable character that the audience will immediately associate with. Her naivety, longing for love and her acceptance of her fate is devastating, yet applaudable. The constant flow of music throughout adds even more sadness to this film and makes what is happening truly heart-breaking. The sombre tone is easily maintained throughout, added to by Carey Mulligan's perfect portrayal of Kathy. Beginning in the middle of the film gives the audience's reason to find out why Kathy chose to become a carer, and why her life is how it is. However, the dark reason behind these questions is unexpected and shocking, to say the least. The main question you will probably ask yourself when you watch this question is ""why?"" This is because there are so many questions left unanswered. Why do they not rebel against their situation? Why do they accept their fate? Despite Never Let Me Go falling in to the science-fiction category, I would rather label it as a romantic mystery. Purely, because it focuses on a, somewhat, love triangle and you will be left guessing and creating your own assumptions throughout. The answers you have will not be properly answered, and it is because of this you may find the story hard to believe. On the other hand, it is this ambiguity that makes the film even more compelling. The lack of answers will also allow you, the audience, to draw your own conclusions and fill in any gaps with your own ideas. Deliberately misleading the audience appears to be something the director (Mark Romaneck) and the screenplay writer (Alex Garland) wanted to achieve. Believing that the children can escape their destiny with a few drawings is something we, and the characters in the film, hope for. Also, a select few can be chosen for a ""deferral"" if they can prove to be in true love. To sum up, Never Let Me Go is a wonderfully told, beautiful story of love, friendship and hope. If you don't feel a tiny bit moved by this film, you probably won't be by any other. I was surprised at its ability to linger in my mind after watching. So, if you want a film that will keep you watching, waiting and wishing to the end, then Never Let Me Go is a definite must.",Never Let Me Go

187,skfla500,Rather Morbid,3,28 March 2011,"*3&1/2Stars* I liked Carey Mulligan in another film so I picked this up. I should have done some research before renting. & I certainly recommend renting -NOT BUYING-this one. Fyi, I do like the odd bittersweet, coming of age movie but the characters here are pretty lifeless. I had to really push myself to identify with them-or even care about them(I do admit that some of the childhood scenes were heart rending). I never had any feelings at all about the main male char. & someone should tell K. Knightley that she cant play 18 anymore. Mulligan did a fair job but after watching her work in An Education, I'm a little bias. The overall premise was the main reason I gave the movie any stars at all. You have to wonder as cloning advances, what will come next. The one statement by the headmistress does make me curious-what does society say when faced with an ethical question of this nature? I agree with her. They'll just so ""no"". Or ""so what?"" And keep carving up the needed organs wherever it can get them. I'm incredibly curious to see what the so called Civil/Human/Animal rights activists would say if they or their family members were faced with choices like those glanced on in the movie. Honestly I think they would find a way to justify, just like society did in the movie, the creation of a new slave class of people. But maybe I'm being too cynical. To have the viewers think about the ethics and purpose of cloning may have been the main reason for making the film. Or was the movie just commenting upon how that as we age, we gain in experience & wisdom, but lose pieces of ourselves along the way? Or perhaps the standard, ""we all die someday so its HOW we live not how LONG we live that's important?"" I'm confused. Anyway, it clearly wasn't meant to be an edgy or money maker type of movie. So I guess it was partly successful. But ouch, its a pretty painful 2 hours to sit through in order to open up a dialog on whateva the moviegoer was meant to take away... Reviewers keep saying the book was exceptional but after watching the movie, I don't think I can generate the interest to focus more attention on this topic right now.",Never Let Me Go
188,CuriousGrl,"Subtle, Moving and Redeeming",10,3 March 2011,"This moving masterpiece directed by Mark Romanek based on the book raises some thought provoking questions. Spoilers ahead We all die (complete). What makes us human? These clones could face and accept their death and their creators couldn't and had to create clones to delay the inevitable, making clones more ""human"" then their creators. A question of why they didn't run away often comes up. Well it was a life they knew from the inside they never looked at it from the outside perspective as cruel as their predicament was they learned to accept it from early on and never question it. But even if they questioned the system, there is nothing they could do to change it. Should Kathy have started a revolution? I don't think the movie is about what she should have done. One of the oldest themes is that we should make the world a better place. Another is that we should be grateful for what we have. I think both are right. They don't contradict, but complement each other. This movie is probably more about acceptance, then the need to question and improve the system. Questioning the system may not provide answers. In her world she is doomed, but even if she ran away and hid, or started a revolt, there is still a greater system that she cannot overcome (we are all mortal, and her masters complete as well). There is always a system. The tragedy isn't in not realizing it, but in the futile struggle to overcome it. Which is what the regular people in that world do and in the process lose their compassion and humanity. The teacher who is honest with them is probably the only decent human being and she is kicked out. Its Kathy's ability to come to face with her limitations and accepting them that makes her human. Ruth, who is selfish all her life becomes a better human being in doing the right thing. Tommy is at peace before they pull the plug. Kathy understands that her predicament is tough, but she learns not to give in to despair and enjoy what she had and what she has left. Maybe another point of this movie is not that finding love makes life more valuable (worthy of extension), but that it makes it more beautiful while it lasts.",Never Let Me Go

It is more a story about how finding out your life is not what you believe and dealing with the inevitable horror with dignity. No, there are no monsters or apocalyptic flashiness, but what looks like a coming of age drama has a dystopic twist. The theme music running through the movie is a major focus for the cohesion between both parts of the movie.

With a 10 star distribution and a fantastic screenplay, ""Never Let Me Go"" delivers a beautiful and haunting drama, mix in surreal. The kids, Kathy (Carey Mulligan), Tommy (Andrew Garfield) and Ruth (Keira Knightley), have no vision of the future, they live for the moment. In an excess of spirituality, this movie tells the sad and poetic story of three kids that cannot reach adult life. Right from childhood, they understand their own meaning on Earth, a sad one. This is a movie without hope. After the fail of winning a delay in their black fate, with the help of love, Tommy and Kathy embrace what is to come. ""Never Let Me Go"" is about a short and dark love story, transcended in humanity. The Individual, watched as a simple piece of meat, without any feelings or goals. Their act of sacrifice is a prove of greatness, but what about those that are managing such a horrible ""organ farm""? What about morals? And free choice? And what about giving a chance to love? The shocking in ""Never Let Me Go"" it consist in a magnificent acceptation of fate, that scared me, in some manners. NLMG is a wonderful movie, that deserves Oscar recognition. The performance of Andrew Garfield can shatter a lot of hearts. I'll keep an eye on Garfield and Mulligan, and also on Keira Knightley, very good in her Ruth role.

This movie has everything going for it, from a creative, intelligent novel, to an excellent screenplay to a sensitive director who expresses it so perfectly. The music, production design, timing and titles are meticulously done. Kudos to the creative production team and crew.I won't say much about the plot except that it is set in what seems to be earth in a parallel universe or one possible version of contemporary society if certain scientific breakthroughs occurred in our health-care system. It is a what-if scenario but one that asks very potent questions and gives the viewer the time to consider them. It is a thinking person's movie. What health-care could become It is paced slowly enough to give the viewer time to reflect, time for critical thought and time to use your imagination. Time to consider what choices society could make given certain medical breakthroughs I really can't say enough about how well done this movie is and I highly recommend seeing this most engaging film.Russ^",Never Let Me Go
195,digression_jim,Haunting Film... **Spoiler Alert**,9,5 February 2011,"Do not read on if you have not seen this movie...I watched Never let me go last night and I am still thinking about it this morning, what has stayed with me is not what I saw on screen but what I did not see. I am compelled to write this review and as I have already said... SPOILERS.It is said at the start of the film that the average life expectancy is now 100.We only have to wait 20 minutes (a lot earlier than in the book) to discover that we are watching a story about cloning. We are told that most clones will complete (die) by their 3rd donation. If we assume that each clone is donating to their original and the organs are not used for other patients, then the use of the word average at the beginning of the movie implies that all people in the real are able to have a clone. The clones we see are special they are brought up in a facility that imitates a boarding school. In this facility, the teachers who seem to be pro lifers are trying to test the students to see if they have a soul (all of this is left very ambiguous until near the end). It is then said that the school was closed, so we are led to assume that the teachers either did not find, or were closed down before they had the chance to prove the existence of a soul in this group of cloned humans. Now we are also told that since Hailsham (the school) closed down the rumors are that the clones are now raised in battery farm like conditions. What the viewer is then left to contemplate on (given that we are already aware that cloning is rampant) is the fact that somewhere in this peaceful green English land there are concrete and steel factories producing cloned babies, that as no soul has been proved to exist are one assumes treated no better than cattle. The mind conjures up conditions of mistreatment on a par with animal slaughter houses but with young children or early stage adults at the least. (When one thinks of the population of the UK the slaughter must be on a massive scale)This film is haunting, the treatment on the operating table of the two characters who we see donate is awful. Keira Knightly's character is left disemboweled, the machine beeps it's last, the doctors leave the room and turn off the lights leaving her corpse on the table. No attempt is made to cover the corpse or close her eyes, one can only assume a clean up crew will come along and collect the leftovers (which is what they are here leftovers not human remains) for some purpose such as glue making in another factory somewhere. What does it also say about the people who let this happen, those that voted for it and those who use clone. If you are replacing your organs to live to 100, say you begin to need them around the age of 80 that means perfectly healthy duplicate copies of yourself are to die and suffer so you the wrinkly old life lived has been can have another few years to potter around. Above all, these old people are literally killing themselves so that they can go on living. If cloning were to really happen why not clone a younger version of yourself to carry on your life's work, to leave all your worldly goods to, so in some way you are almost able to achieve immortality. See this movie, understand this movie, carry this movie in your heart for a while then tell others to do the same.",Never Let Me Go

197,gwood194,It won't let me go...,10,18 January 2011,"Once in a while a film comes along that just stays in your mind for a long time. This is one of those and it does so for several reasons - it is a beautifully made film that just doesn't skip a beat - but, more importantly, it explores issues that are uncomfortable for us. Just as ""Brokeback Mountain"" tenderly explored issues we'd prefer to keep in the back of our minds, so ""Never Let Me Go"" explores the issue of cloning. More specifically, it explores the issue of creating clones to be used as organ donors. This has been explored before in ""The Island"" but that didn't touch my heart as this one did. (""Coma"" also looked at the organ donation issue - but from a different angle.) The folks who work in bioethics and theology have batted around the issue of ""ensoulment"" - when does a human get his soul - and, of course they have no answer. Late in this movie, Kathy and Tommy are told that the contests they had in school weren't to see what kind of soul they had but whether they had one (a soul) at all. And therein lies the question - if we determine that clones don't have souls, is it OK to ""farm"" them in this manner? The thing that's most disturbing about this film is that it could - and probably will - happen. All the flap about stem cell research slowed things down a bit but we may be sure that this sort of thing is being planned even as I write this. If there is a way to make a dollar, big business will have its way.Don't misunderstand, I'm as interested as anyone in prolonging our lives.

It tells it all about love, any yet without much of it really manifesting - similarly as in another great film about love, the Kar Wai Wong's In the Mood for Love.It is one of these rare movies that pulls the viewer into the story, leads him/her into the silence and opens up softness and vulnerable emphatic spaces within. And it remains with us for quite a while after the credits have run out.Carey Mulligan is remarkable, and so is Andrew Garfield. Hey, he is an actor indeed!

If this was an alternate reality, then it was a reality in which non-human creatures took human form. The nation that produced the magna carta, the abolition of the slave trade, and equal suffrage would somehow quietly assent to this gross violation of human rights?

200,blackledgec,Bleak and upsetting... but worth a watch.,8,6 February 2011,"Watched this film last night as film 4 were involved in making it. Wasn't quite sure what I was expecting. In some ways a good thing and in some ways a bad thing. It's kind of like an actuality of the island film concept.Rather than rapid stem cell to adult growth, the clones are born as babies into a semi-closed institution, where they are given a boarding school childhood but without any loving parents to go to in the weekends. The film starts off in the 1970's, adding to the feasibility of the plot. When they get a new teacher arriving at the school, the main plot of the story is revealed. We find out that the children are clones and that they are to be used as organ donors for their original selves. Unlike the island, these poor things have nowhere to turn to, as their lives progress into young adulthood and can never break from the system that has predetermined their fates.Only one, almost insignificant, glimmer of hope to be saved, arrives during the film. However the film doesn't spend much time with such optimism and the 2 remaining main character's hopes are dashed. There is a current of impending doom throughout the whole film, that stirs a heap of emotions, that left me feeling flat, sad and generally uncomfortable. A main focus of hope is taken away from the film quite early on and so you're left watching it all as a morbid voyeur, waiting for them to die.And because the film starts during their childhood, the film's ending literally hurts from an emotional perspective. It has a real life outcome that many people would want to avoid watching. So yes, as it did me, it'll upset some people.The bad guys in this film are society along with the brains behind the institution in which the film is set. The good guys die for them, which makes it all the more bleak when watching.In the end you are left with just their experiences during their relatively short lives. Who had the happiest life e.t.c.

It depends on who it is and which side the person happens to be at.The slow pace is almost hypnotic and the music is so perfect for the drive of the story. If the pace had been any faster the whole movie would have been different and I think the meaning with it would have been spoiled. A perfect pace with perfect subtle acting - well done.However, I think the old-fashioned production of environment, clothes and behavior is a little strange. I got the feeling that the film could play out around 1940-1950 but the story itself should be in the future.

The fact that it is set in a somewhat dystopian reality is extremely subtle and not overtly scifi. Instead, the science fiction element plays out more along the lines of films like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, keeping the focus of the film on the three main characters and the emotional highs and lows they experience as their fates unfold before them. The core of this drama could be deconstructed and reconstructed at any period in history; past, present, future, real, or fictitious. It is essentially a story about humanity and the experience of grasping one's own mortality and the mortality of those we love throughout our lives. It reminds us that we are lucky to be here now, and feel what we feel.

Either way, the movie was thought provoking, the cinematography was beautifully done and the casting was perfect. This is the type of movie that you might wish to watch more than one time because the theme is very perplexing. It shows us how if conditioned either from birth or over long periods of time, we can be molded into thinking we have no other choice than what has been told to us. Either that or we can see that selflessness exists in some people so strongly that they put others needs ahead of their own without much effort to find happiness for themselves.

Certain scenes sure will have a haunting affect on you. Mulligan's acting is solid. Knighley's emotional performance is intense.

And it is so unsubtle in its overt subtlety, and so layered on, that we're engineered and navigated to a sad inevitable finale.

It is easy to do something that will record in someone's memory by injure him psychologically. But does this make a movie good ? No. The abuse of the viewer can be neither the purpose nor the medium.

Throughout the movie, however, it continued to go on and on about all these underlying plots that somehow the directors thought we would just understand ourselves. It got a bit long, boring, and just draining.After getting to know more about what's going on, I started to then realize it was just like the older film (except a drama version), of The Island played by Ewan McGregor and Scarlet Johannsen. I mean, if you are going to make a film, can we not use the same premise as another film and make it 20x more boring?I definitely would've loved it more if the story line was tied together better.

Well I haven't read that book, so just took the film at face value. I loved the way it looked. Just loved it. I have watched it twice now. Once for visceral emotional impact which left me feeling like I had been run over by a steamroller. OK it is a dehydrating sob-fest. The second time I watched it was in a more self-questioning mode teasing out the reasons for my own unexpected reactions. Perhaps you should know I am a golden-ager and this movie dredged up and revived stuff I haven't felt since I was a teenager. Tommy personified for me 'the boyfriend I never had' but really wanted. I didn't know I still harboured such bitter regrets . . but there they were. Like other people, I have severe reservations about an over exposed Keira Knightley but she was the perfect bitch in this. The film simply has great casting. The kids in it are all brilliant. Loved all the very 'mauve' worthy lady teachers.

I have two reviews of this movie. First: Are you kidding me? The whole premise of the movie was absolutely INSANE, morbid and just down right stupid! Because of advances of medicine (curing cancers, etc.), kids are now being raised as organ donors. Are we to believe that the world would be OK with this? That something like this could even take place? That every kid who was raised like this is just going to accept it? I mean throughout the movie I kept yelling at the screen ""RUN AWAY YOU IDIOTS""...At least if a character in the movie did try and run away, we would have seen the consequences of someone trying to get out of their donation. But no, everyone walks around like an idiot stupidly accepting their fate. Come on, Really??Second: OK, so I'm not totally ""Mr. Literal"". There are plenty of movies out there that ask me to suspend disbelief in order to enjoy the movie...Never Let Me Go was not one of those movies....I did in fact, while watching the movie go along with insane plot line, accepting its premise (just hoping it was get better). But even if you can do that, there's no getting around how utterly depressing this movie was. It's one depressing moment after another, climaxing to one final depressing moment (as she's looking at Tommy on his last and final donation). It was like the writer of the book/movie wanted to create a dark and dreary story about no hope, and doomed lovers. I kept asking myself, why would anyone want to write a story about this?Oh yeah, the two stars goes to the acting. The three actors playing the main characters did a great job.Overall this movie was stupid and as depressing as Angela's Ashes.

Go see a movie for certain entertainment, read books for another kind.The emotions this film stirs all come with tears, but unlike other reviews I've read, they are not all with sadness. Carey Mulligan is able to pull off convincing the moviegoer of her intense, vulnerable, joyous and doomed love for Tommy. This love resonates throughout the film, and this is something few actors/actresses seem able to pull off with such conviction. The depth of Kath's love for Tommy is the main source of tears. I was totally absorbed in her naivety and vulnerability, caused by this love.The film is mostly about sad things, but it is a fictitious storyline that is at best ridiculous and must be overlooked. The fact that the film is set in the 70's and 80's (probably the same time line as the book) just doesn't ring true, but is far superior to a similar premised big budget film like The Island(Ewan McGreggor).This film was totally enjoyable,and ideal entertainment for anyone over 16.One of those films I'm glad I watched, if only to discover the amazing acting qualities of Carey Mulligan.",Never Let Me Go

I can't disagree more. Slowly and gradually, the filmmakers reveal to us a society of absolute fascism. Its very victims suffer some sort of Stockholm syndrome believing they're sacrificing their young lives for the common good, their sole purpose of existence being to save other people's lives. It's not that they have no choice or lack the guts to escape - they see no choice. It's their noble sacrifice that makes this kind of sick society possible.The spooky alternative-history atmosphere is conveyed very subtly from the start with tiny hints like mismatched fashion trends, the 'boarding school' regulations that don't quite sum up or a close-up of a car's number plate that couldn't have been issued at that particular period. The acting is heart-wrenching and the imagery is atmospheric and infused with deep symbolism. This isn't an in-your-face sci fi flick: this is a serious work of art and it's absolutely unforgettable.

216,mike_k56,Too many unanswered questions...,6,18 April 2012,"There were too many unanswered questions in this movie that I'm sure would be in the book. I think the guys who adapted this to screen did a very good job, but they really cheated audiences in certain ways.This was a beautifully shot and acted film. But I feel like the movie simply WAS NOT as loyal to the book as it could have been. (This is coming from someone who hasn't had the chance to read the book). I just intuitively know that there are holes.The hole that really bothers me the most in the movie is the question of why these kids voluntarily show up to these hospitals to get cut up? The characters seemed to have free will, and no electronic chips in their heads for mind control. There was little sign of brainwashing in the movie, and no mention of genetic programming to make them believe this is their destiny.To be honest, none of them seemed like they were crazy about the idea of being harvested... so why mix that with elements of free will? In fact, the woman who was fired from the school was fired for telling them their new destiny, and the matron of the school hinted that there will be no subversion allowed.I also didn't see a single cop in the movie who could have dragged them in.WHAT GIVES?? Also, why is there no mention of, or even appearance of, these people who will receive these organs?Time to read the book I suppose. Overall, a decent movie, but so story flawed and shortchanged the audience.",Never Let Me Go
217,NyxEos,"Loved it in Theory, Bored with the Reality",6,15 December 2012,"I decided to watch this movie on two premises: 1) It has Keira Knightley, who I adore in nearly everything I see her in, which is basically everything she's in. 2) While the preview made the love story seem pretty slow paced, the dystopian twist in the description drew me in.Lets start with what I did like. The acting was superb, from the big names such as Knightley and Garfield, and those who I had never heard of before, such as Carey Mulligan. I also very much liked the idea of the movie and the themes it presents, such as love, envy, and greed. I had two major problems with the movie. The first, is my unwillingness to accept the premise of the danger. Many movies have considered the same ethical issues, but have done so in a way that the mass population is not aware of the breach in ethics, or the lines are blurred because for instance, the protagonists are not fully aware. In this movie however, everyone is fully aware (although not right away), which I don't believe to be possible.Then perhaps, you can accept this as an exaggeration, the outermost limits of what is possible. Fine. My other issue, is that for the most part even I did not care what was going on. As I said above, the acting was very well done, so this is not a point of being unable to connect with them. The pace is extremely slow, for the entire film, no matter the emotion we are meant to feel. Even when they face the danger, it is done with a pitiful acceptance of their fate. There is only one moment from Garfield when I truly felt something. Nothing changes, in fact there are hints that the system has become even worse ethically. In the end I give this movie a 6/10. I loved the actors and the potential story, but just felt numb with a hint of depression for the constant, monotonous, doom. If you like movies with a slow pace, a strong character focus, and can easily accept the unlikeliness of the plot, then I recommend it. If not, don't bother.",Never Let Me Go
218,technofunkie,Never Let Me Go is a devastatingly beautiful film.,9,18 October 2010,"It is not often that you come home from a film feeling both defeated  and genuinely happy. While these would appear to be contradicting  emotions, that is exactly how I felt coming from Mark Romanek's Never  Let Me Go. The film, written by Alex Garland and based on the novel of  the same name by Kazuo Ishiguro, is beautiful and emotionally  devastating at the same time.  The film opens in the 1970's, focusing on the lives of three school  children in an English private school. Although at first sight the  setting appears normal enough, we quickly discover these are not normal  children, as they exist solely to have their organs harvested once they  become adults.  Never Let Me Go seamlessly combines period drama and science fiction.  The alternative reality we are shown is never fully explained nor needs  to be. The film is purely about the three main characters: Kathy, Tommy  and Ruth. It is the film's deep focus on the emotions and personalities  of the characters that makes it fascinating. The world they live in is  simply there--reality for them--no explanations needed.  A film as personal as this relies heavily on the actors; and without  their strong performances the film would have fallen flat. An  Education's Carrie Mulligan stars as Abbie, a girl who does not act but  rather observes. Andrew Garfrield plays Tommy, who Kathy has been in  love with since they were children. Keira Knightley is provides the  most surprising performance as Ruth, who jealously falls for Tommy.  Fortunately, no one disappoints, in fact, they all exceed expectations.  As these characters are shielded from normalcy, the performances we get  portray them as innocents. This is especially true of Andrew Garfield,  who plays Tommy as a naive, innocent teenager who wants nothing more  than to live longer than he is programmed to. It is his performance  that stands out, it is understated, but still emotionally heart  wrenching.  The difficulty in reviewing this film for me comes from the emotional  impact it had. Many films will tug at the heart strings, manipulating  the audience into feeling a sadness that is not real. This film does  not manipulate, it has a genuine sadness at its core that leaves you  devastated. No film has left me on the verge of tears as much as this  one has. In an age of formulaic films, it is utterly refreshing to see  something so genuine on screen, even though the characters' situations  are foreign to the audience.  Alex Garland has often been criticized for his inability to write  logical conclusions to his films. While I personally don't agree with  that, Never Let Me Go proves that wrong. The final act of the film  doesn't try to trick us into feeling for the characters as we already  do. The characters reunite after years apart from each other; now,  closer to the end, they spend what could be their last days together.  There is no twist to the film, it ends exactly how we know it will, and  that is where the sadness comes from. We know the fates of these  characters, and the films' focus is on their struggle to accept their  fate just as we have had to.  Mark Romanek is a veteran music video director, and Never Let Me Go is  only his second feature film, although you wouldn't know it. Romanek  shows a maturity and patience behind the camera that is not only rare  for young filmmakers but for veteran ones as well. His use of focus  leads to one of the most beautifully shot films of the year, if not the  most.  Never Let Me Go is without a doubt my favourite film of the year, so  far. It had the emotional impact that I usually judge a film's quality  on. The fact it is not being talked about more is truly a bewildering  shame. I fear it will be forgotten, as dramas that do not garner Oscar  attention usually do.",Never Let Me Go
219,escapoholic,Of course they're humans?,8,19 December 2011,"I've rated this movie an 8 in spite of some pretty serious problems, which I""ll get to shortly.As the story of the characters Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth, destined to be organ donors in a society where organ failure is apparently the only medical issue ""real"" people have to deal with, Never Let Me Go succeeds. The acting is top notch; the settings and the mood are admirably conveyed. We care deeply about these kids/young people, and their fate weighs upon us well after the movie is done.For the most part, though, the ethical issues arising from the treatment of organ donors gets pretty short shrift; the movie works, at least for me, because I'm induced to overlook some head scratching aspects of this story. I suspect the book accounts much better than the movie does for why the all important art gallery of the donors was created in the first place and how the characters understand its significance. What we get from Miss Emily at the end suggest that somebody thought they could tell from artwork what they couldn't tell from simple observation of the young donors. Really?Somehow it's been arranged that the donors don't interact much with ""real people,"" although they get close enough to speculate about who might have been the originals from which they were cloned. The notable exception to this is the adults who work at Hailsham, one of whom steps out of bounds in revealing the real story about the child donors' eventual fate. Because these adults are significant characters in the story, it's a problem that what they say and do doesn't make much sense. Moreover, we have to accept that something has happened at Hailsham to make these kids feel special, because the movie doesn't give us much in this regard.But the movie isn't the story of Hailsham or of the people who created it. The movie is about Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth, who are doomed, but then, aren't we all? There's never really any doubt about their humanity, and we connect to them out of the sense of our own humanity.",Never Let Me Go
220,victoriavaradi-47267,So many things don't make sense in this film,5,19 December 2017,"Questions I kept asking myself while watching this film:If the children are cloned and raised to be organ donors only, why do they go to a seemingly normal boarding school? It seemed they had more or less similar classes like any child would in a school. For what?After leaving school, what people who don't become ""carers"" do to live? Do they work, or does the state provide for them? What do they do?Why don't they not even think about changing their fates? Especially because they didn't seem to be brainwashed too much in the boarding school.Why is it Ruth's fault that Kathy and Tommy couldn't be together? Why would a guy choose to be with someone, and stay with someone for years, who he doesn't love, especially when the girl he loves is obviously head over heals in love with him right from the beginning?How can someone feel for so so so passive characters, who do not seem to have a will or the capability to think or act, and just go with the flow ALL THE TIME?One thing in the script which I think was a poor decision:The filmmakers decided to make the new teacher character TELL the children (and us, audience) about their terrible fate, while in class. In my opinion this decision killed the suspense, it was such an anticlimax. I expected a very engaging movie, but it felt slow and dull at many times unfortunately.

223,hatsubob,Ridiculous plot.,3,28 June 2011,"I am very surprised and a little disappointed to see so many high ratings for this movie. Each person is entitled to their own opinion, but in my opinion this movie doesn't deserve the 7 plus star rating it has got on IMDb for the following reasons.1. The huge plot hole... the clones know they are clones, they know that they are going to have to donate all their organs until they are dead, they aren't very happy about it, and yet none of them seems to realize that they could just up and move to Brazil(or the Australian outback) and live out a nice happy existence. What is it that is keeping them subservient? If they screenplay had explained that they have a microchip in their head that will explode if they don't turn up for surgery, or something else along those lines, then it might have made some sense. Or if they had been bread with some kind of passive lemming like DNA, that made them resigned to their fate, then that could have made sense.(But as Andrew Garfield's character screams in frustration at the end, then that obviously isn't the case) 2. The whole story has been done to death, first in Parts: The Clonus Horror then in it's ""remake""/""ripoff"" The Island. All the time while watching this movie I couldn't help but think about Gattaca, a movie with similar themes, humans messing about with DNA, and discrimination of some ""humans"". Never Let Me Go is not a terribly bad movie, but it's certainly not a really good one either. If you have a couple of hours to kill and you have the choice of this or Gattaca, stick with Gattaca and give this one a miss.",Never Let Me Go
224,dick-sanders,"Beautiful, profound, moving",10,10 October 2010,"Just ahead, I'll tell you how to know if you'll love or hate this movie (very few will be in between). But first, I'm always surprised to see people reading the novel, rushing to the movie, and then expressing disappointment with remarks such as, ""there are gaping holes."" A 2-hour movie is a 110-page screenplay, which means a 300-page novel becomes a 6-hour miniseries. Get Martin Scorcese, hire ""Never Let Me Go"" novelist Kazuo Ishiguro to write the screenplay, and cast it right, and you'll have a shot at making a miniseries that CAN be compared to the novel; otherwise, let's understand the limitation and let the film stand on its own. I didn't read Ishiguro's novel, and I found Mark Romanek's film (screenplay by Alex Garland) to be a beautiful, profound and complete meditation on life. It demonstrates the best and worst of human behavior, the beauty of undying love, and the heroism of accepting responsibility (or fate in this case). To me, the story is uplifting and memorable, in spite of its overall sad and melancholy tone. What's more, it's seamless, from the superb performances by Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightley, and Andrew Garfield, to the near perfect direction by Romanek, to its gorgeous cinematography with muted color palette, to its precise wabi-sabi production design (the beauty of worn and broken things). But how can you know if you'll like this film or not?Forget the Sci-Fi angle; it's insignificant except as a stepping-off point for a story that reveals great truths: That life is short, your choices have consequences, and at the end none of us may feel we've had enough time to love, or just get things right. But I can safely say... If you interpret your movies literally, you will not like this film. If you need action, a fast pace, explosions and special effects, you will not like this film. If your idea of a great movie is Inception, forget it. On the other hand, if you can appreciate a fine story by Henry James, Edith Wharton, or Katherine Anne Porter, this film is made for you. If you enjoyed Todd Haynes' lovely melodrama, Far from Heaven, or Oren Moverman's powerful movie, The Messenger, or Tom Ford's poignant film, A Single Man, you'll love this picture. The story addresses themes of love, longing, jealousy, betrayal, courage, atonement, and perhaps most important ""acceptance."" The film also asks us to consider the ""morality of science,"" and some might find this aspect chilling, but to me the larger human themes overwhelm this one. When I saw Never Let Me Go, the theater was about one-third full, but probably one-third of these folks walked out by the half-way point. And, surprisingly, the couple sitting behind me got up and walked out 10 minutes before the end, once they were convinced (revealed by their groans) that the story would not have a happy ending. Apparently, they were looking for the ""feel good movie of the year."" Sadly, they missed the most extraordinary and beautiful ending -- most of the emotional power comes in that last 10 minutes -- but then I suppose they wouldn't have understood it. But to me, Never Let Me Go is the ""feel good movie of the year,"" precisely because it tells the truth: life is beautiful because there are hopes and dreams, love and loss, tears and tragedies. One final note: Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield are excellent in their roles, but Carey Mulligan is the standout -- she shows a wisdom and weariness far beyond her years, and handles difficult emotional material with a sublime restraint that makes the whole thing work. I feel we are witnessing the early work of the next Deborah Kerr, Sarah Miles, or Vanessa Redgrave.

Kathy is just wonderful her facial expressions the way she holds her emotions, she does not express her feelings very openly but her facial expressions you can see her soul. 
also, I think a true masterpiece is one where you understand the ""villain"" and feel bad for them because the characters are real and people are not all black and white
I read a quote before that says ""hurt people hurt people"" and I feel like that summaries Ruth's character. I spent the whole movie hating her but that scene at the boat where she is talking and the camera just shows her face there is so

The novel is a modern classic, considered by many as one of the best books in the past decade. Adaptations of literary pieces are definitely a challenge for directors and screenwriters. Norwegian Wood disappointed me, so did Love in the Time of Cholera, but not this time, Never Let Me Go by Mark Romanek. As a fan of the novel, while watching the movie, I do agree that somehow the first half of the film ran too fast while the relationship between the characters was portrayed in a too-brief way. However, when finished seeing the film, I was stunned in my seat, with tears rolling down on my face. How can people blame such a beautiful visual poetry and claim that it's empty and full of gaps??? The perfect casting has to be given a tribute. Carey Mulligan is undoubtedly the most decent actress who could win the Oscar one day, having matureness and sadness on her face that never match her child-like look. Music is soft and depressing, make me rush to HMV and look for the original soundtrack. Above all, what move me in the deepest way is the beautiful quietness in the movie.

231,shahriman_ams,I remember reading a very different book,5,8 January 2011,"I read the novel some three years ago, so may be my memory failed me here - but I remember reading a very different novel. The novel had an air of mystery surrounding Hailsham, Hailsham was almost like a character in its own right. What is Hailsham? Or the Gallery? Who is madam? Why Cathy, Ruth and Tommy's lives are the way they are? Are they orphans? Are they part of an experiment? The questions are innumerable - and Ishiguro keeps them suspended until the very end. The mystery unraveled slowly, the truth didn't emerge fully until the last pages. And once it did, the result was crashing, devastating. The book doesn't even pretend to answer all the ethical and philosophical question it raises (which, by the way, is a hallmark of Ishiguro).The film, on the other hand, was a listless affair. It remains insular to the end, the drama never picks up and fails to evoke a paralytic affliction as the book does. Hailsham didn't get enough importance, the relationship between the three main characters was downplayed. Mr. Romanek's interpretation of the book appears to be archetypal and he ended up attempting a tear-jerker (albeit, with little success).The film had some stylistic choices, all of which didn't sit well with me. For instance, it was populated with numerous inserts of bird, trees, bushes and whatnot. Now from a narrative point of view, they didn't seem to carry any significance. While they looked pretty and helped to control the pacing of the film to some extent, personally I think they were unnecessary. Then there is the voice-over. The fact that it was there is enough to raise controversy. The way Mr. Romanek used it, it was a waste. Cathey's voice did not convey the slightest emotion which definitely was intentional, and a bad choice.The use of shallow DOF comes with its downside, as the subject of interest is always at a risk of going out of focus. But in this case, the trade-off was necessary. The film mixes static camera footages with some hand-held shots in places. This, if well-intended, didn't achieve its purpose. These, and a number of other shots in my opinion, had a music video-ish look not suitable for the mood of the film.If I'm allowed a bit of indulgence, I'd like to quickly rate the key people: Mark Romanek (direction): 0 (failure to make good choices, failure to direct the child actors, failure to create a gripping narrative) Adam Kimmel (cinematography): 5 (for the whole look of the film, especially the way he shot the lonely buildings, sky, rain, sea and the sense of deep melancholy created by them) Mark Digby (production design): 5 (absolutely impeccable) Andrew Garfield (acting - Tommy): 4 (although I think he is better in The Social Network) Music was just the way it should have been and the costume department did a marvelous job too.To those of you who liked the book, or are planning to read the book (which I think you definitely should), I strongly recommend not watching the film.

Carey Mulligan is extremely believable as Kathy and in many ways leaves you both feeling sad for what she must go threw but also happy that she faces it so bravely.

While scene in and of itself was very effective, I preferred the way the novel allowed the horror to slowly reveal itself to the reader.That said, I thought this was a haunting and beautiful film. Here it is a week later and I keep replaying scenes in my mind...the quiet, humming,aching beauty of it. The performances of these 3 young actors were powerful. The subject matter would have been too much in less qualified hands. I was so moved by the absolutely stunning cinematography of this film.

Both young (Izzy Meikle-Small) und older (Carey Mulligan) Kathy are wonderful. I thought the beginning of the story was almost magical, I loved the innocent romance.After the switch to teen/twen age the story became too depressing for my taste. I can't really understand when somebody who's in love with somebody else sticks with the wrong person for so many years, although really *everybody* knows who should really be together. That's more stupidity than drama and it's kinda hard for me to feel with that person. Anyway, as I said, acting and direction was great.

241,netean,An Amazingly Affecting Film,10,2 April 2013,"For me, what takes a good film to greatness is by how much if affects you and how long you spend afterwards thinking about it and the topics it raises. What then takes a great film beyond even that, how it leaves you, weeks, months or years afterwardsNever Let Me Go, was film that profoundly affected me at the time, the performances, the cold, almost bleak filming style and the way every character in the film seemed to just accept the situation. The emotion it stirred caused me to want to yell at the screen about the injustice and ethics of it all. How could we/they live in such a world?- A world just the smallest blink from our own. The anger I felt, the loss, the injustice and sheer ""wrongness"" of it all, haunted me afterwards and stayed with with me for days, even weeks after.At it's heart, it's just a story of normal, every day people, who grow up, have friends, grow apart, fall in love in a world that doesn't acknowledge that normality. In a way, a very British film, nothing really ""happens"", there is no big dramatic end point that builds the tension for the characters like in Hollywood, just a quite, in the background, inevitability of their fate. That's what makes it more it powerful in my mind, because it mirrors our own lives in so many ways. No big ""event"" just the slow, steady march to old age and ultimately our own death.A few weeks later I watched this again with a friend. If anything, it was better after a second viewing, you can really see just how subtle, realistic and ultimately superb acting is. After a second viewing, if anything I was more upset and more angry that ""we"" could allow this to happen to people. Months later, I can feel myself changed by it. Changed for the better, because I could not passively, apathetically, live in a world where that could happen. It doesn't, not in the context of the film at least, but maybe elsewhere? I subsequently read the book and yes, there certainly are differences from the original story. Those differences though, for me, make it a more intense, more emotional story. In there is just ""I didn't see him after that"" kind of ending ,that is cold and empty. The change in the film is realistic, emotional, more human, more upsetting, and I'm so very very glad it was changed like that. Had they followed the book it would have been a bit of a flat empty emotionless ending and it didn't deserve that at all.If you're looking for action, speedy dialogue, dramatic tension and interactions between the characters, you'll be disappointed. Because these are, to me.. a British person, utterly believable and thoroughly normal. That is what makes it so superb, they're not ""everyday heroes"", they're not brave martyrs, activities, or victims per se.. they're just, they're just you and me.There are bookmark films that we see at key points in our life that define the moment, the year, the relationship or other event. Yet there are others that come along, quietly, out of the blue and become life changing films. They become ""bookmarks"" not because of what was going on in our life at the time but solely because of the film and it's contents. For me, this is one of those films, one of those very rare films that, unexpectedly profoundly and forever changed me. (for the better I hope). A film I've seen numerous times and been moved at each viewing.I have friends that I know would hate it, there's not guns, actions or CGI, they'd have to think and feel beyond the bounds of mainstream Hollywood plot lines. This isn't a film for them, this is a film for people with a even just a morsel of self determination, a fragment of individuality, intelligence, passion or soul.",Never Let Me Go
242,rolls_chris,"Intelligent, haunting and beautifully produced",7,20 February 2011,"Perhaps it's perverse to review something with an eye to how bad it COULD have been. 'Never Let Me Go', the film version of Kazo Ishiguro's Booker-shortlisted 2005 novel, manages to escape being a mawkish, sentimental and rather formulaic thriller through the subtlety of Alex Garland's sensitive, nuanced screenplay.Like Ishiguro, Garland let's the world of Hailsham and it's fey child inhabitants unfold slowly on screen, pulling us into their strangely altered reality. The schoolchildren wear electronic tags, are sternly encouraged to be as physically healthy as possible, and have a paranoid fear of the outside world. If, like me, you don't know before you watch what's going down in the boarding school, you find yourself intrigued, saddened and not a little sickened by the sinister truth. Much of the film's impact lies in not knowing the set-up before it's revealed. There'll surely be some though who know the novel or who'll have have heard spoilers.The strength of Kazo Ishiguro's vision lies in not letting the characters at the heart of his story be Orwellian victims desperate to break free from the omnipresent tyranny of a state which persecutes them. There are countless examples of this 'Trueman Show'-type genre. A more insensitive writer, or faithless producer, would undoubtedly have ramped up the jeopardy and had the protagonists running for their lives in a bid to be human. Ishiguro, on the other hand, meditates on how far the characters themselves are complicit in their situation, and to what extent they're the unwitting ciphers of an uncaring, health-obsessed society. Thus we're spared the 'bad' version of this story and treated to a somewhat philosophical, character-driven narrative.But the chief thing that struck me watching 'Never Let Me Go' was the sheer beauty of Mark Romanek's production design. The screen constantly evolves in a muted palette of blues and soft autumnal browns, counterbalancing the uglier truths at the the heart of the society being depicted. Clever.",Never Let Me Go
243,mjorgensen62,yet another GREAT performance,10,30 December 2010,"I never read the book. I never HEARD of the book. I never heard of the author. I'd never heard about this movie. Now that I've seen it, I'm wondering just how good this wonderful little Mulligan kid can become. The purpose of the kids' existence is as appalling as the revelations of Nazi atrocities. But, we are sucked in to caring about Kathy, Ruth and Tommy. This is the mark of the truly great movie. Carey again proves that she is the real thing, one of the finest actors of our age. She's too young to be this good. She acts with her face, her words, but mostly through her eyes, which look like they have the wisdom of the ages behind them. Of course, this cannot be, because she's only in her 20's. Add up her entire book of work, and she becomes one of the most bankable stars around.",Never Let Me Go
244,nwnyc,Implausible Premise,5,9 June 2011,"I had not read the book and knew nothing about this film when I watched it. As I began watching, I was intrigued and continued to be intrigued until I discovered the story's basic premise. The three stars are known to me as terrific actors and I was particularly drawn to the film when I saw Andrew Garfield was in it. (I first came across him by accident when watching the film, A Boy, in which he was utterly brilliant. He has a certain quality about him that makes you feel his feelings.) While this film is beautifully acted and photographed, once I realized its basic premise, I could not accept it and that ruined almost everything else it had to offer me. I appreciate imaginative science fiction and know how to drop enough of my reality behind in order to be entertained by a film, but this story went too far in asking me to accept that such beings would be created and used the way they were. The words in the introduction about the medical advancement of 1952 which enabled the human life span to be extended to over 100 years seemed unrelated to the procedures we later learn these beings were expected to undergo. It was also ridiculous to believe that the beings would not revolt when they reached later teens or adulthood, as human teens do. Human teens naturally rebel as part of their maturation process, so why wouldn't clones? The fact that they don't was absurd.",Never Let Me Go
245,t-c-pearce,Original premise and looks like a work of art but disturbing for the wrong reasons,8,22 December 2013,"To enjoy the movie we need to suspend disbelief and a myriad questions about a generation of kids bought up by the state (presumably, we are not really told) only to donate their vital organs to prolong the lives of others more fortunate than themselves.It is all done beautifully in period style, if a little slow moving for some people's tastes. Many parts of the movie look like works of art and really made me question about our lives and its value and purpose. It is a deeply existential film, in the sense that it makes no moral judgement on situation faced by the clone donors in the film, which both gives it its art-house feel but also exposes some big issues in the plot.The problem is the lack of humanity becomes more and more troubling as we go on: * firstly the humanity in the ""donors"", in that even as children when they are told about their fate, they respond with such acceptance that it seems inhuman. Are they really just biological ""meat"" without a soul? If they were just biological robots, we could accept it perhaps, but the film is deeply ambivalent about this as the central plot is a love story between donors, presumably of which only humans are capable? * the humanity of a society that would accept the rearing of children to be donors and live a short life. Creates so many issues that are utterly avoided. Not even a hint of how this immoral system could exist.Because the film makes no judgement or gives any degree of insight or clues on these two points of humanity we are left with deeply unresolved puzzles, and in the end the film just seems to question humanity itself - if that is the overall point, it's a depressing conclusion.",Never Let Me Go

This movie has literally made me cry (esp the last 15 minutes).

247,whizzkiduk-311-648630,A chilling dark film,8,7 March 2012,"I have just watched this film after reading the very dark book. However, this film does not necessarily need you to have read the book, but i highly suggest it as it ties in neatly.Anyway, back to the film. Right from the start you get a bone chilling sadness that lingers in and out throughout the film, Carey Mulligan does a brilliant job of the portrayal of Kathy right from the cottages onward, you feel very involved in her sadness towards Ruth and Tommy. The acting was moderate in some areas. Personally i though Andrew Garfield handled Tommy's character well towards the end, but struggled in earlier parts. None the less towards the end you really came to grips with his character and although you could never really enjoy the film as much as you wanted too due to a lack of depth, you at least had an idea of how things worked and the key aspect of sadness. Maybe readers of this review will agree that a lot of questions still needed answering and quite a bit of detail was left out from the book.I thought Ruth could have be a more in depth complex character as she was in the book, and maybe time constraints had caused an issue, but that did scupper my enjoyment a bit. One thing i must note is the exceptional music throughout the piece by Rachel Portman who did an absolutely brilliant job captivating one's self throughout the film. I thought the repeating song of 'we all complete' towards the end really left you in a thoughtful mood.Overall, a captivating and almost gripping film with sadness, a few things need tweaking to make it a great film, but overall a really enchanting film which leaves you with a dilemma as you switch off the film. A solid 8/10.",Never Let Me Go
248,Ubeenzuked,Why this film is actually a masterpiece in storytelling...,10,2 November 2013,"In the 1950's the cure to EVERY disease and terminal sickness was discovered. THAT is the very foundation everything this story is based upon. After this, the ground work is laid that suggests that if not all of humanity, then all first world nations, nations that basically dictate what happens globally, are complicit in benefitting from this discovery, and society evolves around this. We see early in the film that they are watching old television shows, listening to dated music. Music and entertainment will drastically be different than what it is now, or at least in 1996, when the most recent timeline of the movie is revealed as it will also have evolved differently. Perhaps there was no societal need for a hippie revolution. There may have been fewer wars, less famine, etc. So the story being told is not how a group of children would react to their circumstances according to how society has evolved post Castro, post Viet Nam, post Cold War, etc., it's telling us what happened to society after this discovery was made. What would happen in Europe or USA if our leaders were forthcoming about everything they do in third world nations? How would we react if we were informed of every cruel and inhumane act committed against those poor impoverished people? We would have to make a very difficult decision about where we fit into that equation, that's for sure. We either remain complicit as we are now, or we stand up against tyranny, but that would mean foregoing so many of the things we take for granted that are the products of the blood, sweat, and tears of those downtrodden people.",Never Let Me Go

All right, I added it into my movie collection, because it was real, emotional, gorgeous. Kathy and Ruth, they both wanted to get the deferral with Tommy, but it turns out that it wasn't for real. I was completely shocked when I saw that Tommy cried his eyes out in front of the car. It was so desperate. Speaking of AI, a must-see film was AI(2001)by Spielberg, the opinion/attitude towards AI was totally different. AI was talking about hope,facing obstacles, overcoming the darkness.

The acting, the rhythm, the beautiful and subtle photography, the atmosphere, everything is in its place. The casting of Carey Mulligan seems obvious. She generates so much empathy that we feel deeply involved in the story. Andrew Garfield shows also the adequate level of fragility without falling into a caricature.

A virgin mind not knowing to expect from a movie which was ..Sumptuous, yes. Subdued, definitely. But I just couldn't get past the overbearing notion that all the characters were basically spare parts on legs. Great acting, sure, analogies for the human condition, whatever, I was screaming out for back story here; but I guess I'm tainted by a love of sci fi. If you're going to weave a story around a premise like this, you have to address that issue in a more satisfactory way; it glares way too much to ignore it.The cinematography; very nice. But I got the impression it was just there for the sake of being pretty. And yeah, I got most if the symbolic stuff, as our two female protagonists shuffle towards the light at the end of the .. hospital corridor, but it really has to work on an immediate and a more subtle level - you can't just linger on a long shot of a beached fishing boat, out of the blue, and not offend viewers.""You poor creatures"", ""We wanted to find out if you HAD souls"" - these comments helped to assuage my understanding of why this alternate world society is OK with an underclass of liver donors being exploited so massively; you get a hint of it about half way through when our gang of teen replicants are given the stink-eye by an elderly couple in a café.And I'm sorry, but 10 seconds of monologue at the end of the movie commenting that, hey, maybe the people we save live not so different lives to us .. I read a few other reviews on IMDb to get an idea of what other people thought; I ended up getting a bit of a Cliff's Notes on the book the movie was based on. My impression is that the director soft-pedals the whole issue of the donor society out of fear that it will drown out the focus on the characters; fair enough, but he achieves the opposite affect, with the background looming all the larger by the very fact it remains unaddressed adequately. I don't mind the occasional movie that I'm supposed to make an 'effort' to engage with; but let's face it, such movies are never great movies, by the very laziness of the people making them. They're like depressing university students reading their poetry around a camp fire, demanding that people absorb every nuance of the great message they are relating. A movie, in the end, is all about the story telling, and if the story isn't great or the delivery underwhelming, few will listen and few will 'get it'.To summarise: a reasonable representation of the art of film-making, a little heavy handed perhaps, with some pretty scenery, but just too self involved to tell the story well enough to keep you engaged.",Never Let Me Go
254,david-g-725-408845,"Interesting, but flawed.",7,6 January 2011,"This movie certainly was not what I expected. I didn't hear much about it beforehand, but the whole ""kids/ teenagers lead a sheltered life"" stuff seemed pretty familiar. Thank god, that I was wrong. The main story is about 3 kids growing up isolated from the outside world. Throughout the movie there are two time-jumps: the first from childhood to adolescence and the second one from adolescence to adulthood. What's so special about this, is that those kids are destined to become either ""donors"" or carers"". Donors give their vital organs for other people to survive and carers look after them. Of course they don't have a very long life expectation and after the 3rd or 4th donation most of them die, many even earlier. So you might expect there to be some sort of political or social commentary in this movie, but there isn't. It's about what the donors are lacking the most: time. The acting is pretty good and the characters are likable, even though some of them do pretty nasty things that normally would make them loathsome. The ending is quite sad and again the actors handle the scene very well. A problem I have with the movie is that all the characters seem to be upset about the whole system, but none of them actually do something. Nobody tries to run away or fight the donations, they all just accept it as their fate. It also seems a bit strange that Ruth would start a relationship, just not to be jealous anymore and keep it up for over a decade. Definitely worth a watch, but the movie has it's lengths and some might feel a bit unsatisfied.",Never Let Me Go

Nothing wrong with that, but that is what these people mean about the movie being boring, as everything, boredom is in the eye of the beholder, and in this case some beholders are too impatient.But do beware of the people saying this is a marvel of a movie. it isn't, and the problem are the gaping holes in the plot.What would give this movie an edge in regards to a full blown melodrama is the reference to Sci-Fi elements, but unfortunately these are touched so casually that in undermines the whole thing.Spoilers!We are led to believe that people (are they people? that would be the first question left unanswered) that by all appearances are thinking and functional, that clearly despair about their mandated fate (By whom? How?) do nothing but meekly ask for a short reprieve from a bureaucrat that surely they know is a minor peg in the overall machinery that mandates their fate? People have started revolutions for far less. By not telling us more about this inhumane condition the film is found wanting and undermines itself. You can suspend disbelief, sometimes to great lengths, but this constant distopyan teasing without throwing us one or two bones is infuriating, and inevitably rests weight from the matters the film is really trying to address.I thought that at the end Carey Mulligan's character would have the last laugh against the system and use that tree, where she reminisces about her short life, to keep to herself those precious organs she has been raised to ""donate"".But she doesn't and here is a shining example of a subtle but fundamental contradiction in the plot: that in spite of the attempts of their teachers to probe that the donors actually have ""souls"" (Really? Souls? Was all what they were concerned about? Is that a theocracy? Again most questions unanswered...) the donors have no recognisable aspirations.So what is it? The boy screaming in despair or the carer signing a form? By not making its mind, the film fails to deliver its message, in spite of good acting and impeccable cinematography.Lose the plot and you lose the movie.Nevertheless this is a gallant failure, it is an adult movie for adult audiences, a rarity nowadays for which we should be grateful (remember who gets bored during complicated movies and who the film industry is trying to please when movies are not ""boring""...).",Never Let Me Go

I won't give away why...since that is really the twist in the movies. In any case the film centers around 3 of the students, two girls and one boy and of course a romance between them. They grow up and soon they are off to do what they are meant to do which will create heartache, sadness and truths about our lives and mortality. It is set in the 50's but in a parallel 20th century unlike ours. All I can say is rent the film because I think that it was poorly marketed and that's why it didn't have a wider release.

Those who would call this picture preposterous can only be too philistine to appreciate the story's subtlety, let alone read the original novel by Kazuo Ishiguro, in which the writer recaptures some of that poignancy we felt so strongly when the emotionally stunted, ever-professional butler, Stevens, contemplates what remains of his day.Carey Mulligan is superb as Kathy, building on strong performances in BBC's Bleak House and, more recently, An Education, with Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley excellent in supporting roles. Two things I found particularly chilling: the contrast between the conservative, traditional, home- counties appearance of Hailsham and the bleak (future) reality for its inmates; then, the way the doctors disconnected Ruth (Keira Knightley) on 'completion' of her final 'donation' with not so much as a second thought.

My expectations were so high due to the fact that there were actors like Carey Mulligan,Keira Knightely and Andrew Garfield in the cast. But beside this the movie is really deploring. I've really aprreciated the book by Ishiguro which described the life of Kathy who's a clone. The beautiful thing about the book is that you really understand how the characters feel (Also Ruth and Tommy) while in the movie you don't emphasize at all with them. The plot is really ununderstandable in the movie.

There is no action, no space disaster, no war. Well actually there is a war, but a silent war. It is a time in which live donors are an acceptable practice. It is a sad, sad, sad and true story. Organ donors are copied from the DNA of patients and when the donors reach a stable age, the donor must undergo operation to remove some of his organs for the patient, doing this a couple of times, this results in premature death.Children are being made fearful of leaving the complex they live in by horror-stories and thus are bound by a psychological fence that they do not cross. Even when they are physically free on a later age, they still follow the rules. I couldn't understand why these donors were so passive in 'giving' their organs. No one tried to escape.It is a sad, sad story and if you are in a positive spiral, I would't recommend this movie. It doesn't give you tears, but it doesn't make your day either. It gives you a feeling of passivity, inevitability and the 'innocent-people-will-always-loose' idea.",Never Let Me Go
269,christiancottingham,"Unerringly brutal, but utterly beautiful",9,20 November 2010,"We are, most of us, pretty familiar with dystopia. An outsider, or group of outsiders, rises up in opposition of some malignant, controlling force. Sometimes they overthrow it, or at least register some level of victory, however ambiguous, as with Children of Men. Sometimes, as in 1984, the system consumes them. But always - always - there is the fight, the struggle to overturn whatever dark elements have taken hold.There is no fight within Never Let Me Go. There is no conflict, no resistance, no tiny, token victory. The fate of the protagonists is chillingly accepted, their passivity devastating.The film, adapted from Kazuo Ishiguro's 2005 novel, weaves an understated hopelessness through a well-worn science-fiction concept, telling the story of a group of clones created so their organs could be harvested for medical purposes. Taking place in an alternate Britain in the late twentieth century, where life-expectancy has risen to over 100 years, we first meet Kathy, Ruth and Tommy as children at Hailsham, a country boarding school. At first their lives seem idyllic, sunset hues and natural imagery creating a sense of a privileged rural seclusion, but the edges are frayed with tension. A new teacher, Miss Lucy, questions the children as to why they seem afraid to leave the grounds: their replies, as with The Village, hint at rumours and misinformation that have distorted their sense of reality.The initial impressions of privilege are quickly worn down by the faded interiors, the dorm rooms sparse and colourless, the classroom desks worn and cracked. The students collect mismatched tokens to exchange for junk, their uncontrolled excitement at odds with ragged castoffs on display. Visitors to the school shudder visibly as they enter.For the children, of course, this all goes unnoticed. We're led to assume that they've experienced nothing else, and whilst we're drawing dark conclusions they're growing up, and falling in love. Kathy and Tommy's growing affection for each other is tracked from early concern to backward glances in assembly, shared mealtimes and thoughtful gifts, until finally he's stolen from her by a jealous Ruth. It's a love triangle that dominates the rest of the film, as they leave Hailsham for a group of farmhouses shared with people from other institutions similar to their own. Food and supplies are delivered regularly in a van marked National Donor Programme, but otherwise they're pretty much unsupervised.Which makes their inaction all the more awful. They each know what awaits them, each fully aware of the various stages mapped out until their 'completion' not long hence, but they do nothing to prevent it. At no point is there even the suggestion of escape. Many, many questions are raised regarding the extent of surveillance and control that they are under - wristbands clock their return home, their arms mechanically waving them to the sensor - but none are answered, and nothing is challenged. But that's the point: these are people - creatures, as they're referred to at one point - who have known no other life, for whom the idea of challenge would be incomprehensible. They're unable, even, to order food in a seaside restaurant, so far from their experience is it.As a story it's horrifying, our gradual awareness of their circumstance - more clearly signposted than in the prose - quickly turning to frustration at the hopelessness of it. To be sure this is not an easy watch, and not one easily shrugged off or recovered from. All of the leads are excellent, Carey Mulligan particularly so but Andrew Garfield the most affecting, his hope the last to fade like embers dying in his eyes.Technically it's quietly beautiful, long takes and nostalgic palettes suffusing every frame with an aching, undisguised sadness, ever-present and at times overwhelming. The soundtrack is simple, a recurring motif echoing both the melancholy themes and the character's calm acceptance of their tragedy. This is low-key filmmaking, certainly, but no less confident for it: Mark Romanek has done menace, in One Hour Photo, and here he's nailing pathos.Is it Oscar-baiting? Possibly: it's certainly been timed to hit awards season, but it definitely deserves some recognition. Whether it gets it is another question: the trailers don't sell the film right, and there will be many who dislike the slow, measured pace and the lack of clear exposition. But Never Let Me Go isn't a story about answers, nor even, really, about clones - it's about our own powerlessness in the face of larger forces. And we can shout and scream and rage and try our hardest to break those forces down, but ultimately the true measure of our lives is in the relationships we form, however they may end.",Never Let Me Go

I have recently watched it again now it's out on DVD.Whilst the main 'science fiction' premise is a bit tricky to get your head round (it traces the lives of 3 young people from 70's to 90's living in an alternate reality following a 'breakthough' in medical science that cured all illnesses) the film uses this as a vehicle to pour on layers of emotional content that is sadly missing from many of today's films.However, the real heart of the film are the scenes involving Kathy 'H' and Tommy 'D' (palyed by Carey Mullligan and Andrew Garfield.) The acting is top drawer and brings with it moments of real beauty and heartache in equal measure.In fact the quality of the cast at times makes this a bit of a tough film to watch, but ultimately rewarding.

It was never explained why they couldn't just escape, how they were created, and what lives their originals (to whom they donated) led. Nor did they explain what the medical breakthrough was, how the life expectancy has passed 100 years old. How can you relate to something you can't understand?

It stayed with me for days and I thought about what ifs constantly. Andrew Garfield had one of his best performances and Carey Mulligan was good, per usual. I was even impressed with Kiera Knightley.

Growing donors immediately reminds me that Nazi stuff. 2. Maybe, at some point, 1 became legal. I don't believe that no one who knew that his life isn't actually belongs to him will accept this path. When you have to control children, it isn't so hard, but when you deal with grown-ups, it isn't that simple. 3. All of the teachers' emotions (espetially at the end) for me just can't be real - they had jobs, good house etc. 4. I can't believe that after many years apart those three can simply speak so long with each other. I can't believe that Knightly's personage, in that situation, could help and don't be jealous about having 3d donation while traitor Kathy didn't have any. 5.

After reading several of the reviews (certainly not even most) I find it astounding that no one commented about the evil of human cloning and the total mis portrayal of the motivations of the human spirit. If the film has captured the essence of the novel I apologize and was true to it than I condemn the book as well. Absurd at its face is the bizarre acceptance of their fate. While we all ""complete"" we are universally endowed with the will to live, motivation to thrive and achieve, procreate and experience life to its fullest as best we can or are able. The film (and book, perhaps) totally avoid/miss this 800 lb gorilla.I thought the use of soft, mild coloring versus vivid and bright images alludes to the almost experience of the clones, coming close to experiencing life but never fully. There are no strong expressions of normal extremes of emotions with the exception of Tommy's outbursts. there is no joy, only smiles. No anger, just disappointment.

This movie was more like a slowed down, single mommy version of it.There were no surprising moments whatsoever and I didn't feel anything while watching the movie except boredom. Acting was nice, but the storyline was so boring I almost completed myself. This probably works as a book but the screenplay was horrible.

282,countrygirl_jo,"Tremendous attempt to make a powerful, moving book work on screen",8,12 February 2011,"If you have ever read any of Kazuo Ishiguro's books perhaps like me you have been moved by the way that his writing contains so much power in what it doesn't say as much as what it does. As a writer, he is interested in inhibition and restraint and the things we cannot face. 'The Remains of the Day' is a masterly example - and the Hopkins/Thompson movie adaptation made a very strong attempt to convey the tone, and the characters' avoidance of pain and truth, on screen. 'Never Let Me Go' is a valiant attempt to do the same for a novel laced with heartrending pain, so little of which is explicit.You don't need to have read the book to weep during this film. But if you have, you will perhaps weep more, bringing to it all the unspoken power that the film cannot fully deal with. Much of the book's bewildering effect comes from what is left out - leaving the characters, and we as readers, gradually to realise the horror of where it is all gong. In the movie, much more is made clear much earlier - but thereagain, it maybe needs to be...and the film still works, with the director managing to pull off a sense of the awful, shattering realisation, in the midst of love, even though we have glimpsed what is coming. Others have questioned the loose ends that the film doesn't deal with - why don't the characters run, for example. Well, the film starts to answer this in a device that shows they are surveilled (which isn't in the book), and there is the even bigger one of how they manage to carry on at all given what is happening to them. But for me those who are bothered by this are missing the point. 'Never Let Me Go' asks more questions than it answers, as all Ishiguro's work does. And this movie asks questions about endurance, acceptance and compliance, and - through its dystopian setting - about society which society might prefer to remain hidden. There may be a lot of 'Why?' in your head as you pick up your coat to leave at the end, and I feel that's a measure of the film's success not its failure. The cast is top drawer. Keira Knightley's work dairy seems to have been pretty full recently and you may feel she's phoned in her performance from about eight years ago to start with, but stay with it - as the plot develops you'll feel that she's really started to stretch herself and is very watchable indeed. Likewise Andrew Garfield gets better and better the more time he spends on screen. But Carey Mulligan ultimately acts them both off the screen...with a performance of heartbreaking restraint and depth. She is very very impressive, and just as good as she was in 'An Education'.Oh, and their younger selves, played by Izzie Meilkle-Small and Charlie Rowe deserve a big mention - they are first rate. Performances full of charm and simplicity, given immense pathos by the plot. I was slightly worried about going to the see this. The novel is precious to me - probably one of the top five I've ever read. And the movie doesn't quite get there, as it probably never could have. But it's really pretty close...",Never Let Me Go

I think anyone who picks out every missing section of the book from within the film should concentrate on the film itself, separately, in it's own right. The acting is incredible. All three main roles are performed with such heart wrenching emotion and such raw vulnerability, I have never seen anything like it. Other people I know have complained that nothing really happens in the film, so I would just say, be prepared for a romantic drama. It does not add any CGI or car chases to try to be anything else.

The film succeeds in telling the story in the same simple, gentle and understated style as the genius author does in the book. In fact I found the film to the be the perfect companion to the book; the book moved me for sure, but the film (for me at least) encapsulated and drove home the narrative the author created. It's not horror, and it's not sci-fi as we know it, although I suppose it is a re-imagined history. The acting, direction, production and screenplay are all excellent. I thought the three main characters were very well played. On first viewing, I did not take to Tommy's character, but on second viewing I noticed subtle looks and mood changes which made me understand the character better, and where he was coming from. Maybe, as this illustrates; the film actually helped me understand and appreciate passages of the book better. So why was this dystopian, alternative reality/history film so powerful and disturbing - it is fantasy right? I believe its power lies in the nagging feeling that if research and development had gone that way; that if such such discoveries had been made and harvesting systems set up, in those more authoritarian and less informed times (such as the 1950's), given the selfishness of the human race it is PROBABLY JUST LUCKY that this film is only fantasy. I was left with the overwhelming feeling that with a little push from medical research, a little pull from the less ethical members of the human race, and a blind eye from government that this could be reality.

Knightley is also great as a bitchy but also vulnerable and frightened Ruth. All the other actors were also very good. This is in no way a very pleasant film, it is not only said but it tells us something about tendency of people to accept the fate no matter how bad it is.

291,gencwilliams,A delicate but troubling film,9,20 February 2012,"I saw this film at the cinema, knowing nothing about it. I had some sense of the tone of it, but no idea at all about the story. The story, and the film, proved to be both pitiless and staggeringly beautiful. The cinematography and colour palette of Never Let Me Go, all soft cloudy greens, yellows and greys, and faded browns, suits the story, and the lives of the three central characters; limited, never bright, but beautiful in its limitations. Andrew Garfield is sweet as the odd boy, grown into a kind man, less naive than he looks. Keira Knightley plays the brittle, emotional but selfish character that she plays so well; I sometimes wonder if the recurrence of this kind of character, not altogether likable but all too believable, is why she is often criticised with a bitchiness she doesn't deserve. And Carey Mulligan shows why she keeps getting parts in terrific films. She's subtle, undramatic and lovely, and makes compelling humanity out of the smallest gestures - she and this whole film have that in common. Yet amid the quiet there are horrifying moments. A body left open on a surgical table, only moments ago a breathing human being. A girl in a hospital bed, missing eye tidily covered with a dressing - we all know what's happened to her, which makes her smile more appalling.What perplexes me - and I haven't read the book, though I intend to - is why the characters never rage against their fate. Tommy has his rages, inherent to his personality, but they are rages against his powerlessness. Ruth's bitterness about their preordained value (or lack of) as human beings seems to be more about identity than their fate. And Kathy is so accepting of everything; perhaps not passive, but very grounded about the options open to her. Part of me is puzzled about why they never question their futures, why they never consider making a bolt for freedom, or arguing with those in charge. Another part of me thinks that's one of the great successes of the film. It's less about the will- they-won't-they than how they handle what they're faced with, and what they get out of life regardless. Though they accept the purpose of their lives, they don't give up on the things that really make a life worth living. It gives these characters a heightened dignity that a simple story about success or failure just wouldn't come close to. We don't sit back and watch these characters wrestle with the ethics of their situation on our behalf. Instead, by effectively taking a neutral position, they leave it to us to form an opinion on.

I adore the film of the music because of being effective. I did not say actors for actors are really important for me also they act well. The film is wonderful adaptation and its subject is really good. While I watch it, I cry because the film is romantic. Event is not love but it is everything. I think the film is watched while you are understanding. I am impressed the film with the music. Actually; the music in the film is effective. The music is slow and romantic, and good voice. Actors donate organ in the film but they escape from donating organ. This reason is nonsense for me because they are obliged to donate an organ. The film reflects same emotion in life except for obligation. Video quality, actors, colors, and director is pleasant. The film is different with working subject. I want you watch the film because you are romantic while watching it and love the music ıf you like romantic music and film.

But I do not think the book is about a love story at all. As usual in my experience the book is a lot richer than the movie. It gradually leads the reader to the ending.

The depth of thought that must have went in to the plot narrative was astounding. Dare I say that the acting was superb because it was.What gives with these actors nowadays, he asks contemplatively. I say that this was a top notch production from top to bottom. Before you go and prejudge this film as drivel or commonplace, see it through to the end. In total, the film truly made me think about my place in life, and how that station can be both confining and ultimately freeing. But, that was only my final take on the movie. For I would be remiss to not indulge this revue further. For instance, I have failed to acknowledge the magnificent acting. I often marvel, for example, at a young girl who can take such a brave leap into the abyss of a world so scantily defined, and so harsh in its finality. A young man taking that same journey is no less impressive. There was a real tenderness that existed between and betwixt these, dare I call them, kids.Worth checking out as a film for the ones who want life full force and full volume.

296,thompd59,Deeply moving and thought-provoking,10,11 March 2014,"I agree with other reviewers who say that this is not one for the masses. Definitely not a 'Hollywood' movie. Based on the award-winning novel by Kazuo Ishiguro, this one rips your heart out and does it slowly while you wade thoughtfully through layers of sub-text. Never Let Me Go is a remarkable study of the human condition and of mankind's predicament, with wonderful performances by the cast - most notably Carey Mulligan - some of them very young and some usually associated with lighter fare than this. I'm not going to go into details about the narrative; you can find those elsewhere, or, better still, you can just watch the film. Be sad, be thankful, and reflect on your own hopes and dreams.

297,rogerlapthorn,"Am I shallow not to ""get"" this film?",3,21 February 2011,"Sorry, but I found this film very disappointing. Some of the scenes were visually beautiful, but Carey Mulligan was let down by a poor script, poor supporting actors and actresses and poor direction. Expecting something of an art-house gem, what we got was a pretentious little film in which the acting was wooden, the story line inconsistent and the overall package a failure. I came away from the cinema unmoved and unimpressed.Perhaps I was watching this at one level when I should have be looking for the deeper meanings beneath the surface? I find it amazing that others have rated this film so highly.

298,Spike64,"Some good acting, but emotionless storytelling",7,9 October 2010,"I've been looking forward to NLMG for a long time, and while I was impressed with it, I thought Romanek was pretty detached in his treatment of the three main characters. To be honest, while much has been made of Ruth's character (Keira Knightley) being reduced to a one-dimensional villain, I thought hers was the only character with any depth whatsoever, and the only one I had any great sympathy for. She at least tried to make something of her life after learning what their fates would be, while Tommy wandered around lost and confused and Kathy simply passively accepted it. Were we supposed to feel bad for her when Ruth swooped in and snatched Tommy up even though she knew he and Kathy had a connection? Kathy wouldn't have summoned up the courage to go after Tommy if the three were going to live to be 100. As for the performances, I've seen a lot of praise for Andrew Garfield here but he just didn't do it for me at all. Carey Mulligan delivered another performance like the one she gave in ""An Education""...very good, but nothing any competent actress couldn't have done, and leaves me scratching my head over all the fuss about her. Keira Knightley, especially during the final third of the film, far outshone her two counterparts and if any of them receive acting noms (unlikely due to the lukewarm overall reception the movie is getting), she's the one most deserving.",Never Let Me Go
299,norakele,A masterpiece,10,30 April 2017,"This film is, at least to me, absolutely unforgettable. I watched the film first, knowing that Andrew Garfield was in it, who is one of my all time favorite actors. He is brilliant here, as well as in every other film he had ever done. After watching the movie I bought the book and it is easily one of the best books I have ever read, this coming from someone who is extremely critical with books and reads a lot. Anyway, the book and the film are both just magical. Andrew Garfield, as I said before is an amazing actor and I am so glad he got the role of Tommy, who is one of the most interesting characters to me. Keira Knightley and Carey Mulligan are both excellent as well, their performances are great. The movie has a very special atmosphere, almost melancholic, and I adore the decoration and the colors, the clothes, everything about the Cottages. Those scenes are probably my favorites. This movie is an excellent piece of art with an amazing cast and with a fascinating, unique plot. I can't recommend it enough. Amazing, truly.",Never Let Me Go
300,sanityfair,One of the best films from 2010.,10,20 February 2011,"I am surprised, after viewing this movie, that it did not get more attention. I truly believe it was among the best movies of 2010, and I enjoyed it more than The Social Network, which was a great movie as well.What works for Never Let Me Go is that it is carefully understated. It does not use trite dramatic plot devices to make the movie more engaging. It is about the lives of three people, Ruth, Kathy, and Tommy, and how they deal with their numbered years they have here until they ""complete"". There is no running away from the system, the goodbyes are not over acted with sentiments, it is more about what is left unsaid.It starts with Ruth, Tommy and Kathy as children at at a school specifically for donors, and one of the last schools of its kind still operating. None of the children have parents, or and family, not even full last names; just a last initial. The main character is Kathy H, who is friends with Ruth. Kathy becomes drawn to Tommy, a boy at the school who is not terribly good at art or sports, and doesn't have luck fitting in. While its very clear early on that Tommy and Kathy love each other, life takes over much in the same way it does for anyone else. Ruth ends up with Tommy, even years after leaving the school as the three of them share a cottage while waiting to make their donations. Kathy, not being able to watch Ruth and Tommy together, applies to be a carer, someone who helps donors during their recoveries, and postponing her own donations by a few years.10 years pass, and Kathy finds Ruth at a hospital accidentally, while she was there attending to another donor. Ruth has finished her second donation, and the two of them seek out Tommy, who has made two donations as well. From then the story focuses on missed opportunities, as Tommy and Kathy finally come to terms with how they feel about one another.There is no running away, no real complaining, no ""why me?"". All of these donors accept the life they are given. The emotions of the film are not so much inspired by them being cheated out of years together, but rather, how many moments do you need to have with someone you love for it to be enough? What this movie emphasizes is that we could all live 100 years and feel like we didn't have enough time. It's our humanity our fears, that keep us from taking risks, for life and for love. It is easier to blend into the system, and its hard to get out of that, and it happens too late, after these relationships past, as we get ourselves into a hole we cant climb out of.The acting is excellent. Carey delivers as the main character, she is fantastic. Quiet, beautiful, observant. Keria plays Ruth, who is damaged and scared and afraid of being alone, and then Andrew plays Tommy, so perfectly.The setting is beautiful. I love that it takes place in the past, while most sci-fi themes tend to always take place in the future. It makes it more surreal, more believable. Beautiful country sides and simple lives. I think it had to be that way. As we watch the 3 of them grow up, we watch as they try to handle normal situations like ordering food at a diner, or watching TV. All alien tasks to them, they don't understand it, and become further isolated from society.To me, the point was that it doesn't matter how much time you have, but what you do with that time. Do you play it safe, possibly making the wrong decisions, and then regretful when faced with the end? Or do you take risks, on the possibility you would have more time with the person you love? But what is 40 years together when just one amazing day with that person is enough? What does more time give you? All it can give you is opportunities, it doesn't give you love, security, satisfaction. You still have to fill in the gaps, no matter how long you're going to be around.",Never Let Me Go
301,charman-07268,A series of missed opportunities,3,10 April 2017,"Never Let Me Go is an underwhelming movie which struggles leave any meaningful messages with viewers.Never Let Me Go utilizes its origins as a novel poorly, skipping or simplifying many of the crucial themes of the book. It was once an intriguing novel due to its chaotic character interactions and intricate descriptions of the world which our protagonist, Kathy H, dwells within. While in text, these concepts are expressed beautifully, as Never Let Me Go was fitted into a film, the skeleton was extracted while the flesh remained in the book.In the movie, nothing really happens. There is never a solid plot compelling scene which grasps viewers. There are no ploys, or plot twists, or even divergent thoughts. The characters simply play the cards they are dealt, and deal with the consequences. That being said, there are still some dramatic moments. Viewers are treated to street screams, heart breaks, and plenty of emotional tension, however none of this drama sparks any change. For example, rather than confronting Ruth or Tommy about her objections with their ongoing relationship, Kathy just puts up with her discomfort and waits for the two to change. Similarly, Tommy does not seek any alternative means of prolonging his life after the option for a deferral has dissipated, he just screams. These emotional releases are indeed dramatic, and may even be seen as admirable coping methods in today's world, but as a viewer, I crave the utilization of such emotion, not just coping mechanisms.Beyond my overall dissatisfaction with the complacency of the film, there was a multitude of other shortcomings where this film seemed to eliminate any opportunities for greatness. In the opening scenes at Hailsham, I frequently found myself craving more dialog and less musical transitions. After finishing the film, the relevance of this entire first section of the plot comes into question, for unlike the novel, the movie fails to address the relationships shared between important characters as children. Additionally, in the cottages, the movie sets up some great opportunities to illustrate the culture shock which Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy must feel when out alone in the city. Yet again, the movie missed the mark, opting for a thoughtless food ordering scene before jumping on to the next plot idea.I am not coming to this website to simply say 'the book did it better', or that 'they shouldn't have even tried', but rather to state 'at least the book did it at all"". Never Let Me Go was not an exceptional novel due to its plot, but rather due to its underlying themes and unique writing style, and in its film adaptation, we are just given a boring, meaningless skeleton.",Never Let Me Go
302,jesusjuansalgado,For the ones who don't understand,10,15 March 2021,"This a really nice movie based on a masterpiece book from the Nobel prize winner Kazuo IshiguroSome people asked why they do not try to escape from their destiny (like in the dumb movie The Island). No, it is not about this. Although it could be seen like a clones film, this is not the target. They cannot escape and they do no try to do it because all the Kazuo literature is based on the destiny you cannot prevent.The entire idea is a metaphor of our existence. We are going to die and we cannot do anything to escape from it. We can cry, run or try to find tricks to escape from the death but we are condemned. We have to admit our destiny and make it happen in a proper way and with honour.Any Kazuo's book is like a nightmare. I truly recommend to read his books. If you like cinema, you can also see The Remains of the Day, also based on one of this books where a Butler sacrifices all his life without love, without mourning his father or without doing anything more with his life because he is the butler, this is his work and he has to do anything to do it the best he can.

305,cmyles-07888,A pretty decent film,8,21 May 2018,"Never Let Me Go is a 2010 British dystopian literature film based on Kazuo Ishiguro's novel, Never Let Me Go - written in 2005. The film was directed by Mark Romanek. There are three main protagonists, Kathy H (played by Carey Mulligan), Ruth C (played by Keira Knightley), and Tommy D (played Andrew Garfield). The story follows the trio throughout their short, confusing lives - starting at their strict boarding school, Hailsham, to the Cottages, and to their inevitable ""completion"" after donations. 
 When the time is right - around mid twenties - every student begins donations, where there organs are removed and unwilling given away for the wealthy's use. Donations occur until ""completion"", where the life of the donator is complete. 
 In the film of Never Let Me Go, I felt that the time spent showing Hailsham was cut short. Readers of the novel can attest to the fact that Hailsham is where an extensive amount of character development takes place. Hailsham is where Cathy, Ruth, and Tommy show signs of being independent people with their own goals and dreams. It is also the place where the bonds between the three protagonists rise and fall over the course of several pages, showing readers the dynamics between each of the characters. Contrastingly, the growth of characters in the film relies on quickly displaying scenes that highlight the major events that impact the dynamic of trio's relationship. While watching the film, I felt that viewers were rushed through and only shown glimpses of Hailsham - which in turn left me unable to connect to the characters of the film the way I did to the characters of the text. 
 An aspect of the film that was unique to the text was the incorporation of daily pills that students must take and the numbered wristband that kept track of the characters in the text. These helped allow for viewers to conceptualize the hold that Hailsham and the bigger overall system had on the students and their behavior. The addition of the elements added to the dystopia effect.
 Overall, I feel that the film did a pretty good job of bringing the text Never Let Me Go to life, but fell short in a couple of areas. I believe the selection of actors for roles was handled well, and that setting of the film was excellent. I only wish that more time was spent showing Hailsham, but I'm sure time restraints had a role in the equation.If I had to rate this movie from 1 through 10, 1 being absolutely a piece of garbage and 10 being the best film I've ever seen, I would give it an 8.5.",Never Let Me Go
306,rohanshah-84809,It was alright,6,20 May 2018,"The movie Never Let Me Go is based upon the book written by Kazuo Ishiguro and follows almost everything that happens in the book. The movie does a good job of creating a plot and including scenes that fit with the plot. By this I mean that the movie sticks with a plot and makes it clear what it is and therefore does not confuse the reader. Also the movie does a good job of following a timeline while also going back to the main character's childhood days. The mechanics of the movie are very well done but the movie itself is confusing. If you haven't read the book before the movie, it will be very hard to understand what is happening. There are a lot of instances in the movie that make sense in the book, but are thrown into the movie to make it seem like the director read the book. For example, the movie does not do a good job of explaining the purpose the movie and it is revealed later on. This leaves the reader not knowing what they are watching and what the purpose is. Also, the movie mainly focuses on three characters Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy and the movie follows them throughout the book. However, there are many other characters we see in the movie that we don't know who they are except for their name. The movie could do a better job of talking about or explained everything else that is going on or the other people in the movie instead of basically strictly Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy the entire way.
Overall, I liked this movie and the mechanics of it and also how the directors made time jumps and stuff pertaining to that. However, the movie does not do a good job of explaining things in the movie which is why I would give it a 6/10.",Never Let Me Go

Even at first, you don't really know that anything different is going on, other than some kids meeting and becoming friends at a boarding school. But once you've found out that the whole purpose of this school, and these kids specifically, is that they were created with the exclusive intent that when they become adults they will be organ donors. They will donate their organs, one surgery at a time until their body stops functioning and they die. Yet, they are still human. They still have feelings and fall in love and want to live their lives. Except they are somehow monitored / tracked and don't have the option to say no.

The movie as it progressed, just left me with a lot of questions that was never answered; Why didn't the kids riot after learning they were only brought up for their organs like cattle? If I as a child would be told that the only reason I was alive was so that I could give body parts to people who needed them in the future, I think my reaction would have been bigger than what the kids expressed.And why the hell did Ruth apologize ""for keeping Kathy and Tommy apart"" like HE didn't have a say in the matter. Yes she was selfish and afraid, but he could have easily just followed his heart and be with Kathy from the beginning! It made no sense what so ever that only she would apologize, and really, she did nothing wrong. She went after what she wanted and he didn't have balls enough to not let her? And then it's all her fault? Come on!
And when Kathy and Tommy finally did end up together, why not run away? They were never incarcerated! This whole movie just makes me angry, not with the ethical aspects; but rather with pea sized brains they must've had not to run away; like ""they won't let us be together cause we're clones, so I guess we just give up and let them harvest our organs"". Also, if all they cared about was organs, why didn't they just butcher them all in one go and take all of the vital organs??Mkay, I'm done ranting.. these were just some of the bigger questions I had.

Similar concepts have been discussed in the past but this one is unique. Something is not right though. The characters demonstrate a utopic behavior and exactly this is the point that the film exploits. It is like there is an ethical law that is unbreakable. Is it altruism? Brainwash?

318,small_songbird,"Hardly ""Emotionless""",9,16 February 2011,"There are plenty of reviews on this site that already detail the magnificent performances of the three lead actors in this film, so I won't bother lending my praise to the lot. The performances were undeniably good.What struck me most about this film was not the science-fiction premise, nor the heart-tugging romance of the three main characters. I truly think the most poignant element of this film was the attitude of the clones themselves.What many people have deemed ""emotionless"" or lacking in reaction to their own fate, I see as a startling accurate portrayal of resignation. These young children/adults face the same thing we all face: eventual death. Yet they know that death will come sooner for them than it will for an average human. By way of notices, they are informed that their ""completion"" is coming soon by the time they are forced to start their first donations.While they may not cry, scream, and fight their destinies, these people - like any other human - have no desire to die. What this film provides differently from others of the same genre is the sense of peace emanating from the three main characters.Like any person diagnosed with a terminal illness, they know they cannot change their fate, nor choose the day they die. They can, however, choose HOW they die. The very lack of overt, extreme emotions so typical to the everyday drama makes way for the beauty of the more subtle ones, such as remorse, forgiveness, affection, hope, hopelessness, peace, and eventually, dignity in death.I was quite impressed.",Never Let Me Go

From the very beginning this movie managed to grab my attention thanks to its excellent direction and scoring. When the actual story began unfolding, I was literally spell-bounded.Its not very often that we come across such a tragic and evoking story matched by a strong acting performance. I never managed to like Keira Knightley but the movie served its little purpose very well as I unconsciously hated Keira's Ruth character and have actually developed a lot more appreciation of her acting ability. Above all though, it was the story that really made the movie for me.Like once said before, I wasn't informed of the movie's story. So when I confronted it, I was shocked! I was touched! And I was taken to that special blank space of mind where there lives only the movie and its spectator. The story was not sudden, too swift, or over-ambitious. The fact that the original writer of this movie is half Japanese is clearly Visible in the way this movie was so delicate and humble.

My actual comment is that, I don't know any of you reading this, but I would have loved they played 'Never let me go' as the closing song, during the credits.

You need to take for granted that the whole world was convinced it was a good idea to make and bring up children to become organ farms, you need to accept that those children cannot escape, will not attempt self-harm in any way and peacefully grow up to be 'donors' and then die while idly reflecting on their lives.For me it seemed absolutely unreal that neither the children, or the teenagers have no reaction to being brought up exclusively to be donors. They never question it, never talk about it, never try to escape it.Ultimately it tried to draw a parallel between their lives and the lives of those who are not brought into the world to be donors, but it clearly failed at that, and - for me at least - the whole point of it all is elusive.",Never Let Me Go
322,im_cute88,Don't see this movie unless you want to Let go of your brain,1,23 January 2011,"I seriously feel as if a chunk of my brain fell off after watching this movie. I believe it is due to how stupid the screenplay writer and director think the viewers are (or they themselves might not be that bright....who knows)What's worse is to open IMDb and see some people raving about how great this movie is and how this makes you think the whole time. Yeah I think how long will this crap go on. And how stupid can these characters be.We are to believe that after they learn their fate, their attempt to avoid it is just by asking for deferral?? And that when told there is no such thing they just scream in the middle of a street? A little study of Biology (I believe during my Junior High) mentioned that our survival instinct part of brain is the first to develop and the one that kicks in whenever we face problems. It's a field of study that I will suggest for the writers and director of this movie.There is one scene so memorable in the movie (which is probably when the screenwriter wrote right after he got his lobotomy done). It's when they finished the 3rd organ harvesting of Ruth and she died. The doctors just pack up and left the room (instead of trying to revive her as what would happen in normal world) they tried to portray a message that these people are just like cattle and their life is just for the organs, but if that's true, won't they straight away try to harvest all other organs that can't be harvested without the person dying? (heart, lungs, corneas) we all, at least those with brain still know that those organs need to be harvested as fast as possible.Sure the scenery is beautiful and the acting is pretty good and there is the yada and the blah blah like other reviewers said. But if you're looking for a movie that your brain can remotely comprehend (I'm talking to those that have basic education) then Never Pick This piece of steaming horse crap up.",Never Let Me Go
323,b_hutchinson,Not quite the book but worth watching!!,9,7 January 2011,"As a fan of the book I had mixed emotions towards this film. It doesn't compare to the novel. The novel is a lot darker and we see more of the characters desperation and less of a romance between Tommy and Cath. I'm going to review this movie separately from now on, because there are elements of the book missing but it doesn't make the movie any less enjoyable.The shots in this movie were stunning and paired with the music that was enough to have me sniffling alone. All three leads were incredible in their role. While everyone has been mainly singing Carey Mulligan, I'd like to say what a tremendous job Andrew Garfield did. He really pulled the role of Tommy off well and was completely believable the whole time. Keira Knightley was good as Ruth but had a really unlikable side to her. It's harder to believe that Cath and Ruth are friends in the movie, just because of the way they played their characters. The young actors were amazing as well and looked eerily similar to their older co-stars.This movie had me crying at the end, as I expected it would, and overall the movie was pulled off wonderfully. Does it compare to the book? No, the two are very different but if this was just a movie it would do equally as well.",Never Let Me Go

325,linkyrules,"Visually Beautiful, Emotionally Dead--Poor Adaptation",5,5 July 2012,"Viewing this as a movie in its own standing, Never Let Me Go is a passable film with its hits and misses. The acting is solid; the cinematography is breath-takingly beautiful and leaves a deep impression. But the story itself is relatively shallow and poorly told.Perhaps it is because I watched this movie right after I finished the book, I felt that this movie failed to do justice to Kazuo Ishiguro's deep and complex novel. The book ask deep questions about humanism and morality concerning cloning technology; but these issues are subtly dealt with. The novel foregrounds the complex relationship between Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy. Their love for each other is undeniable. However, due to their special identity, each has to deal with their own fears, insecurities, and fate. Each character reacts differently to their situation, and it is this process of manipulation, reconciliation, and love-hate mentality that makes the novel immensely interesting and touching.The movie simplifies things a lot--too much in fact. The movie foregrounds their special condition and their eventual fate. The relationship takes a back seat. The deep connection between Kathy and Ruth is blatantly omitted. What's left is the cheesy romance between Tommy and Kathy; Ruth becomes a flat antagonist whose actions are hardly justified. In the book, the title ""Never Let Me Go"" is a song to which the protagonist dance to while imagining herself cradling and fending for a vulnerable baby. However, in the movie, this song becomes a sad love song that the protagonist listens to while Tommy and Ruth have sex. This change takes away much of the book's original sentiment and leaves in its wake an emotionally dead film.I would recommend this movie to those who would like to while away a couple of hours watching a visually beautiful movie. But for those who enjoyed the novel, I would advise you not to waste your time on this poor adaptation.",Never Let Me Go
326,flamingoklr,Spectacularly Disturbing,9,8 April 2011,"For me this movie left me with mixed emotions but in no way was I left feeling unfulfilled. This movie was deeply moving. It was strange; it was magnificent; it was emotional; it was thought provoking. The actors and the directors alike did a superb job. For me, the movie consisted of a large commentary on modern society. The setting, during the 1970s in the English countryside, was a perfect pairing of the rather futuristic idea of cloning and the timelessness of the storyline. The stark setting creates this feeling as if one is stuck in time as a very modern idea revolves around the characters. The average setting is so realistic that at times I forgot the story was fictional. It is the love story in the movie that really brought the emotional topic full circle. The inability for two people who love each other to be together is relatable and dispiriting. Although quite disconcerting at times, this movie delivered a pertinent message about society and its fallacies.",Never Let Me Go

Well, I doubt I will be running down to the store for a copy.So we're coming home from a long day on the road and someone suggested a stop at the movie theatre. We pull in to a place that shows a lot of indie flix and none of us were familiar with the offerings. We reviewed the 5 boards outside noting actors we liked, directors we knew and on the toss of a coin metaphorically speaking we chose ""Never Let Me Go."" We are ardent movie-goers. I personally like the occasional sci-fi genre. We all have open minds and are well educated.This film was not our cup of tea. The most interesting thing I can say about it is how we have all come back to talk about how much we disliked it. There was almost utter silence in the car on the way home. It was bizarre.There are so many contradictions and implausible holes in the concept that taking that leap of faith that is required to buy into things like this is just not possible.I heard a lot of hushed negativity leaving the film as if no one wanted to say how disturbed they were out loud.I guess that it is sort of a Gattaca for a new alternative world. Without the glamour or the positive hopeful conclusion... Well not exactly. And nor do I believe in every story having a happy ending. I don't know why I was so affronted by this film. We all agreed the performances were solid. It had a lot of things going for it in terms of scenery and look. But there were just too many things that left blots on the page.

As a matter of fact, it's a very interesting and unusual film, a must-see for all people who are even slightly out of the mainstream.

This film did it for me, this movie was the missing link I needed. It was painful to watch feeling how they must feel but I needed it.

Now, I wish I had read the book, because I feel like I was missing something from the movie. There wasn't enough depth and development to the characters to become attached, and there were holes in the plot that might have been filled with more explanation. It could have been amazing, but it seemed to me like there just wasn't quite enough to it. Nevertheless, Never Let Me Go was profound and moving, the kind of movie you just don't find very often anymore.

If you like quick fire plots this isn't the film for you. Keira Knightley's great acting was wasted on this film. Keira Knightley was the best actress but she hardly got a look in.

Fact of the matter is that it is terrible. Don't worry if you think ""I didn't get it"" because there is nothing to get except some much needed sleep if you suffer from insomnia.The characters are cloned to be organ donors yet there is not a single question as to the morality of the premise, not a question from the characters about whether this is right or wrong and they walk around with a mentality of, ""I'm going to die and that's just fine."" Yet they somehow are all looking for a way to get out of dying. They have cars, they have freedom and they don't run? There is no confrontation with any of the powers that be and other than a couple screams and a few tear drops on the cheek you wouldn't even know they had a pulse. Didn't know cadavers could still donate organs.Now the movie tries to be deep and artistic and points to the fact that if you can prove you love, or if you can prove that you have artistic capabilities then you must have a soul. If you have a soul then you would be worth saving.

338,ms_lucy,Young love is the only thing the students of Halisham truly own.,6,12 March 2011,"Never let me go, Screen adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's novel by Mark RomanekI went to see this screen adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's novel, at the much loved Ultimate Picture Palace in East Oxford, and joined the queue of people outside. I overheard a couple mistakenly saying that UPP is a cinema that shows only old film's and perhaps this is a common misconception of the cinema, which has a mix of old and current films on its program.Never Let Me Go, suggests from the title to belong to the genre of Romance, and indeed the title has been taken from a fictional love song by Judy Bridgewater. Set in the 1970's the costume and tone have a somber and austere quality and with the lighting and colouration of the shoot in subdued hues of hospital gown greens, browns and greys with some pretty pastels you could be forgiven for thinking it was the 1950's.Locations used in the film include Ham House and Garden in Richmond, a 17th century building that is the facade of Halisham School, a boarding school where the film begins, and where the main protagonists Kathy, Ruth and Tommy are schooled. They grow up and move to live in the countryside in the cottages where they have space to develop relationships, the one thing that is truly theirs. The children who grow up at Halisham are less than ordinary, they live excluded and isolated lives, out of societies gaze and as such come across as naive and innocent in their outlook on life.This is a film in which horror and ethics are quietly and efficiently put out of mind and we are offered romance as a solace so that what we most remember is the story of young love and the trials of growing up, with a science fiction twist that subtly presents itself as accepted fact. Don't let the term Sci-Fi put you off, the narrative is barely interrupted by the new information the children come across about their purpose in life, the tone is little disturbed like the face of the head teacher who dispassionately sets out their daily rules. That is what is most disturbing about the book and the film, the understated and clinical way horror is presented as fact using euphemism's such as 'Completion' rather than 'Death'. The audience is left subtly affected by what they learn and only encouraged to feel slightly appalled at the way the young people from this strange and isolated boarding school are made to believe is their purpose in life.Dispassionate and accepting of their situation there is not much scope within the plot for shows of raw emotion or much of a range for the actors to revel in, more a subdued and quiet acceptance of their lot in life. Carey Mulligan who plays Kathy has to remain stoic and supportive throughout as a carer living as she does to sooth the pain of others. I am reminded of Ian McEwen's Atonement, partly because Keira Knightley plays key roles in both films and because they are both adaptations from tragic romance novels that I read in tangent, in which there is also a love story that is suspended by the actions of a young girl. In Atonement, Knightley's character was on the receiving end of unrequited love here, she is the girl who prevents another's love from flourishing.Having read the book first, non of the twists in plot were a surprise to me however the novel has been artfully translated into film and will surely haunt me more visually in it's film form. I really enjoyed hearing Tommy's explanation of the purpose of art and his hopeful philosophy that art could reveal truths about his soul and the rare moments of humour and understated beauty in the cinematography.",Never Let Me Go

340,radient_loser,Same old' storyline,6,8 April 2011,"The movie was not up to my expectation. I had heard praises about this movie and started to watch with great enthusiasm. However, as the movie unravels itself, it appears to me that the plot gets weaker and finally drops dead. The lack of climax, twists and surprises makes the journey boring and depressing. We are presented with the same contradictions about the clones like the movie ""The Island"". The storyline is basically the same: human clones, their unfortunate romances,helplessness in the face of reality and subtle ethical issues. The clones in ""The Island"" had the courage to stand up and fight. But here the donors are submissive and in a sense aloof to their existence. Also the story couldn't specify why the donors are not using their freedom to break the shackle of injustice. The subtle issues about love and betrayal adds some spice but still it does not make any sense. If the donors had the power of jealousy and betrayal then they must rebel against the injustice. Their ""goody-goody"" nature cannot explain the three cigarettes,passionate sex(without any pregnancies!) and the jealousy. The good thing about the movie is that the acting is appealing and touchy. The rustic beauty of England and the calm England weather is portrayed beautifully.The camera work is awesome and the music composition is soothing and at times depressing . The acting was also up to the mark. So, I think this movie is a waste of talent.

What was prenatal care like for whoever carried the babies? They were allowed to have sex freely so were they all sterile or were they on birth control? Lot's of questions, for me anyway!

Acting is well above average, and is what will probably convince you to finish the movie. The cinematography is also quite beautiful, yet slightly bleak. The main characters in this movie are lacking the very basic law of nature: the will to survive.

349,aazam-parvez,"A tragic take on ""Life""",7,19 February 2012,"Never Let Me Go is a thought provoking Romantic Thriller Drama from Director Mark Romanek (Know for One Hour Photo) based on a book by the same name.The Novel Never Let Me Go was ranked the best novel of the year in 2005 by TIME magazine and is now included in Top 10 Novels of 2000's. I was not aware of this fact until I stumble upon this information while bouncing of some web pages.In short I could have mentioned that Never Let Me Go has the same theme as ""The Island"" ( The Movie) set in Sussex Britain in late 60's and 80's but that would have been insult to Kazuo Ishiguro, A Japanese-born British author who craftily placed the time line of his story in the past instead of near future. I believe the reason he did so because NLMG is essentially a Romantic Tragedy and very few movies in past who had their time-line set in Future were not able to connect the audience with a love story. Though there are exceptions like Blade Runner who made us feel very sorry for ""engineered organic robots"". Apart from that the author raises very serious questions about near future Cloning Technology and breeding of clones for sole purpose of organ farming. Most importunately and very subtly he raises a very strong question about existence of God, if humans can make clones (Humans) where will the souls for clones come from? I am sure everyone can go through many reviews available on IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes and Wikipedia to understand the plot of the movie. I am only here to discuss the consequences of such art work. It is thought provoking work and so real in near future.Kathy, Ruth and Tommy who share a love triangle between them are also clones who are being breed in English East Sussex in Hailsham boarding school during late 60's. Hailsham is no ordinary boarding school. It's meant for very special students who are not told of their main purpose in life until Miss Lucy, a comforting teacher gave up their biggest secret in pure emotion and of course gets suspended. If you have not read the novel it will take some time to understand the plot until Miss Lucy gives you in a platter. Since the time line is set in past you sometimes starts to believe that maybe UK had such program in past, which is of course not.The children of Hailsham have only one purpose that is to donate their organs to ""Real"" people in need. They are clones who are breed for Organ Farming and their interaction with the outside world is minimal if not downright negligible. Every clone raised in Hailsham can take up two roles in this process he or she can either volunteer to be Carer or Donor. The Carer takes care of organ donor until he completes or dies because he has donated all his or her vital organs 3 or more times. Eventually the Carer becomes Donor and completes too. It's a very mechanical way to look at life born out of test tube as if they don't have souls or feelings.The love triangle of Kathy, Ruth and Tommy is interesting one too and the main purpose of this love story is to let people know that even if conquer the final frontier of Science by creating life what will be purpose of this life? Will clones be raised as slave labor or Organ donors. what will happen when they start to grew feelings like us? Can we just shut them of like machines or do we need to ask more serious questions on what we are creating? and will the life of a clone be of far less importance because he was not born out of human womb! Overall it's a very serious and tragic movie. Recommended for the real cinema lovers and thinking minds. It has a low entertainment value though the production value and cast acting is highly admirable except Keira Knightley who looks little out of place with young actors and of course someone please tell her to stop doing overacting. BTW The poster of this movie does not do justice to the movie. The protagonist had very little to do with wooden bridge on ocean front, looks like the production house wanted to sell Never Let Me Go as a long lost love storywhich in my opinion it's not.",Never Let Me Go
350,agunes10,Gave me a reason to increase my medication costs,1,23 November 2013,"I've been diagnosed with major chronic depression and currently being treated in a private hospital. I've picked this movie to watch within my ""time-passer"", a time slot allocated to each patient in the ward to get a relief and come to our senses and the feelings of the life. I well came to my senses after watching this movie...Though otherwise gloomy, the movie at the beginning intrigued me with well portrayed grizzly fields, a school as big as our clinic(where people are bred to donate their organs), impeccable portrayal of rules and ordinance... I could see the deepness of the movie that was about to reveal. Well ordered milk bottles, only to be drunk by innocent sheep to be slaughtered later, great performances of actors that open doors to inner sense of their well being... These scenes cured me better than Prozac and xanax, well momentarily.Later the scenes faded away and been replaced by the ones where people get in lines to get cut and only smile back at their fates. No reason to defy or take the control of their lives, they are willing to cut into pieces and given to their originals to replace their defective parts. My clinic therapist suggested that these scenes might have also reversed my therapy progress and I should be writing down all of my thoughts about this movie to get rid of it for the good.Though I can see and understand the dark and dejected atmosphere of certain lives in certain places (the infamous writer of the original book is from Japan), this movie could easily grasp the last breath of life you've left and blow it away to eternity. The kids whose facial gestures only change from mild sad to utter sad grow into worse characters who only momentarily smile to cry thereafter with dreariness. Although it may help some people to see the ""profoundness"" of the work done by the director, this movie only helped me increasing my medication costs. Unfortunately I can't get a refund of what I've lost but, oh well, only thing you see in this movie is loss anyway. Ironically the movie is testing whether the kids had souls (not that it mattered to story line anyway), it may as well rape and steal yours.So please stray away from this movie unless you want to get a taste of Prozac and boredom. Utter disappointment.",Never Let Me Go
351,mgvsmith,Scientific Romance,5,29 December 2011,"Early Science Fiction works were often described as Science Romance as publishers and producers felt that Science Fiction lacked credibility. That time has long past but seems appropriate for this work. If this film is to be considered as a film about ethics and science, then it is a failure for it doesn't properly address the ethical issues. On the other hand, if this was considered a romantic story about a three handed relationship then it works much better. Sci-fi does at its best deal with the big issues, in this case life and death and the acceptance of this human condition. In the hands of Rod Serling or Robert Matheson (Twilight Zone) this would have been handled with the correct amount of balance between the sci-fi and the romance but in this case the dreariness prevails.",Never Let Me Go

While the actors and actresses were good and the presence of Keira Knightley is a real attraction to want to watch the movie, the preposterous plot of the movie makes it such a waste of time to watch. The movie does not even explain how these people cannot even simply NOT donate any of their organs. No society can force anybody to donate one's body parts, not even in the distant future not to speak of the 1980s. I cannot understand how Keira Knightley could even accept this movie part. If not for her I would not have watched this movie. Her name makes people think that this movie is worth watching but unfortunately it is so boring and slow. The lead actress though is very good and such a natural actress. Still this movie is just so depressing to the point that it is ludicrous.",Never Let Me Go

Or any of the numerous diseases that will ban you from donor lists forever. Some of those will be mild enough to make your life almost normal in terms of length and quality. Even if we disregard medical facts supporting this story, psychological ones remain weak also. So, Mr. Kazuo Ishiguro is trying to convince me that those people, despite having free access to information of all sorts, and free access to all means of transportation, can't at least try to escape? Oh please. Vast majority of them would turn to rebels and start rioting and burning cities. Others, more intelligent ones would try to flee unnoticed, get a fake identity, or something...

I remember hating it. It wasn't the story itself that I hated, it wasn't the moral implications, it was the way it was told. Meandering, too drawn out in some places, and with an ending that seemed abrupt and without reference to the rest of the book. Whether it was because I was prepared for the ending and knew the story or not, or whether the movie format necessitated a more concise telling of the story, this has been one of the few movies that I have enjoyed more than the book. Recommended if you like other 1960s-esque stuff like Ginger and Rosa, The Help, An Education, Moonrise Kingdom, Cracks.

Carey's Kathy has strength of character but she shows her loss so well when her love is taken away from her. Andrew Garfield is so lovely when he portrays pain and loss, it just makes your heart melt. His is by far the best part in the film.A number of people have called Never Let Me Go dull and depressing but, while it is a slow film (no bangs or robots her boys) it builds a truly haunting atmosphere that will stay with you for ever(ish) after. Its not depressing its wonderfully sad in that melancholic way that makes you sigh and think deep thoughts about truth, love and chocolate.

Right know, I see myself if not in a different perspective, surely changed. I did not cry but I was not able to fully concentrate on daily routine and to have a proper meal for about a week after I watched this movie.

They never question the ethics of having to be young organ donors until they die from it! Alright, let's assume the characters were quite well conditioned in Halisham but regimes that try to condition people into being the cogs of the system have a strict censorship and limitation to the citizens (see North Korea) but the grown-up characters are roaming around freely, reading whatever they want to and just accept their faith to die way younger than the other people who are expected to live over 100 just because they were born clones.Alright, let's assume the characters were genetically conditioned to be absolutely compliant. But what about the rest of the society? What happened to the Hippocratic oath of doctors? No philosophers, rebels, anyone to consider this being unethical! Seeing how in the modern society animal rights advocates are getting more and more stronger, imaging a modern society where there are no *human* rights is just... a killer of the suspension of disbelief. If it needs to be about slaves who don't even think to revolt it needs to make more sense. A society where the whole human nature is so different needs to look alien in other aspects too.

This is a haunting story, set in an alternate version of the future. The premise is oddly kind of sci if, although the movie is definitely not of that feel. Visually a very beautiful film with soft lighting that favors Carey Mulligan and appeals to the senses. This film raises all sorts of questions, I urge those who haven't to see it and make up their own minds. I have nothing to compare it to...

367,aimee-lucas5,Tedious and Tiresome,3,21 September 2014,"I felt 'Never Let Me Go' raised some interesting ethical issues about cloning. I particularly enjoyed the way Ishiguro presented all those at Hailsham with slight personality flaws, for example Ruth's need for attention, as it seemed to show that they weren't 'super humans' and seemed to back up the theme of the 'The Gallery' that ran throughout the novel. However, apart from these two aspects to the book, I found it to be very tedious. Throughout the book there was a feeling that it was building up to something, there seemed to be sense that something big, perhaps unexpected was going to happen. Sadly I have to say I was disappointed. The ending was predictably and frankly a huge anti-climax. Also I found the style it was written in intensely irritating. I believe the reason Ishiguro chose to write it in a fragmented way was to echo how the mind works when memories pop up at random as one thing reminds you of another. This is a clever concept however there is no flow to the text and to read in this style is tiresome. Kathy seems to recall her memories with no passion or excitement, just stating what happened and declaring her feelings for the past. The trouble is when the reader is simply shown and not told the emotions of the narrator it is very hard to become emotionally attached to the characters in the book yourself. I was annoyed at the fact that Ishiguro presents the clones with human traits but not once does a character question why it's fair to them and why they have to donate. This makes the Hailsham students seem a little less real, and widens the gap between humans and clones which I believe was not the effect Ishiguro intended when you consider the gallery and other aspects in the book that go against this. Overall, I was frustrated when reading this book, as I felt maybe a grand statement would be made or something truly thought provoking would be uncovered if I carried on reading to the end, this was not the case. I felt as if though the ending should have moved me, but it just didn't as the last quarter of the book became increasingly drab as I predicted the ending. I believe the novel had the potential to influence the way we think about cloning, which is why I think is it is such a let-down.",Never Let Me Go
368,lillyan-113-552234,Poignant beauty,9,21 September 2014,"Never Let Me Go. An apt title for the book, as the poignant storyline stays with you for a long time after the last chapter finishes. The only way to understand what this book is like to read is to describe it as an old oak tree; beneath its jagged, coarse, thick exterior, the new wood is slowly growing, hidden by the weathered bark, until much later on, when on the broad gnarled boughs you glimpse a smooth young acorn, very different to the outside of the tree that you saw before. This sums up the reading style – jolting, informal, chatty remarks, which pull the reader in and out of the many little stories that give this book the life that it secretly glows with. And of course, there is the narrator herself – Kathy H, a carer who faced a fragile Utopian childhood in a mysterious school named Hailsham, and her companions, Tommy and Ruth, also pupils there, all intertwined in a tale of twisted hope in a society of division and segregation. This story explores the controversial concepts of clones, and follows them as they go through childhood and adolescence, eventually separating from their past idyllic surroundings and being plunged into a alternative 1990s surrounding of an abandoned rural England, where nothing is as it seems. Fear is an implicit theme which binds itself around each chapter with silent ferocity. Never seen, never heard, yet always sensed, it shapes the opinions of not only the characters, but also the reader's, gently plucking heartstrings throughout the book. Kathy H never explicitly mentions fear, but often she expressed her wariness in the recounted stories, ""though I couldn't really say why"". Her instincts differ from the reader's when reacting to people or events, and this gives a pleasant contrast between her view and the readers, to offer a less passionate view on what is a serious ethical debate nowadays. In her mind, it is something so deeply ingrained that it is just accepted, but her raw pain at the end of the book radiates from the pages, even though she lays everything out in such a matter-of-fact way. Unconsciously, with every inked word, you draw closer to her and her friends, and while it reveals itself as a beautifully sad, calm book, you feel the last chapter tear out your heart, and your lungs start to clog up in your throat. Only a heart chiselled from stone could ignore the hurt that an anguished truth caused, the children clinging onto a lie as the only escape from a doomed world. Overall, this book is not a light jovial read, but it is not meant to be. The characters and their stories continue to haunt you, and for this mortifying reason I recommend you to read this. You will never be the same again, and perhaps this is for the better, as eyes have finally opened towards this tale, and Kathy and Ruth and Tommy will never leave you. To be perfectly honest, they are not characters. They are people, like you and me, their life story told to finally light the torches on this issue. They do not come across as paper and ink. In my mind's eye, they are flesh and blood, and only a ream of paper is between your extended hand and theirs. Read the book, tell the story, and see the life. Just because they came from a writer's mind doesn't make them unreal.",Never Let Me Go
369,bukovitelli,A picture of fear and anxiety,8,5 December 2014,"I have seen some misunderstandings in a large group of reviews (both negative and positive), thus I express my own thoughts.I see the love triangle as an easy-to-comprehend family of human emotions utilized to draw a picture of something far more complex and horrifying: the fear of death. In such narrative, these everyday human situations: love, care, friendship, envy, betrayal, penance, and absolution; are the colors of our soul, that we care to examine on a daily basis. We are comfortable with them, therefore they provide excellent media for something far more difficult to grasp. The impending doom is that makes these children all the same as everybody else, and the point of the whole movie is this sameness: no matter how late it comes, we are never prepared for it, we always want just a bit more. The canvas is the human life, the brush and colors are the familiar human emotions, and the object, the topic, is the fearsome, though not less human, mortality.What makes the movie overly depressing - what we have seen in negative comments - is that we feel they could always escape. I feel the donors in this sense are metaphoric, referring to every single mortal creature. We learn of our mortality roughly the same age they do, there are some rumors, seeds of hope for a small prolonged lifespan, and when we discover our utter helplessness, we can do nothing else, but stop the engines for a few moments, and scream in agony.We need the donor story to always keep the sword of Damocles close, and the anxiety is illustrated through the relationship of the three main characters. I am no expert on acting, but the writing is excellent (credits for the novel I suppose), the picture and the music usually supports it with appropriate ambiance.

Nobody questions the situation in a satisfying way and it leaves the viewer desperate at the end. The attempt to discuss serious topics in context about how far society is willing to go, to get rid of illnesses and death, failed by the passive approach the producers took. There are better movies about this topic out there. Even though it is clear that the movie doesn't even try to answer questions it takes this approach very far, and for anyone who enjoys a convincing plot, probably too far. Anyone who is happy to watch a slow move distantly touching a serious topic will probably enjoy this very much.

372,glenchess,"Pretty pictures, but not a film about humans",2,19 February 2015,"Ishiguro's obsession with a stereotypical England is this time set in a bizarre alternative vision of life in the late twentieth century.The whole film seems a hollow creation in which children are bred for the purpose of dying as organ donors. We are asked to believe that they accept this from an early age, and go to the operating rooms like sheep to an abattoir. The society in which they live apparently has absolutely no qualms about murdering to obtain spare parts.Where did these children (all white, all healthy, all so very English middle class) come from? Where are there families? What, exactly, is wrong with their teachers, their patients, their friends, their entire society? This is all so utterly unhuman that I was simply unable to believe in any aspect of the characters behaviour. I bailed out on this film about half way after recognising that I would never care about what happened to such unbelievably portrayed individuals, or the revolting society in which they were so used.This is all very disappointing compared to Remains of the Day, which managed to transcend the artificiality of its setting to at least allow us to believe that the characters might act as they did.If Never Let Me Go is an attempt at a sci-fi dystopia, then it fails. If its meant as a novel to convey a message about our humanity then it fails utterly.On the plus side, it was quicker to watch half of this ghastly and pointless film than it would have been to read half of the novel.

379,karmanosthefour,meh,6,17 April 2016,"Disclaimer: I am going to review this movie as if I have never read the book.Overall, I found the movie Never Let Me Go to be a decent watch, but I cannot bring myself to say it was a ""good"" or ""bad"" movie. The beginning of the movie is what really confused me. When we saw the student's early life at Hailsham, I feel like we were only shown bits of it. Little key snapshots that really paint the picture of the world they live in, but fail to really show the characters personalities. I felt that they lost focus on connecting the people with the characters, and spent too much time on showing the world they live in. Additionally, I saw barely any events which signaled friendship between Kathy and Ruth. I only event I recall is when they are sitting on the hill talking about horses. Not only that, but the scene with Ruth staring at Kathy as she danced to the song ""Never Let Me Go"", was just plain weird and did add to the movie one bit. (P.S. I thought they really should have made more of an attempt to have the people connect with the audience. I felt as if I was watching a movie version of Sparknotes or Schmoop.) Moving on to the cottages part of her life: I will start with my biggest question, why in gods name did Ruth kiss Kathy after telling her that Tommy does not love her? It only made me unsure of how to feel about Ruth. I found the scene with Kathy and Tommy involving the porn magazine to be a funny scene, but still did nothing to make me more interested. Up until that scene I only saw Kathy as a very monotone and grey person, afterwards I saw her as not only monotone and grey but sassy. Now skip to Kathy and Tommy love life: This really shocked me. I never once imagined Kathy ever falling on love with Tommy. I knew right from the scene when Tommy buys Kathy her tape that they were destined to fall in love, but I saw maybe one scene where she showed minimal interest in him. (Quick question: When Kathy and Tommy have sex, wasn't Tommy in dire pain as he just got his first donation done? I mean let the man rest Kathy.) Overall I found the movie to be very confusing and unsure of what genre in wished to be. Is it a dystopian or is it a love-story? I asked myself that when the credits rolled down the screen. Oh and If you have read the book, don't watch the movie it makes it 10x worse.",Never Let Me Go

381,jessiejessk,felt like the writers were trying to write Never Let Me Go with new characters. Did not go too well.,1,10 April 2017,"Overall, the movie adaptation of Never Let Me Go makes very little sense to anyone who has not read the book, and it is inconsistent with the book to the point that readers become frustrated with the glaring inaccuracies. Therefore, the movie adaptation to Never Let Me Go is not suitable for anyone (as everyone either has or has not read the book). Analyzing the movie independently from the book, there are several issues that immediately come to mind; including the apparent lack of emotion in each character until an outburst, the limited character development, the absent character motivation, and the fact that certain references brought in from the book that seemed out of place (given the components that were removed).The characters in the movie adaptation of Never Let Me Go did not portray any clear emotions, aside from the occasional outburst. This may be described as a director's choice, used to demonstrate depression or a disregard for the future and personal well being, but that explanation is inconsistent with the characters' actions (seeking a deferral, etc). Related to this is the issue of character development, which seemed almost entirely absent. Due to the omission of anything that was not a major plot point (and a few things that were), the movie either failed to characterize certain characters, or characterized them incorrectly (particularly Tommy and Ruth). The idea of characterization leads into character motivation. This movie is largely driven by the actions of the characters rather than outside forces (as it is not focused on the dystopia, but is rather a story occurring within a dystopia), and it suffered greatly from the mischaracterization of main characters, which resulted in a lack of character motivation. It is as if the movie took plot points and actions from the book and assigned them to a new set of characters. Unfortunately, this leaves the audience wondering why a given character did something, and ultimately degrades the viewing experience. In addition to characterization (and related) issues, I found that certain references from the book were incorporated without adequate context, due to plot points that were changed or cut from the book (notably, Kathy never loses her tape, and therefore never finds it in Norfolk, and her speech about Norfolk being the ""lost corner"" seems somewhat out of place.Essentially, it felt like the people who wrote this movie wanted to do an adaptation of Never Let Me Go, but about ⅛ of the way through the script they decided to write a different movie.",Never Let Me Go
382,isabellavarrasso,Brilliant,9,22 August 2017,"Studying this book for VCE English, thoroughly enjoyable and a really good movie. Little bit confusing in the sense that are THEY the clones or are their organs going to be creating clones of themselves? A very smart movie, very unique and different from the typical Hollywood movie. Good choice in actors as well, different to the usual roles which they play.",Never Let Me Go
383,mariagheorghe-35937,"The Book Is A Masterpiece, The Movie... Not So Much",2,4 January 2018,"I read the book a couple of days before watching the movie. I was very excited to watch it and I never thought, not once, that the film would be so bad. The book was absolutely amazing! It was a story about friendship and love and the mystery kept you on the edge of your seat. Whereas the movie focused way too much on the romantic side of the story, which actually, in my point of view, was hardly noticeable in the book. Ruth's character is seen as the villain of the story (in the movie) and Kathy is crying like every 5 minutes. Not to mention that a lot of very important parts of the book were nowhere to be found in the movie. The acting was good, not even close to great, but let's say ""satisfying"". The three main actors are very dear to me and I loved most of their movies (some of their interpretations were flawless) , sadly this one was a complete failure. The book deserved a much better adaptation.",Never Let Me Go
384,satukaitaranta,Sad and beutiful story that you wont never forget,9,9 September 2018,"I read the book and it was absolutely amazing, one of the best books I have ever read. So I had kind of high hopes for this movie and actually this movie did quite well! The actors was great and the story was told very well, it was very similar with the book. The story is so sad and provoking and it will stay on your mind a very long time. But at the same time this is one of the most beutiful film I have seen. You should really see this movie and yes, read the book as well!",Never Let Me Go

386,attrayo,Unlike Any Other,6,23 October 2017,"Hi,I viewed this movie last evening not knowing what to expect. While there were moments when I was tempted to turn it off, I was captivated by the excellent depiction of emotion by the actors/actresses.I am still not certain as to whether or not this school ever existed in England, but plan to do some research on this. I am certainly aware that there were many barbaric practices that took place many years ago, so wouldn't doubt that this is a true story or at least based upon a true story.I do have to admit that while I found this film captivating, I also found it disturbing and extremely sad.Regards, ~Attrayo",Never Let Me Go

388,unity-91633,READ THE DAMN BOOK,6,22 April 2018,"Okay, first of all, I'd just like to say that I completely agree with a few of the reviews that talk about the pace and development of the film. It was slow, non-descriptive and didn't make you want to sympathize or feel for the characters. BUT if you have read the book, then you would know that it gives you a much much different feeling as to how the story moves along and the way Kathy feels and describes the three parts of the story. They missed out on a lot of detail in the film that was significant in giving the readers a full feeling of the story. It is meant to represent an unethical world where these 'clones' are treated like machines, used for their organs, and although there are people like Madame and Miss Emily that try to fight for their rights, it ends up failing... touching on real world problems! And it DOESNT give you a happy ending, it DOESNT give you the Hollywood ending where they do get a deferral and end up feeling happily after and that's why the book is so powerful (and makes you think) because this concept is a reflection of problems in the real world. Not directly but it does. Think about it.",Never Let Me Go
389,danielmahomet,Hard watch,5,11 November 2018,I went in not expecting anything but the story is great and actoring is fantastic but I must say they fact they dont question why or even fight or run away but accept their fate without even a fight is frustrating and annoying feels like a zombie more with about as emotion it made me sad to watch it I know people will say there are lessons here but if you arnt 100 percent happy maybe skip this movie as it feel like watching someone kick another while they are down no one enjoys that. I only wish one would fight run hell even say NO,Never Let Me Go
