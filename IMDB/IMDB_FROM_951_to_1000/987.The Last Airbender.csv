0,MartinHafer,Not good...but not awful.,4,26 May 2018,"You might want to know that I am NOT the target audience for ""The Last Airbender"". I never watched the television show and only got the DVD from Netflix because I was curious if the film was actually as bad as its reputation would have it.So was the film any good? Not especially. At times, the film seemed to skip around and the plot didn't always make sense. I understood why this was the case when I read IMDB's trivia. In order to afford to convert the production to 3D, they cut out huge bits of story...and it showed. The transitions were sometimes klunky and the story felt rushed and superficial. It seems almost criminal to deliberately sacrifice story in order to make the film a 3D spectacle but although the film was universally panned, folks DID go to see it in droves and made it a financial success. On the positive side, the music was great and the story not entirely sucky. Not a good film by any standard but not the complete disaster I was expecting.",The Last Airbender
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Beautiful images and score, but tedious and misconcieved",2,9 December 2010,"Just for the record, and hopefully this should be brief, I love the series Avatar:The Last Airbender. It is beautifully animated, has great music, writing, story lines and characters and is quite deep for an animated series. I wasn't expecting this film to be faithful to the series but at least stick to its spirit. Sadly it didn't do that. The only redeeming qualities for me were the stunning cinematography and scenery and the beautiful music score. Everything else fails. Here banality replaces complexity, consequently the characters are poorly explored and very shallow. The script is absolutely awful with trite dialogue and wooden delivery, the story is juvenile and woefully misconcieved with heavy subplotting and the pacing is so dull it makes the film tedious. And to add further insult to injury, the direction is very bland, there is a complete overload of CGI and the acting is wooden from pretty much all involved. Overall, a big disappointment and best avoided. 2/10 Bethany Cox",The Last Airbender
2,Leofwine_draca,Typically mindless Hollywood effects blockbuster,4,8 March 2017,"THE LAST AIRBENDER is M. Night Shyamalan's much-lamented big-screen version of the popular cartoon TV series about martial arts fighters with the power to control the elements. I saw that this film was heavily criticised before I watched it, but to be honest, I don't think it's that much worse than your normal young adult movie along the lines of THE HUNGER GAMES or DIVERGENT. It's a typical Hollywood production all about the effects and little more, which is pretty normal these days.I don't mind the concept of the film, it's not too bad, but the main plot is really pointless and does little apart from joining the dots from A to B. Some fire lord guys are bad, the rest are good, and the good guys fight the bad. The main kid character has the moves but zero charisma and no acting ability at all, while Dev Patel's would-be villain is completely laughable. Watch for all the scenes where he just stands around with his mouth open like a vacant idiot, a classic example of bad direction.Some of the CGI effects in this film are pretty good, especially those involving the 'bending' (a word that has quite a different context here in the UK, making this an unintentional comedy at times), although others aren't so hot. The action bits are okay but tend to wash over the viewer without really involving them in any way. So it's not the worst film ever, just a very typical one by Hollywood standards. I've learnt not to expect anything else of them these days.",The Last Airbender
3,SnoopyStyle,M. Night Shyamalan's Heaven's Gate?,4,13 September 2013,"There are four kingdoms in the world; Water, Air, Earth, and Fire. The Fire Nation seeks to dominate the world enslaving all the other kingdoms. Water Tribe siblings Katara (Nicola Peltz) and Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) find the mysterious Aang (Noah Ringer), Avatar and last of the Air Nomads. Fire Kingdom Prince Zuko (Dev Patel) takes him prisoner.Is this M. Night Shyamalan's Heaven's Gate? Time will tell. So many problems, let me count the ways. [1]. Too many inexperienced young actors like Noah Ringer. [2]. Dev Patel overacts as laughably bad villain. [3]. The movie needs a single POV from Nicola Peltz. [4]. Generally clunky dialog. [5]. The sets look fake. [6]. Aasif Mandvi is bad as villain. Can't they get somebody better? This is bad. Some parts are salvageable. But it's bad.",The Last Airbender
4,nogodnomasters,Guide for Clueless Parents,5,8 May 2018,"If you are like me, you hate watching a kid's movie and then walk away scratching your head. This movie has that potential.I liked the movie in spite of its short comings. I have not seen the Avatar cartoon, which may be why I over rate this as compared to die-hard cartoon fans. I have been a big fan of the early RPGs until my PS-1 died.The world consists of a number of spirits which create harmony (moon spirit, dragon spirit etc.). Mankind in divided into four nations, each of which controls one of the 4 elements, water and Earth, Wind & Fire. Each element has its own spirit too. Each Nation has people who can control their specific element. The are called ""benders."" There is one person, and only one person in all the world who can control all 4 elements, that is the Avatar. The Avatar spirit always lives and is passed on, or reincarnated in every generation.In this movie, the Avatar originated from the Air Bender nation. However, he didn't want to be an Avatar because of the self sacrifice so he ran away before he could learn all of his skills and powers. He ended up encased in a block of ice in the southern world, only to be ""rescued"" a 100 years later. During that 100 years, the Fire Nation and their machines have taken over the planet. They symbolically represent civilization destroying the planet and ruining the harmony of nature. The Air Bender must learn to master the other 3 elements in order to become a complete Avatar. This is his quest in the movie. Once he does that he can save the planet from the Fire Nation. He is capable of going into a deep trance and talks to the dragon spirit for advice.Now to make this movie slightly more complicated there is friction within the Fire Nation. The king has disowned his son (a Fire Bender played by Dev Patel, who was a good guy and bad actor in ""Slumdog Millionaire"" now is simply bad all around.) The son is tasked to bring the would-be Avatar to the king to prove his worth. At the same time, the evil fire general, (Noah Ringer, who is great on Comedy Central but stinks in Air Bender) is trying to bring back the Avatar also.The acting wasn't solid. The script is filled with holes.",The Last Airbender
5,kosmasp,The other Avatar,5,24 October 2010,"For fans actually the only Avatar there is. I have to admit, I only got aware of this, when some online buzz was created, about Shyamalan having to change the title of the movie, because there was another movie with the title (you might have heard about this other movie ... it has blue people in it .. no not the smurfs, that might come out in 2011 though). But I haven't read any comics (Mangas) or seen the animated series that exists.Which in hindsight, I have to admit, might have been a bad thing. I think it is probably best to know the ""Avatar"" universe (this movie not the Cameron one), before watching this movie. And that goes against what I normally do and say. Not reading any review or anything else before watching the movie. This almost demands you to have some background knowledge.At least that's the feeling I got after watching it. It looks really good, but I didn't know what was happening most of the time. Yes things get revealed slowly, but with an ending like this ... well it will leave quite a few people disappointed (as the reviews and ratings show here too). Hardcore fans will still get their moneys worth I guess, but everyone else shouldn't go in uninformed as I did ...",The Last Airbender
6,jboothmillard,The Last Airbender,3,3 March 2011,"Seeing a trailer I didn't think this was going to be any kind of comeback for director Razzie winning director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense) who hasn't done a good film since Signs, just look at The Village and Lady in the Water, but I had to see why it was a big hit at the anti-Oscars. Basically set in some kind of distant future the world has become divided into four worlds, i.e. four groups of people, each realm has people who possess the four powers based on elements, Air, Earth, Fire and Water. There is a big battle against the four worlds mainly because of the disappearance of the supervisor, known as the Avatar, the only being in the world who possesses all the four element powers. It is siblings Katara (Razzie nominated Nicola Peltz) with the power of Water and Sokka (Razzie winning Jackson Rathbone) the power of Earth that find the missing link, young Aang (Noah Ringer) who is the next in the line of Avatar, he was frozen in ice. It is mainly the Fire people that launch a war, and while this is going on Katara and Sokka take Aang on a journey so that he can master the first of the four elements, Water, i.e. ""Waterbending"". As they try to achieve this goal they must avoid getting near Prince Zuko (Slumdog Millionaire's Dev Patel), the exiled son of Fire Lord Ozai (Cliff Curtis), Commander Zhao (Aasif Mandvi) and of course the Fire Lord himself. Also starring Shaun Toub as Uncle Iroh and Seychelle Gabriel as Princess Yue. The special effects are really good, especially the watery elements, but the acting is silly, even from Patel, the dialogue is ridiculous, the story is preposterous, and even with one or two alright fight sequences, it just isn't an exciting film, it is just a dull fantasy adventure. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay and Worst Eye-Gouging Misuse of 3-D, and it was nominated for Worst Screen Couple / Screen Ensemble for The Entire Cast and Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel. Adequate!",The Last Airbender
7,paul_haakonsen,"Once the CGI effects wear off, you wonder where did the storyline go...",5,15 August 2013,"I have never seen a single episode of the animated series, so I had absolutely no expectation to this movie. However, I will say that when I noticed that the director was M. Night Shyamalan I did have my doubts that this would be interesting.With an impression-free slate and absolutely no knowledge about the lore and history in the series, I will say that ""The Last Airbender"" turned out to be adequate entertainment.The movie was an impressive piece of visual treat, with an overwhelming amount of really nice CGI effects - all elemental (air, earth, fire and water) effects were dazzling to look at.Storywise, well it was predictable to the core. But still, it was entertaining enough to watch. Just don't expect the movie to challenge your intellect in any way. Sure, there were storyline plot holes, but overall, it was good enough.As for the characters in the movie, well again I have no comparison to the animated series, but I think the characters in the movie were nicely detailed, though the movie wasn't heavy on character development and building. This is first and foremost a movie that is depending on the CGI effects.Aside from the dazzling CGI effects, then I was really impressed with the details and the appearances of the sets and surroundings. It was just spectacular and breathtaking. There were so many nice details here, both grand and minute.This 2010 ""The Last Airbender"" movie only covered Book One: Water, so I assume that there are three more movies on the planning board? As in the remaining three elements; fire, earth and air.I am rating ""The Last Airbender"" 5 out of 10, because this is essentially a predictable and hollow movie that is just surviving on the impressive CGI effects - and let's be honest, CGI effects does not make a movie. That, and the fact that this movie was tailored for a young audience - as it was based on a cartoon after all.",The Last Airbender
8,Quinoa1984,Shyamalan continues to do his best to kill fun at the movies,2,5 July 2010,"What is it about M. Night Shyamalan's latest film offering that is so abominable? Well, there's two fronts: there's the front of what's so terrible for people who watched and are fans of the Nickelodeon television series (arguably one of the most exciting and entertaining adventure shows, not just for kids but for anyone, in the past ten years), and then everyone else. M. Night makes his movies to aggravate and befuddle and p***-off people of all ages and races and creeds. Since Signs he's been getting worse, with varying degrees of unintentional hilarity and boredom to be found in his works. But this film, despite all of the bad buzz about it, was something I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt about. He's always had an at least somewhat interesting eye as a director (well, except for Lady in the Water), and with this being his first film not based on a script he wrote originally there was the potential for some artistic success and creativity. Did he succeed? Hell no.The movie takes the skeleton of the plot from the first season well enough, or at least some of the details. Aang (not pronounced how he was on the show for some stupid reason) is the last air bender of the title, found in a block of ice hibernating for 100 years, and is found by two members of the water bending tribe. The Avatar masters all four elements: earth, water, fire and air, and being that he has that last element down, he has to master the other three to become a full-blown Avatar. But, of course (for those who follow this), the fire-nation, who has been controlling the earth basically for a hundred years, has an eye on catching Aang, specifically the banished prince Zukko (Dev Patel). So that's the basic gist of the story, and there are a few obligatory characters carried over from the show (i.e. Uncle Iro). Is there much else? Not really. The humor of the show is gone, and anyone looking for just regular garden-variety comic relief will be disappointed. It doesn't help that the actors are either not good period (Jackson Rathbone), or are directed poorly (Noah, the lead playing Aang) and are lifeless in their roles. Where's the fun in doing these mastering-of- elements? It's one thing that the show had much more character and heart and humor, especially with Aang and Iro and especially Sokka (often laugh out loud, for adults not just kids), and that the movie disappoints on that front. But it's another that Shyamalan doesn't bring anything to the table of his own. His method is to drain anything of character except for what keeps the plot rolling along - and often, it feels as if the plot is cut apart, like the film was longer and was shredded over editing. That Shyamalan probably had final cut just makes this more infuriating.And where's the innovation, or just plain interest, in the action, which is what makes up the bulk of the runtime? How do you put a flying buffalo (Appa) and just use it as window-dressing? The end scene should have people cheering or feel uplifted, but feels stale in a way when it should work. At best, and this is a very faint 'at best', it's competently shot. Please know what I mean by 'competently' as in it's not shot like Battlefield Earth. It takes itself, ultimately, way too seriously to be taken seriously. Every line of dialog... is.. spoken.. like this, or faster sometimes too, and for every one or two moments when a kick or a punch is thrown that isn't too shabby, other twenty moments or so go by that boggle the mind. When Shyamalan starts taking off from Zack Snyder in action sequences, there's a big problem.It may not be as horrible as Lady in the Water (then again, few things short of widespread famine or E-coli could be), but it's not anything of real value. Kids may be impressed, but will they know any better at their age? The adults with them, or the adults going on their own as fans of the show or just fans of the kind of Asian-style mythology (albeit with mostly white-actors), will wonder what the hell has happened to this once promising filmmaker. It's equally dull, far-fetched, visually haphazard, withdrawn, funny from its lack of self-awareness, and filmed like it should be the next coming of cinematic profundity. Andy Warhol could've done a more exciting and invigorating job with the franchise. Three more points to close this out: 1) Don't see it in 3D; if it's not worth seeing in 2D, or even on DVD or TV, why shell the bucks for a film that wasn't even shot in the process to start with? 2) Asiff Mandvi appears as a supporting character. He either needs better material, or has to stick with the Daily Show as their (usually) Muslim correspondent. 3) The hubbub over the racial controversy with the casting is bunk; once you get past the fact that the water benders are white, everyone else is mixed with Asian and Middle Eastern/Indian ethnicities. That no one race or ethnicity can act here or is given anything to do is another matter.",The Last Airbender
9,tavm,The Last Airbender was pretty enjoyable to me though I wasn't completely able to understand the why of certain scenes,5,19 July 2011,"Okay, I just finished watching M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender and while it's not as good as his early (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs) three movies as director, it's not as bad as I feared either. With only Dev Patel from Slumdog Millionaire the only familiar face in the whole film, I had to really concentrate on the dialogue to be able to identify certain characters and what they stand for. I was able to do that to a point but I have to admit to being a little confused by certain scenes. Still, I was not completely bored and it got better as the film went along. The only real disappointment was the way the thing ended as I already knew the movie didn't do well enough for a sequel. Maybe one day I'll watch this again and truly understand even better next time...",The Last Airbender
10,Scarecrow-88,The Last Airbender,5,24 January 2015,"Is this a great film? Of course not. The plot itself is a confusing arrangement of ideas and characters that never materializes. Something to do with tribes who represent the elements: earth, wind, fire, and water. The Fire Tribe, an evil sort who want total control over everything, wage war against the others for supremacy. It will be up to a re-incarnated ""avatar"" (a little boy with an arrow across his bald head in written transcription that lights up along with his eyes when he summons all his powers) with the ability to conform all the elements in one to stop the Fire Tribe and bring peace to the tribes. That is the best I personally could do in describing the film. The film has more than its share of criticisms and critics so I will just say that as far as the presentation goes, I thought it had an epic grandeur to it and special effects sequences (when the avatar uses the elements to awaken to audiences in his presence that he is indeed what they have been waiting and hoping for) pleasing to the eye. The dialogue and acting: well, nothing extraordinary. Everyone seemed bored although Dev Patel was really intense and embittered as the castaway prince whose Fire King father found him unworthy to follow in his footsteps (instead allowing his daughter to follow him in securing the avatar (the only airbender still alive after his monk tribe were obliterated by the Fire Tribe). Nicola Peltz has become a sexpot, earning some eyes in her direction since starring in Bates Motel (as Norman's muse) and the latest Transformers movie. Peltz, however, is insignificant as the avatar's most loyal supporter and always near or right by his side. Jackson Rathbone is worthless as Peltz' brother. He surprisingly factors very little although he is set up to be a ""great warrior in training"". Shaun Toub is probably the best of the cast as Patel's loyal uncle, a voice of reason that often is denied due to Patel's rage. Cliff Curtis (who can be really good with the right part) is handed a nothing part as Fire Lord Ozai, the chief antagonist with little to do but hand down orders and offer a bit of exposition behind what he wants to do (his goal of attaining total power, and he wants the avatar more than anything). Noah Ringer suffers the most as the star with simply no charisma or star power whatsoevera damaging casting choice for a kid starting out in the profession of acting. When a possible fantasy epic franchise hinges on the hero, the casting needs to be a home run. Ringer wasn't even a bunt successfully getting to first base. To place blame on the director alone would be wrong as this simply failed in a number of areas. When the avatar summons up his powers, the film captured my attention. The music was really epic in nature, too. So this wasn't an altogether miserable experience. I wasn't blown away, and I guess that is the pointif it doesn't knock your block off, there could be a problem. I do agree that not casting mostly Asian actors was highly unwise considering the cult fandom will ignite in a fiery flame against you, picking up their torches and pitchforks in heated anger. So no other sequels followed even though the ending prepared us for a second film that would never happen. I am not all that familiar with the show this movie is based on so perhaps that is why I wasn't all up in arms about this as others more ticked off.",The Last Airbender
11,dbborroughs,Somethings just won't work live action,3,25 July 2010,"This adaption of the Nick cartoon series was doomed from the get go. The problem right out of the box is that the terms and such that we buy in the cartoon show sound oh so stupid when said by living breathing people. Allowing for all of the mistakes the film makes the mere fact that dialog sounds silly sinks the film from the first frame. There should have been some attempt to make the film work in the real world instead just adapting the series more or less straight.Its sad since the basic story of a young boy trying to find his place in the world and bring peace is a good one. It has enough to it that it ran for three years and has now spawned a sequel series. The problem is that this condensed straight adaption of the first season falls just doesn't work.I won't get into the poor casting, uneven sets, uneven special effects and not very good action sequence, I'll just leave it all alone and say, if you must see this dropped meal on the kitchen floor (I won't say turkey since this had potential before they took it out of the fridge) wait for cable.",The Last Airbender
12,utgard14,Another Shyamalan Failure,3,8 November 2013,"I came into viewing this movie having not seen the animated series and knowing nothing about it. I avoided The Last Airbender at the time of its release, in part because of the overwhelmingly negative reviews and in part because the rancid taste of Shyamalan's last film, The Happening, was still fresh in my mouth. Perhaps the story in the cartoon is much better. I know it has many fans. Personally, I've never enjoyed anime all that much. But the story here seems like a repetitive ""chosen one"" tale that offers little novelty to someone who's seen these types of stories many times. This time it's told with bland characters and a muddled plot, punctuated by big but poor action sequences.The actors range in ability but none stood out to me as particularly good. Dev Patel shows why his career went nowhere after Slumdog Millionaire. He's limited and here he gives an amateurish performance. Noah Ringer is as weak or strong as your average kid in one of the Spy Kids films. I was perplexed from the start why there were two white kids in an Inuit tribe, let alone that they had such prominent roles. After reading more about the film's controversies I realized this was a sore point for many, as apparently the characters were originally Asian. These two actors are serviceable I suppose but not impressive in any way.The special effects were probably the movie's one strength. However, as I said before, the action scenes were overblown and unexciting. Also, I found myself put off by the exaggerated martial arts arm motions the characters would make as they did their bending powers thing. That sort of thing may play better on a cartoon but here it looks silly and distracting.It's a poor movie. It all feels like a hollow disjointed mess, lifeless and uninspired. It was yet another critical nail in the directorial coffin of a once-promising talent. Avoid at all costs.",The Last Airbender
13,zardoz-13,More Wind Than Fire,1,1 July 2010,"""The Last Airbender"" blows.If the Nickeloedeon animated TV series possessed any excitement or suspense, ""Signs"" director M. Night Shyamalan did his absolute best to eliminate them from this contrived fantasy. Everything here happens in the same galaxy, but it takes place a very long time ago. ""The Last Airbender"" opens with a lengthy written prologue that defies brevity and then Shyamalan jumps to so many points on the globe that it does not matter where the on-screen titles tell you that you are, because you're as lost storywise as you are geographically. Worse, this adaptation of the first year of the series is so solemn that you feel yourself turning into stone. Clearly, Shyamalan took himself and his subject matter seriously. ""The Last Airbender"" is like pre-kung fu type action and the hero is an urchin with a shaved noggin and a tattoo that glows like a merchandise arrow when he performs his brand of wizardry. He has a lot of catching up to do since he doesn't remember everything. Sadly, this sumptuously produced epic with impeccable set designs, CGI effects, photography, and 3-D never generates much in the way of action. Mind you, you see hordes of folks fighting with staffs and some convert fire and water into weapons, but it's nothing but hokum. The worst thing about an origins epic like ""The Last Airbender"" is that everybody has babble exposition or you won't understand what's happening. Once it happens, you won't really care that in did happen.Every formulaic character in the genre leaps out at you with nothing to distinguish themselves. Twelve-year old Aang (Noah Ringer) suffers the same fate as Buck Rogers. He takes off for a flight on his big, furry flying critter and crashes in the ice where he remains frozen for a century before Katara (Nicola Peltz) and Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) stumble upon him. When Aang emerges from his icy confinement, he is concerned because the harmonious balance between the different nations disrupted. The evil Fire people with their gigantic World War I type steel battleships are sweeping like fascists over the globe and dominating everybody in sight without a qualm. The Fire People are the villains and Fire Lord Ozai (Cliff Curtis of ""Blow"") is the equivalent of Dark Vader without a helmet. Matters are complicated because Aang is reminded constantly that he must not kill anybody. The monks have raised him on a code of non-violence. Our tyke-sized hero finds this lifestyle rather disconcerting when he comes home to find the monastery in ruins and everybody that he loved a shattered skeleton. Katara is a water bending. She can freeze you in ice and dispatch currents of water like huge aquatic snakes. Basically, we're talking older adults as the monarchs and masters and juveniles as the heroes. The names sound like different ways to make air with each of your orifices and you'll have a hard time remembering them because so much loquacious exposition occurs between their use. The huge bison that the Avatar rides looks like something left over from ""The Neverending Story."" Speaking of neverending, ""The Airbender"" seems like it goes on forever until its ending that cries sequel. More wind than fire, ""The Last Airbender"" is the last grasp in Shyamalan's spotty career.",The Last Airbender
14,grantss,M Night Shyamalan's downward progression continues,4,21 March 2014,"It appears that M Night Shyamalan has run out of ideas. The Sixth Sense was one of the greatest movies of all time. Since that, however, his movies have had a downward progression in terms of quality. Unbreakable was good, The Village was OK, Signs was mediocre and The Happening was very bad.This is almost as bad. Plot is overly complicated and confusing, and is not entirely coherent. After a point, I simply lost interest. It was probably meant to be a kids movie, but I pity the poor kid who tries to make sense of this movie.CGI is great though.Acting is pretty wooden. Dev Patel will have lost a lot of his acting credibility, garnered mostly through Slumdog Millionaire, thanks to this. Good to see Aasif Mandvi getting a movie role, but if he is looking for a way up from The Daily Show, this isn't it.",The Last Airbender
15,neil-476,Poor but looks good,5,19 August 2010,"First things first. As someone who has seen (without necessarily being enamoured of) all Shyamalan's films except Lady In The Water, The Last Airbender is, far and away, the best looking. There is no doubt that he is able to capture the big visual, deal with exotic locations, control greenscreen and set design, marshall big CGI sequences, and bring the whole lot together visually - the look of this movie is most impressive. It is eye candy with a vengeance.And I'm not going to criticise the story - it is what it is and I guess, like most adaptations, it keeps some aspects and changes or discards others. So there is no mileage in commenting that it looks a bit daft for someone to strike dramatic martial arts poses in order for blobs of water to swoosh around - it's what the film is about, for heaven's sake (and while it may look daft at times there are other times when it looks quite striking).But where it is possible - and justified - to level criticism is at other areas under Shyamalan's control.He wrote this, and there are two things very wrong with the script - one, it is a shambles. It sometimes seems as if the characters (most of whom aren't introduced in a particularly coherent way) will never stop spouting exposition. Some of them serve little purpose in the confusing, over-complicated narrative. The structure and delivery of the narrative is very poor. And, two, this movie is a prime candidate for use of the pun ""Dire-logue"" - the dialogue is perfectly dreadful. There are plenty of examples quoted on the internet - I fancy this film will become a poster child for bad dialogue.Also under Shyamalan's control - although, perhaps not - is the acting. It is not good. Not a single performer emerges from this film with credit.I'm not sure if Shyamalan ever really had it but, if he did, he wasn't using it when he made The Last Airbender.One last thing - if you must see this film, don't bother seeing it in 3D - most of the time you can't even tell it's in 3D.",The Last Airbender
16,anaconda-40658,The Last Airhead.,1,16 July 2015,"The Last Airbender (2010): Dir: M. Night Shyamalan / Cast: Noah Ringer, Nicola Peltz, Jackson Rathbone, Dev Patel, Shaun Toub: The appropriate title would have been The Last Airhead for all the idiocy involved. M. Night Shyamalan once again muddles a story with striking images that never make any sense. We have Noah Ringer as the Avatar who hasn't been seen in centuries and may want to avoid being seen again after this spectacle. He can control wind much like someone does through their ass after passing gas. Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone play moron Eskimos who discover this bald-headed freak show and try to help him. They ride upon what appears to be a flying yak that seems to take orders to the best of household pets. The only positive element is Dev Patel as Prince Zuku who must capture the Airhead and restore respect in his Fire Nation. He was banished and shamed but capturing the Airhead freak show will prove his value and restore his position. Had he been really lucky he could have been banished from the set of this film and then hold his head up with dignity. M. Night Shyamalan started out with four compelling thrillers including The Sixth Sense and Signs but now he seems eager to match those four films with four mishaps. With all of these ideas one would think that Shyamalan could locate a decent screenwriter but that would require an effort. After a mess like Lady in the Water Shyamalan proves that he can go even lower and his audiences is growing fewer with the warped fairy tales. I have had bouts of diarrhea that were more adventurous than this film. Score: 1 ½ / 10",The Last Airbender
17,FlashCallahan,M. Night Shameonyouman.....,1,13 January 2011,"Wow.In the years of movie-going i have endured, every year there is one film that gets damned by the critics and film goers alike (Battlefield Earth, The Avengers), ans i have always found them rather endearing.The dreadful scripts, the hammy acting and the non-existent narrative all make a bad movie....somewhat appealing.So I was sadistically looking forward to this movie. And despite the fact I found the movie the funniest i've seen in a while (the word bender is slang for homosexual where I am from), it's truly a monstrosity of a turkey.Because i've never seen the animated series it's based on, I thought it was because of this, but as an hour felt like a week, it was the dire pacing and story Shyalaman has chucked at the screen.I have never seen a director fall from such spectacular grace, like this man has.Ten years ago, his films were sometihng that would awe-inspire the masses, now, he has made himself a laughing stock.The film makes no sense at all, and we are forced to watch some of the worst acting and badly choreographed fight scenes ever to grace such a high budgeted event movie.The effects are okay, but effects do not make a movie, and going from one set piece to another, watching fire fight ice and wind, isn't entertaining.",The Last Airbender
18,zetes,Not at all bad,7,13 February 2011,"I have kind of a perverse desire to subject myself to awful movies. Last year, I just had to see Transformers 2 to see what everyone was talking about, and, wow, was it a disaster. The kind of disaster where you almost have to pick your jaw up off the floor after it finishes. I've been a fan of M. Night Shyamalan since The Sixth Sense, and, unlike most, I've kind of stuck by him, admitting the major flaws in his films and trying to point out that there was a lot of talent behind them. I skipped The Happening, because I was a little worried after Lady in the Water, which was most definitely a failure, even if it was interesting in concept. So I fully expected to agree with the vast majority who deemed The Last Airbender an epic catastrophe. I was a little afraid it would be unwatchable, an adjective I read many times when the film came out.But it just wasn't.I'm not going to pretend it's a great movie. Like all of his films, it's highly flawed. Most notably, the acting is mediocre at best. I was especially disappointed in Dev Patel, whom I very much liked in Slumdog Millionaire. But I don't think it ruins the movie (after all, the young cast members are mostly newbies and it is difficult to deliver that kind of quasi-mystical dialogue and sound convincing). And, yes, the racial politics are more than a little problematic, although my theory is that Shyamalan made the villains Indians because he wanted to insert himself into this film or the sequels (or perhaps he just wanted to cast Patel and it would be ridiculous to have each tribe be racially diverse, which wouldn't make too much sense in the story; besides, two of the major villains switch sides by the end of the film, so in no way is the film saying brown = bad)).So what did I like? Well, I know it's not huge praise, but I did enjoy that it was a Hollywood action movie that told a coherent story. I watched Prince of Persia afterward and RED this morning, and both of them were very sloppy in comparison. It's not especially complex, but it's not completely cliché-ridden (I'd take it over the name-stealing Avatar any day of the week). It does come off as a little clunky when it's delivering exposition, having been adapted from a very long animated series (which I want to see now - I'm sure it is a lot better, though that shouldn't mean the film is garbage). And the action sequences are well executed as well, also unlike Prince of Persia and RED. The first huge action sequence where Aang drove the Fire tribe out of an Earth Tribe village was particularly well done, with a long take and the camera swirling elegantly around the participants.What I liked most about it is that it looked quite beautiful, and the special effects were used to create a new world, not just to make us ooh and ah (again, looking at you, Avatar).I feel like this one got dismissed more because filmgoers have unfairly maligned Shyamalan and particularly wanted to pile up on this film. Also, as far as its critical reception goes, the retrograded 3D probably did make what is in reality a very stunning visual experience look like crud. It's really not fair that critics, at their free screenings, are forced to watch these movies in 3D, because it really is a bane on the artform. I think it all just came together like a perfect storm of hatred, and the result is that a perfectly decent fantasy film becomes the most reviled movie of the past decade.I'd certainly show up for a sequel, but I doubt they'll make it now.",The Last Airbender
19,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Last Airbender,8,7 August 2010,"Having seen the movie, I'm actually quite disturbed by the numerous comments slamming it, from things like being racist (what gives?) to more spiteful ones that seem to enjoy jumping onto the bandwagon to discredit writer-director-producer M Night Shyamalan. I suppose he's suffering from the weight of the tremendous success his first feature film The Sixth Sense brought him, and everyone expects a continuous Midas touch, but having seen all his films, I am still of the opinion that he's a good storyteller, and have ventured beyond gimmicky reveal surprises to now tackle mass appeal entertainment, and showing that he's equally adapt to work on existing, established characters, versus creating his own thus far.Not having seen the series in its animated form, I'm probably more ready than the purists and fanboys to accept Shyamalan's version (surely you cannot expect too much to be crammed into 107 minutes?), which in this film is but Book 1: Water, dealing with the discovery of Aang (Noah Ringer) who happens to be the last of his kind, an airbender. For those not in the know like I was, the opening scroll provides a quick update on what benders are – folks who possess the ability to manipulate their respective elements of Air, Fire, Water and Earth, while only an Avatar, a chosen one if you will that is constantly reincarnated and rotated amongst the elements, will exist to ensure peace and harmony throughout the lands (almost tribe-like according to the elements as well). But the Avatar had disappeared for a century, so in the meantime the Fire Nation decides that it be best they begin to wage war to rule the world.Which is not surprising, and probably what Shyamalan had wanted to say in his movie continuing from his take on the environment from The Happening. The story's kept extremely simple to follow, so that the target demographics of the fans – the kids – will find it easy to understand the underlying, explicit message that it is important for everyone to take care of Nature, and highlights man's tendency to disrespect Nature and all things sacred. There's an expected loss of morality when governance, in this case the Avatar, is missing, and there will be parties abound to exploit this gap in the meantime for personal power and glory. Good folk have to stand up and be counted against oppression, and quite appropriately, it's the Fire nation to go rogue since fire is an important element to spark off the industrial revolution, from there utilizing technology and militarizing it, as well as the very obvious pollution that goes hand in hand.It's also no wonder that the Avatar, for all his powers, gets to learn a lesson about how he's there to keep the peace and not harbour intentions for revenge, since his own tribe is wiped out (hence his title as the last of his kind). Another important message and reminder to the kids in the audience that with great power means great responsibility (oops, wrong movie), and rightly so we don't see Aang unleashing his powers in bloodthirsty mode. Noah Ringer should be given credit for his charismatic take as the most powerful elemental-bending child in the world who still needs to undergo training and lessons to fulfill his destiny, and while he's not using his powers, he still has that very nifty staff to rely on, which expands into a hang glider. How cool is that?The other hand to hand combat weapon that I thought was top notch was the boomerang- sword, which unfortunately only had a scene in which it was used and caught in the scene in full glory. Industrial Light and Magic continues to show why it's still one of the go-to effects houses with the flawlessly designed and delivered bending effects, and frankly what was seen in the trailer actually provided yet another reason enough to catch this on the big screen, with massive water and ice sheets, force-push abilities and even a glimpse at what the Earth- benders can do when they bandy together against a common adversary.Supporting characters include the Southern Water tribe brother and sister team Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) and Katara (Nicola Peltz) who were responsible in chancing upon Aang, and Prince Zuko (Dev Patel of Slumdog Millionaire fame) and his uncle Iroh (Shaun Toub) being the antagonist here with quite a rich backstory that puts them at odds with the Fire Nation Lord Ozai (Cliff Curtis) which I suspect the subsequent films may see them turn into allies.This was originally intended as the first part of a trilogy, and I hope that the rest get made because there's been too many false starts to the promise of fantasy franchises, from The Golden Compass to The Dark is Rising to name but two in reason years, where the box office returns were less than expected and hence the follow up films got canned. Sure the undeserving ones shouldn't have any more films made, but this film had a certain charm and quality to it, that I want to continue following Aang in his quest to become the Avatar. Highly recommended, if you have been waiting for a contemporary film franchise that's set to thrill, and surely I will be visiting the original source material if I have the time.",The Last Airbender

21,KineticSeoul,For seeing it in a dollar theater on Tuesday for 50 cents it wasn't that bad,6,11 October 2010,"Just go watch the cartoon instead of watching this bogus movie. The cartoon version is way better and has a better plot, since this movie tries to cram a season of a TV show into one movie in less than 2 hrs. In facts some parts of the movie just seems awkward and all over the place, like a lot of the scenes got deleted in order to make the film shorter. The characters are nothing like the cartoon characters from the personality to looks, especially the dude that played Sokka. He was just way too darn serious, while the cartoon version of Sokka was way more lighthearted and cheerful for the most part. The only character that had the personality and look of the cartoon character is Seychelle Gabriel who played Princess Yue. But besides her none of the characters seemed like any of the cartoon character, Dev Patel who doesn't have the look when it comes to the cartoon character at least did a decent job with his character. It just sucks he doesn't look anything like Zuko. The action sequences with all the elements was alright, some parts was kinda cool but the action sequences is also done better in the cartoon version.

22,OllieSuave-007,Lame at its highest.,3,19 March 2014,"Known for his gloomy and dreary-looking movies, director M. Night Shyamalan gives us a film that follows the adventures of Aang, a young successor to a line of Avatars, deity beings. He must stop the Fire Nation from enslaving the Water, Earth and Air nations.In a nutshell, the movie's story is unamusing, acting is terrible, and the entire plot is very juvenile. The large cast of characters appeared very bland in their roles and didn't generate much chemistry or development with redeeming qualities. The action, though, wasn't too bad and I thought it helped with the movie's slow pacing. The special effects weren't bad as well and works Basically, this movie really doesn't spawn one's imagination or has a story that captivates one's mind and sends a strong message. Watch at your own risk.Grade D--",The Last Airbender
23,Hellmant,"Kids, as well as the kid in you (if you let it), should be captivated!",9,14 October 2010,"'THE LAST AIRBENDER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) This movie has a lot of controversy around it, more than any I've seen around a movie in a while, and it's a fricking kid's movie! Some people are so worked up about different issues they have with it that it's really pretty funny. People in general seem pretty split about their opinions on the quality of the movie: the critics hate it because they don't get it, and they fear what they don't understand, and the older die-hard fans, of the immensely popular anime inspired Nickelodeon show it's based on 'AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER' (The film had to drop the word Avatar from the title because of legal issues with James Cameron's film.) hate it because of small changes it made from the source material. The changes are so trivial though; some are complaining that they changed the pronunciation of the names and race of some characters (Some are even calling it racist which is ridiculous; films change the race of characters all the time from their source material, it's only not OK if they change the race to white apparently) None of the changes these 'fans' are crying about affect the quality of the film or story in any way; people like that just make themselves look like giant nerds bitching about their beloved show that they're too old to be obsessed with anyway. The people this film was made for, the young fans, seem to love the movie and I loved it too. I love movies that bring out the kid in me and raise a real genuine nostalgic feeling. That's one of the main reasons I love film.The movie tells the story of a fantasy world where everything is divided into four kingdoms: Air, Water, Earth and Fire and in each kingdom the people have the ability to control that element. Like in any world that man inhabits the people that think they're more powerful than everyone else, fire, want to enslave the rest of the world. The only people that can prevent them from doing this are Avatars, people with the ability to control all four elements, but when they're all killed off by the 'Fire Nation' the land goes into slavery. The only hope of the world lies with the one remaining 'Avatar', a child (played by newcomer Noah Ringer) who went missing a hundred years ago. The movie opens when a sister and brother of the 'Water Nation' (played by Nicola Peltz and 'TWILIGHT's Jackson Rathbone, who are both white unlike the characters in the TV show) find the Avatar still alive in a frozen cube of ice. The problem is that the 'Avatar', named Aang (however you pronounce it) only learned the power to control air before his kingdom was slaughtered. It's up to the brother and sister, Katara and Sokka, to take him to a teacher of each nation in order for him to learn the other abilities before the 'Fire Nation' finds him and takes him captive. Most obsessed with doing this is the jealous 'Fire Nation' Lord's son (played impressively by 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE's Dev Patel) who was exiled from his kingdom.The movie is kind of complicated at times and it's one main flaw is that it's so fast paced it doesn't leave the viewer time to digest information and therefor it's easy to get lost. I think the writer and director (the great M. Night Shyamalan) relied too much on the assumption that most viewers already knew the mythology of the TV series and would therefor be able to keep up. It's also a kid's movie and even though this movie would have been much better at a more fitting epic film length (like at least 2 hours and 20 minutes) that's too long to hold kid's attention so he had to cut it down to an hour and 43 minutes. Because of this it sometimes feels like were missing scenes that would have explained things more thoroughly. It feels like you're watching an edited version of a movie, and I can't wait for the extended Blu-ray cut. Even though I sometimes didn't know what was going on I still loved every second of it! Visually it's amazing; one of the best looking films I've ever seen in the theater. The cinematography is by Academy Award winner Andrew Lesnie (cinematographer of such visually stunning films as 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' trilogy, 'KING KONG' and 'THE LOVELY BONES') so every scene in the movie looks beautifully epic. It's also some of the best 3D I've ever seen and I definitely recommend seeing it that way, even though it was an after thought converting it to 3D. The score music (by the great James Newton Howard) is very sweeping and emotional and the directing by Shyamalan is amazing. Like George Lucas his writing can get a bit corny, and the dialog here is pretty weak, but his directing is breathtaking. He treats everything so serious and 'epic'. That's what I love about the film; it doesn't patronize or talk down to kids, it treats them intelligently and with respect. Some of the acting and dialog, like I said, is a bit cheesy but that's only to make things more relate-able to children. The movie itself is a near masterpiece. It has everything that inspired me to be a filmmaker as a kid. It's completely imaginative and creative and kids, as well as the kid in you (if you let it), should be captivated.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2j_G_qES9Y",The Last Airbender
24,thesar-2,Let's Hope its the Last,2,10 October 2010,"I was thoroughly disappointed in The Last Airbenderbut not just for the low quality it was. It was because I was expecting to laugh out loud throughout, as I do with many M. Night Shyamalan movies. I mean, The Happening was one of the funniest movies I've seen.Okay, there were a few scenes I laughed uncontrollably, such as some of the high-school-esquire choreographed in sync fight dances or whenever Aang (Ringer) opened his puny mouth making little Annie (Jake Lloyd from Star Wars Episode I) seem actually intelligent. But for the most part, I just simply couldn't wait for this experience to be over – and it was, mercifully, only 103 minutes!Perhaps I just wasn't the target audience, and I have yet to see the source material. I would say this was solely intended for the age 2-5 crowd. It's easy enough for them to understand and there was barely an offensive reason to be anything more than 'G.' My guess on why it was 'PG' was the semi-violence, or scenes so incredibly tame, they wouldn't even have been edited out of a Looney Toons short on Saturday mornings.Though it wasn't the worst movie I've seen, nor was it Sleepy-Shyamalan's, it just wasn't any good. The writing was all over the place, the acting was laughable – namely, but not limited to, the main actor, Ringer, who was supposed to carry the picture, the dreadful dialogue was simply painful and the ""fight"" scenes might have worked on the original Street Fighter II game, but not today. This is the Star Wars Episode I of The Lord of the Rings and the Masters of the Universe of The Chronicles of Narnia.My assumption is Shyamalan was trying to fit an entire series of TV episodes in one movie and even if you haven't seen the original shows, you can clearly see he missed large chunks and began ideas that simply went nowhere. Such as, this little tyke Aang had to learn how to bend the other elements but only got as far as element #2 of 4 when previously he already had #1 down pat.So we have these Wonder-Twin siblings, Katara (Peltz) and Sokka (Rathbone) who are out hunting for food when they stumble upon the 1000-year missing Avatar, Aang, trapped in the ice with his faithful giant flying dog straight out of The Neverending Story. He's wanted by The Fire People for reasons that shift constantly throughout the movie.And this is where it gets somewhat funny and eventually tedious: he's captured 4-5 times and always thwarts them to where you have to wonder if each time he's caught, that was the end to one TV episode with the words ""To Be Continued"" even though you know he'll be freed the next week.This back and forth prisoner must learn the bending of the other elements so he can truly be the Avatar, or the only one who can bend all elements and bring harmony to the world of fantasy. But, instead of reaching that goal, they simply end with the obligatory final battle accompanied with a ""heartfelt"" message of ""Why can't we all just get along?""I guess I could recommend this to the under-five crowd for the somewhat ""feel-good"" message – mostly on how to stay away from fire since it burns, and for the semi-good special effects. But for anyone six and above, just skip. Skip it like the movie skips all over globe too many times.",The Last Airbender
25,cherold,Watchable kids' movie,6,21 August 2013,"I have disagreed with the critics on Shyamalan's films so many times (I liked both Lady in the Water and The Happening) that I decided to watch the Last Airbender in spite of its bad reviews. It's not by any means a great movie, and is probably weaker than every film Shyamalan's made except for The Village, but as a simple little kids' action flick it's really not bad at all.This is very much a movie for kids. The story is very simple and straightforward (I fail to comprehend what those people here who said it was hard to follow couldn't follow) and the kid stars were pretty bland and generic. The adults were decent though, and Aasif Mandvi, the Daily Show comedian, was surprisingly good.But in terms of movies not designed for adults, it's not bad at all, and is certainly better than really bad movies aimed at kids like Jack the Giant Slayer (I wouldn't get nearly as annoyed with Shyamalan's critics if it wasn't so easy to point at really terrible movies that are rated far higher on IMDb). This is certainly not one of those movies that is kid friendly yet equally appealing to adults, like most Pixar movies. But at the same time, it's pretty well paced and has some decent effects.The big problem with this film, and it is a notable one, is that it feels like a movie that's building to something and then just runs out of time. Even though it was planned as a series, the first movie had to have a sense of coming to and then resolving an epic moment, but the movie feels like it lopes along at a steady pace, then only gooses up the energy just slightly right at the end. The result is a feeling that nothing really happened at all. Which is why, even though it's not a terrible movie, it's also not one you should spend a lot of time defending.I'm not a fan of the cartoon series upon which this was based. I saw the first episode and thought it look okay but nothing special. So I don't care about what I hear is a lack of fealty to the show. And while I understand the movie is said to lack the racial diversity of the series, and that seems unfortunate, if I didn't know there was a controversy I wouldn't have noticed anything amiss. It is, after all, decidedly multi- racial (in terms of adults, for some reason, but not kids).Should you watch this movie? If you're ten and it's on TV, sure. Otherwise, probably not.",The Last Airbender
26,MLDinTN,did not like the story,2,12 February 2012,"I thought the whole story behind this movie was boring. There was just a bunch of useless fighting, with silly special effects, and it's like who cares. The characters are not memorable. I didn't like any of them. And the movie ends setup for a sequel and according to IMDb, there is no sequel in development yet. That shows how bad this movie was, no one wants another version. Even the flying creature is a rip off from the Never Ending Story. The boy wonder in this mainly can summon up the wind and create gusts of wind. How exciting, but if there is a sequel he will learn to control water, earth and fire.FINAL VERDICT: Just silly.",The Last Airbender

They try to do their best to make this film work. The rest were just, well we need not to mention how bad they were.Overall, this is a bad film with some great moments. M.Night deserves better than what he is getting, but not by much. They should have never even made this film in the first place.

29,A_Different_Drummer,Simple Movies Deserve Simple Reviews...,1,29 September 2015,"To draw attention to the facile manner in which the producer/director chose to re-imagine this tale, here is a ""connect the dots"" review. Like the movie itself, the review is simple to the point of emptiness:1. The original series LAST AIRBENDER was not merely good, it was one of the most original and best written series in the history of TV. Not merely compelling but actually offering a spiritual undertone for the discerning ear. It was not merely for children but for adults as well. Its fame and popularity, its iconic stature, was well earned. (The ""Korra"" sequel, not so much.) 2. Much speculation has been directed to how this film came about? The most popular theory is that a whack of cash was handed to the producer/director at a low point in his career and to this day it remains a matter of conjecture as to how much actually made it to the screen?? 3. Another mystery is why the casting is so bizarre -- with many actors borrowed from Bollywood -- and why the director felt compelled to ""leave his mark"" on this already-abused production by changing the pronunciation of the names of the major characters...? 4. Astonishingly, the IMDb reviews and those of the professional critics completely agree. This film is terrible. The only redeeming factor is that APPA the flying bison steals all his scenes, a claim that no human actor in this film can make.5. In many ways it is an astonishing feat to take such a compelling and heart-warming tale and transmute it into an ""after-school special"" that harks back to the production values of a Dr Who episode in the 1970s.

33,poe426,Flesh and blood anime...,10,20 July 2010,"This isn't the first time (nor will it be the last, I'm sure) that anime has been recast in flesh and blood (see FIST OF THE NORTH STAR, CRYING FREEMAN, etc.). While I can't speak to the fidelity of the movie to its source material (AVATAR happens to be one of the few anime I've never really been interested in seeing, for some reason), I CAN say that the 3-D live-action version is well worth seeing- on the Big Screen, and in 3-D, anyway. (This is the first time since the mid-1980s- when both REVENGE OF THE CREATURE and ROBOT MONSTER were broadcast on television in 3-D- that I've seen 3-D done this well. Some of the shots are just staggering.) Shyamalan has crafted an epic about the schism that keeps all Humans ""equal but separate."" And, for the first time since TETSUO: THE IRON MAN (and TETSUO II: THE BODY HAMMER), we have performers who actually LOOK like manga and anime characters; the ""Kung Fu Kid"" who played the lead is a dead Ringer for the anime character. THE LAST AIRBENDER is also frequently moving in a way that many kids (who may be fans of the Nicktoon) may not realize or appreciate (though, as an adult, I picked up on), especially when discussions revolve around the aforementioned Eternal Schism that may never cease to exist... (A side note: prior to the movie, we were teated to a 3-D preview of an upcoming SUPERMAN cartoon- called MEGAMIND- wherein the names have been changed in an attempt to try to protect the guilty- the plagiarists. It's truly amazing that they're still ripping off copyrighted comic book characters when there are so many Golden Age heroes now in the public domain. One of these days- perhaps- they'll look around and realize that there are characters like Richard Corben's DEN out there just waiting to be discovered.)",The Last Airbender
34,filipemanuelneto,A dull and presumptuous film.,1,23 January 2020,"This film was directed by Night Shyamalan, who has already shown himself capable of going from incredible to incredibly silly in an instant. In this film, inspired by a series of oriental animation, there are four kingdoms that divide the world and hold power over four elements of nature. That is, a kingdom of Water, a kingdom of Earth, a kingdom of Air and an evil and imperialist kingdom of Fire, which decided to control the others. The balance existed thanks to a person called Avatar, who would be able to control all the elements. The Fire kingdom did everything to eliminate the Avatar but somehow it survives and will get the support it needs to face the oppressive military force of the Fire kingdom.I didn't see or know the original series. I can only judge this film for what it is, and I'm honestly not convinced. To begin with, the entire history of the film, strongly influenced by oriental aesthetics, seems to be set exclusively in China or Japan, cultures that tell me nothing at all. This is not a defect, it just excludes me from the target audience of the film. Then, everything is so imaginative, so strange, that it's hard to believe or have any logic for me. And then Shyamalan filled the film with permanent grandeur, as if we were seeing something truly great, and if we are not able to like it, the problem is with us. Too much presumption. We can see this in the excessively vain way in which the actors behave and in the way the dialogues were thought.The cast operates at two speeds. While the adults seem to be able to take the challenge, the younger squad is totally on their own and doing what they think is right. The guidance of a competent director was lacking here. Dev Patel does a decent job, as does Aasif Mandvi.Technically, the film uses massively CGI and green screen for the usual special effects and computer visuals. At no time did they seem realistic enough, but they are one of the most positive points of the film, though. The film has good cinematography and good colors, but the action scenes and martial arts fights are, to say the least, exaggerated to the point of absurdity. The soundtrack is boring and the sound effects were well accomplished, but I am not going to see a movie just for that.In a nutshell, this film is boring, tiring to watch and finds itself incredible, which is downright bad.",The Last Airbender
35,Rectangular_businessman,Another bad live-action adaptation of a good cartoon,1,6 September 2011,"Here we go again: Hollywood makes another lousy movie based on a good animated show, which lacks any single one of the virtues that made the source material so popular in first place.To be honest, I really had big hopes for this movie, mostly because, despite the fact that his movies seem to get worse and worse as time goes by, I still had some bits of faith on M. Night Shyamalan: After all ""The Sixth Sense"" was great, ""Unbreakable"" was interesting. But also, the animated show in which this movie was (loosely) based had a great story, with a pretty good character/plot development, with many virtues to exploit.This was a perfect chance for Shyamalan to show that he didn't lost his touch (And also, that he wasn't one trick pony)Also, unlike most of the directors responsible for lame live actions version of cartoons (Such as Tim Hill or Raja Gosnell) Shyamalan seemed to care about the original story and characters in which this movie was inspired.Maybe for that reason, my disappointment was bigger when I finally saw the big mess this movie is: Not only the movie was completely devoid of all the fun of the original series (While the animated series had plenty of serious and epic scenes, it also had lots of comedy, having a good balance of drama, action and humor) but also fails miserably as a big ""epic"" film, having lots of cheesy scenes and dialogues.Some of them are unintentionally hilarious (Such as the infamous line ""We need to show them that we believe in our beliefs as much as they believe in their beliefs"") but sadly, most of the movie is boring, dull and lame, with uninteresting (and poorly made) action scenes, and equally unimpressive special effects (Being only slightly better than horrible films as ""Dragonball: Evolution"") The performances aren't very good either: Most of them are bland and forgettable, with the main kid characters looking either boring or indifferent to any situation. The Only exception was Dev Patel, which makes an incredibly over the top performance as the Prince Zuko, practically screaming most of his lines.But despite all that, the biggest flaw of this movie is that is unspeakably boring, and despite the absurd stupidity and cheesiness of some the lines and the action scenes, most of this film feels tedious and endless, without any single bit of tension or at least, something that could make the viewers care about the story and the characters.To summarize: M.Night Shyamalan turned ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" into a weird combination between ""Twilight"" and ""Dragonball: Evolution"", managing to make a movie which is even worse than his previous films such as ""The Lady in the Water"" ""The Happening"". And that's saying something.Well, at least the fans will always have good memories about the original show. No matter how bad this movie was, it didn't make me like less ""Avatar:The Last Airbender"", which always will be remembered as one of the best animated shows ever made, while this movie will be quickly forgotten.0/10",The Last Airbender
36,TheMovieDiorama,The Last Airbender bends a variety of elements and your patience until it breaks.,1,30 November 2018,"I'm not one for jumping on the bandwagon, especially for films that are universally detested. I like to think there are redeemable qualities even in the largest piles of rubbish. Howard's score is the only good aspect in this atrocity that has been named ""one of the worst movies ever made"". Holy. Monk. Dancing. Water. Bending. God! How? Just how can one man make something so irrefutably boring? I mean, I can't. I cannot fathom Shyamalan's thinking process on this. Aang is bending my mind. I can't think straight anymore! So, Aang is an Avatar who can bend all four elements to which he protects a water city from the Fire Nation and...oh I don't even know. ""The Not-so-last Exposition Bender"" has so much exposition in every line of dialogue, that it's like someone adapted a textbook. The introductory scene is just expositional text. Katara's constant expositional commentary, only used to summarise entire scenes because no one knows what the heck is going on, is unable to mute itself. The ""acting"" is horrific. The stuff of nightmares. More rigid than earth, less fluid than water. The casting, which coined the term ""Racebending"", was wrong and clearly angered fans. Shyamalan had total control being director, producer and writer (explains everything...) and yet couldn't direct a drop of rain even if he tried. The contemporary ""bending"" dances act as the exciting action set pieces but to be honest, I've seen more bending in a gay drag bar. The visual effects. Oh my, the human CGI on Aang was insulting. Then these Earthbenders spend like 5 minutes punching and kicking the air, just to launch a rock at someone. Just pick up the rock and throw it! Stop with this monotonous dancing and throw it! Sweet Lord help me now, my stress vein is visible. They didn't even end it suitably. Nickelodeon honestly thought they would get a trilogy out of this! Guys, he just condensed a whole series into ninety minutes. ""My instinct was to edit it down"". Do you even know what editing is!? I haven't frickin' talked about the lemur-bat yet! Bye.",The Last Airbender
37,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Suitable for younger audiences who don't know what good writing entails,5,1 July 2010,"There's only one pair of glasses that will make ""The Last Airbender"" a tolerable adventure and it's not the 3-D kind. Based on the Nickelodeon animated TV series, ""Airbender"" is a kids movie, fully equipped with a PG rating and young protagonists asked to shoulder a majority of the workload. Expect just that: a film for young audiences.In a post Lord of the Rings movie world, the expectations of fantasy are higher than ever: epic action, breathtaking landscapes and character-driven stories piloted by professional actors. Armed with the budget of an epic, ""The Last Airbender"" gives the illusion of such a film and will be judged primarily in all the ways that it fails to live up to those standards. But through the lens of a child, this film must appear as an awing big-budget spectacle that delivers itself directly at their eye level. If much-maligned filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan ""did it all for the kids,"" I suspect he succeeded, but for fantasy fans and matured fans of the TV series, the story is a heck of a dud.Shyamalan fails this time as a writer. The script serves only to push the plot and is loaded with almost nothing but background information, running rampant like one of those faulty robotic floor cleaners scurrying about frantically with some false notion of purpose when it hits a corner and keeps backing up and re-treading over the same places, never covering all the desired spots. The oft-repeated concept is that Aang (Noah Ringer) is the last of the Air nation (there's Earth, Water and Fire as well) because they were exterminated by the Fire nation over the course of the last hundred years, during which time he was frozen in ice. The reason for their extermination was because the Fire nation, bent on ruling the planet, knew the next Avatar, or the ever-reincarnating human who is connected to the spirit world, can bend all four elements and exists to preserve peace, would be born an Airbender. That Avatar is Aang. Fire nation is after him (and not to kill him, because he'd be reincarnated so it's pointless) and he's destined to save the world. The script has very little faith in the fact that kids will understand that, which is probably a correct assumption in many ways, but that doesn't mean they wouldn't be able to enjoy it if the script had been geared a bit more toward the 16-and-up crowd.These young actors, Ringer and co-stars Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone as young Water nation friends that accompany Aang's adventure, are asked to deliver almost all of this information-based dialogue, which sometimes even the best actors aren't good at. You can't expect a kid to act without giving them any kind of motivation-driven lines or some kind of an emotion to play out in the scene. Only Dev Patel as the Fire prince Zuko gets that luxury. Exiled by his father and shamed in front of his people, Zuko actually has motivation and it shows in Patel's performance being the only decent one in the film aside from a few moments from the supporting character Princess Yue (Seychelle Gabriel), who impressively finds her character's motivation in a story that doesn't provide it outside of expository dialogue.As for racist accusations in the casting of this film, every race and ethnicity is represented, (Earth people are Far East Asian, Fire are Persian, Indian and Italian, Air is a mixture of ethnicities and so on), but I can certainly understand it being suspect that the main characters (most of whom are Water nation citizens) are Caucasian. Without any frame of reference from the original series and expectations as to what the characters should look like, it did not affect the film experience or manifest itself in any way other than looks alone.The visual effects, which you'd expect to be the saving grace in some way, are not prolific enough to redeem ""Airbender."" The best scenes were already exposed in the trailers. However, the way that different martial arts styles for each element influence the way that element is ""bent"" in the fight sequences is interesting and unique and the way ancient Asian beliefs are incorporated into the fantasy lore certainly prevents any accusations of unoriginal or bad material. The presentation of this viable concept is what ends up being a tangled, frantic mess, particularly for those beyond a certain age who can't simply be awe-stricken into enjoying a movie. As a fantasy epic for children, however, ""Airbender"" will be like nothing they've experienced before because it will feel to them as if meant for older kids but they'll be able to grasp the elaborate concept behind it. Unfortunately, it won't hook their parents or older companions too.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",The Last Airbender
38,FiendishDramaturgy,Magickal,9,6 July 2010,"This movie strikes a chord within me. It speaks to some ancient racial or tribal memory; coaxes it out of the subconscious until it sparks the imagination and ignites the creative juices. This film was rife with magick and possibilities about our earth, our past, and our future as humans. MNS has a reputation for creativity. I'm really happy to see he still has the propensity for high magick about him.Many will misunderstand this film, and others will claim to understand it, just not like it. But for the same reasons that Star Wars, Avatar, and Psycho still inspire us, intrigue us, trigger our creativity, and fuel our imagination, so this does, as well.All in all? If you have even the smallest spark of magick in your veins, you will find enjoyment herein. Let the pretentious numbers prattle on about how bad this is, how lifeless, and how it lacks creativity, but I found it purely Magickal.It rates a 9.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Last Airbender
39,elshikh4,Shyamalan used to have a twist at the end of his movies. Now he has a twist that may lead to the end of his movies !,5,28 May 2012,"This is a live-action film adaptation of the animated series (Avatar: The Last Airbender) written, directed and produced by Mr. supernatural thriller (M. Night Shyamalan). It is not unbearably bad as they must have told you. I know, it was awarded with many Razzies, the fans of the animated series hated it passionately, and sure you fidgeted in your seat while watching. But it's really less bad than disasters produced in the same year. For instance, it has no plot holes unlike (Salt), no botoxed faces unlike (The Expendables), no bland action unlike (Robin Hood), and no big stars with big disappointments unlike (Red)!Don't get me wrong, the movie isn't great either. Actually, it's in a provocative middle, since it has good vs. bad matters.The good is clear. The action sequences are very well done. Playing with water, fire, air, and sand is nicely made by GCI. Not the best, and some times obvious, but nicely made. The imagination of the story captures the attention. And.. and that's it, I'm afraid!The bad is clearer. The story is complicated, and the script just doesn't seem to have any interest in telling it comprehensibly. For instance, I didn't get what's the tragedy of Katara and Sokka mainly. I didn't get why the commander of the fire army hates Zuko's guts, wanting to abase him, then kill him. And I didn't get why the old guard of the older benders betrayed the lead (?!!!). What could be the problem of the title character? He feared of not having a family because of his fate once, so why he wouldn't fear now? That line wasn't served by any way!There is indubitable sense of straying; with much talking about things out of the movie as if this is a part 2 or 3 of a movie which we didn't catch. The ambition was summing up one season of the original show, but unfortunately that led to a pressing feel of ""let's condense a long series of events"". You even have yet new characters to be presented through the third act; including a king, a princess, and a mighty dragon!The idea of adding a narration, by Katara's character, to clarify and explain wasn't vivification inasmuch as another nail in the coffin. It was so apparently redundant; like someone says the lyrics of a song beside the one who sings it. OK, no one needs a subtext to tell already understood meanings. Writing the names of the places on-screen proved to be wearisome and unnecessary as well. The dialogue is shot in awfully dead method. I don't know why (Shyamalan) insisted on freezing the cast and the camera while telling the dialogues!The acting was mostly cold and trashy; (Aasif Mandvi) as Zhao, and (Cliff Curtis) as Fire Lord Ozai were the cast's lowest point; their scenes together were a genuine torture! The only survivors were naturally (Dev Patel) as Zuko and (Nicola Peltz) as Katara; they provided the sole heat and truthfulness that the performance had. (Noah Ringer) as Aang, I think the most young, less experienced, among the cast, while mastering his fight scenes perfectly, was in the middle of the 2 teams; being between ice and fire literally!I read that 2 matters caused huge problems. Firstly, some of the ones who watched the movie in cinemas said that turning it into 3D harmed the image rather than adding any attractiveness. Most probably the 3D thing was a last minute decision done by the producers after seeing the movie to beautify and make up for the downsides. Though the final outcome did miss the intended goals to an extent where the Razzie awards foundation gave it a special award in 2010 for ""worst eye-gouging misuse of 3D""! Secondly, there were massive changes made to the original show in terms of events, races of characters, and pronunciation of names, which pushed the fans to the climax of madness!Furthermore, it had no stars, so neither the fans nor the regular moviegoers found plenty to charm. And whoever went to it waiting for (Shyamalan)'s famous trademark, ""THE END TWIST"", was frustrated. And whoever loved (Shyamalan)'s first hit (The Six Sense), watched his later series of less powerful, less successful movies, then went to this--was even more and more frustrated!(The Last Airbender) is a ride of bore, coldness and action. It's uneven, where what's bad annoys what's good cleverly. Again, I can't say it is bad. Only watchable and amusing, but with some patience and leniency needed from your side. Finally, (Shyamalan) habituated us to have an END TWIST, this round the movie itself was the TWIST in his career; as a Hollywood fantasy / action fare, with kids as heroes a la Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings; the commercial icons of the decades. And I hope it won't be the END of his career which had lately too many flops more than hits.P.S: The movie's original teaser is the most ludicrous teaser ever made in history. I can't stop laughing till now!",The Last Airbender
40,DarkVulcan29,I hope this is the last,3,2 July 2010,"It seems that M. Night Shyamalan has lost his genius creativity that he had with The Sixth Sense(1998), Unbreakable(2000), and Signs(2002), and the last three in which i didn't see, proves M. Night Shyamalan has really lost his genius, and The Last Airbender also proves it.Now where do I begin, I never saw the cartoon, but i'm sure it was not as badly done as this movie was. Noah Ringer who plays Aang, proves he does not have much experience in his acting,cause his performance is so over the top, and annoying. The effects are alright in some parts, others they look incredible hokey. And the fight scenes are a joke. But Dev Patel is the only one of the cast who gives a descent performance, I would have liked a little more if the film was more about him.I liked Percy Jackson more, because it knew its tone and where it was going, but the last Airbender seems confused where to go. It's a reminder that you've seen better sci-fi dramas. I hope M. Night finds his way.",The Last Airbender
41,freemantle_uk,I always knew you would be a great bender,3,11 September 2011,"And its lines like that that makes The Last Airbender unintentionally funny to British audiences: I admit it's juvenile because bender is a schoolboy way to describe someone who is gay but you will take anything you can get with a film like this.Based on a popular animated series, The Last Airbender is the most expensive film made so far by Nickelodeon Movies. This film attempts to put 22 episodes into one film and it ended up annoying fans a lot.The Last Airbender is set in a fantasy where some people are able to control the elements, Earth, Water, Fire and Air. One person at one time is called the Avatar and he is able to control all the elements makes sure there is peace and balance in the world. He is reincarnated every time. But the Avatar has been missing for 100 years and during his time of absence the Fire Nation has risen. In the Southern Water Tribe Katara (Nicola Peltz) and Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) found the Avatar, Aang (Noah Ringer) in a Ice Bubble and free him. On the way the three youngsters team up, knowing Aang is the only person who could stop the Fire Nation and on the way to find the great Waterbender masters start a rebellion. But Aang is also being chased by a exiled prince, Zuko (Dev Patel) who wants to capture him to regain his honour and a sadistic Fire Nation commander, Admiral Zhao (Aasif Mandvi).The Last Airbender was the bigger winner/loser at the Razzies in 2011 and it was deserves despite some stiff company. For some weird reason Paramount allowed M. Night Shyamalan to write, direct and produce this film, despite making two flops in a row and give him a $150 Million budget to play with. Why they did this I do not know, I assume that the producer still thought Shyamalan was the wonderkid who made The Sixth Sense or simply Shyamlan has amazing abilities to talk people into doing anything. I hope studios realise that Shyamlan needs to go back to basics, do lower budget films and make sure he does not have control over production or the script. The dialogue is awful and much of the film is rushed, for the obvious reason that Shyamlan is trying to condense a long show into 90 minutes. Added to that is some of the most wooden acting in a fantasy film: Ringer was only cast because he knew tae-kwon-do, but he could not actor at all, compare him to someone like Chloe Moretz and Saoirse Ronan who are professional child actors and learned how to do action scenes. Shyamlan said he cast Peltz because she gave the best audition by a child actor since Haley Joel Osment: standards must be slipping because she was terrible throughout. She has a pretty face but that is no substitute for acting ability and she had no chemistry whatsoever with any of the characters. Rathbone too has similar problems, a wooden delivery and a lack of a connection with the other characters. Even Patel was struggling and he was coming off the back of a Slumdog Millionaire: he was just trying to be as intense as possible. He has admitted that he thought the script was weak but Shyamlan talked him into taking the role and his only options was comic sidekick in Hollywood films. I'm surprise he could kept a straight face whilst filming. Mandvi was the best performer because his character was a real dick, making snay comments at every opportunity.Shyamalan can not direct an action scene: I have often complain about films using shaky cam and over-cutting, but Shyamalan has the opposite problem, he does not when to cut and going for long shots with no focus at all. If you want to see good steady-cam shots, look at Children of Men or Warrior King. The fight choreography is terrible, Shyamalan claims he always wanted to make a material arts film, but he obviously did not see what makes a good material arts film. Added to that when characters are bending they have to do stupid dance moves; I can understand that a blocking motion would lead to Earth coming up from the ground, but how does a dance act make the elements move? Why not look at something like Magneto from X-Men who moves metal by simple movements. The other problem of the action scenes is most of the time they are too dark to see and makes it hard to follow what's going on.There are some pluses on the technical side of things, James Newton Howard provides an excellent score, the art-direction and costumes are well done and some of the special effects were okay. Also the character of Uncle Iroh (Shaun Toub) is complex because is a good commander, a caring uncle and father-figure, a loyal general but has a scene of honour, I am sure he was sure he was developed more in the cartoon.I have not seen the cartoon, but I am sure it is a deeper, more complex series and what I read I have only heard good things. I did catch the end of an episode once and I thought it had a good, fast flowing animation style. And I can understand fans' fury about changing the characters races, it something that should never be done unless there is a real good artist reason.",The Last Airbender
42,estebangonzalez10,The Last of Shyamalan?,5,3 September 2010,"¨ He will begin to change hearts, and it is in the heart that all wars are won. ¨ This is the first film that M. Night Shyamalan directs an adapted screenplay since his earlier works have all been original screenplays written by him. I am probably one of the few Shyamalan fans left. I was a huge fan of his earlier movies; The Sixth Sense is one of my favorite films, I also loved Unbreakable and Signs. I even enjoyed his much criticized films: The Village, Lady in the Water, and The Happening, but I can't save him this time with his latest movie: The Last Airbender. He adapted the screenplay from the successful Nickelodeon anime series titled Avatar: The Last Airbender. I personally never saw the series, but I know it has a lot of fans and that it consists of three seasons (there are three books: Water, Earth, and Fire). I can only judge this film based on Shyamalan's screenplay since I know very little about the series, but from what I saw from the movie I am guessing it didn't translate very well into the big screen. The main actors were totally miscast, the transitions from scene to scene felt forced, the screenplay was very poorly written, and the characters were one dimensional. Between the bad actors and the poor script the movie failed to entertain, but I didn't hate it as much as most critics did. I don't think it is among the worst movies of the year, although I am not saying it is good either. The Last Airbender is Shyamalan's worst movie and the first that I actually found rotten. I still believe he will rebound from this, my faith isn't lost in him.Katara (Nicola Peltz) and Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) are brothers from the Southern Water tribe. Katara is a water bender and she discovers a giant frozen sphere outside of her village and decides to melt the ice. She accidentally discovers that there was a boy who has been frozen in that sphere. The boy tells Katara that his name is Aang (Noah Ringer) and supposedly an Avatar, the last of the Airbenders. This avatar has been missing for a hundred years and during that time the Fire Nation has been dominating the rest of the nations (Earth, Water, and Air). The Avatar was the only one who maintained the balance in the world since it could bend the four elements, but Aang never got to learn how to bend the rest of the elements since he escaped from his training and was frozen for a century. Now the Fire Nation controls most tribes, they have extinguished the Airbenders and don't allow the water and earth nations to bend their elements. Whoever is discovered to have bending abilities is imprisoned by Lord Ozai (Cliff Curtis) under Commander Zhao (Aasif Mandvi). Lord Ozai's son, Prince Zuko (Dev Patel) was expelled from the Fire Nation because he refused to fight with his father in a duel after challenging a Commander's decision during war. The only way Prince Zuko can regain his honor back is by capturing the Avatar and bringing him back to his father. Zuko is not alone in his quest; he is protected by his uncle Iroh (Shaun Toub). Aang begins to travel with Katara and Sokka setting earth villages free from the Fire nation, beginning rebellions, while heading to the North Water Kingdom where Aang will learn how to master water bending.The main actors, Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone, are really miscast in this film. I don't know if it was their acting or the script, but every scene they were in and every line they had to say felt really forced. The first thirty minutes of the film are really terrible, the scenes where Aang and Katara go free the Earth tribes are really poorly executed, and it isn't until they reach the North Water Kingdom that the movie picks up a little. The best scenes in the film are the ones with Dev Patel and Aasif Mandvi; they have the best dialogue on screen. I really didn't have any trouble with the special effects, although they aren't anything out of this world, just your average effects. The score was decent as well and it is the seventh time that Shyamalan has worked with composer James Newton Howard. I don't know if they will continue to make the next two sequels for The Last Airbender, but if they do they will have to correct a lot of things if they want to keep fans interested (beginning with the acting and the screenplay). This is a bad movie, but not among the worst I've seen either. My love for Shyamalan hasn't died yet and I still think he is a great director although he has lost his touch with his latest work.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",The Last Airbender

It's just all very uninteresting, nothing stands out from it. The CGI is extremely questionable, while the cast members are pretty boring. James Newton Howard's score is solid if unspectacular.Noah Ringer (Aang) and Nicola Peltz (Katara) are perhaps the more noteworthy performers, but none of the characters really offer all that much; not even Dev Patel's Zuko.The actual world involved is intriguing, hence why the TV show is so popular I assume, though this production does a terrible job at bringing it to live-action.",The Last Airbender

Ever since there were ads for this live-action feature film, they had been very excited to watch. Despite all the negative reviews this film had been receiving, there was no way I could convince my kids not to watch. So off we went this afternoon to check it out.I only had a fleeting idea about what the TV series was about. The movie simplifies things a lot. My kids seem to recognize all the major events that were happening, so I guess it was faithful. They did have complaints, like mispronounced names and changed story lines. Or how Prince Zuko and Iroh looked different from how they were on TV. I would not really know, so I cannot comment any further about those gripes.I could comment though that the treatment of the story was really very juvenile, and even amateurish. The TV series looked very different from how darkly it was portrayed on the big screen. The film's wretched acting and dorky dialog were reminiscent of some insipid Disney TV movies. I found the ""bending"" movements to be excessively out of sync with how the element being ""bended"" was acting. I am so glad we did not catch this on 3D.I must say M. Night's career continues to spiral downward with this directorial effort. He had some pretty awesome and highly multi-cultural material on hand with this, with very high potential for a film epic.

But both Prince Zuko, the renounced son of the Fire King intent on reclaiming his position, and Commander Zhao who want to take the vacant position as prince at any cost, hunt them.As I said, it is an epic adventure in a world of magic. The story is rather classic, the quest to learn one's true abilities and responsibilities, but it should also be noted that it is a story for older children. It is not very dark, or complex, but there is some violence. The effects are actually the main attraction in the movie. Apparently Industrial Light and Magic are behind them, and they certainly know what they are doing. Taken together, I enjoyed the movie right up to the end.The end however, is bad. I can understand if many feel cheated, because there is no real end. The movie ends just like a pilot episode of a series. There is no conclusion, the story is cut mid-sentence. You can't do that if you don't have a series or sequel following, and I have heard of neither. As it is, there is no real ending. This is a huge mistake.I'm a big fan of M Night Shyamalan. But as a writer and director of the movie, he could have done a lot better. Even though the movie is actually based on previous material, and your choices are limited, it cannot end like that. This is also nothing like Shyamalan's previous movies, and should not be expected to be since they were made from scratch and this is based upon previous material.I will conclude this review with this.

It is pretty feeble, artificial and boring.On another matter: last month, I used Prince of Persia as an example of how Hollywood doesn't wanna look racist but they sometimes are (although I was not the first to mention this so I won't take credit). Apparently a Caucasian hero is better than a non causasain hero. The Last Airbender (as everyone has pointed out) further illustrates such a Hollywood way of thinking. Frankly, I don't give a darn about an actors skin colour, but rather about his/her acting ability, and nobody in this film has any. In fairness, the lines of dialogue which they are given are so lame that it would be difficult for anyone to deliver them convincingly. It's all Shyamalan's fault.The Last Airbender is the product of a weakling and a hack. It is clumsy and feels overlong in a way that recalls Dune and Battlefield Earth. Like those two, this motion picture also lacks thrills, chills and convincing special effects. This fantasy world looks exactly like what it is: an almost entirely CGI, green screened landscape. Occasionally the film has a few aesthetic touches not to mention some weird wonderful beasts and ships that look like something from Hell's navy. It is surprising that even with so much fire and light reflective icy colours, the movie is frequently murky and dark in appearance.A dozen people left the theatre before the movie was over. About ten minutes in, I was tempted to do the same, which would have made me the first of them, but I fought it out. The Last Airbender is in major need of an energy boost. What little action there is is shot almost entirely in slow motion, resulting is the almost non-existence of adrenaline. Despite the all the sweeping camera movements and wide shots, the film never feels as epic or as grandiose as Shyamalan probably thinks it does.I used to love Nikeodeon, but I never got a taste of Avatar: The Last Airbender. Of course the reason I saw the movie was not so I could get a taste, but rather to find out what exactly has become of M. Night Shyamalan. His career has taken a nosedive since the Village, and now he is doing kiddie movies. The film is mostly intended for a young audience, I cannot see this working for children of any age. It features characters that are impossible to like, a story that is yawn provoking, and visuals that are mystique but won't capture children's imagination.In the end, not only can I not recommend this, but I believe now that Shyamalan has hit rock bottom.",The Last Airbender
49,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,The Last Airbender (2010),1,26 December 2011,"Oh dear! Words can't describe this failure. Shyamalan disappeared up his own arse after Signs and forgot to take his talent with him. Here, he makes the misguided jump to big-budget adaptation world. Taking a much loved cartoon series (which I can't wait to see), this is an obvious watered down attempt at condensing as much as possible. The movie moves far too quickly and stupidly. The film actually begins with backstory scrolling up the screen, over black, whilst being read out. Why do both? Why not have some visuals for us?After this painful set-up some kids that deserve to be smacked about because of their terrible acting discover some frozen guy and he's the chosen one. There's some interesting stuff here, but Shyamalan can't handle it. He has the mind of a hermit. Nothing outside of his own head makes any sense to him. Watch him fumble about with turgid dialogue. It's painful. It doesn't help that the words bending/bend/bender are thrown around so much. I'll certainly be creating a drinking game for this. Nobody gets out of this film unscathed. Awful effects, jarring editing, and some twatfaced hairy floating monster make this a laughable attempt at a franchise. Shyamalan is one of those people that needs to take a decade off and reevaluate his life.",The Last Airbender
50,Rob_Taylor,I actually fell asleep during the movie!,4,12 September 2014,"I remember up to about where the attack on the water people's fortress began and then everything is a blank after that.Which is ironic, because the story I did watch up to that point was so thinly developed and presented that it might as well have been a TV testcard that they showed.I have no knowledge of the animated series that predates this and now, thanks to this turkey, I likely will never be able to steel myself to watch that undoubtedly superior show.I really don't know what to say about M Night Shyamalan. Everything he touches seems to turn into either an awful adaptation, or something worthy that invites endless ridicule. Yet still he finds work, writing and directing.Acting was poor throughout the film and the story was delivered so blandly that you could not care less about it if you tried. Add in flying goat-beaver and what you have seems to be trying to recapture some of the magic of movies like The Neverending Story. In this case, though, neverending is the feeling you get throughout the movie, and not in a good way. The opening forty minutes or so seemed to crawl by so slowly that I felt sure the film had been on for over an hour. Imagine my (unpleasant) surprise when I found out how much more there was to go! Not to worry, though. My ""dull-as-ditchwater"" brain defence mechanism kicked in a short while later and rendered me unconscious, thus saving me from watching the whole thing.I will say, however, that the special effects were generally pretty good and there was some decent production design as well. Acting, story, pace, endless narration and everything else combined to make this an impossible film to sit through.As for the narration... If you constantly need to interrupt a movie in order to explain what is happening it merely means one thing. You have (as a film-maker) done it wrong. Constant narration just tells your audience that you have tried to make a film you are not capable of making, or which is to ambitious to be crammed into two hours. There is also the old adage of ""show, don't tell"" in storytelling which is also valid here.For someone with no background knowledge on this franchise, the thing is just a confused mess. I'm sure those more knowledgeable made sense of it, but I doubt they liked it any better than I did.SUMMARY: An awful mess of bad dialogue, acting and pacing. I doubt anyone involved with this had any idea what they were doing, except for the special effects and production design guys. Avoid it.",The Last Airbender

A century has passed with no hope in sight to change the path of this destruction. Caught between combat and courage, Aang discovers he is the lone Avatar with the power to manipulate all four elements. Aang teams with Katara, a Waterbender, and her brother, Sokka, to restore balance to their war-torn world. Based on the hugely successful Nickelodeon animated TV series, the live-action feature film The Last Airbender is the opening chapter in Aang's struggle to survive. --© ParamountI have never seen so much hate unfairly lashed upon a film that didn't deserve it. I have to say this now: Coming from someone who hasn't seen the cartoon series that the film is based on, TLA is not a bad film...at all. I would even bet my life that people who hated M. Night Shyamalan's last two films (which is quite a lot) would enjoy this film a whole lot more because it's his most commercial film to date. For those who are a fan of the show, let's talk about that later.Let's start off with the things that were bad. Season one of the TV show runs barely under 500 minutes long. The film, on the other hand, runs about 90-95 minutes long without credits, which cuts about 80% from the show. You see the problem already? With such a short running time, especially for an adaptation (which, in my opinion, should be at least two hours), it's only appropriate to expect the dialogue to be filled with exposition. Imagine this: What's the fastest way to present a load of information to an audience in such a short amount of time? Just tell them right up front, of course! It was awkward at first, but I quickly got used to it after the first ten minutes. Sure, while it's a bit ""elementary"" for a screenwriter to ""tell, not show,"" it's not as problematic as people make it out to be. But, then again, it may be just me.Because of the explanatory dialogue, the film's characters are developed as much as what they say. They are not as multi-layered and complex as the characters in a Pixar film. They are just presented in the most simplistic way with the most common emotions. It's clear and to the point that you just have to go along with it (if you're willing to). The film also suffers from inconsistent pacing. The film is a bit fast paced AND slow paced in different parts of the film, which is odd, even for an M. Night film. It was fast paced because the film presented a wealth of information in such a short period of time and when the film finally slows down, it meanders.The characters, on the other hand, I quite enjoyed. This is where the positives come in. Noah Ringer is as good as Daniel Radcliffe in his first Harry Potter film, which isn't saying much but it's good enough for me. His karate moves, however, are very excellent, which makes one wonder he was chosen for that aspect than his acting aspect. I liked Nicola Peltz a lot because she played such a ""bad ass"" character. I just love her angry face because she looked like she was about to rip out someone's heart! Hey, she's a better role model for teen girls out there than Bella Swan. Jackson Rathbone is, uh, interesting. At times, he's decent, but, at others, he's very awkward when delivering some lines. Dev Patel plays your typical ""threatening voice"" villain who I hope will be more fleshed out in the sequels. Shaun Toub seems to be the best of the bunch as Zuko's heartfelt uncle.On a technical level, the film is pretty much perfect. The sets, costume designs, and visual effects are all commendable. I thought it was fascinating to see another mythical world, other than Hogwarts. The action sequences are pretty amazing. Adding on to the fact that most are single shots is pretty fantastic. Say what you want about M. Night but he knows how to orchestrate an action scene. The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is brilliant as always. For those avid soundtrack collectors, try listening to ""Flow Like Water.""Overall, while the film is not as good as the HARRY POTTER and the LORD OF THE RINGS films, it's certainly not as bad as other adaptations, including THE GOLDEN COMPASS, INKHEART, ERAGON, and THE SEEKER. For a director who usually makes slow burning small films, I was impressed with what M. Night did here. I was thoroughly engaged and entertained throughout and found the world of TLA to be captivating. I will admit that the film certainly could have been better but it's really not as bad as people and critics make it out to be. I think fans of the show would find the film more problematic than others because I would imagine many changes were made for the film. Otherwise, go see the film.",The Last Airbender
52,valadas,Overwhelming,7,17 August 2010,"Overwhelming action, powerful images, appalling visual effects. One of the best (if not the best) computer made movies I've ever seen, able to rivet your attention from the beginning to the end. This movie belongs to the history fiction species, a subspecies of sci-fi. The action takes place in a fictitious world (on some other planet?) in a mediaeval-like atmosphere in this case mixed up with awful huge monsters and characters with superpowers. A few complementary ingredients are the references to an oriental Buddhist-like philosophy, the characteristic Buddhist-line monks and the Asian features of some characters and extras. The story is worth what all stories of this kind are worth with the usual war between an empire governed by a dictator and a peaceful benevolent one. It's the old struggle between good and evil. In this case it purports the originality of putting on the two opposite fields the four traditional classic elements of matter: water, air and earth on the good side and fire on the evil one. It's worth to be seen at least for the visual aspects. And the last scene suggests that the saga will continue in some further movie or movies.",The Last Airbender
53,saadgkhan,"besides M.Night Shyamalan direction the major flaw was the lead kid ""Noah Ringer"" as the Avatar the last Airbender, he was not good at all,",5,10 October 2010,"THE LAST AIRBENDER – CATCH IT ( C+ ) The Last Air bender is not as bad as critics has slammed it to be, C'mon give M.Night Shyamalan a Break people. Though I still wished he shouldn't have touched this movie he uses his imagination too much in simple story like this even. I think besides his direction the major flaw was the lead kid ""Noah Ringer"" as the Avatar the last Airbender, he was not good at all, he didn't look like the Avatar, his acting was really poor too. Jackson Rathbone and Nicola Peltz were really good in their parts. Dev Patel did a fine job though I don't get it why the Fire Nation was Indians but strangely Dev Patel paternal uncle was English? Plus Jackson Rathbone and Nicola Peltz were American and his whole villagers were Asians or Japanese and even among Water Benders, some of them were American and some of them were Asians. So it became really confusing, I think it was important that M.Night Shyamalan should have thought about what Authenticates he wants to present as the Fire,Water or Earth benders. Overall I enjoyed the Beginning, then in the middle it got sloppy and then picked up in the quarter and then in the end it again got all over the place & sloppy. Still watch it just for the cool special effects and actions in the first half of the movie the last action fight disappoints big time.",The Last Airbender

55,Troy_Campbell,A decent adventure flick.,6,18 September 2010,"From the 15 Top Critics on Rotten Tomatoes that have critiqued Airbender, Scott Bowles from USA Today stands alone with the only 'fresh' rating from the pack. Out of the 154 T-Meter Critics, 144 of them marked it as 'rotten'. Universally excoriated in a way typically reserved for the likes of Date Movie, Epic Movie, etc, Shyamalan's latest is getting a raw deal. For all its flaws – clunky dialogue, hit-and-miss special effects, Jackson Rathbone – this blockbuster has plenty to cheer about too.Adapted from the cartoon series ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"", the concept of manipulating the various elements is intriguing and ripe with potential. Shyamalan has always littered his pictures with religious subtext and the same applies here, although I found it easy to sweep aside, instead relishing the 'bending' premise as a more childish fantasy rather than cogitating on its deeper meanings. The movie falters whenever dealing with conversation – partially due to the amateurish acting – as though it's just eager to advance to the next action set piece, nevertheless the storyline itself is satisfying enough.Visually stimulating and choreographed with panache, the martial arts employed to control the four natural entities is at times breathtaking. Witnessing Aang – the lithe yet powerful titular hero – despatch of multiple Fire clansmen, with the help of the socially secretive Earthbenders, is the apogee of the fight sequences, but there are many others that stir the adrenaline. The CGI is of unstable quality and the opening scene set in a snowy mountain range had me extremely worried however as the film progresses so do the effects. Whilst the seemingly simplistic background matting is frustratingly poor throughout, the weaponised water and fire is believable and effective. After the bulk of the bad reviews emphasised how atrocious the last-minute 3D was I opted to seek out a plain old 2D version to attend and, along with saving a few bucks, am satisfied I made the right choice.Not great by anyone's standards, Airbender remains a decent adventure flick that doesn't deserve the critical smashing it has received.2.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",The Last Airbender
56,dunmore_ego,"Bender me this, Bender!",4,11 August 2011,"What is a Bender? 1) The petulant anarchist Judd Nelson in THE BREAKFAST CLUB; 2) The alcoholic, kleptomaniac robot in FUTURAMA; 3) a homosexual man; 4) getting stoned on alcohol or drugs for a sustained period of time; 5) an exceptionally bad hockey player; 6) a tumescent penis; 7) a curveball; 8) to crap oneself; 9) a person who can affect the elements at will; 10) the act of vomiting.Night has fallen.During his worst slumps, I have stood up for writer-producer-director M. Night Shyamalan as being a magnificent visual storyteller, an artiste, a visionary, a bender (9). But now he's just a bender (3).It seems in trying to cram THE LAST AIRBENDER with lore from the manga TV series AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER, and in juggling the ubiquitous special effects, it was all too much for Night to handle, resulting in him having a bender (8).Disjointed, badly-acted and - surprisingly - badly directed, AIRBENDER takes place on a world different from the Earth we know, as it follows a brother and sister from Water Nation, Katara (pert Nicola Peltz) and Sokka (vapid Jackson Rathbone) as they aid the last of the ancient airbenders, young Aang (Noah Ringer) in his quest to unite the five warring Nations, named after the five elements of Water, Air, Fire, Earth and Lame Special Effects.Aang can bend the air to his desire, creating tornadoes, walls of force, lethal destruction, and has the potential to bend all other elements; that's the power you inherit from having an arrow tattooed on your head. Or something.For the second time in his career, Night has populated his film with non-actors (as in THE HAPPENING), and I'm wondering exactly when he is going to notice. Noah Ringer is the only passable performer in the movie, and rides around on a big furry thing that escaped from Maurice Sendak's WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE. The interrelationships between Noah and the other humans are so vapid and uninvolving, we don't really care what happens to anyone. It's like Night let someone else direct the interaction between his principals and went off on a bender (4).I feel sorry for Dev Patel, who kickstarted an international career in SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, and is now here, traveling the world through special effects and trying to act his way out of them. He plays ostracized Prince Zuko of Fire Nation. Like a bender (1). With his gang from Rydell High School, the T-Birds, he tries to capture Aang and the heart of Olivia Newton-John.Sokka becomes a sucker for Princess Yue and has a kiddie romance with her like a bender (3, 5, 6).Movie throws us a bender (7) when we realize Prince Zuko's father (ominous Cliff Curtis) has sent out Commander Zhao (THE DAILY SHOW's Aasif Mandvi) to capture Aang in a race against his own son, which Zhao does with the lust of a bender (2).Night actually leaves us with a cliffhanger - it's sad and pathetic and a bender (10) all at once - like he will ever get the funding to make a sequel.Verdict: M. Night Shyamalan's THE LAST AIRBENDER is a bender. Know what I mean?",The Last Airbender

58,TheUnknown837-1,"Yes, sir, Mr. Ebert, let's hope it is",4,13 July 2010,"Poor M. Night Shyamalan. It seems as if he made one movie - just one - that everybody liked. That movie is, of course, his 1999 modern cult classic ""The Sixth Sense"" with Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis. And it seems as if everything Mr. Shyamalan has made since then (""Lady in the Water"", ""The Happening"") has been the subject for harsh criticism, hatred, and ridicule. Such is the case, with more emphasis than ever before, with ""The Last Airbender."" In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, famed movie critic Roger Ebert slyly tacked on for his header ""The Last Airbender. Let's Hope It Is"" and he called it an agonizing experience. Well, for me as an avid moviegoer and amateur critic, it wasn't on the level of being agonizing, but it was very flat, very uninspiring, and a complete waste of time. I only stepped into the theater to settle a dispute. The negative side has won.The movie is based on an animated television series called ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" (they removed the first word so there would be no mistake with James Cameron's movie). In some world, at some time, the people have been divided based on elements. Fire, water, and earth. Within each nation are people who are called ""benders."" They can ""bend"" the elements. In other words, control them and use them as weapons. Anyway, the Fire Kingdom has taken over everything and is hunting the last Airbender, the one who can control all elements. One day, a waterbender (Nicola Peltz) and her brother (Jackson Rathbone) stumble upon a little boy (Noah Ringer) who is the titular character. On a whimsy, they team up with him as he returns to his home, and then on his quest to fight the evil king of the Fire Nation.Yeah, the plot of the TV series and the movie is geared mostly toward children, but this is a premise that, if done rights, adults could find interesting. But the problem is, the movie was simply not done right. It was done flatly, without much inspiration or enthusiasm.The main fault of the movie lies in the core of every movie: the screenplay. Not since ""10,000 BC"" have I heard such incredibly silly dialogue. A favorite moment of mine is where two characters are walking over some frozen ice and then a big blue sphere appears beneath them, casting a blinding ray of light into the sky and one of them says, ""Hey, there's something beneath the ice."" In the theater, by my lonesome, I laughed out loud and said, ""Oh, really? What gave you that impression?"" Another thing I found laughable was how many times that the movie felt it had to remind us of the same thing over and over again. Details about what the avatar must do, we hear them over and over and over and over to the point where we scream at the screen ""Yes! We get it already! Move on with the plot!"" I think the movie should really be titled ""The Last Airbender: The Search for a Plot"" because that's what I felt the characters were really trekking about for.There aren't any real characters in the movie. What we do have are just very primitive imitations of human beings. Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone just team up with the avatar because that's what they are supposed to do. The avatar has a flying creature that looks like a cross between a bison and a squirrel, but this creature has no personality and no purpose other than to float around and transport characters across landscapes. The bad guys are even duller. They just act evil because that's what bad guys are supposed to do. I did not get involved in any way. This was all just too primitive-minded for me to become interested. The movie becomes very dull very fast.Now, I will admit, there *are* some positive things to say about the picture. The movie is not bad-looking and there are some good special effects. The performances, considering the material the cast was given, are quite good. Director Shyamalan was courteous enough to cast new faces and give the younger generation a chance and he cast some good young actors. I didn't care for the outcome of his character, but Noah Ringer was solid in his performance as the tattoo-riddled boy that everybody wants to get ahold of. Jackson Rathbone is good and it is a shame that he didn't have more of a character to flesh out. Most enthralling was a young actress named Nicola Peltz who is a surprisingly effective screen presence. She's able to take the insanely corny dialogue and somehow make it work in individual moments. So I like the cast, especially Ms Peltz's performance, but in a way, even they are not quite a redeeming quality for the movie because as good as they are, the plot and the story just bogs down one second after another to the point where watching it because an exercise in solid boredom.By a stroke of luck, when I went to see the movie a few hours ago, I was completely alone in the theater and thus I was free to let loose my sarcasm and talk back to the screen. I had a good time pretending I was Joel and the 'bots from ""Mystery Science Theatre 3000"", responding to the idiotic dialogue and implausible moments. So on that level, I had a good time. But that's not how we judge movies. And besides, imagine how I would have been had there been other people in the theater and I couldn't lash back with my sarcasm? On and on it goes, leading right up to a poorly organized ending that leaves us with the haunting impression that this *isn't* the 'Last Airbender' and that sometime down the road, we will have the displeasure of being given a sequel. Let's hope they don't.",The Last Airbender
59,suite92,Disappointing action film; terrible adaptation of the animated series.,4,15 February 2014,"On a planet not our planet Earth, political divisions are aligned with the elements: the Fire Nation and what used to be nations aligned to air, water, and earth (the element). At one time, there used to be balance among the elements, but after the disappearance of the avatar about a century previous, that balance was lost. The Fire Nation is in the process of conquering the planet. Nations aligned with the earth element and air element have fallen to the Fire Nation. A Water Nation stronghold still exists in the far north. A few people can work magic with the elements. Only one (the 'avatar') can work magic in all four elements. The cause of the political imbalance was the disappearance of the avatar.Back to the film: at the beginning of the tale, two water nation teenagers, Sokka and Katara, accidentally discover the avatar encased in ice. As fate would have it, extremely disgraced Prince Zuko of the Fire Nation witnesses this. The lines of power in the Fire Nation are broken. Fire Lord Ozai has banished his son; Zuko's only hope of reinstatement is to bring the avatar to his father. Oddly, Ozai prefers that Commander Zhao do that instead. This undermines the success of the Fire Nation.Another plot driver is that there have been no air benders (magicians who used the air element) for decades. The avatar is ready, willing, and able to demonstrate his strong mastery of air bending. The rub is that the avatar ran from his responsibilities (a century before) without having learned to use fire, earth, or water magic.So. The Fire Nation views Aang as a threat, but their efforts to capture him are weakened by internal dissension. Aang needs to learn water, fire, and earth bending in order to bring back balance to the world (which is not our Earth).This film is about finding Aang, then Aang's learning water bending while the Fire Nation tries to stop him. That's it.Future movies might include Aang learning earth bending, Aang learning fire bending, and Aang crushing the Fire Lord. The current film did not address these matters.----Conclusions------Considered as a film in its own right, the picture was disappointing. Considered as a live- action adaptation of the animated series, this was a complete bust. If there are to be sequels, a different auteur should be at the helm, with some serious oversight.One line summary: Disappointing action film; terrible adaptation of the animated series.Two stars of five.------Scores------ Cinematography: 5/10 Mixed. The photography was well done. The SFX was another matter. Some of it was fine, but much of it was lackluster, and some was outright poor.Sound: 7/10 OK, but nothing interesting.Acting: 4/10 Aasif Mandvi, Dev Patel, and Shaun Toub were reasonably good. Many of the other characters were not so good. In particular, the choices for the characters Aang, Katara, and Sokka needed to be much better.Screenplay: 3/10 The first ten minutes were rather good. The rest of the story was not so good. To complete the story arcs of the animated series, there would have to be two, perhaps three, additional films. I do not see this happening. For 150 million, one should expect a better script and SFX that varies between current and good to smashingly excellent. Those things did not happen. So, who would trust the same screenwriter = director = producer?",The Last Airbender
60,petra_ste,"Bad movie, disastrous adaptation",4,28 September 2016,"The original Avatar: The Last Airbender animated series is the rare kind of fantasy fiction ostensibly aimed at kids which can also be enjoyed by adults - like The Hobbit (the book, not the tiresome movie trilogy). The Nickelodeon saga ran for three seasons full of compelling storylines and vivid characters.So, how does a director whose increasingly shaky reputation hinged on thrillers adapt in 90 minutes the entire first season of an adventure/fantasy series?Badly.I have never been a huge fan of M. Night (although I really liked Unbreakable), but usually even his flawed films (say, Signs or The Village) have something interesting about them. This one is worthless though.Writing is leaden and ponderous; the voice-over by Katara (Nicola Peltz), in particular, is one of the most overwritten, insufferable narrations I recall in a major production. In spite of all the yammering, the exposition is so inefficient that the series' rich lore and world-building are mercilessly castrated: the result is a generic, shallow fantasy setting.(To be fair, the first season was challenging to adapt because of its episodic structure; the second and third have more forward momentum).While M. Night has never been a great writer (The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable notwithstanding), he does have visual talent. Unfortunately, he is not a strong ACTION director - a limit he is probably smart enough to realize, since both his superhero movie (Unbreakable) and his alien invasion movie (Signs) featured *one* fight scene each. He could not write around this limit here, since The Last Airbender relies heavily on action. The result is a string of set-pieces ranging from bland to ridiculous.In the series, ""bending"" - a mix between martial arts and magic employed to command elements (water, earth, fire, air) - was visually effective and precise, with each elemental effect corresponding to a quick, clear body movement. This connection is lost in the movie, where characters gesticulate wildly and flail limbs around to produce comically tiny results; it takes six people performing a choreographed dance to make a medium-sized rock float (in the animated series, characters toss boulders around with a flick of the wrist). It's pathetic, the kind of stuff which gives fantasy a bad name.Still, the original sin of this film is how the story is better fit for animation rather than live-action and for a series rather than a movie. I can understand the appeal of adapting, say, a book into a film... but here the story has *already* been told in a visual medium, very well and with more time for subplots and character arcs than you can possibly have in a movie. So... what was the point, again?4/10",The Last Airbender
61,Falconeer,Exquisitely filmed tribute to a great anime..,8,4 September 2010,"Being an avid and devoted fan of the anime series, it was a wonderful treat to see a live-action adaptation of this spiritual adventure tale. Filming on location in the stunning and harsh terrain of Greenland works amazingly well for the coldly beautiful look of the film. Few films have been shot in this country, and it was a brilliant move on the part of the filmmakers to shoot on location instead of some CGI sound-stage. Young, Taekwondo artist and first-time actor Noah Ringer portrays a more serious and solemn 'Aang,' looking similar to the anime character. He doesn't always look comfortable in front of the camera, but he makes Aang a strangely sympathetic character. Similar to the series, but obviously abridged from that TV season, which totals over 8 hours. Director M. Night Shyamalan, known for his dark-themed films, also removes the light tone of the series as well, creating a much darker, brooding vision of an ancient World in peril, terrorized and controlled by the ""Fire Nation."" The Lords of Fire hope to control the world, but the re-emergence of a young 'Airbender,' frozen underground for 100 years, has returned, and it seems that he is the ""Avatar,"" the ancient Buddhist monk child who has been chosen to control all of Earth's elements, and thus save it from destruction. If the story sounds complex, it is, because it is such. A fascinating subplot about a young Prince, banished from his kingdom by his Firelord father, the tyrant Ozai, trying to capture the Avatar to regain his father's love and respect, makes for a compelling fantasy epic. Prince Zuko, played by the talented young actor Dev Patel, makes for a frightening, but somehow sympathetic anti-hero. With his unique look and passionate performance, he is one of the best things about ""The Last Airbender."" Zuko desperately longs for his father's acceptance, despite the fact that the evil Ozai has scarred his face with fire. The cinematography as mentioned, is quite beautiful, as are the exquisite and elaborate costumes. The film contains scenes of Buddhist Monks, showing how they live and explaining a bit about their life philosophy, and about how Aang lived, 100 years before. Ultimitely, like many Chinese 'kung-fu' epics from the 1970's, this film is about honor and bravery, overcoming fear and weakness to accomplish what needs to be done to improve the World around us. Initially Aang runs away from his responsibility of being a leader to his people, but through his experiences with his new found friends, Sokka and Katara, and facing the wrath of the Fire nation, he does things differently, 100 years later. The finest and most spiritual scene comes late in this film, when Aang, reaching his full power, conjures up a great tidal wave. Rather than letting it crash down on his opponents, he amazingly has the wave recede back into the sea; it is his way of showing the extent of his power without killing, which is in line with the Buddhist beliefs. and it works; the fire Nation retreats, and Aang gains the love and respect that he needs, to continue on. Great stuff.The film did not do well in the States, due to it's Eastern symbolism and dark atmosphere. most young children who love the anime series will be bored and confused with the deeper meanings, and most likely terrified by the sinister and sometimes intense tone of this strange film. Older viewers might not be willing or able to be swept along by a story where children are the main characters. This viewer however, enjoyed the ride very much, and my only complaint is that i wish it were longer. I imagine that fans of the old kung fu and fantasy films from long ago might really love this film. I believe the controversy and artistic style of TLA will eventually lead to it becoming a cult favorite. This beautiful work already is with me.",The Last Airbender
62,EijnarAmadeus,Agonizing. (The Last Windbreaker),1,29 November 2010,"M. Night Shyamalan's career may be in the face of downfall after making his third turkey-flop in a row. THE LAST AIRBENDER is so terrible from start to finish that it never achieved to grab my attention, and as Shyamalan tries to walk the narrow line of fantasy-storytelling it all falls to pieces before you really care who this ""airbender"" is. Out of all the terrible things about this movie, it is the acting that takes the grand prize; not one single actor seems remotely interested in what he or she is doing, it is truly remarkable. The special effects are good, and that's the only thing in it that'll get acceptance from me. Without doubt one of the strongest contenders for the worst film of 2010.",The Last Airbender

64,jdkraus,What it loses in acting and plot feebly tries to make up in the technical aspects.,4,5 September 2010,"Ever since his master hit ""Signs"" M. Night Shyamalan has not made an excellent film. ""The Village,"" ""Lady in the Water,"" and ""The Happening"" all had potentials to be great films, but they all fell short at some degree or another. I had faith that Shyamalan would get his creative streak back with ""The Last Airbender"" but like with the previous films I have listed, it adds to the bad streak.Unlike most people, I do not absolutely loathe this film. It has some great concepts to it, such as Andrew Lesnie's amazing cinematography, fairly decent CGI and set design, and James Newton Howard's mesmerizing score (perhaps he'll finely get his Oscar—probably not). Needless to say, the film does well on the technical/filmmaking aspects, but it loses its power in the most important parts, story and acting.I agree with Roger Ebert's remark in that the film seems to wander and has no solid structure. In my opinion, the film tells little yet it tries to squeeze as much as it can in 100 minutes. Imagine if the ""Lord of the Rings"" films were only 100 minutes a movie. They would've been awful. A film that is based on a long story (in this case the first season of Nickelodeon's hit cartoon ""Avatar: The Last Airbender""), it makes the film's story jumbled, hard to follow and overall dissatisfying. I never saw the animated television show, so I can't make any plot comparisons. What bugged me most though was the lack of character development. Characters' motives aren't explained, merely implied on why they do the things they do. This is very significant in Dev Patel's character, Prince Zuko. He starts off bad, and then becomes good, then bad again, and once again good. His character can't make up his mind. This may add some ambivalence to his character but there's no strong motivating force shown that drives these actions. Dev is a great actor, but his character needed more explaining and breathing room—as did all the actors in this film. The only character we seem to understand his Aang (for some reason his name is pronounced ""uhn""). The child actor didn't do a bad job in the role, but it could've been of the same caliber as the kids in ""Slumdog Millionaire"". On a side note, half the actors in this movie tried to put in some effort while the rest were just reading a script.In conclusion, this film could've been something great—perhaps in the same range as ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. What it loses in acting and plot feebly tries to make up in the technical aspects. What seems to keep this film from being a total disaster is James Newton Howard's epic score. If he used this score for another movie, he would perhaps get the recognition he so desperately deserves. On a final side note, Shyamalan needs to get some better ideas for films—for his luck is almost out. 1.5 out of 4",The Last Airbender
65,Christian_Dimartino,Easily the worst movie of the year.,1,18 December 2010,"Director M. Night Shamylan unfortunately returns with the easily Razzie contender, The Last airbender,based on a cartoon series. The Last airbender has no good quality. I hated every second. It's an agonizing experience in which you suffer for an hour and forty minutes until then end in which you find out a terrible truth: There is going to be a sequel.Newcomer Noah Ringer(I hope he doesn't come back) plays Aang. Aang is a bald kid with an arrow on his head who, in this magical world of a name that I don't know the name of, can control all the elements(earth, air, water, and fire). This is a bad thing for some reason. So the fire nation, mainly Prince Zuko(Dev Patel ?) try to track him down, while Aang and his new friends flee.The special effects blow. The acting is atrocious. I mean a little effort would've been nice. I laughed more than I was dazzled. I was bored too. The movie is way too cheesy, and no fun what so ever. What is supposed to be fun is... boring.This movie is incredibly slow. There are some things that aren't explained enough. My main problem with it is the acting. The dialogue. Something. Could something have worked about this movie? Sure, maybe something might have. But nothing does.M Night Shamylan lost his touch after Signs. Since then he's been on an on going losing streak, from The Village, to Lady in the water, to The Happening, and now when he tries not to do scary movies with twists, he makes easily the worst film of his career. I hated this movie. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Once it finishes you find out that the movie is over, but the story isn't. That is the worst thing about this movie. Next to the acting.I was going to say that I was being too harsh on this movie. But I think i'm being too kind. Maybe a zero out of four is a little extreme. But you'd have to suffer through it to understand. From it's terrible acting to it's cheap special effects , boring story, and god awful script, I really hope The Last airbender is the last.F",The Last Airbender

As much as every fan of classic anime like DBZ and Avatar want to see a decent film version of the show, Hollywood keeps f*cking it up for everyone. First came ""Dragonball Evolution"" in its crappyness, now comes this. I'll admit the trailer looked kind of awesome and interesting, and knowing Shyamalan was going to directing it I had extremely high hopes. But then one TV spot came on, and I heard the actor for Aang blandly say ""I will stop them"", in a very monotonous and un-excited voice. From then on I knew it was going to be screwed up. How right I was. First off, the casting was terrible, aside maybe Dev Patel as Zuko. I heard Jesse McCartney was at first supposed to play him. WTF?/!! Idiots, are you serious?! As for the casting of white actors and all that, yeah I do believe it takes away from the film. Expecting the audience to ""suspend disbelief' was ignorant and basically a lazy choice. The acting is over all just so damn drab the characters just end up nothing like the ones in the show. So, with that, I watched the film in a theater where my low expectations were sent even further to sheer hopelessness. I mean it was just painful to watch honestly.Our director tries to save the film with nifty effects and action, but it's all negated by the terrible characterization and the hour and forty minute run-time. A rushed story and incorrectly pronounced names just killed what could've been a great film. Shyamalan, I hope your career dies with this film.",The Last Airbender

Now I went to see the movie in live-action or live action from the cartoon The Last Airbender!Director M. Night Shyamalan's film did not research the drawing right, which was very successful in the 2000s, history is very fast and he forgot a lot of important details of the drawing, he did not know how to conduct the film unfortunately (if he were researched the film would have 2 hours in duration and it would work) but I wanted to adapt it to be less than two hours and that was it! Some actors chosen for their characters I liked, an actor who chose to be Zuko's uncle did not convince me to be just an old man with no stomach and his humor! Where's his mood? It's gone? Unfortunately there was no equal and the Avatar character that he didn't take seriously, Sokka was like that, Katara was a strong, fearless woman and they didn't do that!

69,LazySod,Only if you're bored. Very very bored,4,12 August 2010,"Based on an animation series this film attempts to bring one of the successes of the Nickelodeon firm to the big screen. The series, basically about a young kid that finds his predestined path includes saving the world from destruction isn't too bad in itself - it combines the reality of martial arts with the fictional ability of bending the four elements to ones will and it has a decent story to tell.The film however, is quite bad. It skips through the story and leaves out way too many elements making it fractured. It also manages to fail on the visuals - I haven't seen the 3D version but in the 2D version the effects are mediocre at best, with one single exception, the finale is quite nice. And then there is the acting - far too many actors/actresses stare into the camera or into the distance and simply spoon up their text, making it as good as impossible to be pulled into the film and accept it as a temporary reality.All in all, a film that is best skipped, unless you are insanely bored, expecting the worst and willing to pay up to be proved even your worst expectations can be failed.4 out of 10 failed attempts at bending anything",The Last Airbender
70,Rickting,M Night Shyamalan what happened to you?,1,21 March 2014,"I have never seen the TV show on which this is based on, but it sounds like it deserved a better adaptation than this. The premise is good and the trailers made it look fun: It takes place in a world divided into 4 nations, each with people who can control the elements and the fire nation has taken over. The last of the air nation tries to starts to discover his powers and tries to save the water nation. This is by M Night Shyamalan, who made 3 strong movies at the start of his career before inexplicably descending into dreadful territory. What happened to him? Does anyone really know? However, while that might be the biggest question in movie history, one thing cannot be questioned. This is a horrible movie. And I mean horrible. There is another big question surrounding this; a big one that is up there with 'What is the meaning of life?': What. Were. They. Thinking?! Did Shyamalan really sit down at a typewriter and write this script and actually think it was good? Did someone think anyone would be satisfied with this cinematic abomination, which aside from some good special effects is an unparalleled disaster on pretty much every level?I have long been confused as to why people hate child actors so much. After seeing this, I'm no longer confused. I totally understand why. The actors are all blank, wooden and utterly boring. The script is so painfully awful it could genuinely have been written by a 5 year old. There is no sophistication, no involvement and no personality. Just an endless mixture of CGI, exposition, idiotic characters, action scenes which are literally laughably bad dance routines, whining, horrible writing, detachment, boring set pieces, dragons, bland battles, non existent drama, air karate and (Insert many more things here- this movie is sure to have them), equalling what must be one of the worst blockbusters of all time. M Night Shyamalan, once very skilled with cinematography (have you seen the camera-work on his earlier films?) suddenly forgets what it means to have meaningful direction, and the direction is some of the most basic and bland you'll ever see. He also tries to stuff 20 episodes into 100 minutes, which also doesn't work. If you like the TV show, you'll inevitably be curious to see this but I would recommend staying far away from this film.

It's not for the special effects, but it's generally standard now for movies to have them. Sometimes it's for an actor or actress we're in love with and want to see. Sometimes it's just for the popcorn and a place to go on the weekend. But the biggest reason that people go to the movies is to see a GOOD STORY. M. Night Shyalaman has only told one good story in his film making career-The Sixth Sense and since that time he could tell a good story if one hit him on the head, like a rock thrown by a earth bender. The Avatar cartoon is one of the greatest pieces of storytelling in a while and I knew that this guy was going to mess it up and he did. It was all wrong from beginning to end. He took random pieces of the cartoon and put them together with no concern about their coherence. He picked his cast also with the same lack of concern. He took a story about so many things and condensed it into a child's endless narration and more repetitive non information than I have every witnessed in a film. Shame on you Shyalaman.

Megalomania is characterized by an inflated sense of self-esteem and overestimation by persons of their powers and beliefs"", such is the definition of megalomania.Hence, we're talking about a real disorder that would be treatable, if it were not confirmed or worst, enabled – which is exactly what soulless managers and Hollywood-executives have done with people they hope to milk for all they're worth. That has been the case with an obviously sick comedian like Charlie Sheen and that is what is being done with M. Night Shyamalan, formerly a young, promising director. A director that has given us decent films like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" but had at one stage begun to believe in his own hype, producing literally unwatchable films like ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Happening"" – and now this sham of a movie.You may have noticed that so far this review hasn't talked all that much about ""The Last Airbender"". Well, I have the feeling that I don't have to. You've read the reviews, you've read the critics, you probably have heard about it word-to-mouth – none of these people were lying: ""The Last Airbender"" is truly awful. It even prompted Roger Ebert to give it a negative review – that's how bad it is.The only question that remains is the ""why""-question. What could prompt a company or producer to keep heaping money on a director that will produce a film that will inevitably become an atrocity and flop at the box office? Don't know the answer – unless it involves serious money-laundering and I don't want to make any accusations here.If you want to watch a good martial arts movie, there are plenty of great films produced in Asia, from Thailand to Hong Kong (I personally recommend something with Jet Li or Tony Jaa). If fantasy films strike your fancy, why not watch something along the lines of ""Lord of the Ring"" or ""Harry Potter""? Looking for a good movie for the kids? ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" or some Disney / Pixar movies, there are plenty around.Or perhaps you're more cynical in nature, like to watch trash and big-budget train-wrecks; stuff to make fun of. Then I recommend you any given Uwe Boll product, John Travoltas ""Battlefield Earth"" or alternatively ""The Village"", ""Lady in the Water"", ""The Happening"" or ""The Last Airbender"" – cannot go wrong with any of them.One mandatory point.",The Last Airbender

Also, Aang's friend & teacher/master from the air nation is not black!! There are no black Tibetan monks!!!
The acting is horrendous! Bringing in a twilight actor to play an Eskimo is not what you do!! Nor do you bring in people from India to play the fire nation!! The fire & earth nations are supposed to be Asians!!
The bend of the elements in this movie is laughable! It's SLOW & easily predictable so anyone with the ability to move can get out of the way!!

This is full of some of the worst writing & acting that you can imagine. 3D did not make this better in the least, in fact it was so obvious it was tacked on after-wards it detracts from an already bad film. I didn't love ""The Sixth Sense"" but it was pretty good compared to this absolute rubbish. What happened to the guy who made the excellent ""Signs?"" If there was any film that needed some sort of NAME actor involved this was surely it. The lead actor kid was such a bad actor it was hilarious! I haven't seen any of the cartoons this is based on so I don't have that bias towards this film at all. Unlike most who learned who Dev Patel was by the completely overrated ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" if this was the first thing he had ever done he would never work again. I know the kid can act from his excellent turn in the fantastic BBC show ""Skins,"" so I don't think it's fair to judge him in this turd-fest. The script is so bad & full of cliché's that someone of Tom Hanks of caliber of acting could not save this. This is so terrible & from what I've heard it rips apart the cartoon & everything that people loved about it. The lead actor kid is so obviously not an actor it's painfully obvious & embarrassing. As far as the 3D is concerned, it is god-awful & it is obvious. Usually I would recommend this to die hard's but I think even they will hate it. I didn't hate it, but it was pretty close. Quite possibly the worst movie I've seen this year by a mile.",The Last Airbender
76,kdnor2011,Coming from a hard-core fan of the series,7,16 December 2010,"Before we begin, I would like to point out that The Last Airbender cartoon is my favorite animated TV show of all time. First, I'll say what I loved about the film, and that would be the way it looks. The special effects, costumes, and sets, perfectly match the TV show. However this seems to be the one thing that people, even if they hate the movie, have said the CG and production design is good, if they said the CG looked bad, than, you are clearly blinded by hatred, I think the CG looks just as good as Inception's was. But let's move on to me actually defending this film.The Acting: everyone says that the acting stunk, Noah Ringer is officially the worst child actor ever, and Dev Patel was miscast. Now I do admit that Aang was pretty bland and overall, not that good, but it was Noah's first movie, and believe me, I have seen worse first performances, I've even seen worse non first performances. I thought most of the adults were OK. Nicola Peltz was also pretty bland, but she had her moments. Same with Jackson. And finally, I think that Dev Patel did a great job, he was over the top in some scenes, and dramatic in others, but everyone likes to complain that the original voice actor for Zuko, Dante Basco, and while he was a great voice actor, at the time of filming, he was probably 32-33 years old, Patel was around 18-19 when he filmed the film, 18-19 is closer to 16 than 32-33.The Characters: According to the main consensus, all the characters are completely changed from their original source material. I call wrong. In the show, Aang is either fun or dramatic, in the movie, he's almost completely dramatic, with a few instances of fun, such as when he hid behind Zuko's back. So basically he took one of his character traits, and did that the whole movie. Katara is supposed to be like both a friend, and motherly figure, and she kinda was, such as when she tried to protect the little earth bender from the fire nation. Now the changes to Sokka truly were the worst, I can handle Aang being overly dramatic, but Sokka needs to be fun. And to be honest he had his moments, like when he kicked a fire bender right in the nuts, but I really wanted more comedic relief with him. And I thought Zuko was done the best, don't deny it, Zuko was always overly dramatic, rarely was he ever used as comedic relief. And finally Iroh, and this is the only character change that I couldn't stand, he wasn't funny, he wasn't fat, he wasn't awesome, but there were a few scenes when he did show signs of the real Iroh, such as the scenes at the North Pole.The Name Changes: there were only four of them, GET OVER IT!!! The action: Most say that the action scenes are boring, and not interesting. And while I agree that the action itself wasn't anything special, I do like the way they were shot, lots of slow motion, 360 shots, and in a time when acion need to be shot up close and shaky (Transformers, Hurt Locker, HP7pt. 1), it was a breath of fresh air to actually see the action, and this is from a director who has only made thrillers and romance movies before.The Racebending: This is probably just a personal thing, but I didn't mind this. Why? Because I had no idea that the characters in the TV show were Asian. In the show I was so invested in the characters, that I didn't care what race they were, and if you did care, then you obviously weren't that big a fan of the show in the first place. (Warning, this is a joke, I'm sure that most hardcore fans of the Last Airbender cartoon knew that the characters were Asian.) Bender: This isn't really a problem most have with this movie, but apparently over in Europe, the word Bender means Homosexual male, and people have actually used this as a slam at the movie. Why? So for you people complaining that there were so many changes, you actually now want the word bender taken out of a movie in which people can bend elements. Come to think of it, how does that work, how did the show air over there with the word Bender in the title.And finally, how does this movie work as an adaptation. Overall, I say that most of the important stuff that happened in the first season of the show, with two exceptions, the Kyoshi warriors, and Jet. In fact the Kyoshi warriors were actually filmed, but they had to be cut because the movie needed to be shortened for a cheaper 3D conversion, so blame Paramount, it's there fault. But the basic premise of the first season is the same as the movie. PS. I didn't see this movie in 3D.I know that despite this review, there are still millions of people who despise this movie, and that's fine. But they still have the show. The show is not going to be ruined from watching this movie, if the show did somehow change, than there's something wrong with you. I actually did recently re-watch all of season 2 and 3, and during that whole time, I completely forgot that the movie even existed.I know I'm making the movie sound better than it actually is, and it truly is a flawed movie, but I still like it. Please leave comments if you agree or disagree. I didn't mean to almost completely praise the movie, but it already get's enough hate as it is, I give the movie a 6.5/10.",The Last Airbender

78,scottshak_111,Okay so this can be called Shyamalan's worst,4,3 October 2010,"So this one was another flick by M. Night Shyamalan. I must admit in the beginning I was not that big a fan of Shyamalan's work although there have been several movies by him which I've appreciated a lot like - ""The Sixth Sense"",""The Village"" and ""Unbreakable"". The only thing that I like about him is the way he thinks. As a writer I consider him as one of the unique thinkers of all time. Although he fails to make it big at the box office he still manages to woo the public by his story. This movie however happens to be an adaptation although it certainly fails to create that magic. There were only a few good things about the movie. One of them was special effects. I was surprised to see 'A Shyamalan movie' with nice special effects.I must say only the 'story' looked promising. Eventually they leave you with a hint for a sequel(well looking at this fiasco I doubt that there is going to be any). The pace of the movie was very slow and I yawned quite a lot. I was awakened once in a while by the 'almost promising' air bending and water bending effects and not to forget the dumb Bison which flew on the screen every now and then. The movie reminded me of 'The Secret of Moonacre' only with a tinge of action in it. However the action was not good enough either. Noah Ringer seemed pointless till the end. I doubt if 'he' knew what was going on in the movie. Dev Patel tried his best but hey he is not a superhero after all. If the movie is poor then the chances of someone saving it from sinking at the box office goes to a cipher.One thing I must say is that it could have been made better if a little bit of 'interest' was appended to their drinks coz all of the actors seemed lacking interest in their acts. The action scenes could have been made better. Little stories about the spirits and stuffs like that could have been narrated with interest. Occasional blackouts when moving from one scene to another could have been made more interesting than going to a new one silently. Because people believe in living the movie and not simply staring at it coz they are supposed to. That enthusiasm and zeal was missing from the movie. The Avatar was really getting on my nerves as he failed every now and then in bending the water. It became a little bit interesting though in the end but my zeal soon died when they made us realize that the Avatar is not supposed to harm any soul. So there you go. All that trouble for nothing.It became so pathetic that when eventually I saw the surprise in the end I could only say,""Okkkaaaaaaaay !"". Thats it. The decision ?? I leave it for the readers.",The Last Airbender
79,jamiedarlow-37510,Visually great in places but that's pretty much it,4,16 March 2020,"Shyamalan's live-action feature adaptation of the much loved animated series met much backlash. The story follows Aang (Noah Ringer), the titular Last Airbender, who must learn the methods of all four elements to defeat the Fire Nation and stop them from taking over the Earth Kingdom. The film has had a lot of one star reviews and has featured on many people's worst films lists. Fans of the series in particular were heartbroken over how poorly they handled the source material in transferring it to the big screen. I personally can't comment on this as I've never seen the series and indeed never heard of it before this was released. I think that's probably what makes me more forgiving of it also; it seems to be an honourable effort in which they tried to make something good and I think it's saving grace is that there are certain visually lovely moments when the characters are morphing and shaping the elements around them; particularly with water. Also, Noah Ringer does a decent job of playing the lead role and is a very watchable screen presence. Other than that, it's a bizarrely bland experience considering it's fantastical narrative and I did trail off on many occasions. I don't think it's terrible but it isn't particularly good either and a disappointment considering the directors previous mastery",The Last Airbender

Granted, they were very well-made and was terrific entertainment. The heart and soul of the cartoon came from the joyful characters and rich mysticism of the world of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"". Not here. In writing the screenplay, Shyamalan focused on only the grand mythology of the series that he sucked out everything that made the series great; character development and important plot points perished in the making.To call the actors ""acting"" is a grave understatement. Firstly, the young actors give monotonous performances THROUGHOUT the film, pushing the viewers out of the way instead of making them connect emotionally with the characters. The older actors were barely OK but they did not capture the original essence of the original characters. The original Aang was joyful and funny in the series, what the hell happened to this one?! He's brooding, dark and (worst of all) BORING! Katara and Sokka are also wasted as the actress playing Katara is painfully monotonous and Jackson Rathbone's portrayal of the hilarious Sokka just falls flat. Same can be said for Dev Patel. His performance consists of looking emotional/angry and nothing more. He really needs a better agent after this one. I tried to ignore the casting controversy when I watched the movie, however it is so jarring and sticks out like a sore thumb. EVERYBODY in the movie is miscast.Now onto the plot. It's as if Shyamalan tore out the progressive parts of the entire first season of the cartoon's scripts and stapled them all together in one bunch, resulting in one inconsistent scene for another. In fact, I think the decision to condense an entire TV show's season into a less-than-2-hours film is a major mistake to ANY movie adaptation of a TV show. Take for example, having just met the Avatar, the two kids decide to join him on an adventure after a mere five minutes. Sound logical? That's just the tip of the iceberg. There's many more preposterous plot progressions that are too ridiculous to be posted here.Production wise, it is top notch with extravagant production design, beautiful cinematography and excellent special effects (again, without 3D); plus the music score by James Newton Howard is sweepingly outstanding. The action sequences are also quite good.But, why bother? Why give top Hollywood quality touches to a horrible script? It's like wrapping an extravagant wrapping paper around fecal matter. But it is what it is at heart - a soulless piece of crap that is a testament to what is wrong with Hollywood today - all style, no substance. If this trend continues into the next decade then it's seriously time to call Hollywood quits and leave it for dead until great directors (and even better studio executives) discover a way to redeem it.This is, without a doubt, the worst big movie of 2010. A crushing disappointment and an abomination to movie fans, fans of the original cartoon or anyone else in particular. M. Night Shyamalan, shame on you. You really need a miracle to get yourself out of the steep grave you have dug yourself in.I know this sounds cliché, but I really hope this is the ""Last"" airbender. This is even worse than ""Dragonball: Evolution"". There, I've said it.Overall value: 1/10 (only for the production value)",The Last Airbender
81,barrys82,Far from what I expected,6,14 December 2010,"Based on the hugely successful Nickelodeon animated TV series, The Last Airbender tells the story of a world where human civilization is divided into four nations: Water, Earth, Air and Fire. and the only one who can solve this is a little boy named Aang, the latest reincarnation of the Avatar, the only person in the world able to control all four elements. With the help of two siblings, Katara and Sokka, they go on a journey to defeat the Lord of the Fire Nation. Now Although the movie isn't quite accurate and the timeline is a little weird, The story is a little weak, the plot isn't well developed, the movie barely fulfilled my expectations as a fan of the t.v. series. The movie is a little dark for my taste and the rhythm is way too slow. The cast has its pros and cons. Noah Ringer performing as Aang is quite convincing as well as Nicola Petz as Katara, Dev Patel as Suko is in my opinion a little overacted and Jackson Rathbone as Sokka I feel that he didn't understand his character and he didn't get fully into him. In conclusion, The Last Airbender was a movie that I enjoy just because I'm a fan but it was way far from what I expected also as a fan.",The Last Airbender

83,Meven_Stoffat,Avatarded: The Last TIme M. Night Shyamalan Should Be Allowed Near a Good TV Show,1,3 July 2010,"Verdict: 0/5. I would like a full refund for that $15.75 I wasted seeing it in 3D. Twas a very depressing evening.First off, ENOUGH WITH THE CONVERTED 3D. Or, at least, if you're gonna convert it to 3D, PUT SOME FECKING THOUGHT INTO IT. Look at the CG animated movies, they're clearly converted and yet they are stunning. This movie was NOT 3D. It's just blurry image which requires a pair of tinted glasses to unblur the image, and there's NO depth to the picture. It took 3 minutes to get a headache and every 10 minutes I had to remove the glasses. There was no real depth or anything, it just looked like 2D but with a pair of shades on. Weak.OK that aside. The movie is bad from the start. From the dull and lifeless blast of orchestral music over the logos to the gimmicky flashy red-tinted shots of the four element benders bending the elements, and then to top it all off, the opening expository crawl and its evil twin, Obnoxious Patronizing Narrator join in on ruining any suspense about to come. Joy!!!!! The acting is... well, AWFUL. Dev Patel's performance consisted of basically SHOUTING and over-emphasizing every word, reminding me of John Travolta in Battlefield Earth. His British accent kept slipping too, and his facial expressions looked like he was reacting to someone holding a catbox under his nose. The two leads were laughably bad. I kept laughing at their wooden acting, in fact their acting was so wooden that I was expecting someone to carve a rocking chair out of them. Aang looked and sounded like he was reading the lines off of a teleprompter.The sets, aside from the gorgeous Water region, were all grungy and depressing to look at. Not that every movie has to look like Pandora from JC's Avatar, but honestly, with the big budget and all you'd think they'd have put some thought into it.The dialogue is the perfect example of how NOT to write dialogue. My favorite lines: ""Is there a spiritual place where I can meditate?"" ""There is a very spiritual place. The city was built around it, ya know."" ""I'm scared. Please don't make me more scared."" (I'm not kidding, I burst out laughing at that line) ""Let's spar! I don't think we've sparred in quite a while."" ""My father WILL take me back someday and you will bow down to me."" And pretty much every line mentioning ""Pretty girls"". Seriously, does Night actually think people talk like that?!?!?!?!?!!! The plot I won't waste much time on because there's so many holes and misconceptions. I haven't seen much of the original show so I can't say much about what they got right, but come on, it's full of holes. For example, Aang is THE LAST AIRBENDER, as the title suggests. I mean come on, while the water benders can only go so much as to attack people and they've been doing it for years, he's SOOOOOO SPECIAL that he can basically create a tsunami as does at the end. I gotta say I laughed pretty hard at that.The action scenes were pale copies of copies of copies of copies, and were very badly done. I swear the ""Burly brawl"" was a carbon copy of the prison fight scene in Watchmen! Even the music sounded similar!!! The scene near the end with all the zoom in/slow mo of Aang owning people made me laugh so hard I fell out of my chair. Way to rip off Zack Snyder, and it's also no coincidence that the Legend of the Guardians trailer showed too.In short, this movie was awful and quite possibly the worst I've seen this year, and I HAVE seen Robin Hood. That said the script for RH read like it was written by a monkey going crazy with a word fridge magnet set. But boy this was worse.",The Last Airbender

85,Ryan_MYeah,"Despite gorgeous special effects, and lovely music, M. Night Shyamalan only provides further embarrassment to his own career.",3,19 July 2010,"Today I thought I'd check out past his prime writer/director M. Night Shyamalan's recent Summer flick, The Last Airbender, based on the first season/book of the popular animated TV series that originally aired on Nickelodeon. Sad to say, the movie doesn't do it much justice. While it's certainly nowhere near as bad as Shyamalan's previous dud, The Happening, it's hardly an enjoyable movie.The film takes place in a world where people can control the elements of Water, Earth, Wind, and Fire. The film starts with two members of the Water tribe, a waterbender, Katara (Played by Nicola Peltz), and her brother, Sokka (Played by Jackson Rathbone). They come across the last of his kind, an Airbender named Aang (Played by Noah Ringer). They find out that he is the Avatar, the only person who can control all four elements. He must learn the elements of Water, Earth, and Fire, so he may defeat the Fire Nation, who have taken over much of the other nations. Aang and his friends however, are constantly pursued by the disgraced Prince of the Fire nation, Zuko (Played by Dev Patel), and his uncle Iroh (Played by Shaun Toub), so that Zuko may capture the Avatar, bring him to his father, the Fire Lord, and reclaim his place on the throne. But Zuko faces competition, as Aang is also pursued by the ruthless Commander of the Fire Nation army, Zhao (Played by Aasif Mandvi).I want to give kudos to Dev Patel and Shaun Toub for giving the best performances in the movie. They were good, but it's also partly because they were the only two who fully got their characters. It's bad enough when that happens, what's even worse is when we want our villains to succeed more than our actual hero. Noah Ringer was all kinds of bad as Aang. Nicola Peltz, and Jackson Rathbone are inconsistent in their portrayals of Katara, and Sokka. Now, there was some controversy over supposed racist casting, because Americans were cast in roles that were originally Asian in the TV show.But even a different cast wouldn't have changed anything. No actor could have pulled off Shyamalan's dialogue, which is next to nothing but exposition, and often laughable. Some of the things in the movie are as well. I could not help but laugh at how over the top some things were (Insert a heckle of that slow moving boulder joke scene). Not only that, but the movie simply takes itself WAY too seriously. All the characters have been purged of all the optimism, humor, romance, adventure, and mild sarcasm we've come to associate with them. Another problem the film suffers from is pacing issues, not because it's too slow, it's too rushed, and never gives the characters, or story arcs all the attention they deserve, and often uses action sequences that are just painful to watch, it's cringe-worthy.Even a talented tech crew aren't much help. DP legend Andrew Lesnie brings inspired light from his trademark digital photography, James Newton Howard provides one of the best scores of his career, Industrial Light & Magic provide excellent visuals, and the film is smartly designed through the sets of Philip Messina, costumes of Judianna Makovsky, and Makeup by Ivana Primorac, but at the end of the day it only makes this poor piece of film making a ""pretty"" poor piece of film making.It's discouraging to say the least, and utterly disappointing. What's more disappointing is how great the first book was, so they had the potential to make a great movie, but soiled it badly.The visual crew must be commended, but everyone else shouldn't.I give it *1/2 out of ****",The Last Airbender
86,Quebec_Dragon,Something must be wrong with me...,7,6 February 2012,"I actually liked this. Granted, I never saw the animated series, I didn't see the apparently atrocious 3d version and I like Shimalayan's movies, even his latest ones (except The Happening). I wonder how much the negative press on this influenced me, because honestly the movie wasn't that bad. I liked the mystical eastern underpinnings (buddhism, reincarnation, Tai Chi, martial arts, etc.) and thought it gave us a rather rich, unconventional fantasy world even with the somewhat cliché nations, each named on a different element. Visually, the settings looked nice, almost epic sometimes. The criticized blurriness was for me only visible with close-ups when you saw half of the Avatar's face. It was too obvious not to be intentional. Other than that, the directing, especially in the talking scenes, was very conventional. The action scenes fared better. I thought that using Tai Chi like moves to manipulate elements was not only novel but graceful. The magical usage of the four elements looked cool to me, even original sometimes. The story has been criticized for being convoluted. I had no trouble following at all. Granded, the narration was awkward sometimes, and the movie would have benefited from a longer running time, particularly for characterization.The acting here has been panned pretty badly. Other than the stilted, awkward, bad Jackson Rathbone playing Sokku, I thought the others were not horrible. Sometimes lacking, yes, but not terrible. The boy playing the title character, who I initially thought annoying, even grew on me, and I liked him by the end. Why? Because he showed a nice range of emotions, and he really sold the graceful action moves. Regarding Patel's performance as the Fire nation prince, I did find his character and story arc fascinating. He was intense and tormented, perhaps a bit too much with a few vocal outbursts, but I think the fault here might lie with actor's direction. I thought the story tried to show some heart and sometimes succeeded. I thought the whole last act, starting with the drama at the fish pond was pretty exciting, despite Rathbone's lacking performance. They didn't cop out and by that point, I couldn't totally predict what was gonna happen. Of course, I'm sure a particular tragic sequence paled in comparison to the cartoon, but I never saw it, so couldn't be properly offended. And one could not honestly say that the Avatar's last push towards the wall with his new magical skills wasn't amazing. I also found the music very good, stirring even. Despite all the bad reviews, I admit I enjoyed watching The Last Airbender way more than I thought I would. I think kids not too stuck up on fidelity to the animated series would love it, as would a certain type of open-minded adult who likes fantasy movies. To be just, I'd probably be angry if I thought they had botched up important aspects in the movie adaptation of a beloved story, too. It's worth a rental to make up your own mind. This review comes from a somewhat critical but fair guy in his late thirties who has watched tons of sci-fi/fantasy/horror movies. I actually would like seeing a sequel, and that's saying something.Rating: 6.5 out of 10 (Good)",The Last Airbender
87,dallasryan,First and The Last,2,21 June 2012,"This movie lived up to the hype and it did not disappoint, it very much lived up to how bad everyone said it was and then some. In some way there's some accidental genius in making a movie this bad. The one element that truly makes a movie one of the worst movies of all time is the fact that the director and producer(in this movie's case, the same person) were trying to make a great film, a really great film. It's that way with Howard the Duck(even though I don't care what they say, I love that movie!), it's that case with Showgirls, even Ed Wood's Planet 9 from Outerspace(which is freaking hilarious). That's the formula that truly makes a movie the worst of the worst, that they were all trying to make a great film! And what I mean by some accidental genius, I mean simply that to make a really great film, all kinds of elements have to come into play, I can't even begin to name them, there's so many, but let's just say the stars have to be aligned for it to all come together in being a truly, truly great film. That same concept goes for a truly awful film such as The Last Airbender. Everything has to just come together to make it God awful. With most movies, some parts of the movie will be bad, and then other parts will be good, but with The Last Airbender and Showgirls, that's just not the case. They are bad from beginning to end. At least with Showgirls, you get a good laugh throughout the movie, it's pretty funny, but with The Last Airbender, it's just more annoying than anything. Jackson Rathbone was playing his part as if he thought he was going to win an academy award, I thought at one point in the film that you would find out that Rathbone's character was a robot because there's nothing really human about him, he's a 100% silicone in his performance, and that goes for that Nicola girl too. And I'm surprised Noah didn't get nominated for a razzie award as well, perhaps there can only be so many razzie award nominations per movie, and I guess The Last Airbender hit it's Razzie Award Nomination cap. I guess sense of humors and three dimensional characters aka real people aka human beings are a thing of the past according to the characters in The Last Airbender. The Last Airbender is definitely a movie to make a funny spoof movie on, actually you could make about 4 spoof movies off this ridiculous film. M. Night Shyamalan is way out of his league with this movie. This movie is proof that you don't try to do a remake off of an animation, especially an animation where the whole reason it's an animation in the first place is to do things you can't do in a live action movie nor should you do. It looked like Shyamalan was trying to go for perfection with this one, and he was probably going to crank out another 2 or 3 movies on this one, going for the Star Wars or Lord of the Rings Trilogy he was, but Shyamalan got a little ahead of himself and I can only imagine he ran to the bathroom puking his Sixth Sense out in the toilet once he saw the end of this one at their Big Movie Premiere Opening. If you want to see if this movie lives up to its hype, I can assure you that you will not be disappointed by how bad it is. It will surpass your expectations. You cannot make a movie this bad on purpose.",The Last Airbender
88,chubarova,Something strange.,5,30 May 2020,"This film could be great adaptation of iconic animation series. In fact, it is something strange. Firstly, the plot is hardly for understanding, of you didn't wathc the original series. Acts, that happen for number of series, happen at 10-15 minutes in the film. Viewer doesn't have any explanation of rules and history of the world. Secondly, the cast is very pale, characters haven't got any individual characteristics. Thirdly, the visual effects look very strange, authors have big budget but CGI looks unrealistic.
So, it looks like parody of original animation.",The Last Airbender
89,Jerique,M. Night Shyamalan's worst work?,2,8 July 2010,"It's entertaining. I'll give it that. But I'm supposed to base this review on this single film alone when clearly it's the first part of what looks like three.I could careless that there was no famous actor in it. It makes the story and special effects work for themselves. It's still very noticeable that no Nicholas Cage, Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis or top name actor is absent.The story follows Aang, ""The Last Airbender"" (the only living person who can bend or control air) but unfortunately for his people, and I suppose fortunately for the audiences (?), he must learn the other three elements (fire, earth and water). This film centers on him learning and struggling with the single element of water, while his enemies use fire.It sounds good on paper. It sounds interesting enough and the trailers really work to reel you in for a viewing. But honestly, skip it and look for a bigger draw. This movie is a flashback galore and it relies solely on it's tame special effects that have already been done before.I believe M. Night Shyamalan has lost his touch since Lady In the Water. Much like that film, the movie drags on and Aang struggles to control the element of water until a few minutes before the end credits. You sit there for ninety minutes watching basically nothing.I am not excited about a possible sequel because the first film wasn't even exciting to begin with. I felt the need to walk out numerous times. But I wanted to stay till the end in order to fully make my review valid.Trailers give you false hope that this movie will be mind blowing. It's not anything special or unique. It's a waste of time and money. Skip it and see something better.",The Last Airbender

Alas I would be embarrassed to say that anything local was used in a movie this god awful. Let us look at the script: uninspiring--with dialog that is even below cartoonish. The story is chock full of holes and moves at a snail's pace. Acting: I am not sure that you can say that there is acting in this movie. The kid who played Anakin Skywalker in The Phantom Menace looked like a Shakespearian actor compared to ever single performance in this movie. The kids were all awful and should not pursue another film venture after this movie---they are not actors. This movie is awful on every level, every scene, every word, every shot--there is nothing redeemable about this film and it is a total waste of time and effort. I am so surprised that M.

The acting is weak and lacking, the direction is flimsy, and the dialouge is absolutely terrible. The Nickelodeon T.V show has been ruined here. I think even kids will be able to tell how bad this filmmaking and acting is. Even Dev Patel of Slumdog Millionaire is flat here. M. Night Shyamalan has now made four stinkers in a row starting from The Village, along with The Happening and Lady in the water. You have to wonder if Shyamalan is still a worthy director or not.

92,kevinxirau,Good try but could use improvements.,5,9 February 2012,"Avatar The Last Airbender is without a doubt one of the greatest animated action-adventure series of all time. It has memorable characters, remarkable creatures, an original story, fantastic music, awesome action scenes, inventive comedy, and...well...you get the idea. So naturally I was excited that a live-action movie adaptation was in the works and the trailers only furthered that excitement. Has this movie lived up to that hype? Well, not entirely.I mean this movie isn't really bad because it has some good qualities to it. The action scenes and the special effects are certainly a spectacle to watch and the design of the entire avatar world is quite creative. The creature designs like Appa are great and well detailed. So yeah, there are some things to like about this flick.I admit that there are some things to complain here. One major complaint the world offered is the ethnicity of the four nations, specifically the Water tribe and the Fire Nation. In the show, the Water Tribe had brownish skin like Eskimos and the Fire Nation were basically white but here in the movie it's the other way around. Also, some of the characters like Sokka (he's not at all funny and he's pretty bland) were not portrayed accurately or that the acting wasn't really good enough. Exceptions include Iroh and his nephew Zuko who did just fine. Some characters, I've felt, did not do enough and you'd see who I'm talking about.I actually expected this movie to be at least two or three hours long but it isn't, therefore a lot of things were not explored or explained enough, such as the spirit world. I felt that they were being lazy on the detail of the spirit world because in the show it's such a vast and unworldly place full of strange creatures, but here they never bothered to do that. Certain dialog also felt out of place and seems random at times. They could have brought more focus on to many things, but for reasons beyond my understanding they were left alone. So many things left unchecked.In conclusion, this is pretty good but it still has a lot to live up to. Hopefully, improvements will be made in the upcoming sequel. Wanna see it?

93,torstensonjohn,The different M. Night Shyamalan,5,9 August 2018,"M. Night Shyamalan is well known for making films of the supernatural style and having unique twists in the plot. Films such as The Sixth Sense, The Village, Unbreakable and Signs where he draws upon the characters to drive his films. The plot of having those humans that can bend or draw upon Air, Water, Earth, Fire elements is unique and fantasy driven. I thought the fact of the Last Airbender had a traditional storyline of folklore and unique sense of good over evil. The CGI effects were very well placed in the film and the acting was NOT terrible. What strikes the audience is it is a completely different film for Shyamalan and many have found this off putting. I felt the mythology of the film found it's place with location, utilization of fighting sequences and storytelling. I liked the movie, it was unique, fun, an adventure/fantasy film for all ages.

94,RichardSRussell-1,Consistently Declining Shyamalan Continues To Squander a Once-Great Reputation,3,1 July 2010,"The Last Airbender (1:43, PG, 3-D) — Fantasy: Sword & Sorcery; biggie; crossoverMrs. Rathbone must be so proud: Her little boy Jackson has featured roles in 2 blockbusters opening on consecutive days this July 4 weekend. Here he's Sokka, eldest surviving male of the Southern Water Tribe, reduced to living a miserable marginal existence on the edge of Antarctica by the Fire Nation, which is evidently bent on world domination.In the opening scene, Sokka and his younger sister Katara (Nicola Peltz) inadvertently summon a huge glowing crystalline globe from beneath the icecap. Asleep within it is a young boy with strange tattoos on his bald scalp. He turns out to be Aang (Noah Ringer), the Avatar (speaker to the spirit world), who has been missing for the last century. He alone can bend air to his will; Katara has the same talent with water, but it's poorly developed and fitful. The rest of the movie comprises these 3 enlisting the aid of the earth benders and the Northern Water Tribe to resist the domination of the Fire Nation, led by Lord Ozai (Cliff Curtis). The crafty Ozai pits his lieutenants, Commander Zhao (Aasif Mandvi) and Prince Zuko (Dev Patel), against each other to see which of them can capture the Avatar.M. Night Shymalan has been the most consistent director in my third of a century of reviewing SF&F movies. He started out getting my highest rating (9) with The 6th Sense and has dropped steadily 1 notch every release thereafter. This 7th outing finds him reliably checking in with a 3. (I wasn't the only one who thot so, either; the 2 people sitting next to me in the midnight showing fell asleep and started snoring halfway thru the movie.)You remember those awful chop-socky movies made in Japan and badly dubbed for the US market, where someone's lips would move for 5-6 seconds, and then a single English syllable would emerge? This movie was much like that, except that it was MADE in English. The dialog was painfully awkward, and the delivery was uniformly stilted. The Avatar (modeled on the Dalai Lama) lets fly with janglingly inappropriate colloquialisms like ""hey, guys"". (Shyamalan is listed as the only guilty party for the screenplay.) Awkward is also the word for a bunch of strange poses, bug-eyed expressions, shows of affection, and ""action"" scenes. Due to poor choreography, many red shirts just stand there waiting for their scheduled time to get hit and fall down.This movie is based on the TV show Avatar: The Last Airbender, which ran on Nickelodeon from 2005 to 2008 and was overt anime. After dropping the ""Avatar"" because some hack director had beaten Paramount to registering the title and had the gall to claim he didn't want THIS flik trading on HIS el cheapo reputation, Shyamalan evidently decided to go the rest of the way and also omit anything that smacked of Japanimation.The 4 competing factions in this fantasy world are named for the 4 elements of antiquity. As my attention drifted during the show, I wondered how well they'd stack up against the modern periodic table — particularly the Lead Tribe and the Uranium Tribe — and found myself kind of hoping for a chance to find out. Bad me. (Speaking of which, Despicable Me is due out next week.)This movie is supposedly available in 3-D, but in Madison, Wisconsin, all the auditoria capable of projecting 3-D are devoted to the 3rd Twilight movie, so I saw it only in 2-D. If this kind of scheduling problem is duplicated nationwide, the inability to charge a premium price may hurt Airbender almost as much as its overall lack of merit.It gets a few points for a reasonable score by James Newton Howard, excellent production design, and some imaginative costuming — you know, the sort of technical awards that constitute the SF ghetto at the Oscars every year. Expect at least one of these to vanish the next time our ole buddy Night rolls around to drop yet another rung on the Ladder of Quality in his lifelong quest to squander a once-great reputation.",The Last Airbender
95,colinrgeorge,Shyamalan as the Elephant Man,4,8 July 2010,"All of a sudden, ""The Last Airbender"" is the worst film of the year—Or the most hated, anyway. It sits at a lowly 8% on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of just 2.8 out of 10, based on the opinions of 122 critics. Come on, guys. That's a little unfair.Now I'm not saying M. Night Shyamalan's latest, an adaptation of the popular Nickelodeon cartoon series, is ""great,"" or ""good,"" or even ""mediocre;"" I disliked it. But with hyperbolic descriptors like ""torturous"" and ""nauseating"" and ""worst-film-of-the-last-20-years,"" being lobbed, I can't help but backpedal the conversation. By my estimate, 2010 has wrought at least half a dozen worse films (and because the internet evidently has no long-term memory, they are: ""Legion,"" ""The Wolfman,"" ""Hot Tub Time Machine,"" ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" ""Survival of the Dead,"" ""Killers""), and a few more I would consider of ""equally bad"" caliber.So where does the fire-and-brimstone fury come from? I'll tell you why I had trouble with ""Airbender,"" though it's hardly worth getting into a tizzy over—It bored me. Plain and simple. The fight scenes in particular elicited yawns, with gymnasts pointlessly whirling batons or kicking theatrically at one another before unleashing their impotent elemental tempests. Some of these scenes are cut so short that they border on nonexistence; others are stretched long enough to support multiple catnaps.The choreography is lousy, but the real perpetrator of ""Airbender's"" persistent boringness is its clunky pacing, a function of either poor scripting or eleventh-hour editing. As I recall, early test-screenings for the film begot none too positive feedback, resulting in ominous reshoots. It seems likely that among those initial complaints was the snore factor—Which might have been sloppily addressed by slashing scenes and bridging the gaps with an unconvincing voice-over.Of course, the alternative is equally likely, since as readily as I'll defend Shyamalan the director, as a writer I'm one of his stalwart detractors. Out of misguided pride, he carries a snooty auteur's attitude about directing anyone else's material, which is especially frustrating given that he still shows potential as a visual storyteller. The fact of the matter is he didn't have the slightest qualification to pen ""Airbender,"" and had he instead hired a (competent) professional screenwriter, the results could have been something extraordinary.I will, nevertheless, cede one final point to the piranhas that encircle Mr. Shyamalan's every release. One of their most vociferous accusations this time around was in regards to the performances of his young cast, particularly the airbender himself. Aang, who as the title suggests, is the sole descendant of a race with the ability to manipulate wind, and who befriends and battles those that 'bend' fire, water, and earth, is portrayed by newcomer Noah Ringer—Who is terrible in the film. However, I'm inclined to blame Shyamalan for his dramatic floundering—Ringer was clearly chosen for his talent as a martial artist over his obvious inability to carry a film.And yet, for all ""Airbender's"" clear missed potential and consistently shoddy storytelling, I didn't leave the theater formulating some all-caps condemnation of Shyamalan. Nor did I, as has been tirelessly proclaimed and repeatedly rebuked, type up some smarmy headline about this being the final, final nail in the coffin of his movie career (until the next one)—I just felt sleepy and dissatisfied.His film is nowhere near the year's worst, let alone of the past two decades, but Shyamalan has become irrelevantly hated and an exceedingly popular target as public opinion, along with critical consensus of each subsequent project, has steadily fallen since the release of ""Signs"" in 2002.Can 122 critics and a thousand internet fanboys really be wrong? Maybe not, but they don't have to be so ornery about it.",The Last Airbender
96,loco_73,Move Over...Uwe Boll... You've Got Company!!!!!!!!,1,12 July 2010,"I am not sure how many IMDb users are familiar with the mrcranky.com website. It is one of the ""older"" websites, famous for its exchange of ideas, opinions, comments and ""culture wars"". Besides featuring some of the funniest, but also blunt, brutal and on-mark movie reviews, it also boasts one of the best movie rating systems I have seen! A movie's quality is always measured in minus with the most positive being the ones that sucked the least! The movie gets from one to four bombs, the really bad ones get a dynamite stick and the really awful ones get an atomic mushroom cloud. The caption next to the atomic mushroom cloud reads, ""Proof that Jesus died in vain"".Well, ""The Last Airbender"" is proof that Jesus died in vain. Proof positive indeed.I have no idea what drew me to watch this ""movie""?! I guess it was in part a response (an ill-conceived one in hindsight) against the invasion of yet another instalment of the Twitlight saga, the fact that I did not have to pay for the ticket, and I'm beginning to guess, the copious amount of alcohol I consumed prior to seeing this ""movie"". In the process I managed to deal a serious blow to my intellect, overall health and well-being.To call this ""movie"" bad would not do justice, to just how awful and terrible it is (hence the quotation marks whenever the words movie, flick or film are mentioned). This is not the case of a ""movie"" that is soo bad that is good! No, no, no!!! No, this is bad as in cancer bad, as in a malignant tumour bad, as in having a third nipple or a second a**hole bad! What I stumbled upon here, was a disjointed cacophony of sights, sounds, special effects, acting, script, plot, directing and everything else that goes into making a ""film"". This ""flick"" is a disaster from beginning to end and I don't want to delve into any details, since I want to spare any potential readers of this here humble review and myself included, an overwhelming feeling of nausea, sickness, followed by a quick trip to the bathroom to expel the excremental effects that this turd of a ""movie"" heaps upon its viewers!As a side note, the 3D in this ""movie"" is not really 3D, its more like half the ""movie"" is just plain, regular, old fashioned 2D! For some reason (I am beginning to suspect the consumption of the aforementioned alcohol as the culprit), I kept removing my super-duper-high-tech-wallmart-made-in-china-do-not-poison-me 3D glasses...and surprise, surprise, I did not need them! The 3D presence in this movie is not continuous, but rather intermittent and it occurs only when there are some large scale special effects, fights etc., but they are third rate at best and nothing like ""Alice In Wonderland"" (or as it is known Tim Burton is finally selling out) or ""Avaturd"" (AKA, James Cameron IS the king of the world and the rest of us mere slaves to his boundless ego). I always held some sliver of hope that M. Night Shyamalan still had some hidden reservoir of talent, somewhere deep inside his...whatever! Personally, I always thought that his best work was the underrated and often maligned ""Unbreakable"", ""Signs"" was good, ""The Sixth Sense"" was alright, ""The Village"" and ""Lady In The Water"" I still cannot honestly decide and ""The Happening"" I don't know what to make of it! But with this latest, horrendous abomination of a ""movie"", that sliver of hope evaporated faster than a liter of alcohol from Lindsay Lohan's house.Now Mr. Shyamalan can proudly join the pantheon of movie-making turdmasters such as Joel Schumacher, Michael Bay, MC G, Brett Ratner and the darling of them all Uwe Boll. Nice company to have! Seriously,if you value your mental and physical wellbeing, as well as the purity of your soul, don't commit the unbelievable stupid mistake I did, and stay away from the soulless monstrosity that is ""The Last Airbender""!",The Last Airbender

Some of the visual and effects are neat to be honest. Thank god I didn't watch it in theaters because I possible be asleep before the climax began. It's rushed like the story was weak and the writting is god awful! Including the acting. The pacing is terrible like it feels like if I'm watching a movie over 3hrs long, that's how boring it is.

The boy and girl siblings are the worst. Especially the boy, he's just awful and should have never gotten another acting role. They sound as if they are reading their lines right off cue cards.

101,cosmorados,How satisfying it must be for other critics to side with bullies...,6,13 April 2011,"Two members of the southern tribe of water-benders, Katara and Sokka, while out hunting encounter what an only be described as an anomaly beneath the ice in their barren kingdom. After breaking the ice and allowing said anomaly to escape. The pair of then discover in the ice, Aang, the last of the air-benders, and possibly, the avatar, the one elemental who can bend all the elements to his will. Thus begins their journey as the three of them attempt to bring down the warring fire nation who have forced the elements out of balance.Thus begins M Night Shyamalan's journey into critical hell. For those who loved the series many cannot stand what he has done to the film and so lavish fierce criticism against the film as a thing in itself, the film critics who for a long time have wanted to really rip into him, have, with this film finally got the ammo they needed and laid into him like a pack of bullying thugs. ""Oh look at us, jumping on a band-wagon all saying it's rubbish. Tee hee!"" Well critics, having a longer memory than most of you (I do remember, Batman and Robin, Transformers 2, GI Joe and Iron Man 2) I can say knowing all this, that this film isn't as bad any of those mentioned.Also the critics tend to struggle when reviewing either children's films or action films. They're just not their thing, which is why you tend to see such ridiculous reviews for the worst kind of tripe whereas class films get ripped to bits. The performances by the children are not particularly brilliant early on, but as the film progresses all three of the leads grow more assured. Dev Patel is excellent as the prince with equal plaudits going to both Shaun Toab and Aasif Mandi as Prince's Uncle and Nemesis accordingly, the script is adequate for a kids film, the direction is fine, and for the action sequences is excellent, of which there are many, the score, whilst it borrows heavily from star wars, is a triumph. Set design, effects, story and pretty much everything else you can think of are all far better than any of the previously mentioned films, and the kids that I know have seen this film have all enjoyed it, of any age.I know that many people will find what I've said unpalatable and you know what I don't care. I have seen films that truly suck and the stain of seeing them will stay in my conscious for ever, but this is not one of those films.Never going to be great, but far better than the critics would have you believe.",The Last Airbender

One might call it ""the gospel of Dalai Lama"" - for that is, to put it simple, what it was.The effects were good, reasonably so, and thats why I gave it a 3 in stead of a 2.

104,MovieProductions,The Last M. Night Shymalan movie I pay to see,1,18 December 2010,"Zero stars out of (****)M. Night Shyamalan's involvement. A whopping 6% on Rotten Tomatoes. Claims of it being the worst of the past decade. Fans threatening to physically abuse the director for destroying their treasure... yet I still wanted to see this beast. Yes, Shymalan was once such an involved and clean director and now he's one of the most in-ept, pretentious, and arrogant directors of the twentieth century. But I thought... how can you screw up such an awesome concept? No, I was still the one billionth idiot that devoted their valuable time on one of the most sorry excuses for a film. I could care less, anyone who gives this film a ""5"" or above truly is the most ignorant person to film and honestly, it proves that you like giant turds, no matter how polished or seasoned. Wait? What is this atrocity called? Ladies and gentlemen... without further a-do... I present you... The last airbender.The last airbender revolves around the main protagonist who turns out to be an Avatar, one who could bend air, water, earth, and fire. Nobody else has the ability to accomplish such tasks. Although, Ang forgot how to bend water, earth, and fire. Never mind that in order to be an Avatar, you have to do these things! But no, Ang still can do these things. So, Ang's friends teach him the other tasks. Never mind the fact that his friends don't know how to 2/3 of these things, but apparently the calls from Plot Hole City didn't catch M. Night's attention.What is so aggravating is how M. Night Shymalan had one of the most impressive resumes a director could have. ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"", AND ""Unbreakable"" all on the same resume? Remarkable. And then M. Night releases four of some of the worst movies in history ""The Village"", ""Lady in the Water"", ""The Happening"", and ""The Last Airbender"". Okay, I would have given M. Night some credibility if he broke even (three great movies and three abysmal movies) and he released another winner. Now I have zero trust that Shyamalan can make even a decent film.First, the acting is horrendous. Every performer here with the exception of Dev Patel are just awful. If that wasn't bad enough, the script is truly one of the worst I've read. My god, it's something a kindergarden could come up with. And plot holes? They're the size of Texas. Furthermore, the film is just tedious. A movie's only saving grace of being decent is if it's entertaining. This movie is as flat and lifeless as cardboard. Wooden acting, horrendous screen writing, and poor delivery of lines and this is what people deserve when shelving fifteen dollars?As for the 3D, I did not view this flick in 3D, but since reading that the 3D was very similar to ""Clash of the titans"", I can say that the third dimensions of ""Clash of the titans"" was just awful. It was grain galore! No detail, more grain, and it made the picture look x1000 darker. Even if the 3D was of Avatar's, it was so unnecessary. In 2D, I only saw one scene in the entire movie that could be in 3D. Wow, $4 for crappy 3D? While everything pretty much sucks, I have to admit, the visual aspect is the movie's only great quality. This movie had a mammoth of a budget and it truly shows. While M. Night's resume is now in the toilet, he still has an eye for special effects.This whole year I've seen over one hundred movies and ""The Last Airbender"" is easily the worst movie of the year. It cannot be worse in any way. The 3D sucks. The acting sucks. The direction sucks. The pacing sucks. The dialogue sucks. And you want to spend fifteen dollars on THAT? Sure the visual effects look cool but for that, just go to an art museum and stare at paintings. The worst movie of the year. Avoid... like the plague!",The Last Airbender
105,axismladen,Real Life Saw! This movie is a torture!,2,18 December 2010,"Did Shyamalan even see the series? I find it kind of sad and unbelievable that a guy that wrote The Sixts Sense and Unbreakable wrote something as bad as this. I have a little cousin, he's nine, i'm pretty sure that he would write something better than this.----------Not only that it's completely different from the series, even the most of the cast is white, but it sucks in every single way. I haven't seen so much philosophy while reading Shakespeare, an i read all from Shakespeare.----------- Acting is just terrible. Imagine a hundred Keanu Reeves's in one movie. Everything is wooden. One of the worst acted movies in the movie history. Especially considering the fact that it costed 150.000.000 dollars to make it. Seriously, my mom would be better as Katara and my friend that weights 300 pounds would be better as Aang or Sokka. Or even Zuko. I'm pretty sure that Dev Patel has flushed his career down the toilet with this movie. That is, if he even had one. ------------ Nicola Peltz even had the face for Katara, considering she's white, but her acting is amazingly bad! Don't get me wrong, i'm not racist or something. I'm white too. But if someone is supposed to be white than you can't put a black man to play him. Or the other way around. And if someone is supposed to be Asian than you can't put a white man to play him. It's that simple. Imagine Gandhi being played by Arnold Schwarzenegger and you'll get the point. However, i think that Nicola Peltz has a memorable appearance and that if she'd take a lot of acting classes, she could do well in the future.------------- The movie starts way to literal. Kid's write better than this. You have those 'Braveheart ending' moments going for like ten times in the first thirty minutes. Once again, it really seems unreal that a man who wrote The Sixth Sense wrote this! ------------- I guess the only thing good about the movie are visuals. And even those could have been better. At least with creativity. I'm not sure about the music, i didn't pay attention because i was being murdered by stupidity at the time. -------------- Shyamalan, it's about time for you to give up movies. Turn to music or something. If Gaga can do it than so can you! You ruined your own very well started career with movies like Lady In The Water. This was just the final strike. Stop making movies. Or at least not on your own material anymore. Buy scripts instead of writing them. That way you might stand a chance to be respected once again.--------------- People, don't see this movie.

Ever since ""The Village"", for whatever reason the guy has just taken critical thrashing after critical thrashing, and i really don't understand why. I find his films always are at least trying to say something interesting. The world brought to life in Airbender is fascinating. Riveting, even. I am an admitted fan of science fiction and fantasy, and this flick was the perfect tonic for my fantasy-starved summer. Is it a perfect movie? No. It has it's flaws. There are some moments where it feels rushed (obviously trying to cram an entire season worth of TV show into an hour and a half isn't easy!), and some of the acting is questionable, but i found that the key roles all were decently cast and there was enough development there for you to have some investment in the characters by the end.I should point out that, walking out of this film, i wanted more of this world, which compelled me to run out and pick up the first season of the show.

109,evan_harvey,Not too bad,7,18 September 2010,"Having never seen the source material for this movie (the animated series) I had nothing to compare it with. Other reviews have panned it as a result of that comparison. For myself, I quite enjoyed it. I wasn't aware that this is only the first on a series, and so was waiting for things to get moving. Once I realised that other films may follow, I was able to enjoy the slower pace.It's not particularly well-plotted, and some of the scenes are done in a rather half-arsed kind of way. For example, the fight scenes aren't particularly well done. There's some slow-mo bits, but overall they're a bit weak. The rebellion scenes are a bit weak as well, and the story seems a bit rushed. It could have used a lot of tightening up in the script. It's easy to see traces of the series in some of the character interactions, and imagine their animated counterparts. The dialogue is okay.Overall, 7 out of 10 is for the rather epic scope of the film, and the promise of more of the story to come in future films, as well as some cool SFX. For those who are fans of the source material, it might be disappointing, but for everyone else, it's a decent film, albeit a bit slow.",The Last Airbender
110,mjplysaght,Appalling adaptation of a beloved series,1,2 February 2017,"First of all, I'm thankful not to have paid money to see this film in the cinemas. I watched this film on Netflix about three years after its initial release and it was just an hour and a half of my life I will never get back.Recap: the Nickelodeon show 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' centres around the so-named 'last airbender' called Aang (pronounced 'ang'), a cheerful young monk who must accept the responsibility of protecting the world from the impending threat of the tyrannical Fire Nation. He is assisted by quirky Inuit siblings Katara and Sokka (pronounced 'sock-ah'), and travel across the four nations, while encountering many adventures along the way.The actual film: Aang (pronounced 'ong') is a monk who spouts out exposition, whines, and is assisted by Caucasian Katara and Sokka (pronounced soh-ka), who do absolutely nothing in the film and try to fend off the Indian Fire Nation.Of all the films Shyamalan could have made, he had to completely butcher the already existing source material of the Nickelodeon show. This film is a dull, lifeless attempt of trying to retell the story of the first season of Avatar. The dialogue and acting are wooden, the pacing is incredibly rushed and the CGI is atrocious. For any future directors trying to adapt a 20 episode TV series into one movie, here's an idea: DON'T! The film is full of expository dialogue, there is no attempt to develop the characterization of the protagonists and this film immensely suffers as a result. Dev Patel as Zuko is trying his best though. The casting of the main characters spawned a ton of controversy, as people saw this as a clear example of whitewashing. The Inuit siblings were now Caucasian, along with Aang, who presumably was of Eastern background in the TV series. The same can be said of the Fire Nation who suddenly go from Asian to Indian. I have no problem with it whatsoever but the sheer contrast between the TV show and the movie is what I always go from.The only thing I find hilarious is that this film starts with the assumption that sequels are going to be made. For a film that 'captures the tone' of the show by adding cringe-inducing dialogue, terrible choreography, and no character relation at all, yeah, that's definitely deserving of a sequel.

113,I_Love_Spielberg,"2010: Not as bad as everyone is saying. 2014: Yes, as bad as everyone is saying.",1,20 July 2010,"FROM 2010THE LAST AIRBENDER takes place in a world where there are four tribes: Water, Earth, Fire, and Air. As Katara explains, the tribes once lived in harmony and peace, until the Fire Nation decided to conquer all. The Nations' only hope lies in someone known as the Avatar, one who can bend all the elements, and when the world needed him most, he vanished. A thousand years pass, turmoil has settled between the nations. The Air Nomads are gone. Two siblings, Sokka(Rathbone) and Katara(Peltz) discover the latest reincarnation of the Avatar: Aang(Ringer), who ran away from his tribe when he was needed, and became encased in a frozen prison. After being thawed, Sokka and Katara bring him back to the Water tribe, where they learn who he really is. All the while, Prince Zuko(Patel) is on a mission to capture the Avatar and bring him to his father, Fire Lord Ozai(Curtis), in order to regain his honor. But Sokka and Katara aren't willing to adhere to Zuko's request, so they decide to help Aang master all the elements. You may or may not be surprised to here me say this, but I liked it. Yes, Shyamalan did change somethings, and yes he may have taken a misstep in changing pronunciation, but what people have to remember is this: it's a movie. It's not a TV show. There are things you have to change in order for it to work as a film. You have to be able to whittle it all down to something that works as a film, while keeping all the major major moments of the show itself, and Shyamalan does that. The actors did a good job as well. Dev Patel was marvelous as Prince Zuko. He really captured his essence. Noah Ringer was really good as Aang, although I would've liked to have seen him to some more comedic stuff. Shyamalan didn't have to take it all so seriously. The penguin-sledding scene would've gotten big laughs. Oh well, easy come easy go. Jackson Rathbone was really good as Sokka. He actually made me cry at one point during his scene with Princess Yue(Gabriel). That was really the emotional part of the film. It was very emotional in the show, but Shyamalan tends to turn the emotions up a notch, causing tears to be shed. He did it with THE SIXTH SENSE, he did it with SIGNS, he even did it with LADY IN THE WATER, and he did it with THE LAST AIRBENDER. Nicola Peltz is the only gal who can play Katara. She got Katara's delivery, her emotions, everything. I was thoroughly impressed. But I was most impressed with Aasif Mandvi as Commander Zhao. That was a surprise, and a pleasant one. He has proved he can do serious as well as comedy. The writing was good too. Shyamalan did a good job of sticking to the voices of the writers of the TV show, as well as provide some of his own spin. However, the movie did jump around a lot, and that was a little unsettling for me, but it didn't stop my enjoyment of the film. The visual effects were spectacular. I got chills from watching them. They were very good. ILM did a great job of matching the TV show in that area. Appa was probably my favorite effect. He made me smile every time he was on screen. But still, special effects can't cover story, but the story's good, so the visual effects are just as good too. You have to really know the show in order to get a lot of what's in the film, which helps if you've watched the show. If someone didn't, then there would be one of two reactions: They didn't get it, or they liked it enough as a film but would later on be disappointed when they watched the show for themselves. If you like M. Night Shyamalan, there's a good chance you'll either like this or you won't. I can't really give any guarantees. If you liked the TV show, and are a purist, you probably won't like this film. However, if you liked the show, but are able to enjoy the adaptation as a film, then you will like this film as I did. I'd like to see it again if I have the chance. As for Shyamalan, he gets a tip of the hat from me for trying something different. He did a good job of adapting another's work. I can't wait for the sequel.NOW IN 2014: Okay, here's the deal. Now that I've studied screen writing, I'm actually seeing the glaring flaws in this movie. The biggest one being he compressed a whole season into one movie. That's not how you do it, because your focus switches. Act I belonged to Katara, The midpoint belonged to Zuko, and Act III belonged to Aang, the movie's protagonist. What? What the hell is that? He should've just made the movie its own thing, but he didn't. And he failed.",The Last Airbender

115,LinkGoku,"as a remake of the cartoon it sucks, as its own movie its awesome",8,20 August 2010,"after seeing the previews for this movie i was really excited to see it, i didn't expect that it would be very good as a redo of the cartoon show but thats mostly because a TV show can go on forever without needing to worry about cutting it down for length, while a movie is a lot tougher due to not being able to be four hours long.though it still could have had more to it, it could of been like 2 and a half hours long, it was good for the running time it had.i was also getting annoyed constantly by there mispronunciation of Aang.the effects were just jaw-dropping, the acting was actually really good for saying that there weren't any big name actors.i hear a lot of people put this movie down because it wasn't like the show enough, well duuuh! ITS NOT THE SAME SHOW! ITS A REDO! ITS DIFFERENT! GET OVER IT! i enjoyed this movie and i really hope that there is a sequel in the near future.and thats why i give THE LAST AIRBENDER 8/10",The Last Airbender
116,Joejoesan,Dear mister Night Shyamalan...,8,20 August 2010,"Dear mister Night Shyamalan,In Hollywood - and probably all over the world - people like winners. So when you made The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable you became the king of the world. Everybody's hero. Unfortunately it's getting boring when somebody does the right thing every time. So the minute you take a wrong turn, people are more than willing to tear you down. People like to make heroes, but they also love to see them all fail. Now, I haven't seen all of your movies. I did like The Village. I love your Stuart Little script. And today I saw your version of The Last Airbender. And you know what? Even as a fan of the cartoon series I really enjoyed it!Lets start with the bad parts. Your casting was all wrong. To me The Last Airbender has always been a tale of Asian heroes. You use Asian extras, but your lead characters are almost all pretty Aryan. Jackson Rathbone as Sokka... well, Jackson is too handsome to play a clumsy sidekick anyway. Blue-eyed Nicola Peltz as a Inuit girl looked very much out of place. I did like Dev Patel as prince Zuko and Noah Ringer as Aang though. And since the story is mainly about them I didn't think the casting mistakes were lethal.Turning this 2D movie into a 3D one... This was probably the studio's decision, but don't ever do that again! It didn't work. It's ugly. Then the good parts. To summarize the first season of the cartoon series into one movie isn't easy and I think you did a great job storywise. The movie also captured the atmosphere of the cartoon and most of the special effects were well done. I also liked the choreography of the fightscenes.I don't like people being bashed just for the sake of bashing. So I just wanted to let you know that there are still people who really like what you are doing. My 10 year old thought the movie was great (he gave it a 9) and my older son was a little bit disappointed (he gave it a 7), but really liked the beginning and the end. But frightenly bad... no, that was absolutely not the case.Can't wait to see Book II: Water!8/10",The Last Airbender
117,jebyvyson,"This is a movie so bad, you'll enjoy beating on it like a dead horse.",1,11 October 2019,"When I was 8 years old, I first saw the movie on Comcast Demand and liked it because I was a fan of the animated series. Now that I'm 17, I realized how dumb little me was.The story is the same as the animated series, but the problem isn't the story, it how they made the story. The writing and dialogues are laughably bad like a 13 year old wrote it. Now that I think about it, a 13 year old would've made a better written story than this. Is so lazy and bland like they never even try. The characters are the major problem in this movie. Their name isn't pronouns right, they lack any emotions, and makes this movie look like play rather than a movie because of their acting. If they were going to change something from the animated series, MAKE SURE IT MAKES SENSE! The action of this movie was really disappointing. They try it to make it intense yet the pacing of this movie is slow down. The visual effects is...okay, but for the bending scenes, it doesn't feel or look awesome. Glad this movie didn't get a sequel.If you're a fan of the TV series and have not seen this movie, it's probably best not to get your heart crushed but I'm not going to stop you. If you seen this movie and never watched the animated series, I HIGHLY recommend that you do so you can see which is better in comparison.",The Last Airbender
118,borismk-38942,Were they actually *trying* to disrespect the original?,1,12 August 2020,"I could live with the bad animations, I can accept the terrible choreography and if I absolutely push myself I could cope with the fact that they tried to condense a whole season into one film. What I can't accept is the total subversion of what made the show excellent.The meaningful characters of Avatar feel like someone's taken a hacksaw to them. Their motivations, key moments of growth and emotional impact on the audience have been distorted to the point of being unrecognisable, in this hatchet job of an adaptation.The only positive is that this may have attracted some people to watch the series, but it's equally possible that some poor souls who were horrified by this mistakenly thought the show was just as bad. This is truly unforgivable",The Last Airbender
119,mergatroid-1,As a fan of the series I liked the movie,7,17 November 2010,"I loved the Avatar: The Last Air Bender series. I am a big animation fan, and I have the complete series which I have watched several times. The series manages a warmth and humor that were missing from the movie, but I cannot fault them for that. They had an entire season of animation to fit into a movie, and it's hard to do for the best movie makers. I could fault the length, it could have been two hours, but it all turned out very well.This is NOT the series, but based on the series. The biggest changes as I mentioned earlier are that they seem to have missed out the warmth and humor the original series has. The original series was never ""just made for children"". It has some humor in it that would likely go right over the heads of most children. Pretty much all of this humor is missing from the movie. Having said that, the other changes are fairly minor.The story consists of various tribes, some of whom can bend or manipulate the elements (air, earth, fire and water). The fire nation has started a war to eliminate all the benders from the other tribes. In this world, there is a single Avatar who can bend all the elements. He is reincarnated over the years, and in this incarnation as a child he ran away from his responsibilities and ended up frozen for a hundred years. When he awakes he finds his own people have been destroyed by the fire tribe and it's basically his fault. Joined by his new friends who rescued him from his frozen tomb, he comes to grips with his responsibilities and helps defend the water tribe of the north from the fire tribe.I cannot believe there are so many bad reviews of this movie. Most of them are from fans of the animated series who, I suppose, thought the movie would be a verbatim copy of the series. I have to ask, since we already have the series, and it was done so well, why should they just copy it into a movie? That would be a waste of time. Sure, they changed the races of the tribes, but I find no issue with this. I thought they did a great job of it. The story mostly sticks to the same story as the animation did during the ""Book One: Air"" season, albeit a little rushed trying to fit so much into such a short length of time. It's too bad they couldn't have done the three hour thing as LOTR did, but that costs so much for an audience that is likely to be small compared to LOTR it wouldn't have made any sense. As it is though, they could at least have hit the 2 hour mark.I usually am not impressed by child actors. Either most of them are pretty bad or they are not given the opportunity to give their best performances (the exception IMHO is the Harry Potter series of films in which I thought the young actors did a fine job), however in this case I have to say the young actors ""didn't suck"". The Aang character could have been played with a little more gusto, as in the series he's really a happy-go-lucky kid which gives the series some of it's charm. Other than that and the lack of warmth which the series had between it's characters (the love story between Aang and Katara is completely missing, which really brought a sense of young love to the series) I have to say this was a pretty good movie.I'm not going to put it down because it's not a carbon copy of the animated series. The production values were great, the directing was fine as were the actors. I and the other people watching the film with me had no problems with the script, and I'm sorry to have to say it but anyone who has a problem following the plot of this movie may want to stick with ""Dick and Jane"" books. The entire movie had an ""epic"" feel to it, and the effects were amazing.Personally, I hope they do Earth and Fire. I will definitely purchase them if they do.As for all the whiners ""boo hoo, this movie sucks because it's not the series"", grow up. No movie based on an animation is exactly like the animation. Just get used to it because that's the way it is. Can you not see the movie for what it is instead of what you want it to be? You are never going to see a copy of the series in a movie, it's just not going to happen.However, it's likely that thanks to all the whiny reviews by fans looking for a copy of the series, we may never see a completed The Last Air Bender trilogy in movie form. Good job.",The Last Airbender
120,Theraxorterminate,"So unbelievably bad, it makes Dragonball Evolution look like The Godfather.",1,14 November 2015,"So it's been 5 years since this movie was released but I'm still mad about it. And why do I wanna write a review to a badly made movie when I should just ignore it? Well I happen to have some very important news to tell you that I've read that Nickelodeon recently might have some interests of making sequels to it. And my biggest questions are: Is it really necessary? Haven't they learned anything from their mistakes?I mean ""The Last Airbender"" was an awful movie from the beginning to the end. It had just everything that made this movie so badly made, including: bad acting, bad dialog, bad direction, bad production, bad editing, lacking important elements from the original cartoon and need I say more? Also it won ""5 Razzie Awards"" including for Worst Picture of the year and when it flopped Nickelodeon announced that they agreed not to make any sequels at all, until last year they've changed their minds.Please no, just no! God forbid them making that decision, it will only make it worse. I already made my mistake of watching it in theaters (even worse I also watched it in 3D which wasn't even better it gave no experience at all) when it premiered.Even the creators of the original cartoon didn't like it and they also stated that they pretend that this movie doesn't exist. See their priorities? If a sequel want to be made I bet they'll say: ""Hell no, just look at what Shyamalan did to our wonderful show!""I'm telling you, I can predict that if that happens they will lose even more respect than they get today. Don't waste your time with this movie, even if you aren't a fan of the original animated series or don't even know about it you won't like this film in any ways. It's not even worth a rent or cable or even Netflix, there are thousands of movies far more superior than this garbage. Do yourself a favor and watch the original cartoon or if you have children, show them Oscar Winning Animated Movies instead! This movie is beyond awfulness.-1000000/10",The Last Airbender
121,seige-hound,"Not the worst thing ever, but still an awful adaptation.",3,31 May 2016,"Watching this movie a second time, after years of hating its guts, I'm starting to gain appreciation for the few specks of gold in the dirt.The Last Airbender is a children's fantasy adventure film based on the television show Avatar: The Last Airbender, which is still one of my favourite TV shows of all time, myself giving it a 9/10. There are a few blatant issues that I need to address first before I address the few good bits.The Writing: The absolute worst part of this film. The film is based on the first season of the show, which is 20 episodes, running at about 20 minutes each minus ads. That is around 400 minutes of content, that is reduced to 100 minutes in this film. Because of this, much of the content that made the show good is taken out; character development, jokes, worldbuilding, story arcs, etc. are lost and are replaced with horrible narration and far too much exposition.The Acting: All of the leads, save for perhaps Dev Patel as Zuko, are awful actors. That in combination with the writing ads up to a cringe-fest of strangely worded lines, awkward pauses in the middle of sentences, and emotionless delivery.The Casting: The term 'race-bending', used now to describe when a Hollywood adaptation of a preexisting work changes the race/skin tone of the characters, was first used to describe the casting of this film. Katara and Sokka, initially portrayed as darker skinned in the show, are white, whereas Zuko and the other Firebenders, who are much more pale than other races in the show, resembling most closely the Japanese, are portrayed by South Asian and Middle Eastern actors. This rule does not apply to extras and minor roles, further confusing the world of the film.The Bending/Choreography: Everyone has seen that infamous scene where five earthbenders slowly levitate a small rock. While there are some exceptions, in general, the way all the elemental bending works in this film is far more clumsy than the Television counterpart. The choreography is awkward and slow, probably to make the effects easier to accomplish in post (don't quote me on that, I'm not sure)Alright, so that's the worst the film has to offer. What about the good bits. This time, let's start from the bottom to the top.The Bending/Choreography: There are a few exceptional effects that work. Some of the airbending genuinely looks cool in my opinion, and some of the fight scenes do work, but those are few and far between.The Art Direction: There is a lot of good stuff hidden in the background. The set design is mostly good, the costumes look cool, and some of the sets look good as well. There are a few easter eggs that are obviously for the fans (Zuko's picture of his family the most notable, as the character closer resemble the TV show than the movie) I have a feeling a lot of fans of the show worked on this film, and tried to do the best with what they were working with.The Music: The score of this film is by far the best part of the film, absolutely on par with the show's score, even better in some parts. Imagine this score paired with a good film, that would've blown everyone away. It's really a pity such talent and skill was wasted on a film no one wants to see anymore.In the end, this film is not worth watching. There isn't enough good to justify or forgive the bad. However, it's not abysmal, and there is a little fun to be had in some parts.",The Last Airbender
122,garyvanhorn,A movie certain to take home some Golden Raspberrys.,1,10 January 2011,"This poorly thought out disaster of a movie should never have been made. It is a blight upon the good name of the source material and I sincerely hope the franchise dies a quick death and is forgotten. All copies of this cinematic abomination should be immediately transferred to volatile silver nitrate film so it will not be preserved to torture future generations of movie goers.From beginning to end the film it a mess. The acting is atrocious, the effects laughable, the dialogue is clunky, and the fight scenes are less exciting than watching paint dry. At no point in the film is any characterization established partly because of poor acting but mostly because the film races through each scene at a breakneck pace in order to cram an entire season of the animated series into a two hour film. There is no time for the audience to take in any of the scenes, as soon as they begin they are over and the next matter-of-fact scene begins. The film is totally devoid of any measure of emotion and garners no reaction from the audience except for complete, total boredom.The central plot, a young boy who is fated to unite the warring elemental factions and bring peace to the world, is mostly lost in the jarring hodgepodge of scenes strung together in something resembling a storyboard. Narration substitutes for action and acting and serves to further rush the viewer from scene to scene without being able to watch, appreciate, or comprehend any of them. Avatar: The Last Airbender is a fantastic animated series and a very much recommend it, but for the love of God, avoid the live action movie at all costs. You have been warned.",The Last Airbender

We still can't be satisfied because when you come to cinema and put your 3D glasses and start watching movie I guess that there is coming out big PROBLEM-THE QUALITY . OK,maybe we couldn't expect something great from this kind of movie . It is based on cartoons it doesn't seem so . It is set as some kind of little child's work . Jumbled,made out from nowhere and still frivolous . Soundtrack was just like choice of little child . It wasn't enjoyable .

All is set on table and you have just to read it . You don't have even to make some efforts to read some hidden tricks . It is still downfall of imagination by director M.Night Shyamalan . Director with greatest oscillations made some effective crap and he should fell shame because he had one of greatest stories . This story about 4 powerful nations,with their pluses and minuses,terrorized,last of his kind,long war and runaways . Do you have any idea that this story could interest adults which wants fantasy runaway and children which enjoy in great effective war . Director still can be happy because because in fight scenes I enjoyed because they are still have some excitements . Miserable performances,especially from star Dev Patel . It was so bad that it was like their rest of acting . Children still can stuck for this movie because it is interesting but still less imagination . I gave it 5 which is bad mark . But , still good because some summer craps deserved worse like Eclipse or something else . My rating can be described very easily . 1-because of great promotion,2-because of attracting theme,3-story which has potential,4-visual effects,5-costume selection(armies were looking very powerful,especially fire nation) Still hope to see maybe sequel .

124,aaronjbong,The Last Airbender (+ Water and Earthbenders) VS Firebenders,3,7 August 2010,"It's kind of hard to decide whether to give it a positive or negative grade for this movie. It's not necessarily rubbish as there were actually some electrifying moments in the movie. It's not really a bad film ... if you haven't watched the amazing original TV series. ""The Last Airbender"" is basically a fantasy movie based on the TV series of the same name (exclusive of Avatar). It's about Aang, the last Airbender who is the Avatar or the only one who can master all the four elements: Water, Earth, Fire, Air. As the Fire Nation has declared war against the other three nations, the Avatar is the only one who can stop the Fire Nation. With Katara and his brother Sokka, they embark on a journey to stop them as well as mastering all the four elements.First problem in this movie, the cast was totally a joke. You can't possibly have serious, chubby Aang when he's supposed to look joyful. The Fire Nation was also terrible casted as it's all full of Indians where they were supposed to look more Chinese. Katara was supposed to have a darker tone of skin rather than pale. And, Jasper from ""Eclipse"" is Sokka? Whoa, don't start with the villains. Whoever casted them, they should be a little careful next time.Next, the acting was pretty dull for me. Aang looked like he always felt sad and emotionless. He barely looked happy as he always looked sorrowful and solemn. It was quite disappointing. Katara was also not really in depth with the acting. Sokka, however, was fine. Prince Zuko portrayed by ""Slumdog Millionaire"" star Dev Patel was actually the best actor in the movie. Uncle Iroh or Prince Zuko's guardian supposedly was also fine. I didn't like the narrating by Katara that feels uncomfortable for me. It made Katara become the protagonist of the movie and therefore, I hated it. Another thing, the movie is also slow-paced as there are so many disturbing slow-motion scenes which was pretty boring. It ate up most of the screen time and actually simply drags the runtime. The slow motion scenes reminded me of ""The Storm Warriors"" which was almost every second, filled with slow motion moves. The movie could have been better if they actually put more scenes and get rid of the slow-motion stuff which could entertain the audience better.The special effects of the movie was also pretty fake like Appa and Momo. They were pretty obvious to be noticed throughout the film. That's another problem with the film.The 3D effects were almost the same with 2D. They almost didn't convert anything I guess. The first 20 minutes of the film's 3D was quite visible but barely noticed. Continuing the next hour, the 3D was nothing else than 2D. I tried to compare the 3D and 2D by taking of the glasses several times (although the movie was quite blurry if it's in 3D and being watched without the glasses) and it was nearly the same. So, if you want to save some money, take the 2D one.For fans of the TV series, this movie may disappoint you. Obviously, the main reason why a movie adapted from books, cartoon and etc. is not enjoyable is because the story is changed from slightly to whole. Well, most of the TV series's plot was changed. That also gave me the intention to deduct the grade of the movie.However, if you haven't heard the TV series or haven't watched it, then that's the time where you can give a higher grade and have a better time on enjoying this film.To conclude this, ""The Last Airbender"" in a word can be called disappointing. However, M. Night Shyamalan seems to have a little progress from his last creation ""The Happening"" which was almost non- sense to me. If you have kids, the kids will probably enjoy the film whether they've seen the movie or not but I think the adults would enjoy it if they haven't heard of the TV series. Prince AJB's rating: 3/10. Thanks for reading my review on ""The Last Airbender"" and hope it's useful.",The Last Airbender
125,Spidenus816,A Stack of Common Sense Mistakes as Tall as Everest,2,12 December 2020,"I have only one good thing to say about this movie: When I heard how much people detested this film, I thought, ""Well, it's probably just not possible to translate a show like ATLA onto the live-action big screen."" After finally watching this, I am now starting to believe that it could be possible to have a live-action movie that takes place in the Avatar universe. The reason why is because they made convincing costumes and set pieces, and all the problems with the movie are caused by a failure to adhere to common sense (i.e., how did they get the characters' names wrong??). If they ever do try another such movie, I would recommend not retelling the story from the series but picking up where the series left off or some other time period in the universe (like what Korra did).",The Last Airbender
126,sethmlanders,It's not bad.....it's horrendously awful.,1,4 April 2014,"This piece of garbage is painful and this proves that Shyamalan has become a sellout. I enjoyed The Sixth Sense, Signs, and The Village, so I have nothing against the guy. Now I'm going to point out the biggest flaws with this abomination of a film.The writing is rushed. A six year old can write a better script than that. Shyamalan mutilates the source material. The acting is laughable, the actors are either badly at direction or are confused about who their characters are. Also, the dialogue is non-stop exposition and complex rules that make no sense to the story at all, and the special effects are campy as hell! Who gives 150 million dollars to a project that has zero character development or human emotions? Some drunk studio executive who needs to make a quick buck.I've seen the superior animated series and I've watched enough of it to know that the once talented director put no time or effort to learn about his adaptation. Seriously, M. Night Shyamalan hasn't made a good movie in 10 years. In conclusion, this movie sucks, it is one of the worst movies ever made, and the only way to know how terrible it is is to watch it and I dare you!",The Last Airbender
127,blackmambamark,"Behold, the most worthless 3D movie ever created.",4,11 July 2010,"What started as a very promising career for young director M. Night Shamalan, has quickly turned into a vicious nightmare. How can someone go from making great movies such as ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"", to complete crap storms like ""The Happening"" and ""Lady in the Water""? And no, i will not mention ""The Village"" because unlike most of you, i actually liked it. Hopefully M. Night can turn around this un-lucky streak and get back to his roots of brilliant film making.Well, people, here it is in all it's glory. The worst 3D movie ever made. This movie falls under numerous categories of poor cinema. First being the worst looking 3D movie, second being one of the worst all around acting performances in a full length feature, and third being one of the worst child films i have seen in recent memory. Just what makes this movie so bad? Well let's break it down, shall we? First, let's look at the pathetic excuse for 3D. Towards the beginning of spring, i thought ""Clash of the Titans"" was the best example of how a 3D movie should NOT look. Because if you saw that movie, you know that nothing really stood out. It felt like a waste of extra money because, well, you really didn't get much 3D action at all.....let alone any. Well this movie was exactly the same way, but even worse. At least ""Clash of the Titans"" had some sequences that stood out. This movie didn't have any. In fact, it felt like i was watching a commercial for a 3D movie instead of actually watching one. Needless to say, it was the biggest waste of a 3D experience.Second is the acting. I would be very surprised if this movie did not sweep the Razzie awards for acting. My god was it terrible. I don't think i have seen an ensemble act this poorly since last years ""Street Fighter"".Third is the storyline. Watching this piece of trash slowly unfold, was like watching a retarded cricket jump all over the place. From start to finish, there was not one portion of this story that stood out, or was appealing. I mean, i know it's a kids movie, but it doesn't have to be told like one.However, i will not give all the credit to the actors or the cinematographers for this giant turd bomb. I blame the writer/director M. Night. Shamalamadingdong. Because truth be told, i have seen most of these actors act before......in fact, three of them were in Academy Award winning films. They just need to right direction..... and it is clear that they were getting none from this hack. Yes, i called him a hack, because it is almost like the guy has given up being a good director, and you can clearly see that in this pile of rubbish.Bottom Line, i wouldn't say that it's the worst movie of the year, but it is pretty damn close. This movie talks about elements.....well i cannot find one element of this movie that is worth talking about. This may be the movie that finally puts the nail in M. Night's career. Where most directors get better as time goes along.......M. Night seems to be going in the other directon, because his movies keep getting worse and worse.",The Last Airbender

I wasn't familiar with the Airbender story until recently, when everyone started talking about the new movie, so I had no expectations going into it. Yes, I understand that some changes were made, much like Peter Jackson did with The Lord of The Rings, but we went to see a special showing and all the kids that were familiar with the stories said the changes weren't anything terrible and they absolutely LOVED the show.Most of the kvetching I've read has revolved around that.

It is very well directed, visually striking, the framing is top notch.
CGI is correct. Acting is horrible be it for children or adult actors. And the plot is awful. Many things stay unexplained at the end of the movie. Geographically, it is a mess. The dialogs are dumb. Characters are not developed. So many plot holes...
It could have been a great film. It had all the source material for it, but it had to end up with it. The most sad is that it ends like there is going to be a sequel... so laughable. Shyamalan, you are so much better than this!",The Last Airbender

It will win the Razzie Awards, but its box office is so huge that they are going to make a sequel! No need for a big review. While the effects are quite good, I hated the acting and everything else about it. This is just like a Disney TV show with good effects. It is nowhere good enough to be in the big screen, yet people still come to check it out. The Last Airbender is by the far worst film of the decade and M. Shyamalan is the worst director of the decade for creating this film. And this will be true since there are more than a considerable amount of people agreeing to this statement.

If he's really, really lucky he'll have time to redeem himself. Maybe. But he needs to keep it simple. In life simplicity really does reign. James Cameron spent years and years preparing for Avatar, you can't rush such a huge film. Yet M. Night did, in too many ways. If he wants to rush. He needs to keep it simple, if not he needs to take his time. We all get off kilter. Think straight my friend! Here's why this movie was bad.1. The action and effects were awesome but they outdid the acting so bad, and were so frequent that you feel like you are watching the actors take a beating buy the special effects Gods.2. Acting = Horrible. Their were two or three good actors out about 11 and none of them were a main character...The Princess was good that's about it. Aang started to get it at the very end of the movie. Did they even prepare these kids? Is M Night hiring his friends and family? Hasn't he heard of M.C. Hammer? 3. The story was a bit confusing.

132,birck,Ugh.,2,30 June 2010,"Will somebody please put a gun (empty) to M. Night Shyamalan's head and tell him he must make his next movie FROM SOMEONE ELSE'S SCRIPT?! I live in Philly, and the guy is a local celebrity, but everything he's done since Sixth Sense has been hopelessly portentous crap. He needs to lower his sights and write something about ordinary people grappling with ordinary, earthbound problems. Instead of ordinary people grappling with a threatening, malignant universe, and taking everything so doggone seriously. Doesn't anything funny or absurd, or simply *light* ever happen to him?

133,zactac,If you see this movie you will feel ashamed and then you must try to reclaim your honor by seeing the true Avatar.,2,5 July 2010,"I am truly horrified at what has happened to one of my favorite TV shows. I had no idea what to expect so I went in hoping it would be good on some degree and sadly even then I was let down.All Avatar fans know the story. In a world where there are four nations there are also people who can control the elements. Fire, Earth, Water, and Air are the names of the nations and are the elements. Every generation there is a special person born called the Avatar who has the power to control all elements and uses this power to keep the world safe and in balance. When the Fire Nation wages war the Avatar disappears. A hundred years later a brother and sister Sokka and Katara of the Southern Water Tribe find a boy in an iceberg and they learn he is the next Avatar and the last of the Airbenders. So they decide to travel the world and teach Aang the elements so he can fulfill his destiny and save the world.While the series is greatly entertaining the film completely destroys what the show was. The dialog to start with is silly. These people talk like complete idiots throughout the film not even sounding like they thought about what they were going to say.Another thing that bothered me was that the story is different more than it should be. Key plot points are left out and all that does is upset true fans of the series and confuse those who haven't even seen it.Most of the time the children would just talk about getting Aang to the North Pole so he can train, they do absolutely nothing else. They aren't funny or charming they just work at trying to teach Aang the elements. Then there is Zuko and please don't get me started with that. In the series he's fierce and a cunning warrior. While in this film he sometimes makes his sister Azula seem more sane than he is. Not to mention he's not intimidating in the least amount. Which if someone would guess from the series the person playing Zuko would at least look intimidating in the film he looks like an awkward teenager thriving for his father's attention.What also got me upset is that they wouldn't even do something as simple as pronouncing the names of some of the characters right. When they would say Aang it would sound like Oong and when they say Iroh it would sound like Eroh. But it does show me that maybe the cast isn't entirely to blame for how awful this film was. M. Night after all did write the script even though I see no reason why he had to make as many changes as he did.With other adaptations there usually isn't enough source material to make a decent film like they would want so filmmakers would have to make some stuff up. But the Avatar series is just filled with plenty of information and has everything anyone could possibly need to make a good film from it. However M. Night decides to ignore this fact and change the story for no good reason. Because of this he would probably get more hate mails from fans of the show than money (as I am sure that is what he is hoping for).If the children can act its hard to tell through M. Night's mediocre writing. I was hoping that with as much information he had he might have been able to make a pretty decent film but he decides to throw it all away and create a film meant to get fans of the show angry.Whatever the case may be I understand that things are different in a movie than the source it came from. I can deal with certain things but when the actors can't even pronounce Avatar right because of M. Night's script you know there is a problem.This film could have been very good but it was just badly done. The special effects were great but if only the cast was thought over, then the script redone to be a little more faithful to the story, also maybe adding in an extra hour or so to get in all of the important details while also focusing on characterization would have probably been a good idea, and maybe not have a director and writer who's career has been going down the drain for the past decade the film could have been great. But sadly it seems we'll all need some serious Avatar the TV series therapy to get this film out of our heads.Please I implore you do not see this movie. Do not encourage a sequel especially one made by M. Night. Because of this I can not even look at one of my favorite Avatar episodes. If you are a fan of Avatar and like good movies then do not see this movie that is more like a bunch of clips put together to make one big mistake.I give this film a very generous 2/10 stars. The reason is that my love for Avatar prevents me from giving it one star or less. So if you see this montage of horror watch it at your own risk.",The Last Airbender

Of course since it is based off something else it will not live up to the expectations of the viewers. But this movie is an exciting, entertaining movie with an interesting story. It seems like if a movie is just entertaining and that is pretty much all then people give the movie a bad review. Take for example Knight and Day and Eagle Eye. Those got bad reviews but were fun, entertaining and no brainer movies. It is interesting that the new Twilight movie is getting a lot better reviews than The Last Airbender when The Last Airbender was in my opinion a better movie than the new Twilight movie. The movie also has incredible special effects and I love those kind of movies. So all in all this movie wasn't that bad of a movie.",The Last Airbender

136,FilmFreak94,An insult to the animated series. Never watch it,1,28 June 2011,"Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the greatest TV shows to ever come out of Nickelodeon. So when they announced a movie was being made I had very little hopes that they would be able to catch the charm and greatness that the series had. But I never thought it would be something like this. What we got instead of a potentially great movie was a pile of boring, repetitive drivel. None of the characters had any personalities, the pacing was terrible and I just found myself not caring by the end of the movie. The way they bend the four elements in the movie is a complete joke, instead of using actual styles of martial arts they just flail their arms and legs around trying to look cool. The pacing was another thing that ruined this film. One minute we're being introduced to Aang, Katara and Sokka, the next Aang is captured and they need to save him. I'm not exaggerating, I swear this is true. And the characters themselves had absolutely no personality or character traits that could make them likable. Aang was just there to save the world, Katara lost whatever coolness she had in the TV series, and Sokka was just the comic relief. And as for the rest of the cast, they're not much better. Zhao was clearly just there to be a villain, Zuko was just a whiny brat and the extras themselves felt like they didn't even bother to read the script. The only actor who did try was the man who played Iroh, but even then his performance wasn't enough to save the film. And the action scenes? What a joke. Usually when there's a huge battle going on, I'm interested in it and want to see most of the action. In this one, I couldn't care less what happened to anyone, and it was just boring.Overall, this was not worth watching. If you were forced to watch this film and have no prior knowledge of the show let me assure you, it's great. If you haven't seen the TV series you should check it out. But stay as far away from this film as you can. It's not even worth the rental.",The Last Airbender
137,Targe,Horrific disaster filled with terrible acting and hokey fights!,2,2 December 2010,"I am really disappointed in Shylaman. I loved 'The Village', one of my favorite movies, how can the guy go from that to THIS??? What did he do - hire all his friends? The acting was CRINGE-WORTHY. It was literally PAINFUL to watch and listen to! And I do sympathize with the actors, as the lines were HORRIBLE. The ONLY saving grace was Shaun Toub, who did a serviceable job as the outwardly noble and nice, but DON'T GET HIM ANGRY uncle Iroh.The movie is so full of plot holes it is like a giant jagged cheese grater, constantly swinging across your face, scratching it...We have a dude who can make tornadoes and water balls, for example, yet he seems to KEEP GETTING CAPTURED, by lame-ass guys who have SPEARS. It's ridiculous. He was constantly swinging back and forth between willingly allowing himself to be captured one minute and kicking butt and fighting to the death the next. I couldn't keep track.Then he'd show up at a village, and do a 5 second prep talk and woah! Everyone suddenly realizes they can fight the evil fire guards, all ten of them, who are holding their entire village, who seem incapable of doing anything except standing around and posturing, and who completely suck at fighting when pressed.Then the movie finale - Avatar dude heads up on a wall and decides to use the OCEAN to defeat the evil fire dudes ships. Gee... he's in an ENTIRE CITY of water benders, and nobody thought of that??? COME ON!!! And they left all their torches burning!!! Which are used by fire benders! I can go on and on about the ridiculous lack of thinking in planning out the scenes and story in this movie, but it is the ACTING which does it in. Horrible to watch.I hope this movie dies with the one installment, as it should. When it ended, I was not, 'oh damn! I can't WAIT for the sequel! I was CHEERING. IT'S OVER!!!

140,pro_crustes,Twenty pounds of Katara in a five-pound bag.,7,17 July 2010,"My eight-year-old son and I love the animated series, so we eagerly awaited this movie. I saw it today without him, to decide if he'd like it. I think he would, because it shows what Aang and his friends might be like if they were real. Alas, where I had expected that MNS might depart too far from his source material, the first of his big problems seems to be that he stuck too close. Still, there is a surprising positive feature about this film that might make it a minor cult classic. More on that later.First, some math: the original was set in three seasons (""books""), and consisted of 20 episodes per season, at about 20+ minutes each (after you take out the commercials and the opening narration). That's 400 minutes. The film is only about 100 minutes, so if MNS was going to tell the same story, he'd have to have gone at least four times as fast. Pacing like that would have been absurd. Alas, he kept too much, while leaving out some of what made what he left as meaningful as it was in the original. For example, toward the end, one character must make a great sacrifice for the sake of the others. In the series, this was spread out over two installments, so it got 40 minutes to develop. Here, it just can't be given the same time, so all its poignancy is lost in what ends up feeling like a forced sub-plot item. And that happens a LOT in this film. Which leads to the second problem.The second problem is simply that if you haven't seen the original, you will have no hope of following this convoluted, summarized, narrated, series of set pieces. Not much better is that, if you HAVE seen the original, you're going to be infuriated over what's been left out. The sweetness of the original was largely in watching the slow, oh-so-familiar-to-us-grownups process of children becoming adults. Here, the characters don't really change much, though we do see evidence of progress in their skill sets; it's their level of maturity that seems static. And, speaking of children, we come to the third problem.The third problem is that the kids are adequate actors, but the script is mostly absurd, worst by far when the characters speaking its lines are the adults. Believe it or not, the quality of the acting appears to be almost perfectly inverse to the ages of the actors. It's almost as though MNS felt that he could make the young actors look better by having the older ones look bad. Dude, it wasn't necessary! All three young heroes are pretty good. Ringer, as Aang (and, yes, they all say ""Awng,"" or ""Ahng,"" or ""Ong,"" and that rhymes with ""Wrong""), is the weakest, but his slightly smoldering dead-pan actually works for a character coming to grips with being the very last of his kind, whose friends are all dead, who has to save the entire world, while multiple enemies are trying to destroy him, and, oh, yeah, while he is only twelve years old. I bought Ringer's Aang. Rathbone (not really a kid actor, at well over 20) was a pretty good Sokka (yup, it's ""SO-kah,"" rhymes with ""Mocha,"" and, no, I didn't order that). But Peltz as Katara (she gets to keep her name, yay!) was actually quite fine. And that brings us to the good part.The most positive thing about ""The Last Airbender"" is that it's actually mostly about The Last Southern Waterbender. Katara is the main character in this movie. And, while it gets a reliable 4.3-or-so from almost every demographic group, look at the breakdown on the IMDb voting details page. Women under 18 (you know, ""girls"") give it a 6.7. Not a high score, but substantially higher than every other age or gender. Once you see it, you'll know why. It's because of Katara, the fighter. Katara, the mother-figure. Katara, the leader. Katara, the brave, the strong, the compassionate, and the patient. She is every bit as much the hero of this film as is Aang, and he couldn't do what he does without her.There are some very, very good moments in this very, very uneven film. The plot holes and exposition lumps are ghastly. The breathless pacing is overwhelming. But, some of it is beautiful, like the scenes where Aang and Katara are practicing their waterbending forms together. Some is exciting, like the fight scenes that outdo ""Crouching Tiger"" by quite a bit. Some is sweet, or bittersweet, like the flashbacks to Aang's early years. But best of all is the hidden jewel of a story about a young girl who, it would seem, delivers on the hidden dreams of a lot of young girls. A solid character doing extraordinary things, perhaps as all young girls aspire to be and do. Seems like maybe Hollywood could learn a bit about an untapped market from this, and meet the wishes of many a member of the future ticket-buying adult public.If you haven't seen, or didn't like, the series, give this movie a 3 or 4. If you did see it and liked it, give it a 5 or 6. But if you have a daughter who still lives in your house, take her to see it. Out of respect for her and her peers, this 51-year-old father of his own little Aang will give it the same grade she probably will: 7.",The Last Airbender

142,silentcheesedude,"Not fantastic, but not terrible.",5,6 July 2010,"SO let's start with the bad: The movie just didn't have enough to make it great by any means. Much of the dialog was stiff, as was some of the acting. For a kid's movie, it was humorless. I saw the movie in 2D, but I heard that the 3D was awful, as it was originally intended to be a 2D. Don't try to compare it to other good movies such as perhaps Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. And of course, it will never be able to replace 61 episodes that made up the TV series, because much of the characterization and story line is missing.The good: The action was well-done for a PG rated movie, as were some special effects. I would at least compare it to some lite martial art movies. Without, umm... too many Asians.It's just not as bad as what people say it is... but
I would say skip it especially if you are an Airbender fan. This seems to be one of Shyamalan's crazy pet project.",The Last Airbender

Here, he does, but it is barely noticeable.Uncle Iroh is supposed to be funny and all, but the character in this movie was serious instead.Aang, in this movie, was pronounced ""Ung"" instead.I feel like I preferred different characters for this movie as well, but at the same time, it depends if they have time. The characters here are great, don't get me wrong.The ending felt like there would have been a sequel, but I am glad there wasn't one.M. Night Shyamalan is a great director, and I am big fan of his movie Split, Unbreakable, and Sixth Sense! This movie was not what I expected.Is it worth the watch? Not really.

144,javi-y-se-acabo,The Last Shyamalan Moviebender,3,23 May 2017,"Well this is movie it's not the worst I have ever seen but it's neither the best. I haven't seen the original series but I'm pretty sure they are by far superior to this. This is just nonsense story with very bad actingIt tells the story of two brothers Katara (Nicola Peltz) and Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) who one day find a little boy called Aang (Noah Ringer) who is the Avatar who will bring balance into the world. The story it's not boring but it doesn't make any sense. They go from one place to another with no reason and some of the characters did some things that made me wonder if a normal person would do such things (the answer is no). If you're on the ice, you don't hit it with some weapon and then you get surprised by it breaking down. This is just one of the few examples of the silly things this has. The actors, well, they were very unbelievable, but I specially dislike Dev Patel and the little kid, who was supposed to shine but was very awkward at acting.In the technical aspects, Shyamalan delivers some great camera work at parts but it pales in comparison with his previous movies. Also the dance-fight thing I didn't get it at all, I don't know if it's from the original series but, despite some parts were filmed in an awesome way, it didn't make sense. But this has also some good things. For example, the cinematography was amazing and I think they recreated very well all the environments and landscapes with also some amazing visuals. And of course, what M. Night Shyamalan would be without his musical genius and frequent collaborator, James Newton Howard, who delivers one of the best scores of his career with such an epic score that at times, made the movie feel great, but it didn't worked, expect in The Wave scene, at the moment Flows Like Water starts to play it gives the movie the awesome epic feel that it should have had.In general the movie has some great visuals and perfect soundtrack but it doesn't save the horrible story and acting but it's still a bit entertaining.",The Last Airbender

What happened to her healing abilities. And why does Aang controls the avatar state with much ease at the end of the movie ??? He never did learn to control his avatar state. At present his avatar state is triggered by anger depression. Most of all why Aang is depressed all the times. He should be lively and smiling all the time. Why Katara is not mothering all the time ??? And, why Soaka is so serious ??? Shall I keep going ???A film that had so much potential and so much life and had a chance to be different from others but only to be spoiled by M.Night Shyamalan and Paramount Studios. Yes, I blame the studios as well as they are the ones producing this film and failed very deeply to produce it up to the satisfaction of the audience. The best advice that came be given is better stop now itself before doing anymore damage to the remaining to seasons. Or let them bring in a new director who can understand the entire show and reboot the entire franchise from scratch and pay attention to details this time at least.

153,jared79,The best bits were when no-one was talking.,3,14 April 2021,"Let's start at 0 stars and run through the list of elements of the movie and see how many stars we can get.Screenwriting-when your source material is a very good cartoon loved by many people, you should be able to come up with a decent script. Alas, this movie doesn't have it. I will admit that adapting 20 episodes into a movie would be hard. But the movie is just over an hour and half, they could have added and hour on to solve a lot of problem, but it probably would have created more considering other elements of this movie. Star=NoCasting-A bunch of white actors playing technically mainly Asian characters, fail. But what makes it worse is the acting is so bad. A few actors manage to do ok. But the 3 main kids. They are so far removed from the characters from the tv show that it's just bad casting. Yes the kid playing Aang can fight and fight well, but that's as far as it goes. Star=NoCharacter development-there is none. I guess cramming 20 episodes of exposition into 100mins is more important than any character development, accept it's not. You just don't care about them at all. Character development is everything. Star=NoMusic-Finally, something good about this movie. The soundtrack is excellent. Star=YesAdaption-I only just finished watching season 1 of Avatar today and thought I should watch the movie as I knew it was based on season 1 of the show. It's just awful. The adaption is shockingly bad. Yes, as I said before. Cramming 20 episodes into a movie is hard. But half the movie is the first 18 episodes and the second half is the final 2 episodes. It was so disjointed and skipped over some many important stories which they covered in short exposition. But unless you have seen the tv series, I doubt you could follow along. Oh and don't get me started on the pronunciation of the characters names. All the humour was left out too. Sokka is funny in the cartoon. He's annoying in the movie. Star=NoPacing-again, terrible. Rush through the first half, focus on the second half. No time to pause and contemplate what's happening. Got to get to the North Pole. Star=NoActing-bad, wooden, unemotional. Star=0Direction-Shyamalan why do you disappoint so much. You had good movies in the past. But you took a much loved cartoon and dragged it through the sewer. Shyamalan couldn't direct he way out of a paper bag. He makes George Lucas look good for SW Ep 1. Star=NoSpecial effects-pretty good. Not perfect, but worthy of a star. Star=YesSet/Costume design. Ok, so I bundled these two together. But they were good here as well. Very close to the cartoon. I'll give them a star for this. Star=YesSo there you have it 3 stars. I've given lower scores. Mainly to movies that push their Woke agenda. There is none of that here, but it was made 11 years ago, before woke.Like I said, the best parts are the parts where they don't talk. The action is pretty good, the music is great. Just cut out the talking and you might have a good movie.",The Last Airbender
154,morkulv_athferion,A 80 minutes summary of the cartoon,2,8 October 2010,"Just when you thought M. Night couldn't sink any deeper, he grabs the license of a popular animé-influenced Nickelodeon-cartoon and turns it into a 80 minute long turd. I liked the cartoon for bringing character development, martial arts, and good story-telling back on TV. M. Night however, discards every one of those elements and creates a product that resembles the cartoon very shallow and tells the story in such a messy and incoherent way that it will leave people that never watched the cartoon mind-boggled.The story follows that of the cartoon somewhat, in the sense that M. Night took the biggest plotpoints and threw it together. He forgets however that the story is not about the final destination, but about the road to get there (how is that for an epic fortune-cookie lesson?). This results in the characters being completely flat, and you never feel for any of the characters portrayed in this movie because it is simply too busy with running through all the cartoon's chapters.Also a big complaint is the fact that M. Night changed a few things, the most obvious thing being the pronunciation of the character's names (i.e. 'Sokka' is pronounced 'Soaka' in this movie). M. Night said in reply that he wanted the pronunciation of the names to be true to Asian pronunciation. Avatar however, is a American cartoon, nót Asian, so just stick to the damn source-material and stop making excuses. Another change from the cartoon is the fact that only the higher-class fire- benders can conjure up fire. Not only is this ridiculous, but why did he change that? Was there not enough cash available for the special-effects otherwise? I also have to say, its kinda hard imagining the fire-nation being this powerful and fearful army lead by an evil dictator this way. Is it a requirement to always keep a lit candle nearby when you sign up for the fire-nation army?The acting in this movie is completely dreadful. Especially the kid who plays Aang is so uninspired and dull, it looks like he's doing a try-out for a school-musical. The rest of the cast are equally forgettable and they don't resemble the characters from the cartoon very well. The last thing that makes this movie horrible are the fight-scenes. The fight-scenes were very memorable in the cartoon combining all sorts of elements from different kinds of martial arts. In this movie, the fight-scenes are almost reduced to slapstick.Believe it or not, but I set out watching The Last Airbender with an open mind. I have read the negative reviews, but because I liked the cartoon, I wanted to give this movie a chance nevertheless. If there ever was such a thing as being able to un-watch a movie, this would be at the top of my list together with Uwe Boll's Alone in the Dark. If you intend to watch this movie as a fan of the cartoon with a similar mindset like I had, then take it from me, trust the reviews and stay clear of this tripe. We just have to hope that M. Night doesn't get his hands on the sequel to the cartoon which is being developed these days.",The Last Airbender
155,klchu,Shyamalan ruined everyone's hard work,2,2 January 2011,"I have to agree with all of the negative reviews, and I have to say that all of the blame goes to Shyamalan. It's his script and his direction. Good actors can do a bad job with bad directing. Here we have young and inexperienced actors who appear to have gotten no direction at all.If you haven't seen it yet, watch the deleted scene where a messenger gives the Fire Lord some news. That messenger cannot possibly be a real actor, maybe he was the caterer or something. You will hear better acting from a production assistant at a table reading. And while it is a deleted scene, it's typical of the entire movie's acting. All of these actors can't all be this bad, so the cause must be Shyamalan. I don't know what he did, or didn't do, but he didn't seem to care what the actors said or did. Maybe he tried to save money and just did one take of everything, or just filmed the rehearsals. Did Shyamalan even watch the original show? I don't think he did. How else can we explain why all of the names are mispronounced? However, the worst thing Shyamalan did was change the essence of the story. While I realize that condensing over 400 minutes of story into a single movie requires some sacrifice, there is no excuse for the things he did. Katara is sidelined to a minor character, Aang is just a wimp and Sokka is nothing. None of them have any charm or humor.Shyamalan also added a strange ""no violence"" theme. Why? The Avatar can't hurt anyone? Since when? No Ocean spirit? No ships sinking? I don't think a single person, other than Zhau and Yue, died in the entire battle.The ending in the city was also terrible. I didn't like how everyone bowed down. What was with that? Even Katara, Sokka *and* the Fire Nation soldiers! Just a bad ending to a badly made movie.",The Last Airbender
156,lleeric,Great Remake,8,29 June 2010,"I saw the screening of this movie with my sister who is 6 years old and it was an entertaining movie. It was a very good remake and i thought it was better then the cartoon version. The casts were very good and the 3-d effects were eye poppy. This is one of M Night Shyalman's best movie since Sixth Sense. I recommend this movie to everyone. It will be good but read more other reviews before watching it. Also, watch it in 3-D. It's gonna keep you on the edge of your seat and you'll never want to leave the movie. there were some sad moments and action moments and some funny moments.

Finally the day has come.Ummm... What? I'm sorry watching this with a straight face is completely bad. It had to be M. Night Shylaman to ruin a good series. I am 19 years old and I really love Avatar: The last airbender, the TV series. This is not what everyone envisioned.The kids haven't had a long time acting career, so they're acting was pretty bad, so I'll give them a break, because is M. Night's fault they acted horribly. Also the filmed was so badly directed and such horrible script, it was laughable. The names pronunciation shouldn't have been changed it was horrible.As an adaptation, the story was way too rushed to keep up with the whole season. Practically none of the actors possessed they're personalities according to the original story.The only thing everyone can agree with is that the special visual effects were great, and the fighting scenes as well. Unfortunately this doesn't make up for everything else which was terrible.But on the other hand, I had a good time laughing because of the bad directing and of course, the funny and stupid dialogs the movie had. I found myself enjoying this film, it's the year's number one comedy. So yeah I recommend it for anyone who wants to have a good time laughing at writers and directors.

159,davesawesomeinbox,The haters are fans of the cartoon and it is actually a good movie!,10,4 December 2019,"(no spoilers) I rate it 7/10.
I watched this movie having never seen the cartoon. I knew nothing of air bisons, water bending, the characters, or story. I went in completely blind. This movie was my first ever introduction to the Avatar world and all the wonders it holds! So I loved it! While walking out of the theater I was about to tell my friend how awesome that was; but my friend was a fan of the cartoons and started going on about how he hated the movie for this reason and that reason. I felt sorry for him that he failed to see the beauty that I had just seen because of some predetermined expectations that he had of it. Before watching the movie even, he had expressed that others had told him that it would be bad. I wonder if their negative words were like ink splattered across his vision, also making him watch it with a critical eye just looking for anything and everything to hate about it.
Even now, years later, when Avatar is spoken of; most people speak only negative of the movie like it is some mark of shame in the Avatar franchise, even like it is a word that should not be uttered. If only everyone could've had the pleasure of seeing this movie with the lack of prejudice that I was fortunate to have upon first watching it.",The Last Airbender

The movie unable to provide the details and background that the three-season series does and it's missing two things: 1) the humorous dialogue - I really missed that! - and 2) the Scooby / Buffy vibe of the group. I've convinced my husband to watch the series with me, so this movie did provide background. The kids are amazingly similar to the animated characters, the message is the same, but it was just an intro to the show. Enjoy it for what it is! Then watch the animated series. It's amazing!",The Last Airbender
162,Pilsung89,Talk about an epic fail.,2,8 July 2010,"This is completely atrocious. I have not left a movie theater so disappointed since I saw Dragonball Evolution. I had a feeling this movie wouldn't work, but I didn't think it would be this bad. The racially inaccurate casting is the smallest problem of the film. The big problems are poor writing, below average acting, and a rushed plot.Okay, the first thing I will mention is that the movie is way too rushed and tries to cram to much. This film tries to take all the plot points from the first book of the series (which is 20 episodes long), and capture it all in about 90 minutes. That just doesn't work. This should have been more like 2 and a half hours long if not just split into two movies. The result is that nothing is explained enough, and the viewer has no time to enjoy anything, Every 5 minutes the movie is moving to another plot point. No time is taken for the story to deepen, and characters never get to develop real personalities or relations to other characters. Katara, one of my favorite characters from the series, gets little screen time and never really establishes a relationship to Aang. The overall result of rushing and cramming the plot is that the story is shallow and not engaging. Without time to let anything sink and or develop it's not interesting at all. Bottom line, the film should have been expanded.Next up, the acting is not good. None of the actors portray the personalities that their cartoon counterparts did. M. Knight Shamylan says that he picked the actor for Aang because he could really portray Aang's character. This is not true at all. In the series Aang is a lighthearted and reluctant hero. In the movie he's portrayed as serious and strong-willed and never hesitant. The Actress for Katara is okay but has too little screen to to develop her character. The actor for Sokka portrays him as serious and witty, but in the series he's a sarcastic source of comic relief. You could say the actors themselves are doing an okay job, but their characters are badly butchered in the script. To make matters worse is the bad dialogue. Yes, this is a kids movie, but some of the lines sound like they're written for 4 year olds.To top it all off, the movie was made into 3D at the last second. Why? to make money. My cousin convinced me to pay an extra 3 dollars per ticket to see it in 3D. It was not worth it. 90% of the movie doesn't even have 3D effects, and what 3D the movies does have is forgettable. The best 3D effect came from the ads before the film. It was obviously just a last minute decision to milk more money from viewers.The only good things I can say about the movie is that the effects and fights are good. They're not great, just good. In the end the story is incredibly rushed, the characters are all wrong, and the deepest emotional part is a 5 second scene between Aang and Katara. Should they decide to make the sequels they've already planned they need to expand the movies and get people who actually know about the series.",The Last Airbender
163,ridiculonius,"Simply begs the question, ""WHY?""",1,30 November 2010,"Why?Why, oh, why did this have to be so terrible?There is no reason why The Last Airbender had to be a bad movie. It had both a devoted fan-base and around 30 hours of incredible material to draw from (though the main plot structure was based on the first 10 hours). The original show covered all the elements (pardon the pun) that the movie had to have; plot, back-stories, character development/relationships, and a relatively in-depth world including basic religion(s), cultures, cosmology, and even flora/fauna. So why did the film fail? As a huge fan of the show (I've seen every single episode and love them all to death), I'll try to look at this from two perspectives; that of a fan, and that of a non-fan who saw the film out of context. From both perspectives, I think it's safe to say that The Last Airbender was downright horrible. Why? I'll answer that question with some of my own.Fan-Perspective: - WHY the ""racebending""? When the source material already includes a huge amount of racial diversity (albiet with strong East-Asian influences), there is no excuse whatsoever for changing that diversity to suit the director. WHY the mispronunciation of names? I appreciate that Shymalan wanted to honour the ""correct"" pronunciation of the names Aang, Sokka, Iroh, etc., but when the names were pronounced a certain way for the entire series, you can't change them. If he's Ah-ng in the show instead of Oh-ng, that's how the creators wanted the character's name pronounced, that's how the fans know him, and it wasn't Shymalan's place to change that.WHY only 103 minutes (including the credits)? When condensing 10 hours of material down into a watchable film length, it simply doesn't make sense to make it THAT short. I don't know how much material ended up on the cutting room floor, but in what reality does it seem logical to turn a sweeping epic of a show into a visual summary? It was as if Shymalan wrote a synopsis of the first season and called it a screenplay. If they had extended the time, think of all the material they could've added, or all the things they could've expanded on and developed!WHY no Kyoshi Warriors or Avatar Roku? I can see why they would cut the Kyoshi Warriors for the moment (since they really don't come into play until the second season/sequel), but I can't help but wonder how they're going to integrate it. And there's simply no excuse for turning the spirit of Avatar Roku into a spirit-dragon. It makes no sense, and serves no purpose other than annoying the fans. WHY make bending so... difficult? In the show, benders can manipulate their native element with short and simple movements - the more advanced they get, the more natural and effortless it becomes. In the film it takes 5 earthbenders to move 1 rock. It wasn't even that big of a rock. Like the replacement of Avatar Roku with a spirit-dragon, there's just no good reason for doing it. WHY change the Fire Nation's motivation for capturing Aang? In the film, Gran-Gran (not that they call her that in the movie, or anything) says that the inhabitants of the Fire Nation doesn't believe in the Spirit World, and that they were afraid of the Avatar's sway on the people because of his connection to the Spirits. This is complete and unabashed bull-crap. In the show, it is made perfectly clear from the beginning that the only reason that the Fire Nation wants to capture Aang is because his purpose is to keep peace and balance between the Nations/Elements; therefore he is the only single entity capable of rallying the conquered peoples and overthrowing the empire. The Spirits have nothing to do with their motivation, and it was a stupid move on Shymalan's part to make that the case.And Non-Fan Perspective: - WHY the bad acting? No matter which way you look at it, the cast of TLA sucks. All racebending aside, the only decent/good actors were Dev Patel as Prince Zuko, Shaun Toub as Gen. Iroh, and Cliff Curtis as Fire Lord Ozai, and they didn't have nearly enough screen time (this doesn't mean they were right for the parts, but, hey, this is non-fan perspective, right?). WH... well, this one is more of a WHAT? As in WHAT the hell just happened? I could follow the film because I know the show. But, had I not seen the series, I would've been pretty lost. Katara's constant narration doesn't help much, and the way the plot progresses is weird and a bit choppy. Even I was a bit confused after a few sequences - the whole ""starting a mini-uprising in the Earth Kingdom"" montage left me completely disoriented.So, I think it can be agreed - The Last Airbender was awful. The sad thing is, it didn't have to be. With a re-write and re-casting, this movie might've been saved - but, unfortunately, we are left with nothing but the table scraps of an amazing show that deserved a much better tribute.",The Last Airbender

I enjoyed where it succeeded so much that I was easily able to forgive where it dropped the ball.I must admit that most reviews are accurate, but it's really up to you and what you expect. I struggled through some of the movie as the characters seemed to be staring at each other and reading their lines. Some of the close-ups used made it uncomfortable, even. But that was the only thing that made it feel like a Shyamalan movie.When it came to the visuals I had no complaints. As someone who loves visuals, special effects and the such, there were plenty of creative moves and fun effects to fully satisfy me.I came out of this movie loving it and hoping they make the sequels. Let Shyamalan do the visuals and battles and someone else do the acting.Visuals: 10 out of 10, easy! Story: 6 -the explored as much of the Airbender world as possible, both physically and philosophically, in the movie time.

The brother and sister combo starts it off with fake, bad timing, exchanges that never improves. I was watching and hoping that it was just a pair of extras that we would never see again...but they never left. The biggest failure of the whole thing was the decision to cast the worst child actor to play the main role. I think he got the part because he was Asian and had a shaved head.

It has so much meaning & heart! Great action & an incredible storyline w/ I clear ending. I never leave that bad of reviews! Because I can not imagine how hard it is to make a film it's really a miracle they get made at all! But What M. Night did here was just plain disrespectful! It's like he had no love for the characters or the story! I mean the main three characters don't talk that much. Idk if it's becuz he wanted to protect the audience from there bad acting! But the tv show is sooooo funny! Sokka is a riot. The kid playing him in the movie never even cracks a joke. In the show they say Aang pronounced (Ang) in the movie they keep saying Ong it's insane he's the lead character and u can't get his name right!Now I know they r on a budget but hardly anyone is bending in this movie! And when it does happen it's super slow & pathetic looking which I could get over if the editing wasn't so choppy & all over the place.I also know u can't do everything but if they would have taken longer on the script made the movie a bit longer and focused on all the spiritual & energy & destiny stuff it wouldn't sound like Mumbo jumbo!& when he sees the dragon for the second time and it tells him it's not the avatars place to hurt ppl! That is his upbringing that has made him think that! The avatar is bringing balance to the world sometimes there has to be a little pain! I did not like that a dragon is telling him that!I could go on forever about how terrible this film is. It's completely disrespectful to the fans & the two creators of this beautiful epic world! & it was a total money grab from M. Night! Nothing can ever turn out this bad if u have a love for the material! Thank god the two creators r doing a live action avatar for Netflix and they can fix this mess! & even if they can't have all the awesome battles & bending becuz of budget it will still b great becuz they know how to right great conversations. Comedic & drama & they can build even more on what they did in avatar & Korra! So if ur a fan of the show just don't even watch this u will just get mad!There is one cool part & it's when Aang escapes lord zukkos boat at the start!,The Last Airbender

I clearly need to say REBOOT now before all is lost. What were they thinking when they agreed to show this movie? The effects were only second rate at best.

169,Nyx_Selene,Shouldn't have been made at all,2,19 April 2012,"I've never seen the cartoon, so my review is based solely on the movie – which I thankfully saw with a Rifftrax commentary. I don't think I would have seen the whole thing otherwise. Spoilers ahead, by the way.This movie's world is divided up into four nations: Fire, Earth, Air and Water. From what the movie shows me, I can conclude that the Fire Nation are all Indian warriors and douchebags, the Earth Nation are peaceful Asians, in touch with nature, the Air Nomads were Asian monks in touch with nature and the Water Nation are a peaceful Caucasian/Eskimo mix found in icy territories.The story is that the Avatar – who's role in the world is to communicate with the spirit world; to what end I'm not sure about – went missing 100 years ago. During this time the Fire Nation has started a war against all other nations, but I'm not clear on why. They knew that the Avatar would be born into the Air Nomads, so they slaughtered all the Air Nomads (10+ years AFTER the Avatar was born). I can't really figure out how, since the airbending Avatar sort of kicks the asses of all firebenders, and it baffles me why they'd do it, since no-one later tries to kill the Avatar himself. ""There's no point. You'd just be reborn again,"" is their explanation. So why were they killing the Air Nomads to begin with? Was it to prevent him from learning airbending? No, I think not. He was already trained, and it's also apparently fully possible to learn bending from scrolls, that seem to be kept here and there.The Avatar, Aang, is found frozen in ice by an asthmatic, naive girl called Katara, and her dorky brother Sokka (these were the first impressions I got of the two), and they bring him to their village in the southern Water Nation. No sooner do they do this, than the outcast prince Zuko from the Fire Nation comes ashore and threatens to torch the village if Aang doesn't come along to his ship (some metal monstrosity spewing out thick black smoke, ensuring the Fire Nation's position as hate-worthy enemy of nature). Aang escapes with the help of Katara, Sokka and a flying creature, and goes back to his Air Temple, only to find everyone he once knew and loved dead. No time to waste, though; onwards, to start freeing villages in the Earth Nation! Aang is once again captured by the Fire Nation, but this time by the king's constantly confused-looking commander Zhao. This must all along have been known to Zuko, because mere hours later, he shows up in disguise and frees Aang. Zhao of course suspects that the masked warrior was indeed the prince, and goes on to whine to the king about the prince's incompetence, despite the fact that said prince just thwarted the commander's entire company.And speaking of icy territories, our three main characters now move on to the northern Water Kingdom, ruled by a white-haired young princess. Sokka and the princess become friends (and more) right away, or so we're told by Katara's narration, and that's that for relationship development. The Fire Nation soon shows up – Zhao to start a war, Zuko to sort of fly under the radar and kidnap Aang himself, with the help of his uncle Iroh – a former general in the king's army. Zhao's invasion of the city starts with a soldiers-on-battlement scene lifted straight from the battle at Helm's Deep, and continues with a lizard riding scene cut almost directly from Star Wars III. This didn't ruin anything for me, however, because the movie wasn't that good to begin with.Some stuff happens later: Zhao kills the Moon Spirit (which is a koi). Even though Iroh could have stopped him, he doesn't, save trying to talk him out of it. The princess sacrifices her own life to bring the koi back, making it possible for her people to win against the Fire Nation. But in the end, Aang is the one who sends the Fire Nation running, and by this point Zhao has died in battle (sort of) and Zuko and Iroh have fled the scene.The movie as a whole comes across as amateurish, rushed and packed with plot-holes and disturbingly close up close-ups. The special effects are okay, I guess, but the movie is still full of impossibly slow elemental attacks, that no-one nevertheless manages to avoid, and it's never hinted as to why everyone needs to do an entire martial arts exhibit to ""bend"". The acting is all around unimpressive and most of the dialog is cringe-worthy.Edit: Have now seen the cartoon, and will from here on never think about this abomination of a movie again. Recommend Shyamalan be whipped from here to Aberdeen for this crime against cinematic history.",The Last Airbender
170,wolverinesforever,Well... that was an experience,2,1 July 2010,"...in how NOT to make a movie.I went to see this film at 7:30 today at the request of a friend. I decided to give it a go. What could go wrong? Admitted, the trailers hadn't impressed me too much, but I did at least like the visuals, and the concept of four nations based on elements living in an alternate world (I have not seen the original cartoon, by the way). And while Shyamalan may have had a slump recently in the thriller genre, perhaps this would get his creative mojo working again.Turns out he just made a 100-minute endurance test.I'm not sure how to put my thoughts together, because so many went through my head as I was watching this. I guess I should start by saying that while I was watching this, I almost never cared for the characters. The film starts, and we're immediately dumped into this situation of a brother and a sister (Katara and Sokka) who suddenly find this ""Avatar,"" a person with the power to unite the four elemental nations, in peace. They take this Avatar to their village, but no sooner does that happen than the evil Fire Nation comes and kidnaps this Avatar. The brother and sister then decide they must save him- Let me stop right there. Are you noticing something? Because what I noticed at that point was that I wasn't sure why I should be caring. Who are these people? What are their lives like? Introductory words and title cards can only do so much. And so it goes on for the rest of the movies. Characters like the Grandmother and Princess Yue only appear to advance the plot (and the ""romance"" between Yue and Sokka is very awkwardly handled). Aang's (the Avatar's) powers aren't fully explained either. What's with the dragon in his dreams? Why, when he gets into a fight with Zuko (one of the members of the Fire Nation), does he choose to wrestle with him instead of, you know, BLOWING HIM AWAY WITH AIR? I could go on with the questions, but then I would be creating a laundry list. Suffice so say, too many things in this picture aren't well explained. Actually, there is one more thing I must ask: why is the Fire Nation kind of tame? I'm sorry, but I wasn't very scared by these guys. They're called the Fire Nation, yet they use spears most of the times for weapons. When they do use fire, it doesn't seem to cause much damage (the city at the end of the climax, despite being under heavy siege, seems quite intact). Not even Dev Patel, the best thing about 2008's ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" can save them.Which now brings me to the acting and the dialogue. Bluntly put, it's not good. I can't think of any worthwhile performances. And the dialogue the characters say to each other is frequently stilted and unnatural. Considering how strong both elements were in ""The Sixth Sense,"" it is very disappointing to see that M. Night Shyamalan has seemingly lost mastery of this.Are there any positives? Well, I suppose I liked looking at the movie. The camera likes to linger on the landscape, the production values are pretty good, and the special effects sometimes impress. We see wind blow people away like rag dolls, water suddenly rise and freeze around objects, and a giant tidal wave at the end that acts, not as a force for destruction, but for order and peace. Unfortunately, more attention should have been put to where it would matter the most: the screenplay. I'm one hour removed from watching this movie, and already I'm having trouble remember what the point of it was. Thank goodness I did not pay extra money to watch this in 3-D (I have a feeling that, after Paramount saw this movie and realized its lack of quality, they decided at the last second to convert this so they could try to make back their budget). Final verdict? This isn't worth your time in 2-D or 3-D. Not unless you want to learn how not to make a movie. And when you do see this, study and learn. Remember to set up your characters and story. Remember to give a purpose to every event and not have your plot go around your circles. Remember to give your characters agency, and not have them just act as plot points. Remember to make your audience care for your story.",The Last Airbender
171,blandiefam,From 6th Sense to Nonsense,1,29 November 2010,"I guess being of a certain racial make up is how directors decide casting. Spike Lee likes to use Blacks, Scorsese uses Italians, Chan uses Asians. Why can't Shamalan use East Indians? I guess we should all accept this and just enjoy the story telling. But!.. What if the story telling is just plain bad? Then there is nothing left but a bunch relatives of the director jumping around reciting badly written lines. This is what the Last Airbender turned out to be. I am not sure how long it took to construct such a wonderfully spun story entitled, ""The Sixth Sense"" but it seems as if he took a fraction of that time and had 3-D added to not only bore us but give us headaches too. I have seen very little of the series but my kids were angry after watching the movie. It seems that Ed Wood might have done a better job. If M. Night wants to keep using certain races of people to correct the already established characters, he needs to use a screenplay written based upon an East Indian or European White ethnic tale. It was an insult to see such a lavishly told cartoon reduced to an off off off Broadway rehearsal. I hope that he will be able to redeem himself with a great movie. I guess he doesn't realize that some of the best stories are the small ones about Blacks, Italians, Asians,Indians or other ethnic groups, IE ""Slum Dog Millionaire"".People wonder how a major studio could have given him 150 million to do this movie. They don't understand that when an adaptation is done from a former cartoon series, the story was so clearly illustrated. that even a child could have done a better job.",The Last Airbender
172,Incendid,You've done it again Shymalan,3,22 September 2013,"Ciaran: The last airbender perhaps the worse adaption movie ever. The movie starts with Kotara and Sokka, two children from the Sourthern Water Tribe. Then after hunting and failing to find anything the children find themselves looking down to ice, finding a sphere of air, containing our hero and main character Aang, the avatar and last airbender. Aside from the horrifying CGI, the movie suffers greatly from the lack of emotion and the poorly written script. The duologue in some scenes seems forced and unnatural and when this isn't happening, the duologue is just there to feed out the almost hurtfully boring storyline, that Shyamalan thinks he can present in one movie, he could have possibly cut the three books into six movies. The actors do not match the characters from the original TV show, the fire nation in Shyamalan's version seemed to be Indian whilst in the show they resemble more of the Japanese culture. Basically, in a sentence, Shyamalan's version had an a-b story, boring duologue, incorrect characters, bad acting, incorrect lore and horrifying CGI. 3/10 Jacob: Most of Shymalan's recent films have been laughably bad and this is one is particularly painful with only a few unintentionally funny moments. I have to say, of all the big screen adaptations, this is one of the worst. Changes are necessary when adapting but all the changes made in this film from the original television series don't make any sense and are either pointless or convoluted. The acting is notably poor especially from our lead characters who are terribly written and over-dramatic. I think that's how this film could be described over-dramatic, stupid, poorly acted, terribly written, cheap and the most painfully straight forward storytelling I have ever seen. Excess information is unnecessarily given to us instead of trying to develop characters. There is so much exposition it makes the movie feel incredibly rushed but all the other bad aspects of the film make the viewing feel like it has gone for 3 hours when it clearly states that this movie is 99 minutes long. I won't begin on the differences between the original series and this movie because there is so many obvious and tedious mistakes (such as pronunciation of the names e.g. Aang is pronounced ""ung"" in this movie). The effects are sometimes noteworthy but it mostly looks fake especially the p*ss-poor bending skills and that flying bison thing (which uses stock sound effects from Jurassic park 1 and 2). Note much to say other than it is just a Shymalan movie... a very terrible one. 3/10",The Last Airbender
173,patboldt,The Worst Shyamalan Movie and a Disgraceful Adaptation,1,17 March 2018,"Oh boy, here we go, the poster alone should have been a red flag. Even the damn poster looks depressing. And what's going on there anyway? Eleven from Stranger Things using Harry Potter magic to move blue fire? Saying that is being extremely generous. The movie starts with no emotion beyond the somewhat decent introduction which bears the closest resemblance to the TV show. It dies pretty fast. There's no energy, no enthusiasm from the actors, no nothing. We have characters like Sokka who is pronounced ""Soak-ah"" and looks like Anakin from Episode 2, or perhaps Damian Wayne on a diet. Everybody else looks like either some generic white person or a generic Indian person, and it's distracting as all hell. Whitewashing is already controversial in even good movies, and this movie just proves that it is still very much a thing. And since the actors themselves are terrible, it only makes the whole experience worse. But the one fatal flaw with this movie is the storytelling. It doesn't seem like it would be that hard, but the writing is mutilated by Shyamalan and made atrocious. There is no way I can describe it, the only way to understand it to watch it, and I fricken dare you. The first problem is that most of the story is exposition as one thing is explained without anything actually shown and then followed up with more explanation. Didn't these morons ever hear about the rule of ""show don't tell?"" The dialogue spoken by the characters themselves goes against all common sense when it comes to writing; even George Lucas wouldn't be able to write this. They don't speak fluently or with natural emotion, instead, we get the droning uninspiring lame dialogue that doesn't embody how people feel but rather what they think and even then it's only what's plainly obvious. Try listening this for hours without ever managing to laugh or smile once. There's not enough substance to keep you entertained before you simply have to acknowledge that the writing is terrible! And when the storytelling even ""attempts"" to replicate the Last Airbender it not only looks cheesy but it looks stupid. The TV show elements look dumb and nothing even looks remotely natural. Beyond that, I can't describe how stilted and boring the storytelling is. It is so awkward, so uninspired and so meaningless that I honestly thought that this movie was some sort of prank made by a YouTuber! That is completely inexcusable when the director has clearly proven that he can make good movies when he doesn't have his head up his ass! You have better luck turning the Super Mario Bros movie into a political drama!Some of the worst adaptations to ever exist include the Animal Farm cartoon, as well as movies that we have recognized as distinct failures. Examples include Daredevil (2003), Land of the Lost (2009), The Cat in the Hat remake (2003), Dragonball Evolution (2009), any of the Fantastic Four movies, Inspector Gadget (1999), and I believe that Catwoman (2004) was regarded as the worst adaptation of all time. But now that I've seen The Last Airbender, this takes the cake. It's hard to compare because they're different types of adaptations. I'll say that for a TV show to movie adaptation THIS IS THE WORST I'VE SEEN YET! That is one hell of an accomplishment.The Last Airbender is also beyond any doubt the worst Shyamalan movie I have ever seen. Do not watch this movie, there is nothing to enjoy. If I could give it 0 stars I would. The only thing I liked were some of the visuals, otherwise, I didn't like a damn thing. And for those who like the TV show, don't even think about watching this. There's nothing to enjoy and you will only end up disappointed.",The Last Airbender

Try infusing the source material with ineptitude and lack of vision, and this film is the result. The direction from the once promising director M. Night shows us nothing. Characters are neither developed nor interesting, the aimless story is not threaded in any cohesive manner, the acting is abysmal, and the cinematography is ugly and fake.

As a huge fan of the original Nickelodeon series it was for sure a big task not to hate the movie already after the first 20 minutes. Shyamalan robbed all the fun elements, the lightheartedness and the humor to create a grim fantasy drama that takes itself a little bit to serious. Than there was the misspelling of the original names, that was for sure not necessary. The 3-D conversion was bad. It would have better stayed 2D but vivid and colorful. The dialogs where wooden, so was some acting, but that was not the actors guilt, as they just followed that weak script. But still: it was not an awful movie. It was not even that bad. After rushing through the first events, it focused on the big water bender battle and that was the moment, when I finally connected a little bit to the story and the characters. Also the 3D effects seemed a little better in the second movie half. All together not masterpiece and everybody who loves the original needs a very open mind to approach this film, but still Im looking very much forward to a possible sequel.

182,noway234-1,What the heck just happened?,1,2 July 2010,"I will sit through a lot of crap and like it, heck most of the movies I own and love are ones that any sane person would consider crap... here's the difference, I can understand that crap.This movie is barely understandable, not because the actors are mumbling or the speakers sucked (In fact the sound was fantastic, I could hear every badly worded monologue and every misplaced pause). The reason that this movie sucked was that it was just plain old impossible to follow, maybe you need to take some kind of hallucinogenic drug to follow it.Now I'll admit I never watched the cartoon, I went to see this movie because some friends of mine wanted to go but any good adaptation of a TV show or novel should be accessible to someone who has never see the source material. This wasn't, I knew as I was watching it that there were moments in there that you might be able to follow if you were a fan of the show but everyone else was screwed.Plus there were some things that just were flat out stupid, a girl see's something under the ice that looks scary and so she smashes the ice without any motivation? Give me a break. The princesses hair looked like an uncircumcised penis, seriously if you see it there's a shot where her hair looks like a penis... proof that Shyamalan really was screwing the audience? Oh and of course the final battle against the fire nation where at one point someone said something like ""When the bells ring, put the fires out to help weaken the fire nation"" and so the battle comes, the bells ring... and there are still lit flames everywhere!!! I mean come on you don't announce your battle plan and then do the exact opposite.Oh and by the way, fish are friends not gods.All in all I shuddered through most of this movie, I'd go to M.

I understand the racial casting issue is causing some anger, but good grief. There are some truly horrible movies out there, such as ""where the wild things are"", but this is not one of them.

185,theblackscythe,The absolute worst. An insult.,1,23 September 2014,"I despise this film. Basically that's the gist of this review. I adore the source material so I may be considered biased, however I have watched this from non-fans of the show and the reaction was similar. Not a single element in this mess works, not a single idea comes to fruition. So let's begin the burning.The acting is atrocious. I cannot come up with any adjectives to properly describe how bad it is. It feels like a school play, or an April fools prank. Lines are delivered with no conviction, emotion or confidence and there is almost never any expression Only Dev Patel is able to maintain some dignity in this, and even he would be considered mediocre in any competent film. All the personality and depth found in the performances found in the show are totally nonexistent here.Next, the unbelievably asinine writing. This is likely worse than the acting, and is frankly an insult on three levels:1. To any fan of the show, its writing, its universe or its characters.2. To any fan of film who has ever enjoys a written piece of dialogue.3. To any human who has ever held a conversation or read a written word. Wooden, clunky and lacking any flavour or personality. The leaden exposition turns a magical and enchanting universe into a grey prison cell for creativity. It feels like the script has leeched every spec of power, fun or depth found in the source material. It isn't even funny, its infuriating and brain numbing. The acting in this film sucks, however I feel sorry for any actor who had to read these lines.Furthermore, the visuals are pathetic. The effects are horribly outdated and limit the awe inspiring visuals and action of the show into becoming a crappy video game. No size, no weight, no impact. The worst that CGI has to offer. The production design is cheap and tacky, again wringing all the majesty of the show out and leaving a wilted husk behind. The same applies to the costume and make-up, which is probably even weaker due to some particular offences (Zuko's scar is barely noticeable, turning his 'horrific disfigurement' into a slight crease and reddening).I could go into the changes from the show, and other such issues from the perspective of a fan, but that's not the point. This is not a complaint from the perspective of a fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, or a film fan. This is from a person who has common sense and standards. This is an insulting piece of filth that showcases pretty much everything that can possibly go wrong when making a film. I don't believe in calling films 'evil' or 'dangerous' but this wreck might be the exception. I dare anyone to offer a hint of praise to this, thing.",The Last Airbender
186,titushowlett,Worst live action adaptation in history,1,11 August 2019,"Honestly, the only thing about this movie that was good was the visual effects. Nothing more than that. Terrible movie. If the directors were going after the amazing cartoons back in the mid-2000s, they failed miserably. The actors were terrible too. Aang needed to be more happy and cheerful. Sokka needed to be more comedic and also cheerful. Zuko's actor was worst of all, doesn't look or act anything like the one from the cartoons at all. Uncle Iroh was bad too, lacking the jolly, wise, and sweet person of the original character. If I were to direct this movie I probably could've done better. Makes me wonder just how experienced the director is. Anyways, everything about this movie is bad, with the exception of the visual effects. I would never recommend this to anyone, even if they haven't seen the original cartoons.(2/10)",The Last Airbender
187,ShanTeaTime,How Not To Do An Adaptation By M. Night Shyamalan,1,13 April 2020,"So I like many others really love the original animated show ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"". It was beautifully animated, full of humor and well thought out characters. Not to mention some very relevant topics and discussion points that made it feel more like an anime rather than just ""standard American television"". The shows entire premise moves at a fantastic pace, making it so even the ""filler"" episodes that don't move the main plot along are still very enjoyable. Seriously there's not one episode from that series that I dislike.However, moving onto this film. What the actual hell? How could a director who created one of my favorite films (Sixth Sense) make this unfaithful, ugly looking, frankly insulting ""adaptation"" even if you want to call it that. Right off the bat we have terrible choices for casting. Katara and Sokka are played by caucasian actors, whom bare in mind aren't even decent! Neither of them bring the essence of either character (ie. compassion, strength or humor) and they have zero sibling-esque chemistry. Aang is played by a kid who is not an actor and it shows. Then Zuko is okay, but his scar is laughable in comparison to the series which is pivotal to his character arch. Also Uncle Iroh is completely not what he should be, yes he's wise in the series but also warm and comedic.Again I also don't understand the casting, it's like the movie is purposely putting white actors at the forefront and actors of colour as bad guys? Which isn't what the series did at all, it represented characters as representations of different countries/places (ie. Japan, Native American, Chinese, etc). It's like Shyamalan never even watched the series at all! But according to him he's a huge fan so it baffles my mind to think a ""fan"" could mess up this badly!Looking past the racially insensitive casing for just a second, the CGI animals in this look awful. There aren't as many as in the series, but Appa and Momo are in the film and good god it's like a nightmare. I don't know if the movie was trying to appear ""more realistic"" but come on now! None of this is ""realistic"" to begin with. The rest of the film is awful looking too, either boring or too darkly lit or way too zoomed in. Unlike in the series which is colourful and vibrant. The costume design is ugly, looking like cheap party city costumes. Also I mentioned before that Zuko's scar is pathetic, but so is Aang's arrows. They just look...like poorly done tattoo jobs to be honest. It didn't have to be a plain set of blue arrows like in the series, but at least make them stand out and not blend into his skin like he's seen too much sun. I won't get too much into the hairstyling in this movie because ugh, what happened seriously?There's also the horrible HORRIBLE changing of the bending capabilities. First of all, why change it so the firebenders have less power and can't just bend? That's kind of the point to begin with. Fire is a dangerous element, but if handled correctly it can be beautiful. That's LITERALLY ESTABLISHED IN THE FIRST SEASON and later on with Zuko being Aang's eventual teacher. Also the airbenders can still do that so it's not like Shyamalan was trying to ""even the playing field"" or whatever! Other than that, the bending moves overall are so overly complicated. Dude watch the series, it does not take 3 minutes of wiggling around to throw one boulder as an earthbender that's just stupid! It's apparent that the choreography is at its peak of looking horrendous during the final battle, it's so slowwww. Yeah just have Aang stand there for 10 minutes while everything around him is in havoc, totally makes more sense than in the series where he turns into a giant water-bended fish monster.I understand that many won't go in caring about all this stuff unless you've seen the series (which you should go see), but even forgetting all of that this movie literally has no soul. It's somehow boring, slow, or too rushed in sections and overall awful to watch. You don't care about any of the characters (whose names aren't even correctly pronounced!) and it's just sad. You had it all there to roll with Shyamalan and you couldn't get one aspect correctly.It's near impossible to make an entire season of a series into a movie anyway, not without missing key character development or world building. It probably would've taken 2 movies per season to get everything right, but obviously not with Shyamalan as the director. Give it to someone who knows what's appropriate to change and leave out, and also what a cultural impact the series had in the first place. Yes it's technically a ""movie"" so I have to give it at least 1 star, but it's barely cohesive enough to be called that.",The Last Airbender

The only good thing about this movie is that it concludes the story. Unfortunately the TV series was cancelled before anyone could see how it would have ended.

No. way.Right off the bat, the casting was dreadful. The race of the characters are the following: Water Tribe was Indigenous American/Inuit, Fire Nation was Japanese, Earth Kingdom was Chinese and Air Nomads were Tibetans. Here, most of the cast was white and any Asian actors were restricted to background roles!Secondly, the tone. The characters had about as much personality as a piece of cardboard, and there was no humour. Sokka was supposed to be the joker of the group, and here he was pretty much like Hayden Christensen in the Star Wars prequels. Aang was this fun-loving innocent kid, Katara was a brave, motherly character. Honestly, I think I've seen more personality in a piece of wood.Thirdly, the fact that character's names were pronounced wrong. Ong? Sohka? Ee-roh? Ovatar? You know your movie's in trouble when you can't even do that right!M. Night Shyamalan claimed he watched the show with his children, which inspired him to make the film. Yeah. Bet he only watched like thirty seconds of it. And he also had the CHEEK to claim that more films were in the pipeline and they'd be culturally diverse.

191,moselekm,Harsh reviews? Lighten up kids.,8,3 July 2010,"What makes a movie? There are many answers to this, but on a very low key, let's go watch a weekend movie. A movie has a hero who everyone can love and has some background we can understand, or at the very least keep up with. The hero usually has support, to cover the flanks of any personality traits the hero may have. This is to show the hero is not perfect and he can learn from his supporting crew. And the bad guy(s) are generally someone easy to hate and the movie usually reveals the enemy in a way so you can instantly tell they are no good.This film does that. So why the 2 stars and lower? I guess the people who watch the cartoon show are butt hurt about something. I can't place it, I have only seen a handful of episodes. But if you spent the money to go see this movie at a midnight viewing or something without doing your research: Like that M. Night is stealing credit for everything. Then the jokes on you - thanks for the cash, idiot.For those of us who just want a movie to kick back to that has a solid story line, good martial arts, and some amazing effects, then look no further. Allow the Last Airbender to be your whore for the silver screen. I won't go on about the great parts of this film. So I will stick with picking out the flaws.The flaw is that M. Night is a hack and got to do this film. I was scared of this film since I saw the teaser. M. Night not only tries to pretty much overshadow the people who made the good parts of the movie great, but he pretty much makes it difficult for you to even get a preview of who actually made this film great. Because it wasn't him. M. Night is the bane of this movie. From the slow moving scenes, bad transition shots, and everything else M. Night is great at doing, is what makes this movie seem to drag on at parts.Casting. Casting was a huge problem for everyone I believe. I mean, he attempted to Asian-up this film by changing the annunciation, but the characters I thought should definitely be Asian, are just a couple of white people surrounded by Inuits and Asians. However, I will admit I was taken aback by who played Zukko, I ended up enjoying him. He was a little campy, but he did his part. Zukko is campy in the cartoon, come on now. I also love who played his uncle. And the Fire Lord himself is an amazing actor. So the Fire Nation side was pretty down pact in my opinion.Humor. The show is campy. It really is. And M. Night defends the lack of humorous scenes due to the actual mood of the movie and time. The movie didn't even break 2 hours first off. And second, M. Night you retarded hack, it's called Comic Relief. It's not just a great program canceled back in the 90's. Any movie can use Comic Relief. ESPECIALLY A KIDS ACTION FILM! What were there... 2 maybe 3 scenes where you can find yourself smirking in humor? And they all seem to happen at the start of the film. So it's as if when M. Night was spitting all over the original writer's and creator's faces, he forgot he was writing a kids movie 20 minutes in.ASIDE FROM M. NIGHT EXISTING IN THIS FILM IT'S A GOOD FLICK AND WORTH SEEING ON THE BIG SCREEN! However. Let us all laugh ourselves to death... When in the closing credits, it says nice and big for you: Writer, Director & Producer: M. Night Shamalan. And the REAL writers don't pop up till further into the credits. Oh M. Night, how you are the bane of decent movies.",The Last Airbender
192,Kane20,Review - The Last Airbender,3,5 September 2012,"In my senior year in high school, I performed in a big orchestra performance for my school district in which we played a music selection from The Last Airbender, conducted by Pete Anthony himself. The visual clip itself (the finale wave scene) was projected on a screen hanging from the ceiling for the audience to watch while we, the orchestra, accompanied it. From where I was sitting, I could not see the screen, but I certainly loved the music that we played. James Newton Howard has really got musical talent. That particular clip from the movie was actually given high ratings by some movie music critics (I don't remember their names or their organization), and I don't blame them. That scene, and the music, were pretty good. But,...why couldn't the rest of the movie be as good as that scene?The music, especially in that scene, is pretty much one of the only, if not the only, good thing about the movie, in my opinion. The movie is not as bad as so many people have said it is, but yes, it is bad, in just about every aspect. M. Night Shyamalan is a talented director, but this time, alas, he must have taken the day off. The script is terrible, and when the script is terrible, the movie is usually terrible, and that's the case here. Shyamalan seems to have turned his focus away altogether from storytelling, and story and character development, and more towards the mythology of the world. And on top of that, based on what I've heard, he seems to have totally disregarded the original anime series. I myself have never seen the anime series, so I really can't say anything about it, but based on what I saw in the movie, I believe what I've heard.The plot is incomprehensible, the pacing is poor, the confusion is high, and the acting is kind of weak. Even the visual and special effects, while they were okay, weren't as good as they were really supposed to be. And on top of all that, and probably because of it, it's pretty boring. There were scenes, especially toward the middle of the movie, in which I kept glancing down at the movie clock, which seemed to go really slowly in those scenes. The whole thing felt like a string of clips just thrown together rather than a movie. Except for two or three amusing moments, and the wave scene, the movie is flat, shallow, unemotional, soul-lacking, backbone-lacking, non-moving,heck, I can go on all day about it.The movie starts of with siblings Sokka and Katara, who are members of a water tribe, find Aang, young a successor to a long line of avatars, who has been frozen in ice for a hundred years. Now, Aang must help stop the fire nation from conquering the water, earth, and air nations. Sound simple, but there is a lot of stuff going on along the way, and it's just, well, confusing, to put it mildly. And I had to suffer all the way through it to get to the cool finale wave scene.A movie with very little soul and emotional core should have at least something that can somewhat save it. Unfortunately, Airbender doesn't have much of anything that can look or feel really good, let alone save the movie. The special effects are not bad, but they are obviously low to medium-budget, nowhere near where they need to be for this type of movie. The acting is stiff, and the tone is not uninspiring. The music is good, though. The movie plays pretty much like a video game, with a poor, incomprehensible plot (even real video games have comprehensible plots). I know M. Night Shyamalan has been going downhill lately, but I feel sorry for him. I really think people should stop pounding him so hard. He just needs to get back on his feet, that's all. He needs to start pulling it together and really work. After doing a string of medium-budget drama thrillers of his own formula, he is given special effects and a different type of project, but it seems as if he really didn't know what to do. He can't do that anymore if he wants to recover his reputation.My Rating: *1/2 (out of ****)",The Last Airbender
193,mhthehammer,How do you make Avatar: The Last Airbender boring?,3,28 May 2020,"In the early 2000's, I didn't have Nickelodeon or any of the popular cable networks, so I didn't grow up watching ""Avatar: the Last Airbender."" However, I will still take a look at M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender as its own movie. Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) and Katara (Nicola Paltz) are two waterbenders who discover Aang (Noah Ringer), the last living Avatar, frozen in ice in the Southern Water Tribe. In his journey, Aang must master all four elements to overthrow the Fire Nation and stop them from enslaving the Water Tribe and Earth Kingdom. Without going too deep into the comparison between this and the cartoon, let's examine how you summarize Season 1 and make it one of the most boring films ever made. First, M. Night Shyamalan's script consists of nothing but characters citing exposition without emotional address, lacking depth or visual flair. Second, condensing a full episodic series into a two hour long film makes the result too cluttered, unfocused, and slow, much like David Lynch's Dune. Third, the majority of the action sequences are shot in one take in slow motion, focusing more on body movements and computer effects rather than dramatic tension or suspense. Finally, the actors perform their parts in a blank manner, probably because Shyamalan's deadwood dialogue tree gives them nothing to work with thus the characters feel empty. Judging by how much backlash it got in 2010 and also how irritatingly dull and soulless is, I can probably thank The Last Airbender for making me want to watch ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" more.

The acting was horrid! Too scripted, too ""on command"" script! Too forced! None of the characters identified the qualities of the animated characters! It was dull! Director and producer were prob way too lazy to show the real playfulness of the actual characters like they did in the cartoon! I had to stop 30% through the movie and skip chapters and chapters and then I went to the end, they made it look like it was a cliff hanger for a new movie! Huge mistake! That movie never came out so people in 10 more years will say ""where's part 2?!"".

196,Jangobadass,"So much potential, but it's sadly squandered",5,2 July 2010,"You'll find a lot of scathing reviews of THE LAST AIRBENDER around here. I'd like to give it a fair, level headed review and point out its positives, though I will address its fatal flaws.This COULD have been a better movie. The trailers and commercials were actually rather promising. But in trying to cover an entire season of a popular cartoon show, it ended up being rushed and disjointed. Director M. Night Shyamalan writes a script that plays like ambitious fan fiction that cherry picks some of the seasons most popular & important moments from the season while throwing out pacing and character development.I had hoped that what happened to Peter Jackson would happen to Shyamalan and that making something completely different from his previous works would be just the thing he needed. But I forgot that Jackson put a lot of work and effort into his pre ""Lord of the Rings"" movies while Shyamalan is the laziest director ever (he's even admitted it in interviews) and that he is a humbler, more grounded director.It isn't entirely Shyamalan's fault. At the last minute, Paramount Studios decided to convert the movie to 3D, which ended up doing more harm than whatever good it could have done, and had several scenes cut that might have helped flesh out the story and add character development.I'll now get to the good parts. It looks really good, with settings and costumes that often recall its source material and really nice cinematography. There's James Newton Howard's sweeping, stirring music score. I liked the bending effects. They're no perfect but I don't always want my SFX to be like in ""Lord of the Rings"" ""The Matrix"" or , Heaven help us, ""Avatar"" because sometimes that's too much to ask. I liked the action scenes. I liked the imperfect but earnest performances by Noah Ringer and Nicola Peltz as heroes Aang and Katara, Dev Patel's anti-hero Zuko later in the movie (though his early scenes leave something to be desired), and Shaun Toub gives the movie's best performance as Uncle Iroh, capturing the spirit of his character perfectly.But the rest of the cast is unintentionally hilarious as they give bad performances like a poorly done high school production of Shaekespeare. In particular, Jackson Rathbone is as stiff and dull as he is in the ""Twilight"" movies (they may as well call his character ""Jasper""). Cliff Curtis is just silly as Fire Lord Ozai (both in appearance and performance). And Aasif Mandvi gives a strange performance as Commander Zhao, though the fact that the character was rewritten from being ruthless, fierce, and intimidating to being a gloating, weak, underhanded goon doesn't help. The situation is even worse thanks to the hollow, exaggerated dialogue the actors are forced to say that even hurts the better performances.The film is also a rushed sense of pace with events happening so quickly we don't get a chance to catch our breath and exposition repeatedly (and over dramatically) told to us to help us keep up. When characters have to talk about plot points every ten minutes or so, that's a clear sign you have a script that's too busy. And to top it all off the movie is poorly edited, going from place to place in its scenes so fast and sudden some viewers might get headaches.Paramount is hoping to make ""The Last Airbender"" into a trilogy, with each entry based on a season/storyline from the cartoon. The ending certainly hints at things to come. But the negative reaction and possible box office failure may stop that. If there is a sequel, they better get another director, and if they don't they really need to get a different writer. Because the first entry had a lot of potential...but it was hopelessly mired by uneven acting, awful dialogue, a terrible sense of pacing and crappy editing that may kill the trilogy before it can really start.",The Last Airbender

I am trying EVERYTHING I can to forget this GOD Awful MOVIE I have just endured.I feel violated just watching this movie - it was BOOORING, the script is a mess, it was all over the place, the acting is wooden, the characters are all mess up from the series - there is nothing good about this movie. I have to check IMDb to be sure this is a movie from M. Shyamalan. Seriously, this movie makes ""Alone in the Dark"" and even that GOD Awful ""BloodRayne"" looks like a MASTERPIECE !!!Another thing, when I came out of the cinema, I actually saw couple of kids in distress, one of them actually crying. Whether it has something to do with the movie or not, I don't know.So, take your kids to this movie if you think they deserves a punishment for life.

198,LawrenceOfAlabama,Hopefully: The LAST Airbender,1,2 July 2010,"They said ""The Happening"" was bad. I am one of the few that took the fore mentioned film as a goofy ""B"" movie romp. So I am probably more likely to do the same with his latest film ""The Last Airbender"". So I will start with the good points first:1. It did have a nice color pallet. There were plenty of visual location shots that were very impressive. But after Narnia/The Lord of the Rings/and plenty other big budget films not enough to sell a film.2. Interesting premise (One kid to rule them all) Kind of a Highlander for juveniles. Too bad it was not taken seriously.That's it for the good points. Now let's look at the problems:1. Never let your kids influence your work (or most of us would get day jobs at Chucky Cheese. You are to influence your child's work. So Mr. Shalimar I would suggest getting your kids a Summer Blockbuster to star in: Like a certain Smith Kid.2. If you are going to hire Kid actors make sure they can act. If not do what the Disney channel does: make them fun to watch. This bald, big toothed kid was really no fun to watch at all. It was as if he was learning to act while filming. Also the tween leads (I think Anikan was one of them) had no personality. 3. Battle scenes with no jeopardy are not battles. They are set pieces. At several points in this film there were skirmishes. No once was there a feeling that pain or death was lurking. Kids are not stupid, with Call of Duty, the current War, and crime in general, if there is no peril there is no real reason to fight. In the final battle, when the Airbender did his thing, there wasn't one body on the ground. 4. M. leave the Air alone!!! It didn't scare people in The Happening and it isn't going to help you launch a successful franchise. Also no more Ladies in the Water (even if they have magical fish hair!). I don't think this kid gig is working. So for the love of that twist you like so much, do a big one and give us another ""Sense"" of your work!",The Last Airbender

M. Night Shyamalan From what i heard he has been known to make movies that make no sense what so ever, and i didn't really believe that till ""The Happening"" and that by the way was amazingly stupid! And from research he wanted to make this movie only cause he wanted to give his kids something from him for once, because he always busy and what not, and his own kids even told him about it and he saw the show and he was inspired to make it, but little did he know was that he should have just let it go, or not have written it nor directed, it felt like a kids movie and might have been decent if it was at least a PG-13 but no the movie felt like watching Disney Channel-Chessy,Cheap,and crappy.This Epic flop was named the worst movie of the century all year long and i respectfully agree!, don't let the confused fans of the TV Show fool you! this is not the real ""Avatar"" nope this piece of crap was Awful-tar!

200,d_3434_d,A good example of how to make an extremely bad remake of a TV show,2,28 January 2012,"Avatar: The Last Airbender (2005–2008) is the only TV show that I have given a 10 out of 10. I haven't yet given any movie a 10. Avatar: The Last Airbender is that good. A movie adaptation of the show has really an enormous potential to be ranked among the greatest movies, if done right. A director like Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings (2001-2003)) and especially James Cameron (Aliens (1986), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Titanic (1997)) would be perfect for the job. A movie adaptation could break office records.Unfortunately, that is apparently too much to ask. We have got M. Night Shyamalan (Lady in the Water (2006), The Sixth Sense (1999)) instead. Imagine if M. Night Shyamalan was hired to make a movie adaptation of the Lord of the Rings. Sounds like a good idea? Of course not. Like Avatar: The Last Airbender, so has the Lord of the Rings a big and complicated story. Imagine how the Lord of the Rings movies would look like if M. Night Shyamalan made them. An Indian shows up as Frodo. A black guy shows up as Gandalf, all bald. The One Ring is portrayed like a necklace. Everything you have read in the book is not only changed in the movies, lots of important events have been omitted as well. That's how the Lord of the Rings movies would be if M. Night Shyamalan would have directed them and unfortunately, that's how this is.It's understandable that there is no room in a movie to fit the entire story of a TV show. That's, however, no excuse to CHANGE the story, which is crammed into around 90 minutes. There is no character development, no story development and whatever there is usually deviates from the TV show that it cannot be really called an adaptation but rather - at best - something like a quick, alternative and crippled version of the TV show. It's all messed up. The best scenes of the TV show have either been omitted or changed and the very few ones that have made it to the movie are treated insignificantly.The characters in this movie are laughable. Not only do they totally NOT resemble the characters from the show, they are not even given any time for character development. As if that isn't bad enough, their names are pronounced completely wrong but it gets even worse; their races are all mixed up as well! In the TV show there are only white people. In the movie, there are blacks, Indians, whites, you name it. It makes absolutely not sense. The Water Tribe, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation and the Air Nomads are all WHITE. There is even a black Air Nomad in the movie! That's like making a movie about slavery in the Americas with white slaves. Has it become racist to not include actors of races that don't exist in a story? Are there ""affirmative action"" policies these days that have prevented M. Night Shyamalan from accurately portraying the race of the peoples in this movie?All the characters look one dimensional, even Aang, the protagonist. It feels like they have no idea what they are doing, other than doing whatever the screenplay tells them to do. The dialog is so bad, leave alone anything close to the original. Even if you have never seen a single episode of the show you will still find the dialog to be laughable; but if you are familiar with the show, that's when it will start to work on your nerves. You will find yourself think to yourself things like ""Sokka would say now this and that"". Why doesn't Aang have a blue arrow on his head? (The tattoos don't count). Why does Zuko have hair? Why is his scar barely visible? Why do Fire Nation soldiers have black uniforms? The movie even fails with the basic details!Even if you have never seen one single episode of the TV show, this movie will still suck because it has nothing to offer on its own, leave alone as an adaptation of the TV show.The only good thing about this movie (that made me give it 2 stars instead of 1) are some beautiful scenes and the entire movie, purely from a visual point of view, is very watchable. Aang's pets, Appa and Mono, look like they do in the show.What could have been one of the best movies of all times has turned out to be one of the worst remakes of all times. M. Night Shyamalan should be fired, alongside the people who have hired him. It's like M. Night Shyamalan has never seen the TV show, just purchased the DVDs and (at best) read the description of the show at the back of the DVD box. That's not enough to make a movie ADAPTATION of the show. Why was M. Night Shyamalan even allowed to make this movie? After so many previous flops and without any prior experience in this particular genre he was still allowed to take an extremely popular TV show and not only write a screenplay for a movie adaptation but also direct it. Amazing! The idea is to make a trilogy. I hope that that isn't going to happen and there is hope! The movie has been trashed by movie critics pretty much universally. The movie has done well at the Golden Raspberry Award, winning five awards: Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst Supporting Actor and a special award, ""Worst Eye-Gouging Misuse of 3D"".Avoid this movie at any cost! Watch the TV show instead. The TV show is a masterpiece. I personally will not ever accept this movie to be the movie adaptation of the TV show. In my opinion, it's not a movie adaptation of the show but a horrible joke and a desecration of a masterpiece.",The Last Airbender

Ever since i saw the trailer back in the 2009, i knew this was going to be a bad movie, but i had no idea! How the heck did this even get green lit? First of all, the acting is downright horrible. I had heard that Noah Ringer had only gotten the part because he had sent in a video of him doing martial arts. After seeing the movie i can believe this cause he is a awful actor. Not even Dev Patel does a good job in this! The writing is also just terrible! This is seriously some of the worst written dialouge i have ever heard in my whole life. Heres an actual line from the movie... ""This child is being arrested, he was throwing rocks at us. It Hurt!"". Do i need to say more? This is also some of the worst editing i've seen in a movie in a while. In one scene someone will be fighting and then a second later they will be opening up a chest. And even with a budget of $150, the special effects suck! I could go on and on about the problems with this movie but i don't want to rant. It seriously felt like this was a movie that was made for Nickelodeon and than at the last minute they decided to put it in theaters and convert it to 3D.

203,mysteryfan04,Destruction of a Fantasy Epic,1,3 December 2010,"Knock, knock. Who's there? It's the possible end of M. Night Shyamalan's career. The Last Airbender is a fantasy epic based on a popular show on Nickelodeon. Apparently, a brother and sister discover a boy named Aang encased in a ball of ice. Once they free him, the siblings discover that he is the Avatar, the master of the elements water, air, fire, and earth. Due to his virtuoso in bending these elements, the evil fire nation wants to capture him and use his powers for evil. It sounds like a fabulous premise. However, it can be easily botched, and unfortunately that is the case with this film. The movie thinks its audience is slow-witted because it spells out every scene visually, and then drives the point of the scene home by using excruciatingly obvious dialogue. All of the actors deliver this laughable dialogue with no grace, emotion, or intensity. The movie's predictability seems to be present due to its impulse to deliver a poorly shot action sequence every ten minutes. These action sequences feature dull camera-work and the overuse of visual effects. The script additionally fails to establish its characters; with the exception of Aang, you have no clue about who the other characters are and as a result, you don't really care. An incoherent plot, lifeless performances, predictable script, and absent tone result in the top contender for worst film of 2010 and the end of this once-promising director's career.",The Last Airbender

This guy has discovered the recipe of failure. And he keeps it only for himself. I can not believe studios will give him another chance after this ridiculous attempt of coming back to the scene. This is the kind of movie you would indicate to a foe, not to a friend.

205,CompuLOL,"Not that bad, and way better of what I had expected...",6,25 September 2013,"First of all, fanboys have to realize that they're not the intended target audience. This is a children movie, with an appropriate rating; made by a kid TV network studio. The same one that moronically killed it's best show of all time over same kiddie issues; Invader Zim. It's just like the disneyfication of the Chronicles of Narnia. So what were you expecting? Epic blood and gut battles; not going to happen. Specially since these are not orcs, or some other type of mystical anthropomorphic animals; these are real people, indeed. The only difference here is that it's in an ancient fantasy world setting. And that some people have special elemental manipulation powers. One of the problems of the film is that it fails to create that distinct fantasy realm feeling. It simply feels ""too real"" for it's own good. I would have liked to see more funny hybrid like creature animals; for creating a better aesthetic mood. That would be the second realization. It's not a CGI action fest either. The story is the most important factor. It's an adventurous coming of age, pilgrimage and quest tale. Sure, it could've been retold better; but it was still adequate enough. Even the special effects of the bending techniques are of little consequence; since they were so noticeable fake at first glance. Yet, an obv step up from the standard 2D drawing of the series. Little children loved this movie; they didn't have any issue buying it. And hence it was a box office success solely because of them; so in the same way it makes perfect sense to me too.Third; the very premise that the original show has been ransacked is flawed. It doesn't even matter how good or bad it was subjectively perceived to be converted into a movie; since the bitter truth is that the show's really not that great, and gradually goes down in creative plot quality for each season. So this is actually the best main story arc. Sadly still, on another bad aspect of the film is it's casting and acting. Aang, Sokka and Zuko being the worst offenders; besides an Iroh that doesn't even look remotely similar, nor it's any fun. Since this is a live action movie; the nations within were further characterized with an ethnic tribe correlation. The idea was good; the implementation wasn't. Keep in mind that this is an USA production. It was easy to infer that it had to be caucasianazied after passing the Hollywood machinery. Night tried to compromise by adding more ethnic variation to the main org Asian mix; but failed miserably in the end. For instance, Katara and Sokka are dark skinned in the series; here are white. I'd let slide eskimos too; but oddly enough it works better for me as norses. Nevertheless, too much artistic freedom was taken that wasn't required. The point being that most people couldn't break their preconceived appearances of the characters; it didn't bother me. What bothered me more was the lack of consistency within their expected behaviour. Zuko seemed to be always angry without a reason; when it should've been the opposite. Ie, in the series he comes more cool headed, with a clear minded purpose; separated by short outbursts of near maniacal rage. Aang looks and behaves close enough, for the most part. The problem rises when he has to utter a line. And Sokka felt here more like a secondary character since the movie incidentally emphasized his superfluous effect. He should definitely be more funny. Besides, Rathbone simply shouldn't appear in any movie that requires anything but good looks. Anyhow, slightly more robust and better acting would've made a world of diff for all of them. Realizing this fourth point will help you enjoy the film more; since there's no chemistry between any of them, and the performances for the entire cast are overall flat. That also means that it doesn't really emotionally connect with a grown up audience, albeit that's also not a problem for me; as I let it consciously slide. But of course that still is no excuse, and all fault falls on the writer and director. Because Night simply shouldn't have directed it; let alone write it. It's rather self evident that he cannot manage other themes that are not twist suspense thrillers. Hell; he even hasn't score with those ones lately; only at the beginning of his career. This can only mean either that he's falling down or he's a one trick pony; but that doesn't mean this is such an gawd awful film. It's almost enjoyable; with the aid of mind altering substances, of course.:)Which brings me to the fifth issue; the nutty plot doesn't actually follows the series that closely. It's obv that it can't; since it's an impossible task to condense appropriately a whole season into a movie. In this particular and series' case; ""book #1"". Things necessary had to be either changed or cut out. However surprisingly, Night's passion, vision and style, counterweights and overcomes any problems the film may pose otherwise. People that didn't like the end product are obv biased towards his work. Of course the material works best if you haven't seen the org kid's animated series. So in resume; a final more objective, cohesive and global look at the film yields that is not that bad as some other comparable adaptations; say like, The X-Men saga. Expecting realism and serious drama of an unreal campy cartoon is like expecting to get drunk out of root beer. It'll all end in frustration and disappointment on your behalf. So lower your expectations and lighten up; this obv isn't Shakespeare. And if you want to keep seeing movies out of those; then support them, even if not on par to your high and mighty standards of excellence. It's the only way to boot a franchise, and eventually get a really good reboot; way down the line...",The Last Airbender
206,gatheringsnow,Bottom of the Barrel,2,24 April 2017,"This is without a doubt the worst film Shyamalan has ever done. It's an enormous insult to the fans of the Nickelodeon series, such as myself but it's also an insult to the people who came to watch this film because they simply thought it looked good. Let me tell you right now, although by 2017 it's pretty much common knowledge among moviegoers, The Last Airbender is garbage in every conceivable way imaginable. With a few minor exceptions, the acting is complete crap, the dialogue is laughable and forced, the sfx are dull and goofy, the plot is confusing and meandering, and the tone is very cold and lifeless, the complete antithesis to the wonderful animated series. I don't know what Shamalamadingdong was thinking when he conceived this cinematic atrocity but he is probably one of the last people in the world qualified to helm an adaptation of anything, let alone Avatar: The Last Airbender. For starters the casting was incredibly poor and yes, even racist. in the original series, it was quite clearly an Asian inspired fantasy world, nothing too complex or complicated about it, but Shyamalan, apparently falling prey to the idea that ""multi-cultural"" casting automatically makes something both superior and inoffensive, ironically made the film far more offensive than it would have been had the casting been a more accurate reflection of the series.In the adaptation, the fire nation for some idiotic reason is Indian/Middle Eastern, and the main heroes, despite coming from Inuit/Eskimo and Tibetan backgrounds respectively, are all white, and therefore creating a stark and unnecessary contrast to the villainous fire nation. So once again, the good guys are white and the bad guys are brown, and no this isn't even about the fact that in the original series such a problem was not evident, it's due to the fact that this is just another prime example of darker people being bad and lighter people being good, a tradition in Hollywood since it's beginnings in the 1920's and 30's. Shyamalan has tried to defend this nonsense by claiming that they were going for color- blind casting, simply choosing the best actors for the roles, regardless of race or ethnicity. But that doesn't explain why the main actors, Noah Ringer as Aang (sorry Ong), Jackson Rathbone as Sokka (or Sowka), and Nicola Peltz as Katara, are all uniformly terrible in their respective roles. As has been noted by other reviewers the only actors who manage to pull off an even half-decent portrayal of their characters are Dev Patel as Zuko and Shaun Toub as his Uncle Iroh, who, by the way, look nothing like they do in the series, especially Uncle Iroh, who has gone from a stout, cheerful, tea-drinking elderly Asian man to looking almost like a middle-aged ISIS terrorist with his large, weary eyes and long beard, if you look past his Avatar-inspired outfit. But the casting and acting is only the tip of the iceberg unfortunately. Numerous characters from the series like the Kyoshi warriors are completely left out, the plot is incredibly rushed and even by it's end feels incomplete, the ""bending"" scenes look incredibly stupid and fake and it's unexplained why it takes like ten awkward movements to simply make water or earth to move. In the series the bending is extremely fast, fluid, and sometimes even beautiful to witness, feeling much more natural. Overall, the film was a complete failure on all levels, although there were a few positives here and there, I guess the Avatar world did not look too bad in certain scenes, as it managed to maintain the look of the series to an extent. But that in no way saves this film from being a completely trainwreck. Avoid at all costs and simply stick to the series, forget this film even exists.",The Last Airbender

208,NixSar,Not quite so bad...,6,3 November 2010,"Honestly for a kid and/or fun flick and compared to the ego-tripping, quasi-mystical, 100-twists-in-endings-and-none-make-sense crap Shyamalan has been throwing our way for years now (I get the vomit reflex just thinking of The Village or Lady in the Water), this movie is quite decent. It still reeks of Shyamalan and is pretty bad, but to me it was his first bearable-to-watch film in years. Sure, the screenplay is shallow, the child actors have not been prepared properly for their roles, the story erratically jumps from one key issue to the next without proper introduction, especially for someone unfamiliar with the story, etc etc, but if you let go and just stick to the fun and visuals and try to rewrite the story in your head..hmmmmm, maybe that's too much work for a film to work...Oh come on! It's fun.",The Last Airbender
209,geniuskentyk-1,It's in the running for one of the worst films of 2010!,3,9 July 2010,"I've wanted to see 'The Last Airbender' for a long, long time. I knew I shouldn't set my expectations high when I first learned that M. Night Shyamalan was to be the director; he hasn't made a good movie in years! Then, a few months ago, the first trailer for the film was released. From the trailer, the film looked decent. It looked like it was going to be cheesy and stupid, but at least fun. I found out I was wrong. The movie wasn't cheesy, nor was it any fun! 'The Last Airbender' was a stupid, disgraceful adaptation of the original, beloved TV series.I hated how the majority of the main characters' names were mispronounced. Perhaps the changed pronunciations were more correct, but the fact that the film is based on the show, the original pronunciations of the names should have been kept. Aang in the movie is ""Aw-ng"". Sokka is ""Soak-ah."" Iroh is ""E-roh."" Also, Avatar is pronounced ""Aw-vatar."" It's annoying.I hated how Shyamalan chose mostly unknown actors to portray some of the main characters. I hated how Shyamalan chose a boy (Noah Ringer) who has no skills in acting whatsoever to portray Aang, the main character, just because the boy knew martial arts. Personally, I would've chose acting ability over martial arts ability. I hated how all of the acting were wooden and lifeless, aside from Dev Patel and Shaun Toub. Dev Patel is a really good actor, and did a good job in 'Slumdog Millionaire.' Shaun Toub was really good in 'Crash', too. I feel that the majority of the reason why the acting was so lifeless and wooden is because the dialogue and screenplay was lifeless and sucked. Much of the dialogue in 'The Last Airbender' are long-ass narrations – the television show did it much better and shorter. I hated how, many times, the long-ass narrations took the place of actually showing us what happens; we hear about what happens instead of actually getting to see on screen what happens.I hated how the movie's so dark, while the television series is beautiful and bright. I hated the choppy storyline. The film's supposed to be a type of road-movie, but we go from city to city without any acknowledgment. We never know how many days have passed, or if it's the same day or not. We go from place to place without ever getting the chance to settle down and actually care about the characters and the situations they're in. The choppy pacing of the film never allows us to like anything or anyone in the movie.I hated how the order that some dialogue and actions take place were out of order. Things should have been said before they were actually said, and things should have happened at another time, or vice-versa. For example, when Aang escapes from the grasps of Prince Zuko early in the film, Aang takes out his glider. After Aang takes out his glider, Zuko tells him, ""You have nowhere to run!"" Then, Aang uses his glider to fly away. Logically, Zuko should have cornered Aang, tell him that he had nowhere to run, and then Aang would pull out his glider and fly away. It's ridiculous! Some things in the film shouldn't have even been said! For example, in the final act of the film, the Aang is at the Northern Water Temple, and the Fire Nation currently do not know where he is. But then Admiral Zhao (Aasif Mandvi) suddenly tells the Fire Lord (Cliff Curtis) that they think Aang's at the Northwern Water Temple. How the hell do they think and know that!? It's unbelievable. I'm not even finished explaining yet! Right after saying that, Admiral Zhao then tells the Fire Lord that they should attack the Northern Water Temple because the scrolls they found earlier in the film revealed that the Moon and Ocean spirits were located at the Northern Water Temple, and the Fire Nation wants to kill the Moon and Ocean spirits. Now, if the film left just the whole 'Moon-and-Ocean-Spirits' part as the reason for attacking the Northern Water Temple, and just-so-happen to find Aang there as well, I would've believed'em. The first part about ""Ooh, I have a strong feeling the Avatar's at the Northern Water Temple"" shouldn't have been said at all!I also really hated how all of the water-bending, air-bending, earth-bending, and fire-bending had excessively long movements, resulting in actually very little happening. In the television series, the elemental bending followed the movements of the characters. In the film, each character does a series of long-ass hand gestures, and then a short burst of elemental bending occurs.Now, what do I like about the film? The actress who portrays Katara, Nicola Peltz, actually sounds a lot like Katara from the animated series. Also, Princess Yue (Seychelle Gabriel) is really pretty in the film, and looks a lot like her animated counterpart.'The Last Airbender' isn't fun at all. All of the jokes, joy, and life in the animated series has been left out of the film adaptation. I want sequels to this film only to give Shyamalan a chance at redemption and perhaps have other people write the screenplays for the next ones. Or even better, have a better director reboot the film series.",The Last Airbender
210,DanTheHumanBeing,Complete trash..,1,11 May 2019,"As a big fan of the original source show Avatar The Last Airbender, I was thrilled at first when I heard they made a live action movie related to it. Sadly tho I was hugely disappointed once I actually watched the movie. There was absolutely no good parts to this complete disaster of a movie, they did everything wrong, to pronouncing the characters names, to casting the wrong kind of actors for the characters, to the horrible atrocity that was the CGI creatures, and effects. This is what happens when you don't even care about the source material and just wanna make a movie just to cash in on popularity. If you're fan of the show, or not, I'd advise to stay away from this complete dumpster fire of a movie.",The Last Airbender

It took me a few minutes but outside of the plot holes and incoherent events the one thing that truly ruined it was the complete lack of any humour whatsoever. In the series Aang was fun loving and at first didn't take anything seriously, remember penguin sledding? Sokka in the series was basically a klutz at the beginning and really sarcastic. In the movie neither of them smiled even once that I can remember. No sarcastic lines, no fun loving inclinations, no fun in the movie at all. Uncle Iroh did a good job with the ""wisdom"" but there was nothing at all of the good natured amusement that the character brought in the series. They didn't even have him drinking tea! Obviously there is not going to be any sequels (unless someone needs a huge tax write-off) and that's a good thing. This adaptation should never have been done.",The Last Airbender
212,imdb-646,Not as bad as many people say,7,30 August 2010,"My wife and I are huge fans of the Avatar cartoon, and of course we were very curious about that we could expect from the version from M. Night Shyamalan. When you have seen the first book (Water), and you take in consideration that this book alone already is about 8 hours, then how can you expect that each and every detail has been covered in a movie that is only 103 minutes. That is just impossible.I think M. Night Shyamalan made a very decent job and the movie is not as bad as most people say. Think that the movie is based on the cartoon. It is not an exact copy of it. They have made some things different than the cartoon. That's no problem.I am looking forward for the sequels. After all, there are still the books Earth and Fire....the only thing where I have some comments.... Forget the 3D. That was not impressive at all. If you want to make it in 3D, then make it completely in 3D and not just some parts....",The Last Airbender
213,pascaloetterli,It is not THAT bad,5,9 August 2010,"It is disgusting to read all the hatred against this movie in other reviews. I never watched ""Avatar"" and I am pretty sure, that there's a lot more depth in the series. Talking to You as a fan of cartoons and anime, I really liked this film. Without knowing anything about the original, it was obvious for me, that there is a lot missing in terms of character development and background story. I think, they should have gone for an hour more or make two movies and abandon the idea of 3D. Maybe some producer went out of money or the test audience was consisting of the wrong people. The director was interested in having a multi ethnic cast, that is mostly unknown to the audience (and does not cost so much). The decor, colors and landscapes are superb and the acting is not worse than in other movies of that kind. I liked the kind of animations, the mixture of kung-fu and magic.To me the whole story was interesting enough to give the cartoons a try. By the way, I would never consider this movie for any child under the age of eight. The Shalayman film is just a start and I think most people who even hated this movie now will nevertheless watch a follow-up as well. It's the typical ""Eragon"" syndrome: There's just not enough money (or the money was wasted for the wrong things) to go for large scale and epic length just as ""Harry Potter"", ""Narnia"" and ""LotR"" went. Fantasy wants spectacle and developed characters - one can't do that in 100 Minutes. This is the first multicultural and multiethnical fantasy movie, I hope it won't be remembered as just a bad adaptation made with well meant intent.",The Last Airbender

216,Thistle-3,"The story flows, like water...",8,1 July 2010,"M Night Shyamalan has completed his biggest film-making challenge to date. Where most of his previous movies were quiet suspense tales, The Last Airbender is huge, with an epic story line that requires a ton of special effects and 3-D. The title character is Aang. He lives in a world where people are divided into tribes based on the elements of the earth: Fire, Water, Earth and Air. He is reported to be the last of his kind, found by some waterbender kids and hiding from firebenders, who threaten to take over the world. Maybe you've seen the cartoon. The Last Airbender is based on a series of books, and in this film, M Night tackles the first one, Water. The story is dense, with a lot of background. Some audiences might find that boring, but I was interested. All of the actors are gorgeous, the cinematography is fantastic, the effects are fun (I advise you to spring for the extra $ to see it in 3-D), the score is moving. Yep, there are parts that are a little slow, but it's an action picture with a grand story, and unlike, say, a Transformers 2, there are no gaps in storyline or character development scrapped for a loud, unnecessary explosion sequence. It flows, like water. And, I hope I get to see more. I give The Last Airbender a 7.5 out of 10.",The Last Airbender
217,midtra52,It doesn't get much worse than this,1,10 January 2011,The only reason I watched this movie was because someone let me borrow it. I was sick with nothing to do so I figured why not. That turned out to be a bad decision. All this movie did was make me sicker. It's as though the script was written in a day. On top of that it looks like it was written at a third grade level. To make matters worse the entire movie looked like a tai chi exercise video gone horribly wrong. Actually I could have watched a tai chi exercise video and suffered less than I did through this. Thankfully the movie is short so the pain will be over soon. But the same as bad days seem to be the longest this movie will seem to take forever.,The Last Airbender
218,mounirrmaged,Arguably the worst movie ever made (Possible spoilers for the movie as well as the show),1,19 November 2016,"The last air-bender. A film infamously known for being terrible. How terrible? Well it is so terrible that it's not only considered one of the worst movies of all time, but has lower rotten tomatoes score than batman and robin, as well as fant4stic. The film is fundamentally broken on every single level that it fails to be a good adaptation and a solid movie on it's own. So what is wrong with the movie? Scratch that, what is done right in the film? Absolutely nothing. Everything fails. So the film starts off with a narration(foreshadowing that everything will be done in exposition poorly) by a poor performance from the actress who plays Katara. We then start off with Katara controlling the water and causing her brother, Sokka to get wet(a failed attempt to capture the humor of the show). They then see something under the snow and find it's a giant ice sphere containing a young boy who turns out to be Ong.(his name is Aang actually). From that point the events start to go on. I say events because there is no story or coherent plot going on. It's just things happening and bunch of exposition. The acting is some of the worst i have ever seen in my life. Every character is either mopping or angry for no logical reason. There has never been an emotion that was actually believable or plausible. It is either bland or embarrassingly awkward. Another thing is that these character have no depth or personality. The dynamic relationship between characters is non existent. Nothing makes sense except for those who watched the show. Not because the film is faithful, but because they know what is supposed to happen. The film tries desperately to pander to the series without having a clear understanding of it. A prime example is with the protective nature of Katara. In the TV series, they form a strong bond that became unbroken. In the film, literally upon their first encounter, Katara decides that the boy is her responsibility. Another thing for the characters: none of them are done right. Sokka in the show was a comic relief, yet at the same time was a core character of the show and had depth and a strong personality. In the movie, he is just a mopy bastard who is angry all the time. Aang was a happy go lucky likable hero who evolves later on. In the movie, it is none existent. Another thing that was butchered(the show was bastardized) is the relationship between Sokka and the water tribe princess, who share absolutely no chemistry. In fact, there is no build-up or development to their relationship. As soon as they met, we are yet again given a bland and poor exposition from Katara saying that they became instant friends. There was no time spent with them. This makes the water tribe princess' sacrifice completely pointless since we did not build any connection. The princess sacrifices her life to give it back to the moon spirit because the fire nation general killed it to gain advantage in the war, since the water tribe gain their power from the moon. It was very tragic in the show but it felt pointless and a waste of time in the movie. Another thing is that the climax was so terrible, it's one of the most boring battles i have ever seen. Poorly done 3D converted effects. In fact, they were downright laughable. Nothing felt in actual danger, and the action sequences were boring. The writing was also terrible. There was no story or plot, except that one boring exposition that feels like homework(Doing homework would be much more fun than watching this actually) by Katara. It is sad that such a film with potential was not only wasted, but is in the list of worst movies ever made. A complete insult to the show and to cinema in general. 0/10",The Last Airbender

I was very pleasantly surprised, and found the film a serious attempt to address a spirituality that is not widely understood in the west. Maybe this is one reason why the film has been panned. I then looked at audience reviews a little closer, and I realise that most of those who disliked it - no, HATED it - were already fans of the cartoon versions. It falls into place; having never seen any other versions I was coming to the film fresh. What I did recognise was the Dala Lama in the little boy Avator, and this lent the film authenticity.As a Christian, it may seem strange that I am endorsing a film that is rooted in eastern mysticism. First of all, it is a worthy attempt at a challenging subject, and I found the performances - while approached with simplicity - quite in keeping with the mystical nature of the material. The second point is that it has a non-violence theme, and sends the message 5that some things in the realm of the spirit should not be manipulated by humans.The musical score fitted the action seamlessly - so much so, I hope it gets an Oscar nomination; at one point, there is total silence as our heroes walk on ice... the silence is deafening and very dramatic.The most mystical part of this production is WHY so many people have failed to connect with the film.

224,mbh42498,"Interesting to see childhood show, but sad wiht some results",5,21 January 2013,"Well, I'm sure most of us are thinking the hell with this movie. I myself didn't find the movie that great, but it is a pg movie on an action show.I was confused with the characters, mainly because they were mostly Indian descent and the one who plays Katara isn't that attractive. The Indian part was explained by Shymalan because some of the terms in the series like Agni Kai is a hinduism term in a way, and I forgot the other terms, but the show does revolve around some of India's heritage. It was a little disappointing to see the main actor in Slumdog Millionaire in this movie, because of the many flaws in it. Apparently, they also do put emphasis on the pronounciation of names. In the prologue, Katara says avatar like the O in olive. Ovatar. Iroh's name is is pronounced like Eeroh. This doesn't bother me that much though so moving on.The effects? Sadly, they look silly. The fire moves slow and the water they bend doesn't appear to move with much pressue. There is a clip on youtube of the village people ""earthbending"" a rock.....Oh god. ""Why the last Airbender movie sucks"" find and watch it. However I will say this. The movie at times does remind me a little of the lord of the rings. The first scene of the N Water tribe looks like something you'd see from the trilogy. Maybe it is just me, but I just thought I should mention it.The movie did revolve around the main parts of the first season which is a good thing. It did leave out Suki, Jet, Boomi, and of course THE CABBAGE MAN (I could be wrong), but it must leave out these fillers for the important parts in an hour and a half, or they'd just make a reboot TV show of better effects with actual people. The bits used are reasonable important to the plot of the movie Something else I thought interesting was that firebenders fire mainly comes from a torch or somewhere that already includes fire. In the show, firebenders can create fire from their hands. Here, they must use a lit fire source like water and earth benders.Anyways, the movie was unimpressive to the eye or mind.

It reminded of a sci-fi movie I saw years ago when an alien creature entered a Space ship in the form of Water and it could replicate itself to appear anyone whom it touched, which was a revolutionary special effects production. As far as the story goes, it is the usual good guys against bad guys. This always involves a dictator and his ruling army who preys on the weak and than destroys them. This story is not different, but it lacks originality and misses important themes in the process. The true Airbender's full training is not yet complete, but yet he was able to bend both Fire and Water in the Closing scenes, and thus bring victory to the suppressed and destroy the Evil presence, in a manner of speaking because he is not allowed to kill. The Martial Art movements depicted are from both ""Chi Gong"" and ""Tai Chi,"" and I also noticed prayer postures from the Hindu religion.

After all, transferring a cartoon to the big screen is never easy and if you are some cartoon-freak you will never like the end result. The movie is good enough and gives you some quality entertainment above all. The acting is very intense and the lead character shows a lot of emotions for a little boy. Dav Patel is completely unsuited to play his character, but at least he's got a job outside the stereotypical Indian/Pakistani characters and he is a talented actor, so not much to worry about. Special effects are great and the settings for all major fight scenes are very clever. The editing is solid enough and while there are some bad moments in the screenplay, you can hardly notice those as the actors manage to shift the attention in the opposite direction. Where this movie leaves something to be desired is the overall continuity. Everything happens just too quickly and smaller children might find it difficult to follow at times. Yet, it is good entertainment for the entire family and as good as The Golden Compass. Shame they don't make more movies in that specter as they could be extremely interesting.",The Last Airbender
227,puma31219,Shayamalan should be ashamed,3,28 April 2014,"ARE YOU SERIOUS?! Another classic ruined because the director wanting to do things HIS way?! PEOPLE!! HOW HARD IS IT TO SIMPLY CREATE LIVE ACTION FOR A CARTOON WITHOUT CHANGING ANYTHING?! That's what people want to see! Sheesh! Where to begin? Let's start with the casting. Ethnic casting more specifically. Characters, who were supposed to be Native American were portrayed by White actors and all of the Orientals were portrayed by Indians. Why was this? What purpose did it serve to make that kind of drastic change? Granted that White Actors can get any role no matter the ethnicity of the character because that's just how backward Hollywood can be, butthe Indians why? If Shayamalan was looking for a platform film to showcase Indian talent, he definitely picked the wrong one. Aside from the fact that it's not true to the story, it wasn't believable and was visibly offensive. (You expect me to believe that Aasif Mandvi is really a guy named ""Zhou?"" Huh??!?!?) The quality of acting in the film was horrendous. Not one of the main characters was believable and were each kind of annoying. There was nothing of the characteristics from the television show assigned to their film counterparts. Sokka wasn't funny, Aang was lively, energetic and fun-loving and Katara's maturity was overshadowed by her more than apparent naivety. The only redeemable parts, were those portrayed by Shaun Toub and Cliff Curtis; both great actors, yet neither of them belonged in the film. (Actually, Cliff Curtis could have portrayed a wide array of characters, but the Fire Lord was not one of them) Why in the name of everything sacred, did Shayamalan insist on changing the pronunciation for certain characters' names? He was aware, that the television show on which this film is based, created a HUGE following and that people would instantly be turned off to being re-introduced to characters that they know in a different light? (Supposedly, he said that he wanted their ""traditional ethnic pronunciations"" to be spoken. but did not foresee the disconnect that this would create.) There were plenty of other small changes that made absolutely know sense; one was the Blue Spirit mask. It was just supposed to be a mask covering Zuko's face. WHY WAS THERE HAIR ATTACHED TO IT??!?!?! It looked like The Avatar was fighting next to the Great Rumpus Cat from ""Cats."" Absolutely senseless!!! Another was the Bending of the Fire Nation. While in the cartoon, the Firebenders were able to create fire at will; in the film they were only able to bend flames from the surrounding environment. This does not support them being powerful enough to be battling every nation on the planet! If they can only bend lit fires, all the enemy has to do is put their fires out and the fights over!! Major Plot Hole Shayamalan! (The point behind the Fire Nation invading other nations was that they became much more powerful due to Sozin's comet.) Also, the film does not include much of the advanced Fire Nation technology that also made them formidable. Quite possibly the most frustrating of all, was the change in the behavior of Aang in the Avatar state. Instead of the all-powerful and at times violent force of nature, he becomes this passive, peace-keeping light show whose purpose was not to harm anyone but to display his power in order to scare people into submission. Are you freaking kidding me??!?!? Know one wants to see that! The only thing I can give Shayamalan credit for was how he cut the entire first book down (which consisted of 20, thirty minute episodes) into a 1 hour and 43 minute film. For the most part, he included the most critical story plots for establishing the overall premise of book one. And while he cut out certain memorable characters (Like Jet and Bumi) the audience was able to recall each of the events from the film as occurring in Book one of the television show. This accomplishment only deserves so much credit seeing as the outcome of some of these scenes was very rushed. For example, the Liberation of the camp of Earth Benders was just pathetic. (Aang's speech that was meant to inspire the Earthbenders to fight for their own freedom was just awful.) Overall, the film was sloppy, somewhat rushed, horribly cast and an improper representation of a very good show. Huge disappointment; I sincerely hope that there are no follow-ups to this film.",The Last Airbender
228,hennyxu,In three words: What a shame,1,6 May 2013,"Before I start reviewing this movie let me tell you something about the source material. Avatar the last airbender is an animated series with a well told story, humor, a rich culture, and above all a good character development. It's a show with more than 60 episodes divided over three seasons and I really recommend it regardless of your age. The story takes place in a world where people have the ability to bend/control one of the four elements (fire, water, earth, and air). The only person able to bend all four elements is called the Avatar and he is destined to keep/bring balance to the world. However, during a time of war he has gone missing. After a hundred years he is found by a girl named Katara and her brother Soka and together they will have to save the world. Now, this movie written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan is nothing like the aforementioned. The characters are bland, the humor is forced, and the story transition is very fast. This is also the main problem of the movie the story progression and transition. Shyamalan is trying to compress circa 20 episodes of story material into a 1.5 hour movie, which isn't a problem if it is done right. However, this movie is just badly edited together with action, special effects, and character developments consisting of 5 second dialogues, expositions and plot lines. Furthermore, t7hey are mispronouncing a lot of names even though the original series is in English. The only redeeming quality this movie has was the music and the special effects. I give this movie a 4. M. Night Shyamalan should stick with thrillers or try to respect original source materials more. I'll just end this now, people don't watch this movie!",The Last Airbender
229,belldave50,"Flat, Bland, Horrible Acting",3,24 May 2016,"It's not just that this movie failed to draw from the excellent source material, it was just plain bad and forgettable as a stand alone movie.The first problem I noticed was a terrible delivery of lines. Then the characters not feeling like the characters from the show. They were so brooding and angry. Katara and Sokka especially. Like B movie level line delivery in a high budget film. Seemed totally incongruent. The next thing was that they attempted to put too much into one film. Compressing an entire season of the show into it. It make a pace of skipping around as if the movie was simply trying to get it all over with.Even if you didn't have a reference for the bending from the show, it was just absurd how much movement the characters had to make for one little effect. A whole kata to move a rock or make a tiny fireball.I did find the sets and art in the film pretty. The CGI was alright but could've been better.Uuugh. How did such nauseating acting get past the director and editing?",The Last Airbender
230,AntonFokker,Shyamalan has never seen the cartoon that this movie is based of.,1,31 October 2014,"I am a huge fan of Avatar: The last airbender. The story is great, the action is fast en intense, the characters are memorable, and the animation and humor are great. When this film came out in 2010, I didn't bother to see it in theaters. It was until I heard the reaction of everyone calling it one of the worst films ever made, that I watched it on the internet. And I can say like the rest of the world: It is one of the worst films ever made.The story of the film is to keep it short, the first 30 episodes of the cartoon (from the moment that the avatar was found, until the battle of the northern water tripe). Judging from that, you can say that the movie will suck before you have seen it. Al the time is used for exposition of what had happened 5 seconds before, or things that happened of screen. This makes the story rushed, dull, uninteresting and you felt you have waisted 90 minutes of your life.The action in this film, is a joke. In the cartoon, the bender has to make an number of moves to bend the element, but it only took 2 seconds to do that, what makes the action fast and intense. In the film, the bender has to do a entire dance number to move something (thy needed 6 earth benders to move one small rock). The action is slow, boring and completely pointless.Do you remember the funny, memorable characters of the series? You will not find them here. Because of the fact that the movies plot is the first 25 episodes in a 90 minute film, there is no time for character development. You won't give a dame thing about every person in this movie! All the names are mispronounced, because Shyamalan wands respect the original Asian origin. There exist also a thing called RESPECTING THE SORCE MATERIAL!!!! Have you not seen this movie? Than don't watch it. Watch instead the cartoon.",The Last Airbender
231,thescribe7,Only the Worst,1,19 April 2015,"Where to begin with where this went wrong? Look, when you can't even get the f***ing names rights you know there is something wrong! I grew up with the cartoon and I came into this, you know, a little optimistic. If it's good, good, if it's bad, bad. But right from the start, when Aang starts talking is where I'm offended. I will always shutter, ""I had a problem but I'm okay now."" Listen, Aang was a FUN kid in the cartoon! He wasn't sad or didn't act like a crybaby. Yes he got upset at times but it was all in his insecurities. This character you don't even get to see a remote quirky side at all. Katara was brave. She gave the speech that made hopeless earth benders stand up for themselves in a prison of metal! She wasn't a plot exposition explainer. She was a real deal! Aang doesn't even show any interest in her. Outside of the fact he's a gay in this, I wonder why (no offense to gays, you guys have way more color than this piece of cardboard).Sokka (pronounced like Ahsoka from The Clone Wars) is just brooding and angry. The real Sokka's ""jokes"" are way more funny than this guy!Zuko is the only one that I won't say is terrible. I still don't like him but he's the only one that maybe, just maybe, could have bared a reasonable script.The show was quirky but had sooo much life to it! It had tragic moments. It was mythical. It was, above all, colorful. This is just brooding and at the same time more meant for kids than the ""kids"" show! The acting is awkward. The actual bending looks like dance moves your grandmom would cringe at.Just pray, and I mean pray, that M Nightmare Shitupon never goes near this franchise ever again. Or anyone for that matter, because the cartoon is perfect and you can't beat perfect.",The Last Airbender
232,ZildjianDFW,Could've been a lot better.,5,6 July 2010,"First of all, let me start off by saying that, despite the horrible reviews this film is getting, this is NOT the worst movie you'll ever see. It's not great, but it's not the second-coming-of-Ed-Wood that some people are making it out to be. Much of the hatred, I find, stems either from the anti-casters (who take issue with there not being more Asian actors in the film, which was mostly a non-issue for me), or from fans of the show who didn't like this change or that change, or people who aren't familiar with the show and to whom the plot seems silly. Not to mention the Shyamalan detractors, who are likely to subtract a few stars from their rating of a film if his name is over the title.But, to sum up, yes, the movie was definitely a disappointment. First, the pacing is all off. It's way too rushed, especially early on. I don't know, maybe Paramount took a pair of scissors to it, not trusting the material or the audience, but it's definitely rushed. Generally, the casting was okay to me. Noah Ringer's acting was a tad awkward in places, but he did okay, considering he had no previous acting experience. He manages to portray Aang pretty accurately, and his martial arts skills are incredible. Dev Patel is one of the highlights of the film as Zuko. Jackson Rathbone did well as Sokka, but I was less impressed by Nicola Peltz as Katara. Most of the older actors did well, though the guy who played Zhao was a tad annoying sometimes (maybe he was meant to be).One of the biggest problems I had was with how the characters were portrayed. Especially Katara and Sokka. In the show, Katara was a formidable fighter in her own right, prone to be motherly, bossy, and sometimes lovably preachy. Here she's pretty bland, though. Her basic purpose in this movie seems to be to say, ""You can do it, Aang!"" In the show, Sokka was one of the main sources of comic relief, constantly complaining and making sarcastic remarks. Though Rathbone does well with what he was given, the character, like Katara, is bland, stripped of much of his humor. The only highlight are a couple of nice scenes with Princess Yue towards the end. As for Iroh, his wise side was done well, but we saw precious little of his lazy, pleasure-loving side. Also, there is very little chemistry between the characters. There's none of the family-feel of the main group, none of the feelings Aang has for Katara, and little of the great chemistry between Zuko and Iroh. If they had made the movie longer, worked more on the pacing, and spent more time establishing the characters and their relationships, it would've worked wonders.Even though there were flaws in the casting and acting, there wasn't much in the way of writing for the actors to work with. Shyamalan continues his recent trend of writing lazy dialogue. The sets looked pretty good (especially the southern Air Temple), but the costumes, I thought, looked cheapish; they LOOKED like costumes. Also, there was an annoying habit of mispronouncing names - it was distracting, and I can't think of any reason why they did it (couldn't have been a mistake). Also, I thought the opening of the film was cheesy. They tried to emulate the opening sequence of the show, with the silhouettes doing examples of bending in front of a red background. It worked in the show, but it seemed silly here. Also, the written introduction, a la Star Wars, didn't help either.So yes, there's plenty not to like, but there are also some strong-points.First, the martial arts were very well done. And the CGI looked decent as well. The music, by James Newton Howard, is impressive (what else would you expect from Howard?). Also, the film got a little better towards the end, and there were moments where I actually got absorbed into it briefly.To sum up, it's not the worst movie of all time. I've seen worse films, and, despite what some people say, it has its strengths. But yes, it could've been MUCH better, too. Maybe the problem was too much studio involvement. Maybe it was just hard to compress that much material into a movie-length format. Maybe Shyamalan is just in a bad rut (we know he has talent, as his early films show). Or maybe it's some combination of all of them. It just seemed...a little lazily done. Definitely one of the more disappointing cinematic experiences I've had in years. So much potential, so little payoff.",The Last Airbender
233,neji107,Awful-tar : The Last Shyamalan Movie I Ever Want to See,3,1 July 2010,"M. Night's career as a director has been spiraling downwards ever since The Sixth Sense, we can all agree. But on The Last Airbender, his most recent major project, his credibility simply plummeted.You know that embarrassing feeling you get when you're watching an amateur movie? Yeah, you'll get a lot of that if you spend your money to watch this in the theaters, which is ill-advised. The Last Airbender simply had no direction, and the script flopped around aimlessly to try and wrap up an entire season of the animated TV show, Avatar (which it is based off of), in 103 minutes. The dialogue was appalling and the poor development of story made audience members moan and groan. An entire love relationship is created with the single, randomly narrated line of, ""They became friends very quickly"", while two characters who have just met allot the other a generous five second stare each. Embarrassing scriptwriting such as this is what caused the failing of The Last Airbender. This was NOT helped by the mediocre acting performances of Noah Ringer, Nicola Peltz, and Seychelle Gabriel.Poor acting, poor scripting, poor directing. What was there to like? Sadly the action sequences, few and far between, are hardly engaging enough to satisfy any moviegoer's appetite, for lack of other elements. I was told by friends that while the movie stayed true to the general plot of the animated TV series, the action was poorly represented. Underpowered, and a bit superfluous in movement, the much needed fight scenes became almost tedious to watch.The world of Avatar was curious; I'll give it that. The environment with the four elemental nations, each with its own unique race, which far from appearing racist, was actually one of the few ideas that made the movie... somewhat interesting.A general question continued to run through my mind... It was almost as if M. Night thought to himself, ""What is the LEAST I could do with my budget?"" And I think he found the perfect answer with The Last Airbender.I award M. Night's latest masterpiece in his spiraling antics a generous 4/10.",The Last Airbender
234,Michael-d-duncan,Meh. Solid B,6,29 October 2010,"My little brother (17yrs) asked me to take him to go see this. He's not a huge fan of the series but the movie had piqued his interest. I've never seen the series. He warned me that this would be somewhat of a kids movie and really I didn't care. I like to go see movies for 2 reasons. 1: to think, I like over interpreting and analyzing movies that just me, and 2: To have fun. I like movies period and if it's fun I'll enjoy it. This movie however was just boring. The effects were alright (woo-hoo 3d) but even the previews made more dynamic use of the 3D. Both my brother and I were looking at each other half way through thinking, ""how freakin' long have we been here!"" Often predictable, the plot takes an excruciatingly long time to develop. I felt sorry for the moms, that had to sit with 8 year old with a 2 second attention span! So why did I give this a 6 not a 2? Because it's not the worst movie out there, it's meh... okay. M Night has been getting a bad rap lately but even his lower quality flicks still have a huge chunk of originality that other film makers just don't bother with.

235,kevcoop7,A spectacle of failure,1,10 June 2016,"Backstory: In 2005, I heard of a show on Nickelodeon called ""Avatar: The Last Airbender."" I saw the opening episode of this show, and I was immediately hooked on it, but I was only able to catch whatever episodes I could see, and those episodes never disappointed. And I was blown away by the series finale, Sozin's Comet. When I heard they were making a movie based on the show, I was excited for it. The trailers made it look like it caught the spirit of the show. Unfortunately, it did not.I hated this movie. Like, HATED!!!! It destroyed the mysticism, the fun, the comedy, the drama, and the adventure of the show! Now, let me get into what I feel are the most absolute WORST parts of this movie. 1) Too much narration: By this, I mean Water bender #1 (Not using the name Katara) was basically used as an exposition vessel. I know exposition is necessary in order to keep the audience about plot and story elements (No pun intended), but this movie was just overbearing in this exposition.2) Aang is not Aang: This was the most criminal thing in this movie, and that's saying something. In the show, Aang was this fun loving, light-hearted, knucklehead Airbender who became serious when the situation required it, or when he was in a major battle. Aang (in this movie) was a total downer and had no fun in him whatsoever. HE Didn't EVEN WANT TO BE THE FREAKING AVATAR!!! I know Aang in the show was reluctant, but at least he embraced it after the Southern Air temple.3) Where was the duel between Water Bender #1 and Fire Bender #1 (Not using Zuko): That was pathetic. Also, The Northern Water Tribe didn't even look remotely like it was being bombarded by Zhao and the Fire benders. One other thing... What the HECK was up with the Earth Bender prison?! The prison in the show was metal for obvious reasons.Sorry this was long, but, I had to vent my anger on this movie.Please... don ever watch this if your a fan, and even if you are not a fan, you won't like it either because it has a crappy story, terrible characters, green screen, and cinematography.",The Last Airbender

It far better then many of the reviewers here would lead us to believe. Some of the acting is a bit stilted like many action pictures but most of the performances were good to excellent. The cinematography and set design were beautiful and fun. The score was wonderful and not obtrusive. The story was lean but this is adventure not literature. The film did not suffer from the fault of most of M. Night Shyamalan's films after Sixth Sense, that is, claustrophobia. There was a feeling that this takes place over vast distances. It did suffer, as Lady in Water did, of having the characters explaining all the mythology to each other. That is tiresome, and the film did seem short. But all in all it is a good film. I am sure it will do well in DVD. And who would believe it? Filmed in Pennsylvania!",The Last Airbender

I soon realized that this movie should be included in a study in ""what not to do"" in film making. From start to finish, the story and dialog were so cliché and unbelievable. The acting was simply terrible. I laughed through most of the film. I thought, ""This had to be written by some 19 year old who grew up sitting in front of the VCR without literature or education."" Even the music was amateurish. Wow, was I ever shocked at the ending credits to see it was written by M. Night Shyamalan, the music composed by James Newton Howard, and the movie produced by Kennedy and Marshall. How could this happen?

239,lvilaguillen,Don't think it's that bad...,7,24 November 2010,"Sorry if some of you get disappointed about my opinion. But... I don't think is as bad as you said in your comments, honestly. I think that it needs to improve, yeah I know. I also watch the TV series, and is not that bad. I wasted maybe the ''funny thing'' of the series, that made it some sort of special, but well, it's just the first... I've seen and read (so important) Harry Potter the entire collection of books, also the movies... and well, the first ones are close to the books, but though for kids... how could you expect more for ''children books''? The we've got the following 2 / 3 movies (Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, Order of Phoenix) that are not bad, but have got less close to the books... but they're actually not bad, really. Then... the 2 last... whoever says ''are bad'' honestly he/she can shoot in his/her head... because they were growing gorgeous and even more marvelous! So... give it a chance guys, maybe is not what we expected, but we need to see MORE to know if it can give us a close relation to the movie. Try to think more ''objective'' not so personal. It needs a little more fun and a little bit more acting effort... but, after all, they're kids! Remember Daniel Radcliffe, it was really tough for HP's role because of his personality, but well, gave a chance and noted he grown up, so his role is good enough now. We need to be more flexible, in my opinion. And, again, I watch the series, so I'm taking from the understanding point of view.",The Last Airbender
240,mgarland,A lot better than I expected; a very enjoyable movie!,8,4 December 2010,"I have watched only a handful of the original series. I really had no expectations going into watching this movie, and I realize that probably helped a lot.It starts off at a fast pace, and I was prepared for that, since I hadn't seen enough of the series to know what was going to be happening. I would just have to sit back and enjoy it. And, enjoy it I did. On Blu-ray and with surround sound this movie looked and sounded fantastic. It had amazing effects and gorgeous locales. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, and I wanted more when it ended.I thought the story and the characters worked just fine. I didn't have any trouble following the story, it was paced just right, and there were plenty of touching moments to give a little unexpected depth. And, it felt like it could stand alone, and not like a chopped off piece of a movie where you felt left wanting in the middle of a plot.Now, I definitely want to watch the animated series. Granted, I might wind up liking the series more, but that's okay. I felt like M. Night Shyamalan did a fantastic job. And I'm not a big Shyamalan fan since he started going downhill with the shudderingly bad ""The Happening"".I only give it an 8 out of 10 because it did feel a little rushed. It needed more backstory and balance (Earth didn't really get its due in this one.)",The Last Airbender
241,WondrousMoose,The worst part is that they've threatened us with a sequel for years now.,2,18 July 2017,"Avatar: The Last Airbender is an animated series that aired on Nickelodeon from 2005 to 2008. Widely acclaimed for its animation, story, characters, humor, fight choreography, philosophical/religious/sociopolitical themes, and more, it received a Primetime Emmy Award, a Peabody Award, multiple Annie Awards, etc., over its three-season run.Its 2010 live-action film adaptation currently holds a 6% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and swept the Razzies.I was an enormous fan of the series during its original run but had moved on by the time the adaptation hit theaters. News of its release was exciting, but I had moved on at that point and didn't pay it any attention. It wasn't until Avatar came to Netflix a few years later that I revisited it all; it quickly became my favorite TV series and remains one of the best that I have seen. Around that time, though, I also heard the film's reputation: people were calling it one of the all-time worst film adaptations of a TV series. I'm thankful that I was warned, as the tens of thousands of fans who initially saw it in theaters were left horribly, horribly disappointed.In the world of Avatar, some members of the Four Nations are able to control one of the four respective elements: water, earth, fire, and air. Known as benders, these people can use their skills for travel, construction, and of course fighting. At any point in time, there is one person, known as the avatar, who is capable of bending all four elements. Tasked with keeping the Four Nations in balance with each other, the avatar is reborn into a different nation with each incarnation. The film begins at a time in which the current avatar has disappeared, and the Fire Nation has nearly conquered the world.Two siblings from the Southern Water Tribe, Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) and Katara (Nicola Peltz), discover the avatar Aang (Noah Ringer) frozen in a shell of ice underwater. Aang has only learned his native airbending, so they travel to the North Pole in search of a waterbending master. Hot on their trail is Zuko, prince of the Fire Nation, and his Uncle Iroh. Can the kids make it in one piece? Is The Last Airbender less critically acclaimed than Catwoman?Where to even begin with this film? The idea behind it is a mess. Shyamalan wrote and directed a live-action adaptation of an animated series, attempting to condense a season's worth of information into a single, 100-minute movie. Beyond this fundamental flaw, almost everything is wrong. The acting, writing, pacing, and characters are all so bafflingly and aggressively bad that I have to remind myself that there were human minds behind the whole project.Watching this movie is an exercise in tedium. Almost everything on the screen is brown or a dark, washed-out blueish color, and each character's line delivery is dull and slow. Scenes jump around and then sit for too long. Characters mispronounce each others' names, and key characters are left out entirely.There are probably dozens of written and filmed reviews online that offer detailed explanations of every way in which The Last Airbender failed, and trust me, I have only scratched the surface. My job is to tell you that it sucks and to give a sense of why. It can be hilariously bad in the right mindset, but if you have a choice between it and anything else, don't waste your time.",The Last Airbender

Sadly, this film is not finished since we are only dealing with book 1 (and I see no evidence that there will be another anytime soon). Looking at the teaser, and even the final previews many of us had high hopes, but wondered how M.N.S. could make such a huge jump from his usual work. Though the martial arts in the film was intricate, and the cast well coached in movement, their performances were totally useless. Not only we were watching unknowns, but the dialog was lousy, the acting was dry, and there was no emotion. There was no connection - I honestly didn't really feel like taking sides at any point in the conflict. There was no pride, no cheer for victory, just blah.

The effects were beautiful and mesmerizing and well done, but that was nowhere near enough to save the film.Like most -if not all- who saw this movie, I am a fan of the series and it was clear Shyamalan tried to shove too much into it. He tried to condense over twenty, half-hour episodes into an hour-an-a-half-long movie, and he didn't do it well. Bad casting, bad acting, bad plot and the mispronunciation of character names (which he said were 'how they're supposed to be pronounced') simply ruined the movie. ""Disappointed"" is an understatement to anyone who is a fan of the series.Honestly, I'm beginning to think that the twists Shyalaman is famous for are becoming whether or not he makes a good movie.Just... don't watch this, and if you do, watch it muted.

245,J5iftY5iveXtreme,Ehhh...could've been so much better,5,2 July 2010,"Movies based on cartoon shows, like movies based on video games, don't exactly have a good reputation, as evidenced by last year's flop ""Dragon Ball Evolution."" Movies like LOTR and ""Harry Potter"" prove movies based on books can be classics. Why can't the same be for cartoons, such as this adaptation by M. Night Shyamalan of the popular animated show on Nickelodeon?I won't have time to explain what show is about (a quick Google will do), but it's considered to be one of the best to come out of the program. With a source material like that, can ""The Last Airbender"" be the long-awaited Messiah of cartoon show-based live-action films?It's hard not to compare this movie to the original cartoon. If anything, it's necessary: That will judge the film's value as an adaptation (and ultimately, as a movie). And for all you ""Avatar"" lovers out there (myself included), I'm pleased to say that this movie is basically faithful to the original series--events-wise, that is. There are some slight changes in this movie, which aren't too bad. The special effects really truly did show bending must be like had they been real. The costumes and sets really did bring the world of ""Avatar"" to life.The basic events are pretty much true to the show despite some deviations. I have no doubt that Shyamalan is a genuine fan of the series. So this makes this a good adaptation, doesn't it? Unfortunately, when trying to get the world and mythology of ""Avatar"" right, Shyamalan failed with the PRESENTATION of it. The original show had a story that was concise and made sense, but here, the pace is too fast, one suddenly jumps into another, and there is basically no flow. New characters (like the lemur-bat Momo) are introduced too quickly and almost never seen again. To someone who hasn't seen the show, I've no doubt that they'd find some scenes random and awkward. The movie acted more like a summary of the show rather than an adaptation. Scenes that were powerful and effective don't have the same effect here. Shyamalan got the story right, but he doesn't know how to tell it, and this affects the film's value as a stand-alone movie.The characters in the show had so many interesting personalities that made them likable, but none of that is to be found here. In here, they are basically drones whose only purpose is to move the plot forward, but no attention is given to them as characters.These characters weren't helped by the actors, whose performances are a mixed bag. I won't argue about the race of the actors, and heck, I won't even argue about the wrong pronunciation of the characters' names. But I do want good actors. Perhaps it's too harsh to judge the young main actors, such as as Noah Ringer in the lead; for a first-timer, he's okay--but the school-play kind of okay. He has his share of cringe-worthy moments, as with Nicola Peltz. Jackson Rathborne, although not Oscar material, is okay, but seems somewhat amateurish. Now I loved Dev Patel in here, but this isn't his best performance. A really competent director (and script) could have really gotten phenomenal performances out of these young actors. The best performances, obviously, are from the adults, mainly Shaun Toub and Cliff Curtis as the villains, who are more menacing in the show.The original show had wonderful dialogue and so many memorable quotes--unfortunately, none of them is in this movies. Instead, we get conversation that sound like lectures, some even preachy. I know that, being a long series, not everything can be included in the movie, and some parts have to be explained by the dialogue. But here, they either explain too little or too much. The story is spoon-fed to us without giving a chance to appreciate it. The narration made sense in the beginning, but in others, it was redundant, even unnecessary. We're told that they've arrived in the Northern Water Tribes when that's exactly what we're seeing. We're being told that they're learning bending, but we don't see their struggles. The story of Prince Zuko's disgrace and banishment (told in flashbacks like in the show) just happens to happen at the most random moment.I know that adaptations can't always surpass their original source material. But they should at least be as good as the original, and if not, as I've said before, they should be good in their own right. Well, in the case of ""The Last Airbender,"" the original show is superior. What's more, this movie can't stand on its own.For fans, the only suspense that this movie has to offer is seeing your favorite characters and scene be reenacted in real-life, with the help of some really special SFX. I was really thrilled by the final battle scene in the end--but only because I knew what was going to happen, and the fact that all of this was happening on the big screen and in high def, and in 3D no less. In the end, why not stick with the show? Non-fans can get excited because this is a story they've never heard before, but this isn't the best telling of the story.As a summer blockbuster, this is nothing special.It's a shame, because this had so much potential.

Now that we've established the well-loved T.V. series Avatar: The Last Airbender was widely loved, what the hell could've happened to ""The Last Airbender"", the 2010 movie, co-produced and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. The live action 2010 movie earned a Rotten Tomatoes score ""Average Tomatometer"" of just 5%, as well as a Rotten Tomatoes ""Average Audience Score"" of 30%.What went wrong? Sadly, this movie has earned a legacy of how simply terrible it was. Everyone WANTED to enjoy this movie. Names were mispronounced, characters didn't look like they did in the cartoon, and the whole dynamic of the show was ruined by the movie. Possibly worst of all, Zuko, the conflicted antagonist of the show, loses all his complexity in the movie. By the end of the T.V. series, Zuko should be well understood by the viewer of the show. He's a confused teenager who chasing The Avatar because he feels he has to. Zuko's character development in the show makes him to be considered one of the greatest characters in animated T.V. history, more highly regarded than the main character of the show itself, something that rarely happens.There are many issues with live action film adaptation of Avatar: The Last Airbender. While I went over many of the largest issues, there are even more I haven't gone over. One that annoyed fans the most was the inaccurate portrayal of the characters races. Uncle Iroh should have likely been Asian, and seeing as Zuko is his nephew, we should also be the same race. However, Iroh is while and Zuko is middle eastern in the movie. While the show doesn't define their actual races (mostly due to their world literally having a different lay out), skin tones, ways of dressing, the buildings in their homelands done make it hard to narrow it down. While races are just one issue in a whole list of the movie adaptations issues, it's quite glaring.",The Last Airbender
248,MaarssenTheater,Does not deserve so many one-votes,7,2 January 2012,"I did not know the TV series and saw this in HD on a big TV with a great surround system. After reading the bad reviews, I expected I might not finish watching. However, I did and I enjoyed the movie.* Beautiful scenery and costumes * Good special effects * Great score * Cool concept of air/fire/earth bending that was new to me and well executed * Simple adventure story, but entertaining enough for meI do agree that the running time is perhaps short for such a movie with high production values and apparently based on a longer story line. More time would be required to lay down the groundwork for a sequel and to explain the history of the storyline to those who are exposed to the series for the first time, like me.In all, I definitely do not think this movie is nearly the waste of time some of the reviewers here make it out to be. I would definitely watch a part two, if one is ever made.",The Last Airbender

It's like M.Night was out from the get-go to sabotage excellent source material. The kids and I are big fans of the original animated series; but I would count watching this reeking mis-fire as one of the most disappointing entertainment flubs we've ever made. I was totally disillusioned with the movie adaptation by about 7 minutes into it; forcing myself to watch on out of respect for the few few half-decent actors who were at least trying to salvage it. I really hope the bumbling incompetence manifest in the adapting and directing of this monumental cinematic flop doesn't sabotage the acting careers of any of the young talent. And it is painfully obvious that the director had low respect for the source material, even munging the names perhaps in a vain attempt to make it more ""his""?

254,vladtopliceanu,"If you are over 15, don't!",6,19 December 2011,"Shyamalan...what the hell man? From being nominated for 3 Academy Awards(Best Director, Best Picutre and Best Screenplay) for The Sixth Sense you now won with this film 3 Golden Rasberry Awards in the same categories.OK, let's take it piece by piece. The screenplay is so childish. I don't think it's very stupid, but it's clearly for 13 year old kids. Lines like ""What's the spirit world, grandma?"" proves this. I will not blame Shyamalan for this. Let's say he wanted to do a kids film, but what about the directing dude? This is a badly directed film. And I am wondering how did you drop from The Sixth Sense to this? Moving on let's speak about another producer(Shyamalan is also a producer) Let's talk about Frank Marshall. He is a great film producer and has earned 5 Academy Award nominations for Best Picture. I mean who didn't love Raiders of the Lost Ark or The Curious Case of Benjamin Button? How come he produced this? Also, the entire cast did a horrible job with only one exception. This is an incredible film because it failed on so many levels.But I have to mention the 2 or maybe 3 cool things about this film. The first one is Shaun Toub as Iroh. He was great. The other is the story/lore of this entire universe. It fascinated me all the way. I consider this to be one of the most cool stories I have ever heard, but it is put so badly into motion, it almost made me cry. A special mention about the ending, I really liked it because it left me wanting a sequel, even though this is a horrible movie.Why is this not a 5? The Story. If I liked the story so much, why didn't I give it a 7? Well considering I gave movies like Chicago or Invictus 7, it just didn't feel right.All in all this is a kids film, so if you are under 15, go watch it, maybe you will like it.",The Last Airbender
255,ACMcC24,It wasn't that bad.,7,14 December 2010,"Reviewing the movie, I can say that the back story and time lapses are told through narration which is sporadic. It helped to alleviate any confusion on the viewer's part though it added to the choppiness of the film. The beginning is awkward to watch since the movie - like the cartoon - begins in the middle of a story and doesn't seem to even out and really pick up pace until halfway through. The special effects, cinematography, and score were amazing and despite people's opinions that the acting was bad, it really wasn't. This is the acting premier for Noah Ringer and for a beginner he gave his character, Aang, emotion. The Chi movements or dances that helped build Chi could've ruined the movie had the actors looked awkward or inexperienced, but they pulled it off wonderfully, especially on Ringer's part. The other young actors in this have limited acting experience behind them, so to have done the job they did (no doubt in front of a green screen) I think they did just fine. As for changes in the story, the plot is the same though certain details were changed due to constancy issues in the cartoon. In the cartoon, firebenders could create fire which is inconsistent with the abilities of other benders. The movie addresses this issue by only allowing firebenders to bend fire, not create it (though it did mention how the arrival of Sozin's comet would give them this ability). Yes, the names of the characters were given correct pronunciation in the movie but, when you're given a $150 million movie, no director would want to butcher another culture's language just because the cartoon did. Amongst a few other changes were Aang's difficulty in mastering waterbending not because he was incapable, but because of his grief over losing his people and his home. This is an issue the cartoon only mildly addresses over all 3 books. The ending where Aang deals with the Fire Nation's attack on the Water Tribe in the Northern Territory is different. I actually prefer the movie's ending to the animated version simply because it was a more feasible ending. The biggest change though was the sense of humor or lack of it. Where the cartoon was thoroughly enjoyable with a lot of comedy, the movie was heavier with Aang feeling the weight of his responsibilities and the consequences of his running away.I understand the loyalty a fan base will have and the issues the Avatar fans have are really no different than LotR's fans had after each movie was made. Any changes made to a movie for any reason will be met with anger, whether the changes were justified or not. Anyone watching a movie based off of a series should keep in mind that a great deal will be left out of a movie simply because of time restraints. The story's time frame will seem warped in a movie that isn't even two hours long, especially when a person is familiar with the time frame associated with the series. Overall, if Shyamalan had been given the green light to make Book 2, I would've gone to the theater to see it.",The Last Airbender

257,yora217,very bad movie.,1,12 January 2011,"Honestly, i really wanted to like this movie, since i am a huge fan of the TV series. I saw this movie, and really really hated it. i had previously seen early screenings and trailers of this movie and thought it looked fantastic, i didn't even care that some of the actors or characters looked miscast. i thought it would still try to be good. Nope, it was really bad. Noah Ringer is obviously new to the whole Hollywood business, this movie does not hide that fact. He has a long way to go before he is to be recognized as a good actor. this movie will surely scar his future career as well as the other actors. I don't believe Dev Patel will be fazed by this movie however seeing as how he won critical acclaim from Slumdog Millionaire. In this movie however, he did not shine as the antagonist, Princ Zuko. He really tried, i will admit, but the script was really messed up as well as whoever told him to act the way he did. I don't blame the actors, as much as i blame the director, the screenwriters, and the script writers. They really need to go back to the Hollywood school or maybe have an early retirement. Its things like this that ruin potential franchises. Overall, i would not recommend this movie, even to hardcore fans of the TV show. If you have to see this movie, rent it, and then dispose of it the next day. Just trust me, its forgettable, its worthless, and if they are serious about making a sequel to this disaster, they will need a new everyone as far as the production is concerned, and the actors, well i think they can stay so long as someone gives them more character depth and at least some decent dialogue.",The Last Airbender
258,goc6283,A painful directorial sabotage of wonderful source material,1,3 November 2014,"You know there is something wrong when there is more back-story than actual dialogue.As someone who has personally watched both the original series, as well as is someone who staying with the current post-series (as per this review, season 4, episode 5,) there does not seem to be something here for either the fans of the series or others, even with the white-washing of the acting aside.Why it wouldn't appeal to fans: They got the four fighting styles/bending methods all wrong. People do random movement and boom something shows up. The purpose of the system is to convey the various forms of eastern martial arts, not air karate. For example, when an earth bender pushes to the right, rocks go that way. he doesn't do 50 movements and something shows up. It looks silly Pronunciation of the names (I don't mind translating a name to the traditional name, just translate all of them, or use actors who actually sound like they would speak said language.) Fire bending requires outside fire to be usable. The major point of fire-bending is that it comes from the heart and the body. How can later movies been made if characters couldn't communicate that the will was the problem with fire-bending? It leaves a massive plot hole. How could the air nation have been invaded without massive amounts of fire being there (which there isn't? The avoidance of major characters from the show, among others the Kioshi warriors (who serve a major plot point later.) They concentrate the movie on 5-6 episodes.Why it wouldn't appeal to others: The movie itself is devoid of a lot of action and what isn't shown is conveyed in both a meaningless and boring way.There is more back-story than actual viewable plot.3D is bad, the general graphics are bad as well.",The Last Airbender

It's quite possible this has influenced my final opinion in a positive way because I was prepared to kill a Sunday afernoon sitting through it to judge for myself how awful it would be. Surprise, I didn't think it was awful at all, there was a surprisingly decent story about opposing factions represented by opposing elements (fire and water) and successors who are to inherit a position of power and the sacrifices that come with that position but are reluctant to accept their new place in life. The supposedly mediocre bending of elements looked perfectly fine, especially for a 2010's life-action movie. Sure, I believe you, the anime did it better, and so are most forms of animation better at one-upping life-action in creating a spectacle. It comes with the limits and freedoms offered by the chosen medium. This movie is nothing spectacular and I think I can kind of see how it would have bored fans of the anime.I will grudgingly admin an animated movie of The Last Airbender would likely be far more spectacular and impressive.

This movie made me think over what the director was thinking or smoking in the making of this commercial disaster. I have never felt so let down by a movie ever since the I sat through the son of the mask, sequel of the mask. For the love of everything right and innocent, don't go to this sin of a movie. ITS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME.The beginning was fine until I heard Soka's name turn into what I thought sounded like Asoka from star Wars the Clone Wars. Not only that, but the whole ship scene was missing. Thats when Aang or Ong finds out he is over 112 years old. Instead, M. flipped the whole flow of the story by adding scenes and taking some away. Why did this happen to a perfectly beautiful story, I will never know. This was like my worst nightmares come alive. They messed up Aang's water training ad any personality that was previously given to them. They left out some of the old masters of the white lotus, which really agitated me and left no hope in this movie.The thing that made me confused was how Monk Gyatso was not only not aged correctly, but he was an entirely different race. Every single nation had their own race that made no sense. Air was mixed along with white. Water was native American(that actually made sense though). Fire was middle eastern and Earth was Asian...? Does that sound right to you? Of course it doesn't. Because the fire nation was based on imperialist Japan, not middle easterners. If anything, they should be the air nomads. It would make it seem just slightly better.The only scenes that had effort put into it was the blue spirit scene and the Siege of the North pole. And though the cgi looked amazing, it never popped out to me in 3D. This was a promise that made me distrust anything involved this movie.

Or actually if I look at it from a different point of view, maybe I can say that he has done it again. Based off of his last few movies, which were huge disappointments, The Last Airbender certainly followed suit. With a spectacular trailer and a well-written cartoon series to back it up, it was sad to see that the great storyteller, Shyamalan, did a horrible job at telling the story of The Last Airbender.The original story of The Last Airbender is rich in detail and it was sad to see it crammed into an hour and forty-five minute movie. The Last Airbender is based off of the successful cartoon, Avatar: The Last Airbender. In the cartoon one of the final battles is a 90-minute two-part episode and yet Shyamalan tries to fit one third of the whole Airbender story into 103 minutes. It is just impossible. Me being a fan of the cartoon, I am one to say that if you can't do it right, then find someone who can. I mean we see what happened to the Batman franchise until they found Chris Nolan.

I have seen Avatar: The Last Airbender. I have seen ever episode and it took me on an emotional journey and ultimately became one of the best TV shows that I have ever seen. Its original characters and story kept you hooked from start to finish and gave you a moving emotional roller coaster ride from start till end. The same can be said for The Last Airbender, I was take on an emotional ride... from shocked, to sad, to angry and then left in a state of depression. Why did I waste that time.This movie draws its content from the first season of the pure-gold show it almost shares a name with. It takes us on the journey of Aang (The Avatar) being discovered and something happens and then they're at a place with snow and there is a fish in a bag and then someone makes some fire and then a wave and then some credits. Seriously, this is what the movie feels like. There are so many problems with this film it is easier to point out some strong points. 1. The CGI is alright. 2. It finally ends. 3. Thankfully it isn't getting 2 more installments. If you are in the mood for a fun family action flick then steer clear of this. If you want an amazing story about a young boy who is preserved in ice for 100 years, awoken only to find that it has descended into a violent war that only he can end... well you're going to have to clear you schedule and watch the source material, Avatar: The Last Airbender.1 star.

The actors looked similar, Zuko's scar was almost unseen as to the series it was clear as day. Appa looked creepy and non-friendly(I don't see how hard it could be to have a closeup of Appa with special effects rather than CGI. I mean look at ""where the wild things are"" or ""Star Wars""). Momo(the flying monkey) unique identity is almost gone with no close ups of him. Aesthetics are moderate but still out of place. The Fire Lord had a long straight black beard and hardly showed his face till book 3.

E.G frustration, depression, weariness (and this would mix with Uncle Iroh comedy')Uncle Iroh did not look the part and neither his character, everything was off. Nothing was right about him.Everything was so badly written, I can't keep track on how bad it is. The storyline is a mockery of the series. Bending the elements did not have dance movies that where aesthetically pleasing. Every movement had an elemental effect, it wasn't eye candy in itself even though it looked great but in the movie there are so many useless moves that do no coincide with the elemental bending(why???). Firebenders need another source of fire?.This movie is just so bad. Nothing goes according to the series yet why are the same characters in it, and the storyline?. if this was Avatar: The Last Earthbender Then at least there wont be a parallel to the series and the movie could/would drag itself down, but at the moment it also makes a mockery of the series.",The Last Airbender

I had seen a couple of episodes with my family, and I have to say I quite like it: it was better than most of the rubbish that is on today! I have to say that I was really disappointed with this movie. The characters were nothing like they were in the show (and for someone who is not an avid watcher to be able to deduce that is quite appalling), and WHY OH WHY could they not pronounce the character's names properly!!! There was no character development and the acting was very poor (although the lack of a decent script could have played a major part in that.) Granted some of the settings were impressive, as were the special effects, although why he raised a massive tidal wave at the end and did nothing with it other than sink a handful of ships is completely beyond me! Take the advice that has been given by myself and fellow reviewers: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!",The Last Airbender
270,shanebeacham,Shyamalan Needs To Stop Making Movies,3,3 July 2010,"I'm quite a fan of the show Avatar: The Last Airbender, and I was actually looking really forward to the movie version. Even with M. Night Shymalan directing it. So I got a chance to see it today. And you know what? It's bad. Really really bad.The basic plot of the film is that the four nations of Earth, Water, Fire and Air are all ruled by the Fire Nation. Later two characters named Soka and Katara find a boy frozen in a large iceberg, named Aang, who turns out to be the Avatar, who is meant to master all four elements in order to defeat the Fire Lord. Meanwhile, the fire lord's son, Zuko, is trying to capture the Avatar in order to regain his honor. Or something like that.Now normally I don't review movies based off other material on how well they compare to the source material, but I feel I have to make an exception with this one. This film was rushed. They basically took episodes from the first season and either shortened them and rushed to the next scene or didn't use them at all. And I know some people are gonna give me crap for basing this review on how it compares to the show, but at least the show had story arc, character development, and actual entertainment.We don't know anything about these characters. Everything is moved from one scene after another. We don't get time to stop and let these people breathe or give us a reason to care about them.Every action scene in this movie was anti climatic. It's just one big tease after another, where you think something really cool is gonna happen like what was in the actual cartoon and it just screws it up. That or they are poorly shot and have terrible CGI.And I know this is really weird to talk about, but what was up with how they pronounced names in this movie? Since when is Aang sound like ""Ung""? Since when does Soka sound like ""Suka""? That just annoyed me the whole time.There are several other things that I could point out, but I think you already got the idea. The Last Airbender is a waste of time, and if you wanna see it so badly, you can just buy the cartoon seasons on DVD instead. This is another perfect example why M. Night Shymalan needs to stop making movies because it's just embarrassing.I give this movie a 3/10.",The Last Airbender
271,Neos_back,I finally built up the courage to watch it.... for 5min.,1,20 December 2016,"OK, after what 6 years or so I finally got round to giving this another go.I will start by saying I've watched everything in the Avatar series (Last Airbender & Korra) and this... this is not Avatar.Summary: Acting 1/10 Casting 1/10 Pronunciation of names 1/10 CGI 8/10Lets start with the obvious, the casting. Why on earth did they take a highly successful show, and decide that they should change the race of all the characters? The entire settings is based upon a kung fu world, which would indicate a more ""Asian"" ethnicity. But no, the bad guys have to be brown, the good guys have to be white and the poor local people are Asian. I mean did nobody mention that changing the race of the fire nation from Chinese to Indian was not the best idea? Or changing the water nation from Inuit/ Mongolian to white European/ American was a bit daft?The acting, was in a world... AWFUL. Saka was and is my favourite character and they utterly ruined him. Aang (or Ong as they say in the film *shudder*) is just so devoid of joy, the complete opposite of how it should be. The ""bending""... hahahahhahahahahahahahha just wow. Bending was conceptualised to be based of specific schools of kung fu, in this film they wave their arms around randomly and then something happens.I mean how hard can it be to watch the show and simply translate that into a movie? They have the cast, they have the dialogue, all it needed was to be brushed up with some fancy CGI and it would've been a hit.This film was a failure in every respect. Save your time and just watch the animated series.",The Last Airbender
272,disisdkat,If you liked Star Wars this is of the same quality,9,1 April 2011,"I probably gave this a higher rating than I would have normally simply because there were so many grossly and unfair poor reviews. Under other circumstances I would rate it an 8. The film begins slowly and there is unnecessary text that detracts from the beginning of the film and makes it feel lower in quality than it is. The further you get into the film the more attractive and interesting it becomes. The characters begin to form depth and it really is beautiful to watch. I enjoyed the story and hope it does not end abruptly because it gathered such harsh and unfair reviews. I am assuming that much of the vitriol comes from readers who cannot tolerate their story being taken from them and put on to film where much of what they loved is lost. I detested Le Guins Earthsea. I also felt that way about the early Harry Potter movies. It was not until I was able to treat the movies as a different body than the books that I was able to enjoy them and enjoy them I did. If you have not read the books and want a visually pleasing moving with an interesting story (remember this is only the beginning, so we better hope there are follow-ups), then I recommend this for the family. I think pre-teens especially would enjoy it.",The Last Airbender
273,asimov72455,Three types of viewers hate this movie.,6,12 February 2021,"It seems to me from my reading viewers' comments on The Last Airbender that those that hate this movie fall into three basic types: those that can't stand it that this movie isn't a duplicate of the cartoon on which the film is based; those that hate M. Night Shyamalan and wish to see him fail; and those that are ""me too"" types that have heard and read bad reviews of this movie and want to jump on the bandwagon, not wishing to be left behind or (shudder) appear to have an original thought. As for me, The Last Airbender is neither the best nor the worst of Shyamalan's work. I appreciate his creativity. Often, his films open to disparagement but later go on to find their audience. The Village and Signs are two examples. I don't care there are people that don't like those movies. Clearly, Airbender was meant to have two sequels which I doubt will materialize. Too bad.

275,stitch-99,How?!,2,14 May 2011,"While Avatar: The Last Airbender was on the air, I watched it quite sporadically. That obviously meant that I didn't follow the story very well, but I could tell this was a show worth watching, with an engaging and complex story, well-developed and enjoyable characters, and a creative premise. This movie is not that.One of the first problems I noticed upon watching this was that the acting ranged from sub-par to downright atrocious. The most notable offender is the protagonist. From the very first line he delivered to the end, I never believed a word he said.The pace of the movie is also very out of line. This is what happens when you try to directly convert a whole year's worth of a television show into a movie which is not at least two and a half hours. Not only was the story moving at breakneck speed, but almost all character development for anybody other than Aang or Zuko was excised. As a result, Sokka does nothing for more than the first half of the movie and then suddenly has a subplot in which he finds love. This takes a dramatic turn when another suddenly introduced subplot intervenes.Further, the exposition is among the worst I have ever heard. There is a scene early on in which Admiral Zhao blatantly and unnaturally tells most of Zuko's back-story felt more like a fake scene that somebody would film for a screen writing class as an exaggerated example of bad exposition. There are more examples (including the largely unneeded narration), but that was the worst.I will, however, give the film credit on very few points. There is a scene in the big fight scene in which Aang must confront his own internal conflict that is quite well-done. That scene deserved to be in a much better movie. The fight scenes were good, as were the special effects.At least two of the people with whom I watched this movie declared it a good movie (albeit one amended his commendation to say that the acting was not very good). This movie is a good example of a theory I am developing which I call, ""If it feels good, it is good,"" (the name needs work). Basically, back in the day, there was a certain ""feel"" to good movies. It was much easier to tell good movies from bad ones because the bad ones tended to have much lower budgets and thus felt different. However, in recent years, more and more bad movie ideas are getting the same studio backing as good ones and those lines become heavily blurred. As a result, there are plenty of just plain terrible movies that are being touted as works of cinematic genius.",The Last Airbender
276,nabeel1127,Avatar: The Last Time I Get Bent Over by Shyamalan,2,3 July 2010,"I generally don't hate movies; I always say ""hey, at least it entertained me."" But this movie was absolutely horrendous. I don't even know where to begin. I am an avid watcher of the animated series on Nickelodeon, as are my other two siblings so we went into this movie with such high expectations... we were like ""You can't ruin a movie like this! It's already made!!!"" Obviously, all you have to do is give it to M. Night Shyamalan.Mr. Shyamalan wrote and directed the movie. For their ridiculous choice in choosing a director AND writer, I feel like the president of Nickelodeon should make a public apology and promise to make it right for the next one. My five year old cousin could have written a better script. They literally had lines like ""It's time to show them that we believe in our beliefs as much as they believe in theirs."" What the hell does that even mean!? I'll tell you, it means the script writer is a moron. The dialog was just horrendous, they had narration that did absolutely nothing for you, and the characters blurted random facts that nobody cared about. They tried to explain things through random dialog, but all it did was annoy everybody.Next up was the mispronunciation of the names, locations, and the word Avatar. They mispronounced Saka, Aang, and the word Avatar amongst many other things. Really?! How do you mispronounce words like that? It's not like it was a book where it's open for interpretation, it's based on a cartoon and the words are easy! He may have tried to give it a more Asian feel or something, but that was a bad move. Words that the show is built around, and the fan base is more than familiar with should not be tampered with no matter how much of an idiot you are.The bending it was stupid. They had to do a hop, skip and an interpretive dance to get anything moving. In the show, the movements of the benders were congruent with the movements of the elements but in this they move ridiculous amounts to move a drop of water. Also, the moves were horrible. Each element had its own form of martial arts in the show to represent the force of each. Earth was very strong, fire was aggressive, water was very fluid, and air was much like breathing. I'm no martial artist, but that was obvious. However in the movie they all look feminine and it made me really mad.Character representation was pretty crappy also. Sorry, let me correct myself, it was also horrible. Sokka was played by the guy who plays Jasper in Twilight. In the cartoon he's clumsy, goofy, yet protective. In the movie, he's pretty much Jasper. He has a blank face the entire time, he's older than he should be, and he sucks. Aang was a bit chubby for my liking, his acting was also bad, and he made airbending look like a dance from a Miami nightclub. Katara was also bad acting, she looked a mess the entire time and she was a pansy, although in the show she was strong and assertive. Zuko's hair was not the way it was supposed to be, his burn was pretty much not visible, but his acting was good. Uncle Iroh was skinny, why?! Cuz Shyamalan is a freakin idiot. The actor did a good job with the wisdom portrayal but he couldn't capture everything the fat Uncle Iroh did in the show. Fire Lord Ozai didn't have the long hair or chin hair he was supposed to have, and he didn't seem as truly evil as the cartoon one did. Avatar Roku wasn't an Avatar at all, but instead he was a dragon and is never referred to as Avatar Roku. The earth village people were also poor actors, and I don't know what more to say about them besides the choreographed bending was just ridiculous.The racism factor. I don't wanna call Shyamalan a racist. The show was about the series of nations separated by ability coming together to live in peace. I can understand him separating the nations into races as well. What I don't understand is why all the good guys with any lines are white. The entire water nation seems to be of Eskimo descent, but Sokka, Katara, their Grandma and the teacher were all pure white, because they have lines in the movie.I've never truly hated a movie. I've disliked them, I've critiqued them, I've been annoyed and bored. But this movie, I hated for crushing one of the best cartoons ever. I've realized that nightmares are really just dreams directed by M. Night Shyamalan. Don't waste your time or money. Push Nickelodeon for a reboot immediately.",The Last Airbender
277,amunetpallaton,"Not THAT bad, but not very good either",4,3 July 2010,"First, the movie was just WAY too short and everything was rushed through so quickly that the movie just did not allow you to feel anything for any of the characters. In the cartoon series, you grow to love all of the characters and you get to know them SO well, but this movie just plowed through everything like it had a fire under its butt.A lot of people have made a big deal b/c of the change in races, but it's really not that big of a deal. I thought they did a good job casting our 3 heroes, but they ALL need acting lessons. There was SO much overacting by everyone that it was painful.And don't get me started on the god awful script. It's like they thought audiences were going to be filled with idiots that needed to be explained every single little thing or else they wouldn't understand what's going on.The cartoon offered SO much, and this movie had so much potential of being another LoTR if it had been done correctly.

279,jerrybrsc2,Why was this movie made?,2,7 February 2012,"(SPOILERS) OK, first let me just say what I did like about this movie. I liked the look of the film; the cinematography looks pretty damn good, and the special effects and production values for this movie look fantastic, and for $150 Million dollars, I would expect no less. Now, on to what i didn't like: The story is so poorly told, which is actually impressive considering that there are 20 episodes of the animation that the creators had at their disposal. Another thing, this movie is so lazily directed that it's laughable. There was one tone in this movie and that was overly dramatic. Everybody in this film is at this really cheesy level of elevated dramatic performance and the movie around them does not match this level of performance. Then again, what can you expect when you cast your main character from an audition tape and not a live interview; casting Dev Patel as Prince Zuko over Dante Basco (the voice of the character himself), for no reason, and casting two people who can't act as Sokka and katara. This movie was wrong. It was a pathetic attempt at a telivison to movie adaptation. There are very few redeeming qualities to this film, and that is the only reason why this film has two stars from me. I hope you enjoyed this review and I hope you take it into consideration if you consider seeing the film or not.",The Last Airbender
280,TrentReznorandAtticusRoss,Pretty Damn Awesome.,1,30 July 2012,"Shyamalan's recent debut, a live-action adaption from a children's family Saturday morning cartoon series, is a reasonably bearable family film, to say the least. We can all agree that in some nutty way, that this film is better than many other recent live action adapted films to come out like say, Alvin in the Chipmunks, or it's sequel. But Shyamalan takes his name to seriously, and somewhat relies on a good-looking cast, and dazzling special effects to sleaze his way out of this one. His previous film, 'The Happening' didn't necessarily have a lot of the whole 'Shyamalan' charisma, unlike some of his classics. Again, it relied on the faces of Wahlberg and Zooey Deschnal to ease it past critics. But now that that's all in the past, we can only hope to see what he does in the future.The whole idea of Shyamalan doing a 'Last Samurai' meets 'Harry Potter', with a 'Pirates of the Caribean' atmosphere sparked a new interest in the recently failed director. But, we must keep in mind that had Shyamalan owned the rights to this film, he would've turned it into something great. However, Nickelodeon insists on a family friendly film, filled with color and a 'Lord of the Rings' heavy budget. So, very much like the film 'Cats & Dogs: Kitty Galore', the Last Airbender was bound to be poorly constructed, stupidly scripted, with direction from a director that almost seemed to be absent throughout the entire shooting of the film.Over one and a half hours of eyesore and unnecessary 3D, considerably half-ass-ed acting, and visual delights such as the floating air temple, one almost feels like they've watched what was promised to be the most depressing movie of all time, only to find something as uplifting as meaningful as 'The Truman Show'. Aang, is the last of his kind, a Buddhist who can manipulate air as his element. When he is discovered by two siblings of a Water Tribe frozen in the ice, Aang realizes that his awakening has triggered an entire nation of fire benders on a search party - for him. Aang (or 'Ohng', as he's pronounced in the film) is played by the adorable Noah Ringer, who's clearly never acted before in his life. Despite the struggle to keep up with everybody else, he does share a remarkable resemblance to his cartoon predecessor. No doubt he enjoyed taking part in the film, which is more or less evident than his inability to act. His companion (no, not the flying bull) Katara, played by Nicola Peltz - seems a bit too self conscious, at this point. In the duration of what's meant to be a meaningful or tense scene, she seems to crawl back under her shell (perhaps in an attempt to hide from raging critics). Never-the-less, she's a great young actress who by appearing in this film may actually spawn a relatively successful career. But her sibling - played by Rathbone - is probably Othello compared to the rest of the cast. Keeping it simple, innovative, meaningful, and funny at times, he's definitely a highlight of the film with all the experience to share. Actually, speaking of Othello, Dev Patel - and I will not say this twice - is quite possibly, the greatest actor in the film standing proudly next to Rathbone or over him at least. He plays Prince Zuko sophisticated (and this was meant to be the kind of acting expected from both Ringer and Peltz) and tense. Patel clearly takes his acting seriously.It's the dialog, is where the film struggles to breathe. The screenplay's a childish, sluggish and worst yet, it seems to compliment Shyamalan's previous films. With a horrid pace, and woeful dialog, one can only hope for a scene where there is no speaking, and only combat fighting. More to the point, there almost is no combat sequences, except for four main scenes. And like Tim Burton, Shyamalan is clearly not an action director. You say that anybody can direct an action movie? Try 'Planet of the Apes'. While he may not be an action director, he definitely knows what he's doing. His previous films have almost no - okay, none of his films have any action. Anything from throwing a punch. But the action's pretty awesome, even going a little Zack Snyder-Esq with a few slow-mo's. It's well choreographed, but with a few hits we can almost tell who's going to throw the next hit. So maybe a little more practice, for future references.The overall world of the Last Airbender is quite spectacular. There's temples in the clouds, cities of ice, castles of stone... It's quite a sight. The elements themselves are quite breathtaking, actually. If you're an open minded person, you'd agree. So, the production is designed perfectly, but for Shyamalan sadly, it's too happy. Shyamalan even went as far to change some of the cultures of the four nations - did I mention there were four? The fire nation - the key nation in the storyline when it comes to enemies - has now gone from fire-breathing Chinese, to Hindu-loving Indians, a right reflection of the director's cultural heritage. By changing the cultures around a bit, Shyamalan's given the film it's own individuality from it's cartoon predecessor. Overall, it's a pretty awesome sight, but with all of this mumble-jumble and it's childish atmosphere, we at least have something to cradle, and something that we can at least appreciate the effort, despite Nickelodeon's pathetic restrictions.",The Last Airbender

M Night admitted that he was not the right choice to direct this movie. He has a very unique style of directing which doesn't work here at all. There are no characters in this movie. Everybody is just a cardboard labelled with a wrong name. No character arcs, no plot progression, acting sucks, VFX looks decent but are not used properly. Every bit of information is spoon fed to us. We hear a lot of things but learned nothing in the end.

282,gab-fan22,What a joke....,1,10 July 2020,"To experience The Last Airbender is almost like watching something you love be ripped to shreds, taken advantage of and sullied by one who doesn't understand its message or power. M. Night Shyamalan's much maligned adaptation of Nickolodeon's incredible anime Avatar: The Last Airbender is shallow, empty and devoid of any connection to its source material.The actors were all wooden, it seemed as though they all had the same expression throughout the movie and took away the traits that made them so relatable in the anime. The script trimmed or removed a lot of scenes from the first season that were essential and vital to understanding a lot of the characters and things took place in the film that didn't happen in the anime. On top of all that, there was such mispronunciation of names like Sooka or Aaaang which was laughable that it took away from the story.It also missed out on the spirit of what made the anime so great. The show highlighted the loss of innocence, the choices one makes in times of war and how people can redeem themselves in spite of their pasts. Nothing of the sort took place in the movie like why Aang left the air temple, or even two powerful scenes like after Zoo saves Aang from Zhao's forces and then Aang asks him in a different time could they have been friends? Or when Iroh tells Zoo the reason he worries about him so much is that he is like a son to him because of the loss he has been through.
The bending and CGI were so poor it seemed like a film made by a high-school student. It was slow, dull and lacked any of the sense of wonder or power that the four nations showed in the anime. I almost laughed aloud at the scene where 10 benders did an impressive synchronized sequence and yet only moved a little pebble. Finally, the characters had none of the traits that made some so relatable and appealing in the anime. That is simply terrible for someone who claimed to love the anime so much, but I did not see any care for facts throughout the whole film and it made a mockery of one of the great anime series ever made.
It's virtually impossible to understand this movie unless you saw the anime. You are just subjecting yourself to 90 minutes of lightning paced sequences with no meaning, sense or purpose. Many involved in the film like Dev Patel who played Zuko and Dimartino and Konietzko who created the anime have been open about their disappointment in the film. After watching it, it's very easy to understand why.",The Last Airbender
283,couchfrenchfry,I think it's great,10,6 January 2013,"This is a high budget rendition of a fantasy story in the tradition of ancient China. It has great special effects and such creative bits as the hero escapes from a boat by opening a kite, running along and jumping off the boat whereupon he glides away to safety. Another pleasant surprise is that the film is in English so there's no poorly dubbed dialog. Some object to the violence in the film, come on folks, it's a kung fu film. The main characters are played by enchanting young actors instead of ""big name"" stars. This gives a nice freshness to the film.

284,Kieth11,Terrible ripoff,1,24 June 2012,"I watched the animated television series, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and it was hilarious, full of action and adventure, so when this movie came out, I was excited that someone finally decided to create the series with real characters.I want to get straight to the point: if you watch the television series that I mentioned before you watch this, you will hate this show, if you don't, then you probably might rate it 3 or 4 stars; 5 at the most (out of 10).This show was a huge disappointment; the so called ""funny parts"" were lame and pointless. It was like a joke that no one laughs at. All the bending (waterbending, earthbending, firebending, airbending) looked fake, as if the water (for example) was moving on its own, and the bender's arms were just simply moving with it.Also, (if you watched the television series) the whole story is completely different; what was more than 4 hours long got incredibly condensed into this pointless, ripoff, hour and a half thing that changes the storyline, cuts out almost everything about the series, and it was really, really bad.The sad thing is that, the storyline is really good, but it's extremely poor presentation made this series absolutely terrible, and torture to watch.So, bottom line is that, if you want to watch a really good, funny TV series that has the storyline of this movie and more, Avatar: The Last Airbender.

I didn't mind that it wasn't full of top stars. I liked the portrayed characters and wanted to follow along with how the story would turn out for them. The action was good.

They even sucked the fun out of General Iroh and Sokka. The scenery was pretty, the bending wasn't bad - a little more realistic than the anime - but the writing was all exposition and the plotting abrupt. Can't recommend it.

It was in ""3D"" and from the first 'visual' the Paramount Logo in 3D I noticed something wasn't right. Things that should be close up made me felt like I was crossing my eyes, but luckily the whole move 3D was so pointless that it was barely noticeable. It only makes the movie hard to watch, the fast action scenes are blurry and the glasses make the whole movie darker. Few times I had to take my glasses off to be able to see what was happening and in most scenes the picture was normal.Now on to the actual movie, I thought this was going to be a one off movie, but it's an attempt at a franchise, which from the looks of it will be another ""Golden Compass"". The acting is horrible! I saw a while back that some people were upset that the Avatar's character was played by a non Asian actor... I think they should be more upset that a horrible acting child was cast instead. Really the whole 3 main characters were bad actors, if anything those should be the best ones.The story was okay but boring as hell, so many scenes were attempted to be made epic and such, but it felt more drawn out and boring.My suggestion is not to see this movie... but if you absolutely need to, make sure it's in 2D.

I mean, when you're translating a work from book to movie, it's a completely different medium so there's bound to be some problems; everyone has a different idea of what the characters look like, sound like - a different idea of all the little nuances. But with Avatar: The Last Airbender, the source material was already on film, albeit cartoon, so I just don't understand how some of the mistakes were made, except for by willing incompetence.Let's start with the pronunciation of the names. Now, I know it's a small thing as far as the movie as a whole is concerned, but it's really symptomatic of the movie's main problem. All the names were pronounced wrong - despite the source material being an American TV show... with sound... You can't really ""interpret"" the way a character's name is pronounced when it's spoken out loud in the source material; sure, with a book, there might be a couple ways to pronounce a character's name, but NOT WITH TELEVISION.Next, the nationality of the characters... Again, when going from book to movie there might be a few different ways to interpret a character's heritage and appearance, but not with a visual medium. In the cartoon, the characters were clearly of Asian descent. Yet, the main characters Katara, Sokka, and Aang were all American actors. Also, I was surprised that M. Night Shyamalan chose to cast the Fire Nation (the main villains of the film) as an Indian/Middle Eastern nation (in the cartoon I always felt it drew from Chinese culture). It seems like lately Middle Easterners are becoming the Stock Villain of movies, just like Russians were during the cold war, or Germans before that.Now, there were many other problems with this movie aside from the pronunciation and the appearance, like the dialogue and acting, but those are run-of-the-mill mistakes. Rarely does a movie come along that makes such visual and aural mistakes when working from a visual/aural medium. In my personal opinion, somebody wrote up a brief summary of the animated series, emailed it to M. Night Shyamalan, and he wrote his movie off that... the most probable reason I can think of that he would make such mistakes with the pronunciation is that he had only ever read the character's names, and never seen the show itself...Really, that would explain a lot.",The Last Airbender
291,movie_bloke,Best movie ever made 10/10,1,11 July 2010,"I cant believe how many bad reviews i read about this movie & i thought to myself i have to watch it & see how bad it was myself. Is everyone crazy this movie is amazing great story line, amazing acting its like a cross between the matrix & crouching tiger hidden dragon. Well i think most the reviews written here are fake or IMDb just paid people to put up bad reviews. So my conclusion is that this movie & the dragon ball z movie are the two best movies i've seen in the last few years. Im thinking that this is also up there with You got served. The special effects were amazing almost as good as The Power Rangers. Keep up the good work Mr Shyamalan.",The Last Airbender
292,primevalsoup,Good film in the middle of a racism debate,8,7 May 2012,"I liked this a lot, as did my wife. It's a shame that accusations of racism may stop there being sequels made of this very racially diverse film, but the principles at stake are important and without studying the whole ""racebender"" phenomenon in depth, I ought to stay out of it. However, in defence of the film, the cartoon is ambiguous about the race of the different characters, and there are no rules restricting who a director can cast for roles.So as for how good a film it is: It isn't the most profound amazing film ever. It was entertaining and emotional and fun. There are some weird/cheesy/pointless lines. There were lots of good story bits and turns I didn't expect. I like the 'look' of the film - obviously inspired by the show but done very well. I liked the graphics - I saw in 2D, as DVD on a widescreen TV. I thought graphics were really great. I liked the action a lot! It had real-time long action scenes - the type I long for and miss in so many 'action films' (or 'random camera shots with fists, weapons and people moving quickly but too close to know what's happening, edited together, before a conclusion shot, supposedly representing fighting) where cheap tricks are employed to represent action. I liked the elements used in the action - I imagine this was a nightmare to do and I thought it was done really well. I suspect for those who know the show it might feel like some horridly shortened version, but I've only seen two episodes and don't have time to invest in the show so as a summary of the first part of it, it works for me, and I'm keen to watch the sequel, if it's ever made.Maybe in ten years they'll remake with an entirely non-white cast (and possibly non-black as well, or entirely Asian and native American) or maybe a racially diverse, but ambiguous, show cannot be safely made into a film. This could spell the death of attempts to make similar show to film conversions for cartoons. Or maybe because of this big argument there will be more, successful roles for under-represented ethnic groups.Who knows. The film was fun though.",The Last Airbender
293,Bored78,Not that bad of a movie,9,24 December 2010,"I read the reviews of the movie here before i watched it. I rarely let the the reviews influence my decision to watch because i am generally not as picky as most people when it comes to movies.I have not watched the series so this review is based on this being my first ""Airbender"" viewing.The storyline was pretty decent. Though it did feel a bit rushed. It also died abruptly after the first book. This is the same effect as the season finale to your favorite show playing through and then the story just stops dead in the water. I find this annoying with all shows but more so with a movie that isn't even set to be continued yet.The characters could use a little work. Not a lot on the characters to really get you familiar with each one.The special effects were awesome. The martial arts do look like they are channeling their ""element"".Overall the movie needed more time i think. I think if it was a 2 1/2 or 3 hour movie, i think it would of made it so much better. They could of also prepped you for the ending. Tied it up a little bit better until/if the next one came out.Is it worth seeing? In my opinion, yes.",The Last Airbender
294,InakiArias,"Not very bad movie, but worse than expected.",5,9 July 2011,"Please, in first place, forget the fact that Shyamalan is the director of this movie. Lot of people are misjudging this film only for that.I tried to see it as if I didn't knew anything about the previous TV animation series and the plot.OK, then, I have to say that as a movie itself it is not as worse as I have read everywhere. Let's start with the positive parts: The story is great. Visuals aren't the best, more after finding out that the budget is around 150 million, but they have, at least, enough level to fulfill their mission. The battles are pretty well done, with some powerful scenes. There are also a lot of awesome landscape images which show us an imaginative fantastic world, fact that help us getting into the movie.In other hand, even if the story is great, the way that it is told is amazingly poor. No emotions. No epic. No reasons for feeling anything. And this is an epic fail if we are talking about a fantastic/adventures movie. The acting, in overall, is poor, excepting one or two characters. Specially, Dev Patel makes the worst performance I have seen in a long time. He makes me angry every time he appears in scene, but not for the evilness of his character, just for his stupid acting!In conclusion, I give ""The last airbender"" a 5 out of 10, as a single movie, but if you compare it with the TV series in which is based, the result would be even worse.",The Last Airbender
295,MegaGothmog,Worst Cartoon-adaptation Ever!!!,1,1 July 2014,"I know that there are already tons of reviews about this movie, but i can't resist to give you another one. I'd never thought I'd say this, but: Believe the critics!What is wrong with this movie? Everything! The acting is bad, the CGI looks like crap (and with the 3D it looks even worse), the characters are just weird adaptations from the originals, the bending is painful and the pacing is just disturbing.Lets start with the acting. I am not an actor or director, but even I can see that the acting is horrific. The delivery seems forced all the time and there is no emotion in it, and even if there is it is the wrong kind of emotion.The CGI looks terrible: The animals look weird, especially Appa, and it makes the bending look ten times worse than it already is. Given the fact that it was shot in 3D, I am still surprised I didn't get a headache.The characters are terribly portrayed. Aang had nothing of his childishness or innocence. Katara had nothing of her motherness, Sokka nothing of his wackiness. Zuko nothing of his anger (which is pretty much Zuko's trademark) or passion. Iroh had nothing of his wisdom or humor and the rest of the characters looked like they didn't even belong there. All the lines are just weird and seemed forced, had no emotion and didn't fit at all.Given the fact that this is Avatar: The Last Airbender, where people can bend the elements; Water, Fire, Earth and Air, you'd expect some good bending with good moves. Forget it. All the moves make no sense, it is a lot of jumping around for no reason: Punch, turn around, punch twice, do a back flip, press x,x, square, and triangle twice aannddd..... a small fireball is the result.I can understand that you cannot punt twenty episodes of back story in 1 movie, but come on. This was just ridicules. If they tried, the could have made this into a trilogy like Lord of the Rings. 3 hours = 1 book. Every episode is twenty minutes long, so in a 3 hour movie you can fit like 9 episodes. On the other hand I am glad they didn't make it longer. It would have been even worseI have no idea what the director was thinking, but it was nothing good. If you still haven't seen it, don't watch it. Unless you want a huge disappointment, or you want to see for yourself if the reviews are correct, stay away from this. It saves you 2 hours of your time and some money.",The Last Airbender
296,dexter-vane,Incredibly Disappointing.,2,20 May 2015,"I never really was an anime person. I never really had a connection to it. But basically the only anime I was ever really involved in was Avatar: The last airbender. I loved it, and everything about it. So I was nervous when I heard they were making a live action movie of it. And rightfully so. Let's be honest, M. Night Shyamalan is known for mediocre movies. But this movie is probably the worst live action adaptation there is. It managed to take an amazing source material and ruin it completely. The characters are warped into unrecognizability. But not only is it bad as an adaptation, it is also a terrible movie in itself. The acting is heartless and awkward at times and the overall feel of the movie is sloppiness. Thank god they didn't finish the trilogy. Maybe it was the fact that I was expecting a lot and the film didn't manage to bring the magic of the series on screen, but I consider this to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen...",The Last Airbender
297,blackhawk66,A Non-hating Review,7,10 January 2011,"Maybe because I have never seen the animated series upon which this movie is based, it did not disappoint me as it apparently has so many of the series' fans. I watched it purely as a fantasy movie and found it to be enjoyable. Is it in the same class as Lord of the Rings? Of course not. Does it compare well with the Narnia movies? For me, yes it did. The characters were engaging enough if not very deep. I liked the visual effects. The sets and costumes were well done. The action scenes were different enough from other fantasy movies to keep me interested. The plot was easy to follow even if the motivation of some of the characters was a bit fuzzy. I liked it well enough that I would have watched a sequel if one were made. That seems unlikely based on how poorly the first movie performed after all it's scathing reviews.",The Last Airbender
298,mitchelldahlstrom,Watching 10 Years Later,4,23 April 2020,"Roughly 10 years have gone by since I saw this movie. It still holds up being pretty bad. Cultural appropriation is non-existent.

I am hyped for Nerflix's version, since the original creators are working on it again. Hopefully they can redeem this live action tragedy.",The Last Airbender

So I have to view this as its own stand alone film and even then Its still horrendous. Some of the worst child actors I have ever seen combined with a cold, emotionless story lacking in any humanity and dull, never ending exposition scenes that feel like hey were stolen from the cartoons Wikipedia page, make for an unpleasant viewing experience. Even things that a big budget film like this should excel in such as; the special FX, editing and cinematography are poor. Some scenes aren't even lit properly and yet this still got a theatrical release?! To say that the character development is few and far between would be honoring the film, there is zero character development as all each character does is spew out backstory and exposition and the film feels more like a boring history lesson than a form of entertainment.

They're great. I'm looking forward to buying an expanded version or Director's Cut of Airbender on DVD like I did all three Lord of the Rings movies. I'm hoping they made all three movies at once so we don't have to wait too long for the second one. My boys told their mom it was ""awesome.""

302,doomas10,The last air bender is a visual feast!,8,22 August 2010,"After all the bad press thrown at ""The last air-bender"" i was expecting something horrific. Is it a bad film? Well according to my standards no. Definitely not. I will by the number what i liked and what i thought was weak.1. The actions scenes. They are wonderfully done and choreographed and since M.Night Shyalaman has used us with nice camera work, his style is clearly visible from the first shot. He has an eye for some of the most poetic fights i've seen in my life. The use also of slow motion is just phenomenal.2. The production scale. This is a film truly at a similar spectacular scope of ""Lord of the rings"" and ""Star Wars"". Besides the wonderful locations such as Greenland, the sets are just freaking massive and filled with amazing details. I was so impressed when i saw the throne room of Lord Ozai. The iced palace of the Northern water tribe, with small water falls and well crafted zen lakes, i have no words to describe its beauty. 3. The visuals. The whole film proceeds like a poem. It is so easy to watch and even if you do not care about the story, you just gaze the locations. i haven't felt like that since i saw Zang Yimou's ""Hero"". The addition of crystal clear and eye popping effects from Industrial Light and Magic just add extra points in this visual feast.4. The benders of the natural elements. That was something i have never seen before and as an idea is pretty much interesting to see how it will is represented on screen. This is a good idea that can produce various action-hell yes-scenes.5. The cast-OK i know this is a controversial choice but i thought the avatar child actor wasn't that bad but neither that good. Dev Patel as prince Zuko and Shaun Toub as General Iroh are awesome. Their performances are adequate and believable. I really like the relationship between these two and the way Zuko feels. 7. James Newton Howard's music. An excellent soundtrack that captures the main theme of the film.So these are the positive things i found. Now, i will mention five things i did not like.1. The duration. i mean for such a rich and expensive mythology, i would expected a full 2 hour, maybe +, film. Instead i am getting the usual 1/40 hours maximum minutes, including the credits..2. ...which brings me to my second main point. The film looks rushed. Not rushed in terms of production, but rushed as a story. There is no room to have proper acting scenes. Usually most of the film contains dialog about things that have occurred or will happened but they last 2 minutes each. We do not know how long our heroes are staying in the palace of the Northern water tribe.3. The film is trimmed! All the character development scenes have been erased for the sake of entertainment. There are so many moments where i felt like that. I wanted to know more. This reminds another case such as ""Clash of the titans"". People blasted the film however, they did not blasted the Hollywood machine for screwing over its directors. To cut from a film almost an hour to increase in market appeal is a horrible act. If you have seen the trailers, you will notice that half actually of the scenes in the trailers are not in the film! Lame..4... because this is great material. The mythology is rich and its good to see a new world so unbelievably stunning. The characters are intriguing but there is no explanation behind their motives. 5. Finally, major problem is the existence of narration while the camera is traveling or moving. You get to see the kids flying in the air and the girl narrates to us ""we were flying in the air...."". Then they land to the northern water tribe palace and bowing to the king.... ""and we bowed to the king"". I mean i can see that! There is no point for narration unless you want to explain something to your audience.6. The only major difference between the series and the film adaptation is the level of seriousness. In the cartoon, while everyone was so brave, there are hilarious jokes and one liners that ""bend"" the ice (see what i did there?). The series delivered tones of excitement and fun. Aang-the avatar-is a 12 year old boy who is just discovering his powers and is aiming mostly to have fun! Unfortunately, in the film, Aang is mostly or trying to be at least, dramatic. There is no time for fun and that's why perhaps people blasted it. If you apply the above feeling to the whole movie, the atmosphere is different. The film takes itself too seriously and leaves no room for funny acts or scenes. While personally i am not annoyed, if you try to make your film look serious, then implement more scenes to explain your characters motivations, feelings and actions. To conclude, one small reference about the spirit world. In the series it is established from episode to episode but in the film, individuals are just talking about it rather than showing it or at least explaining something!It is such a shame because i loved the visual feast that this adaptation has to offer but i can see the trimming parts coming from a mile away. I really like the film that's why it has an 8/10 but I felt it could do so much more! I do hope in the future Shyalaman will restore the movie into its full glory. So this was ""The last air bender"". Maybe Hollywood learned its lesson about storytelling and 3D conversion process and in the sequel we will get more of the good stuff.",The Last Airbender
303,myloveincruz,Sterile and lacking in soul.,3,7 July 2010,"I have not seen any of the other Airbender stuff so I had few preconceptions of what the movie might be.With that said, I was curious why the critics panned The Last Airbender so harshly so I watched it. I've been mulling it over and the main thing, is that all the characters felt like were kept at arms length from me. Many of the actors only got only a few moments to make me care about them and some had me frustrated I could not get more of them. Princess Yue -Seychelle Gabriel, stood out as someone I wanted to know more about. Uncle Iroh - Shaun Toub, also had me wanting more. I feel the actors had their characters humanity subverted for the plot. So my empathy for them was as if it was a History Channel show covering battle tactics. The plot, special effects and fighting were the focus but feeling so unengaged by the characters, who cares? Say one takes the view that it was a martial arts/fantasy and so it's all about the fighting and 2d characters without development keep the story from slacking. Still, you have a hero that you project yourself on and I'm not about to blame a 13 y.o. for not making me give a damn about him, I would have to blame the director for that. Oh yeah, that asperger's kid is doing some magic again, guess I should be impressed.The lack of soul in the flick reminds me of the later Lucas Star Wars films, like The Phantom Menace, all FX, tricks and craft and no soul.That a fantasy, should feel so sterile is a change from sickly sweet cuteness of others, but hardly refreshing.I feel bad for Shyamalan, I was rooting for him. It seems to me that being crowned the next Spielberg was the worst thing that could have happened to him. I believe he's got talent but needs to see a therapist and get his crap together and realize he is not his persona and make a movie for the movie's sake, in the same spirit that had me happily lose myself in the Sixth Sense. Spirit and Soul, these are not things that can be added by CGI or a 3D conversion.",The Last Airbender

If you have an already good t.v. show and decide to make a movie out, the movie comes out good right? Not the case here. The movie was awful. The special effects were bad and made worse by 3-d conversion. The acting was terrible, the characters were all one dimensional (I swear the characters only had one facial expression the whole time). The other thing that made the movie bad was the fact that the original story was butchered and over-simplified (I counted, 12 characters were chopped out). Also Shyamalan seemed to steal elements from other superior movies (the scene at the end where everybody bows to Aang was defiantly stolen from the ending of Lord of the Rings 3). I could go on, but then this review would never end. So bottom line: worst movie of 2010.",The Last Airbender
305,catch_a_fire_2079,The Last RACE Bender,5,15 July 2010,"I was really looking forward to this movie. I am a big fan of the cartoon series, it's very entertaining, original, innocent, funny, and fuels the imagination. Unfortunately the movie has none of these qualities.When I first saw the preview I was very excited...then I heard James Cameron was directing the Avatar (I thought that meant this movie, not Pocahontas 2010)....and I was even more excited. Then I found out it was M.Night, then I became weary.I really liked the 6th Sense, and Unreakable was pretty cool too. But the rest of his movies showed that he peaked at the 6th sense. On to the movie..First of all Aang, Sokka, Katara, are SUPPOSED TO BE Asian..not pasty white kids that can't act!! ARGHH why would they not cast Asian actors?? None of the actors portrayed what the characters should have been,(physically and emotionally) worst than that none of them had their own personalities. Except for Prince Zuko and Uncle Iroh, the acting was terrible...nothing worse than having to watch bad child actors...you feel so sad for them...you picture them overdosing in a hotel room a few years down the road. On to the F.X First of all bending is Martial Arts NOT modern dance, they looked liked ballet dancers...nothing like the cartoon. I saw it in 2D, the scenery was actually very picturesque...hence 1 star...but it could not save this horrible ""movie"" I also have to add it's pronounced ANNG not ONG...M.Night get over your ego..you suck!! The story line was so boring at most parts..and other times it moved too quickly...so it was not cohesive, on top of that it did not stay true to the cartoon which was a huge let down.To the Studio...please Fire M.Night, or I will not pay to see the sequels. Take a look at what Marvel did with the Hulk, the first one was a disaster...so they scrapped it and started over with different actors and direction...and the second Hulk was a great movie...please do the same here...the source material is classic and does not deserve to be butchered by M.Night.DO NOT PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE 1/10",The Last Airbender
306,officefan01,"The Last Airbender: Worst Movie of 2010, Worst Movie of All Time",1,21 December 2010,"I was a fan of the show Avatar: The Last Airbender. Noticed I said ""Was"". But M. Night Shymalamadingdong has done was comes naturally to him, and mess everything up in this horrible movie. There are so many things wrong with this movie, that I don't even know where to begin. First, the name pronunciation. Ong? Soka? Eroh? Ahvatar? Come On. It's Aang, Sokka, Iroh and Avatar. Second, no one in the show was white, they were all Asians, but they were played by no talent actors who probably lost a bet. And the Fire Nation was mainly portrayed by Indian actors. Is M. Night Shymalan trying to say that he is a member of the Fire nation? Another thing, the pacing. It's starts off with Katara and SOKKA finding AANG and Appa in the iceberg, and just one hour later they end up in the north pole. I mean it's suppose to take months to get there, and they had to make numerous stops. No Kyoshi Warriors, No King Bumi, No June the Bounty Hunter, No Avatar Roku even, Appa and Momo were never mentioned once, and no mention of Sozin's Comet whatsoever. It also felt like there were things in the movie, that were definitely not in the show at all. The dialog was so bad, it made the dialog in the Star Wars prequel seem Oscar-worthy. The acting was also really bad. The guys who played Aang and Sokka make Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattinson look like Marlon Brando and Tom Hanks. The girls who played Katara and Yue make Megan Fox and Miley Cyrus look like Kathrine Hepburn and Meryl Streep. The visuals were just bad. We've seen great visuals in movies like James Cameron's Avatar and Star Trek. You could so tell that there was a green screen used for this movie, I could clearly see an emergency exit sign in the movie. Also, at the end, there's a cliffhanger saying, wait there's going to be another one. It feels like its a parody of the series created by the guys who brought us Epic Movie and Disaster Movie, and it's actually freaking hilarious. Do Not see this movie, for the love of God do not see this movie, in theaters, in 3D, on DVD, don't even talk about it at all. I didn't see it in 3D, but I heard it was very bad. M. Night Shymalamadingdong should stop making movies. As it turns out, he was approached to direct the last Harry Potter movie, he probably would've called Ron, Roon. If you saw Transformers 2 last year and hated it, don't see this, because it is ten times worse than Transformers 2 ever was. If you think I'm being a little too harsh on this movie, I am not. I saw this with my sister when there was a brief family crisis going on, and this movie made me laughed so hard. Also, I'm only giving it 1 star because I'm forced to. It deserves a rating less than 1, it deserves a rating less than 0. In fact, whenever you're in a store that sells DVDs and Blu-Ray DVDs, and you see copies of this movie, buy them, and burn them so no one will ever see this piece of crap called a movie. So go watch all three seasons of Avatar: The Last Airbender, burn the DVDs of the movie, and don't see the sequels if M. Night Shymalan is planning on continuing the franchise. And you know him, he will mess everything up. This movie is so bad it makes Twilight look like a best picture winner, now that's a real shame.

307,ChristianTylerHannah,The Last Airbender review,3,23 March 2015,"Yeah, it's nearly been 5 years since this came out, but who cares? This is my review. So, The Last Airbender is based on the Nickelodeon anime & manga, & I heard this was one of the worst films ever. Well.... it IS a terrible movie, but I wouldn't say it's one of the worst EVER. Let's talk about the positives: the score was good. Now, on to the negatives: for one, I haven't seen the anime, but it looks like it's supposed to be based on Chinese culture, so why is the main cast white? I don't get it at all. Plus, I heard the kid playing Aang took acting classes right before he started filming this film, & it's pretty obvious. It's not just him who can't act, all of the actors had the personality of a rock & I didn't care about their characters. The visual effects could have been cleaned up as well. It's no Sharknado, but the water bending looked pretty poor. Plus, this is ILM, they did Jurassic freaking Park, there's just no excuse for those water bending effects. Another problem was the pronunciation of Aang sounding like Ong. It would work, but if the actors are white, it ain't right. This film was also too short, therefore, you don't care about anybody. If done right, this could have been an epic trilogy each around 3 hours long like Lord of the Rings, but until that happens, we're stuck with a bland film that I will give 1/10 stars.",The Last Airbender

Yet, even on the times I saw the show, I really liked it. The story of the series was awesome and so were the characters.I saw the movie, and to me, I really only liked the special effects and the scenery. It got annoying when they called Aang ""Ong"" or ""um"" or something... I mean, a name that is said in the series over a hundred times shouldn't be hard to say. I did not catch the ""laziness"" of the movie's plot for I personally have not seen the series a whole bunch. But it seemed like they were dwelling on the learning of how to bend water more than they should have..The characterization didn't go too deep for I had to use my own personal knowledge of the series to pinpoint who did what. I constantly had to explain to my sister (whom has not seen the series whatsoever) who was who and even who Aang was, and what he represented. The special effects were exceptional in my opinion, as well as the scenery. I loved all the looks of the temples and the jungles and such. I shall one day watch every episode of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"", for I really enjoyed it, and I found the story to be very interesting and imaginative.

The fact is that hollyweird has not given us at times great films based on cartoons or comics. With that said I will say I am a great fan of the Avatar: The Last Airbender cartoon show so I thought I would give this film a chance. I will start by telling you the good. The special effects, the costumes, and the settings are fantastic. I mean I fill like I'm watching the world of the show brought to life. Even fantasy creatures like Appa and Momo look. Flying bisons are cool. This is what we expect from great summer films a chance to relax and take journey to other worlds . The movie has a great fill of atmosphere. The action lends itself to the setting. I must say the boy who plays Zuko does a great job with the role. I was little worried about him capturing the anger and depth of that character but he does it well. Mr. Night has really surprised me because there is actually sizable action in this film. Now for the bad. Like all fantasy films the selling point should be the director and writers ability to get the audience to care about the characters. First, I do not feel that the young or even the elder actors are to blame for why I just didn't care as much for the characters. It i the writing. There just wasn't enough lines for the characters at times other Zuko and Aang, characters seem stiff. What is worst scenes seem rushed. I mean first we see General Zhou in one place then suddenly he is back in the Fire Nation. I think Mr. Night must have been rushed to complete this film,like Singer with the first xmen, but nevertheless it was a pretty good introduction to what with just a little more characterization and action will be a great fantasy. Please give this film a chance so we can see where the series will go. A solid 8 out of 10.",The Last Airbender
310,pfirsisch,..and sadly miserable,1,28 September 2020,"Regrettable..Noah Ringer as Aang shines silver ... but this light is not enough to save this evil work.Repeated mistakes by the director (producer & screenplay) in the rest of the cast, above all Dev Patel as Prince Zuko, who brings his acting insecurities into the role and fails all through.Nicola Peltz as Kartara .... a ""I am the most popular girl in high school and a proud collector of lip-gloss""The 3D version is the best slap in the face that the audience has to take, because it is only for the purpose of justifying higher admission.The opening sequence shines through the lack of acting and set management by the director.The dialogues are wooden and lifeless, as if people were repeating a prompter in a rigid posture.
Some dialogues are also so lifeless that the viewer gets the impression of being addressed directly by the character in the game. So there is a lack of coordination in the dialogue between the characters !!The interaction between the actor and the special effects is also abysmal. Not just as a faux pas in a scene ... but as a running gag.
The re-union between producer K.Kennedy and Shyamalan did not lead to the expected result.From now on the name ""M. Night Shyamalan"" only stands for well-intentioned intentions, degenerated into mere intent.I now strongly doubt his main contribution to Sixth Sense.",The Last Airbender
311,ccjuniorgurl07,"I wanted to like this film, but it was just too hard to do.",1,9 October 2011,"I am a huge fan of the cartoon series, so when I heard that a live action version was going to be made, I was so excited. Even when I heard critics saying how terrible this movie was, I still wanted to see it, I mean, I like a lot of terrible movies, especially when I can mock them for how horrible they are. But this, when I finally rented it from Netflix, I was so happy. And then I watched it.I honestly cannot think of a single nice thing to say about this movie. The scenery, which should have been the highlight of the film, was awful, the storyline, which should have been good considering the source material, only made sense through half the film, and even that is pushing it. The acting... there are not enough words in the English language to describe how awful the acting was. Most of the actors honestly looked like they could be replaced with a cardboard cutout and nobody would know the difference.I really tried very hard not to compare this story with the original cartoon, so I can look past the pronunciation changes, but looking at this movie as just a movie, I saw nothing even remotely good about it. I mean, the characterization of Aang, and why he chose to run away was done poorly, and killed any chance I had of ever liking the character. Sokka, who was comedic relief throughout the entire series, had no personality to speak of. I've seen what Jackson Rathbone can do when he's flexing his acting muscles, and I don't know if it's because of the script, or because he's not meant to be a comedy actor, or a mixture of both, but his character was quite possibly the most useless out of all of them. Even the villains were terrible. It honestly looked like the villains were supposed to be the comedic relief in this movie. I mean, why else cast a comedy actor as one of the main antagonists?All in all, I would highly suggest watching the original cartoon over this piece of garbage. The cartoon, despite being an animation on Nickelodeon, is actually more terrifying and suspenseful than this ""darker"" live action movie could ever hope to be. It also gave you characters you liked and rooted for. Villains that you wanted to see beaten. With the movie, I didn't know if I was supposed to hate them, or laugh at their crazy antics.",The Last Airbender
312,ben_thurber,Buzz: Fail,3,1 December 2011,"Having seen the movie version first, I actually wanted to see the cartoon and began watching it.I realized the movie was, at best, an extremely bad pale copy of the cartoon. Sure, in both, Appa was the coolest, but there were so many things missing from the movie that were in greater detail in the cartoon, even to the point where........Okay, just one example will do.{{Spoiler Alert}}While the end of the first season of the cartoon has the siege of the Northern Water Tribe the same as the movie, the way the Fire Nation was taken out is so much better in the cartoon.In the cartoon, Aang uses the Avatar power to create a huge creature made entirely of water. He goes through, ship by ship, destroying them until they are all gone.In the movie he creates a tsunami.I don't think the movie would have been any worse if they'd simply used wooden dummies instead of actors.If (big if) Night does the other two books, I hope he really studies and understands both of them before he writes a single line.There was only one, yes one, thing that the movie had that would've made the cartoon a bit better. In the cartoon, the fire-benders could shoot fire out without any fire nearby, while earth and water needed their respective elements (air's everywhere, so there's really no need to point that out). I liked how the movie had the fire-benders needing to have a fire nearby to bend.But that is the only reason I gave the movie a 3 and not a 1.",The Last Airbender
313,rsre4-1,Judge For Yourself - It's Good!,7,3 July 2010,"After reading all the negative reviews, my hopes were dashed going into this movie with my kids. We are big fans of the cartoon. But we learned a lesson: don't let others make up your mind for you.We enjoyed the movie very much. So I'll try to prepare you for it: 1. Forget about the casting. Throughout the history of film, people of different ethnicities have been cast to play other races. So what? Big deal. Get passed it and don't let it even remotely become an issue.2. Don't go into the movie expecting to get the TV series. It's not. M. Night had to try to condense 10 hours of show into a 1/2 hour movie so many sacrifices had to be made. Get over the fact the Kioshi warriors weren't in it. They really weren't that important anyway, at least not yet. Get passed the ""character development"" - there just wasn't time for it. Get passed the ""Aang seemed angry and confused"" - of course he was. His whole world has just been taken from him and turned upside down. Everyone he knew and loved was dead in what was basically overnight to him. And he's 12.3. Get passed the different pronunciations of some of the names. M. Night went with a more Asian pronunciation. Again, so what.4. Noah Ringer (and the others) really weren't as bad as people are making them seem. At least not to us. I think the kid did a pretty good job of playing a kid who's life had just changed drastically.5. It was a good twist that the fire benders needed a ""source"" of fire to bend. After all, Earth benders can't ""create"" earth out of nowhere. Nor can the water benders. They need a ""source"", so the Fire benders were put in the same boat, except for the most powerful ones (Iroh).If you go in with an open mind and don't expect the TV show, and allow for the liberties taken, you might actually enjoy the film. The characters actually were close to their TV counterparts, regardless of what you may read. No, Sokka didn't get a lot to do, but, again, that was because the story had to move on. There really wasn't time to get all the little nuances and quirks from the show, so you'll just have to allow for that.Overall, the movies had flaws, and the acting wasn't always the best, but it was an overall entertaining movie. It could have done with another 15 minutes, but it didn't drag either. Me and my kids were very satisfied with it and hope that Books 2 and 3 will be made.So go watch it and make up your own mind. I have most definitely seen much worse movies. This one doesn't rank among them.Maybe it doesn't rank an 9- but I think many of the negative reviews were unfair and shortsighted. Just trying to make up for that a little.",The Last Airbender
314,mvedprakasha,The Conceptual Review,5,25 July 2012,"The movie emphasizes on the very Indian concept of realizing and experiencing the senses. It persistently relays on fictionizing the basic building elements of the universe i.e. air, water fire and earth, though the sky is left aside, personifying them to humans is excellent and appreciated effort. The introduction of the avatar through the Water ices is really brought nicely in the cinema. The avatar's capacity to talk to spirits at monovega (speed of thoughts) is brought relevance to the concept. Nevertheless, there are benders of water air and earth, it gives a feel of, it is no way concern with concept of movie. The term bending thus seems irrelevant in the movie caption. By default the air should and will have the control over the fire and water which is not very evidently shown in the movie. The avatar which is assumed to be the head of the all the basic elements tries to learn from the water and earth, which actually happens to be in the teaching position rather than the learning position in nature. The Earth Nation has been given no importance in movie and has been seen with reluctance, given the major importance to fire and water nations. This implies that earth has no relevance, which has been brought into the movie without any intention in the story.The dialogues also seem very ineffective. It's observed that there are major flaws in direction and story. The director M. Night Shyamalan has just tried to realize the good and beautiful concept without actually implementing it at the physical level.",The Last Airbender
315,gerd86,"Bad casting, bad acting, bad everything",1,10 August 2010,"After having waited eagerly to be able to see it, I was immensely disappointed by this movie. In fact, I would not even call it a movie. It is simply a series of clips of which their interrelation is neither clear nor obvious. If you do not know the story, it is impossible to understand it, because the storyline is missing. On top of that, it is actually boring, while the animated series always kept me curious and interested.Throughout the movie, the colours are too dark. Everything is given a grey and dreary look. The characters either portray the wrong personality or none at all, and do not even know how to pronounce their own name.Where is the energy, where is the cheer, where is the humour portrayed by the excellent animated series? It got eaten up by bad writing, bad casting, and bad acting. A bunch of twelve-year-olds could have done a better job producing it. It was a complete waste of time and money.",The Last Airbender
316,kkinne,Just a very bad film...,1,14 July 2010,"First of all, I would like to say that I liked The Village, up until it's lame ending. The Last Airbender is not even that good. Everything about the movie was bad...the story deviated too far from the original source material. The writing (a major weakness in many films nowadays) was bad. The dialog was flat, emotionless, and unintentionally hilarious at times. The casting was bad...Mr. Shyamalan's conscious decision to take a culturally-Asian (Chinese mostly) world and de-ethnicize it with a cast of whites (and one cringing token black)displayed a gross underestimation of the audience. The actor who played Aang had a tendency to speak in generalities (""Why are you doing this thing? You must stop doing this thing?"")which screams a poor command of colloquial English on the part of the writer. Katara had absolutely no knowledge of emoting whatsoever. The CGI work was passable, but the live photography was horrific. In one scene, the camera zoomed way TOO far in on Aang's face while he utters his bizarre dialog. And the ending varied from the one in the cartoon. In the animated version, Aang kills (unintentionally) the Fire Nation general. In the movie he is killed by four nameless characters. Also in the cartoon, when he was in his out-of-control state, he destroyed the enemy fleet with a giant water elemental. He didn't just passively threaten them with a tidal wave until they went home...All in all, I was very disappointed in the film. Sad as it is to say, I think Mr. Shyamalan deep down inside just doesn't want to do this anymore...",The Last Airbender
317,milanpthecharming,"Visually impressive, but with many flaws",5,27 January 2012,"When i first saw a poster for this movie i was pretty interested in seeing it. Of course,whenever i see a trailer or a poster for a movie, i consult with IMDb, just to see what people tell and what are the ratings. I was first greatly surprised when i saw the Metacritic score, since it was 20/100 at the moment. Then i realized this movie is a series adaptation (genius me) and that there were probably some mad fans of the series who didn't like the way Shyalaman reproduced their favorite show. Since i haven't seen the series, i can only speak of this movie as a standalone ;)First thing that crossed my mind was that the story was progressing a bit too fast. OK, not a bit, it was bumping all over the screen. In one moment we're here and then, with barely a glimpse of explanation, over there. In the end i was left with a feeling i watched a 20 minutes sequence of fights. The end just came too soon. I felt ripped of the story, like somebody stole half of the scripts before the movie started filming.The other thing are the characters. Too shallow. I guess there just was too many things to cover in this movie. I didn't get the chance to get to know the characters, let alone let them guide me through the movie.That's all of the bad things. Only two, but two too many. By some strange circumstance elaborated story and quality characters are main two things you need in order to make a good movie...But, what about the good sides? There has to be some, right? OK, if we leave aside the story and the characters, we then have some space to admire the visual aspects of the movie. Bendings are very well done, and it seems to me that they were the thing Shyalaman focused most on while making this movie, which is comprehensible, but not satisfying. Scenes of fighting are also well done, although, IMO, there's been a lack of those during the movie. The continents are not that much of a wondrous sight and never-before-seen, although they are admirable.In the end, as my final word, i'd like to say that i was just trilled with Aang (Noah Ringer), i find him very adorable, but still powerful. With him and the visual appearance on the + side i couldn't give this movie less than 5 stars.",The Last Airbender
318,EdnaWelthorpe,Not Dragonball Evolution bad...barely,1,18 July 2010,"My lord what a mess. I had high hopes for this movie too. Sure I was skeptical at first but when I read about M.Night's children were fans of the series and that he became a fan as well after watching it, I thought he would provide some of the talent that brought about Sixth Sense and the reverence to the source material that comes from being a fan.Boy was I mistaken! Let's talk about what went right first...there was some effort to maintain some semblance to the source material which is more than can be said about Dragonball Evolution...Noah Ringer has real martial arts talent. And that's it.As for what went wrong...1. The Cast. A catastrophe all-around; a collection of mistakes and miscasts. The main heroes: terrible. While I can't blame Noah Ringer completely for the horrific portrayal of Aang (that would be the writers) I do hold him accountable for his robotic acting, monotone delivery and incapability of delivering expressions and emotions beyond vacant, stunned stupidity. Nicola Peltz's turn as Katara was a laughable miscast (and one insisted by Shyamalan). Racial issues aside, she looks like she's eight and seems to come from the school of acting that calls for every big moment to have her quiver on the verge of tears. Both of them though are nothing compared to the misery that was Jackson Rathbone as Sokka. Of all the actors, I thought he was the worst. It was amazing how he captures absolutely nothing of the original character. Instead of a sarcastic warrior with budding genius capabilities, we have a wooden cut out who stares vacantly and pretty much could have been cut out of the film without anyone noticing. While also a fault of the writers, Rathbone's ""acting"" makes it all the easier to loathe.Dev Patel is the only actor to acquit himself. I don't blame him for why they didn't get the hairstyle right, why he has both eyebrows and why his scar is barely noticeable. He makes the most of a lousy script. It almost makes you forget that the person originally set to be Zuko was JESSE MCCARTNEY. I think Dev Patel probably saved lives by playing Zuko.Shaun Taub is mediocre as Iroh, displays the edge but none of the warmth and humor that makes the character so beloved. Aasiv Mandvi was badly miscast as the ferocious Zhao -- he seemed like what he was, a comic actor trying to be threatening. Cliff Curtis is also badly miscast as a very non-threatening Ozai.Oh and if that androgynous puppet was supposed to be Haru...GAAAHHH! 2. The script. The writing, pacing and dialogue is so bad you'll be forgiven if you thought George Lucas took over. Due to time constraints, we get a lot of things explained away with Peltz's very uninspiring narration. This takes a turn for the worse when we get to the North Pole and they actually TELL US THAT SOKKA AND YUE LIKE EACH OTHER! SERIOUSLY THEY COULDN'T ACTUALLY SHOW GENUINE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT BUT THEY TELL US! THAT'S JUST BEYOND LAZY! Sorry, got a bit carried away there.Then of course, we have laughable lines like Aang asking in the middle of the battle ""is there a spiritual place where I can meditate?"" I laughed at that though I don't think that was intended.And then there's the story itself. Due to time constraints a lot gets cut out but what they left fails to make any sense. Why on earth would you cut out the Kyoshi Warriors or visit to the Fire Temple but leave in the Haru/Earth Kingdom village thing which by the way is completely ruined when you see that they are KEPT IN AN OUTDOOR PRISON RIGHT NEXT TO THE VILLAGE! THEY ARE RIGHT IN THEIR ELEMENT BUT APPARENTLY NEEDED A POORLY DELIVERED MOTIVATIONAL SPEECH FROM ""UNG"" TO FIGHT BACK! Then I swear halfway through the film, it just stops. I honestly have no idea since it's too dark then to distinguish anything though I think it's supposed to be ""The Storm"". Oh and did I mention the random flashbacks Aang has that add nothing to the story? Then there are changes that just serve no purpose except to make fans hate it more. There's the annunciations of course, the decision to cut out Roku and that firebenders now need a source to bend from...WHAT!? Oh and the fact that the Avatar gang is completely useless fighting the Fire Nation at the North Pole. No cool Avatar State moment for ""Ung"" in this movie. And then there's Zhao is casually murdered by four waterbenders. That was a big ""what the -- ?"" moment for me.Oh and one more horrific and unnecessary change, they change the time line, now Aang only has THREE YEARS TO MASTER ALL ELEMENTS -- WHAT!? THE ANIMATED SERIES HAD A TIMELINE OF ABOUT 11 MONTHS TOPS FOR AANG TO MASTER ALL ELEMENTS, THREE YEARS!? WHY NOT MAKE IT TWENTY WHILE WE'RE AT IT!? 3. The effects. What really sticks in my chaw is how pathetic the bending is in the movie. All the benders make all these waves and kicks to get a very pitiful movement from whatever element they control. The waterbending was especially bad since the Tai Chi movements were so slow and dull. They actually made bending boring. Incredible.Overall this film should be presented to future film makers to demonstrate how you DON'T approach a big budget adaptation and to hammer the point home, show Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings for contrast.Now if you'll excuse me, I need to find a spiritual place to pray that M. Night is not allowed near any future Avatar project.",The Last Airbender

320,rwatt92,Greatest Insult of a Movie I've Ever Watched,1,30 November 2014,"Please note: this won't be a review so much as an angry rant. M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Last Airbender"" is the only movie that I wish never existed. There has never been a bigger insult to such something that was so great. ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" is one of my favorite TV shows and it was something that may have been advertised for kids but was something that anyone could enjoy. Shyamalan, the once promising director and so-called fan of the show absolutely destroyed it and failed the very basics of telling a story. As much as so many people hate George Lucas for the Star Wars prequels, I think most sane people would agree there were aspects about them that weren't bad. And Episodes I, II, and III always delivered in the action and visuals. Let's talk about the actual movie. The action is horrendous, to say the acting is wooden would be an insult to trees, the characters couldn't have been more poorly cast. The controversial white-washing of the cast would've been forgivable if they were competent actors. However these guys couldn't even be cast in a middle school play. A Wikipedia summary of Book One of ATLA would have been a better screenplay. The script is beyond lazy that bombards the audience with nothing but boring exposition. There is no attempt to make these characters interesting or to make the audience care about them. The cinematography is atrocious with characters often being extremely close to the camera. Even the extras are incompetently directed. Extras are very important because they help make your movie world convincing and real. Here it is clear that they weren't given any direction what so ever. No lets talk about how Shyamalan insults the fan base. I'm sure even in ""Dragonball: Evolution"" Goku's name was pronounced correctly. Shyamalan didn't even have the respect to pronounce the names correctly. As far as characters go, all of them were butchered but here are the worse offenses: Sokka, the sarcastic, wise-cracking, comic relief is made to be a stiff humorless stick- in-the-mud played by Jackson Rathbone (one of the worst actors I've ever seen). The big bad guy the Fire Lord is now the most nonthreatening antagonist I've ever seen. Azula only gets one brief scene in the end but just from the look of her she was horribly miscast. The beautiful that was in the cartoon is turned into this awful dancing were it takes 6 earthbenders to move 1 rock. Firebenders now need a source of fire to firebend, eliminating their ferocity. But let me save my breath, there is nothing good about this movie, not the story, not the visuals, not the writing, not the directing. It is clear that Shyamalan clearly did not care when making this movie. He didn't care to actually tell a story. When I hear narration explaining subplots that were barely in the movie, my ears bleed. I would rather sit through the 9 minute rape scene in ""Irreversible"" than 9 minutes of these characters speaking. The worse part is Shyamalan is completely unrepentant. He insists that the movie's negative reception is do to critics not understanding his style. He says that he's been influenced by European films. (What, you didn't see the influence of ""400 Blows"" in his movie?) Though Uwe Boll is European so in that sense he's right. He should be in full-on apology mode like Joel Schumacher was for ""Batman and Robin"", and Schumacher since then has directed a few episodes of ""House of Cards"" so he already has a far more impressive resume than Shyamalan ever had.I am so sick of you M. Night Shyamalan. How you're even able to get work after this is beyond me. I hope your closet gets filled with Razzies in the future. I hope you fade from the public eye. If I were you I would be hiding in shame. If I could give this movie zero stars, I would.",The Last Airbender

There is NO WAY that any filmmaker can put so much content into a 2 hour film.

The settings and special effects were pretty good. The big fight scenes didn't really hold my attention but at least they didn't drag on for too long. The characters were interesting. The acting, particular the kids, was not going to win any awards but was passable.Some reviewers say the dialog is clunky with too much exposition. I didn't notice that. In a fantasy film, you have to explain more than in a real-world drama. I was able to follow the narrative without having to watch a second time. I understood the motivations of the characters.It's a shame that some people's obvious love of the TV show has poisoned their enjoyment of this movie. They don't seem to realize that different media call for different treatments of the same story. This film is subtitled ""Book 1 Water"" so I assume that it covers the same material as the 20 (!!) episode TV series. Obviously a lot of scenes and character development were left out of the movie script - you can't fit an elephant in a mini.This won a Razzie for worst film - seriously??

323,jentlke_in_black,The worst part is that there's going to be two more sequels.,2,5 September 2010,"It's been a long time since I've gotten so incredibly annoyed at a movie. But first things first.When I heard Avatar: The Last Airbender was being turned into a live action movie I was excited yet skeptic. When I first saw the teaser trailer I was slightly put off by the fact that Aang was going to be played by a white boy, even though a bunch of elements from the series (clothing, name, culture) suggest that he is Asian. Then when I heard M. Night Shyamalan was doing the movie, all that was left of my faith in the movie hit rock bottom.First of all I wonder whether Shyamalan has actually SEEN the series. I wonder simply because he makes such obvious mistakes such as having the characters' names and other terms pronounced incorrectly. Other characters look absolutely nothing like the original, both their appearance as well as their personality, like General Ihro. Prince Zuko on the other hand looks more like a spoof of the original character. There is no depth in his character whatsoever.And the way he handled the script was simply aggravating, making it seem as though Katara only realizes he's the avatar near the end of the movie, before the big North Pole finale. The dialogs were cheesy and best to be ignored.The fighting scenes and special effects were okay, but they could've been better. I found the animation in the original series to be far more impressive than the choreography in the movie. I mean, if you see a handful of unbends do this little 'haka' like routine where they shout and stomp their feet on the ground, you're pretty disappointed when all it does is launch a basketball sized rock at one of the firebenders.The acting was awkward and painful. It was simply unpleasant to watch and that's all I will say about that.I just pray that next time, they pick a director that can deliver to handle a movie that had so much potential.",The Last Airbender

that is the crazies idea ever you don't use those powers to conquer earth you use it to defend earth and fight the evil and then the main character appear and as you se their names were all pronounced wrong, the bald ones name is uhng? its aang godammit, soakha?? its sokka you out of your mind , ovatar?? its avatar you idiot, Eroh?? its Iroh you kidding me and katarah its kattara though they didnt mention if her name was pronounced wrong but if Shyamalan made the names wrong then all of them were done wrong including zuko which i would say it was pronounced wrong as Zukkuh. and also the editing is bad and the cinematography was poor, and most certainly the acting is bad especially in that scene were zuko and his army came to take over land and he acts annoyingly awful and to ambitious and this was not how he acted in the actual cartoon even though he was still evil he didn't act like this, and he senses how Aang released his power and then it all gets choppy and worst of all i hated that earth benders scene it wasn't done seriously and then one of the character's kattara tries to use water bending to defeat the ones who stand in the gangs way but ends up freezing one of her comrades, really?? worst acting and scene shooting ever. to tell the truth it was kind of a good idea to make it into a movie only because it would be like a good fantasy with lots of action and would even have done sequals but then they hired m night Shyamalan to direct the film. now i am not a hater of shyamalan i have nothing bad against him he is not a terrible director but he has made movies i dont like and as you review him as a director he is a director for making really good mysterious and psychological thriller and drama films even though sometimes he goes to far and makes it weird like in the happening that film was also weird and really awful but still he tries his best and wants to be the new alfred hitchcock and if he continues his mess it wont be and personally i dont think he is the next alfred hitchcock because hitchock was a very famously great director and i dont consider Shyamalan to be one of the best directors i genuinely say he is an ok director but this movie was atrocious and it was because Shyamalan directed it. you never hire a mystery thriller director to direct a fantasy action movie based on a cartoon it could discredit him and ruin his reputation. the reason this movie was bad is because it was made to weirdly and nonsensical, i dont know if shyamalan purposely changed the names because he wanted it to be better or to make it into a mystery thriller or if he was just trying to earn money, i cant tell either way if he was a fan of the cartoon himself. but anyhow shyamalan was not the right choice for a directing role for this last airbender movie they should have chosen a better and more famous and exiting director like a one who directs big budget action films that provoke thoughts and make you exited like. if they hired Michael bay or Gore verbinski to do it they would have done it way better those two directors are very good at making good action and especially Michael bay he would have done it better it would be longer, the names would be pronounced right , there would be more chaotic action scenes and better character development and also there would be alot of resourceful explosions every time they attack using fire bending to hit their enemies, the speciel effects would be better and more cgi would have been done and most of all if bay directed this there would have been a sequal by now or in the past few years after this was released and this could have been the next thing bay would have done to achieve success after his early transformers movies instead of making age of extinction and the last knight. and it would have also been better if Gore verbinski directed it because like how he made pirates of the Caribbean and made it well done entertainment for families because it was a Disney movie. this movie would have been done actually way better cause verbinski directed also other Disney movies like lone ranger and Rango those movies were both entertaining for teenagers, adults, and little kids , it would have been better if Verbinski directed it, even more better than if bay directed it. it would be just as good as pirates of the Caribbean and not to mention this movie garned several Razzie nominations because of how bad it was and if Verbinski and bay directed it, it wouldn't have been Razzie nominated, it may have not been oscar worthy either but at least it would have been a Saturn award contender and even if it were oscar worthy it would only be for special effects, musical score, and sound mixing. in our perfect world it was directed by either of those two directors Michael bay and gore Verbinski and if it was for them this would have been a great fantasy entertainment movie that was done with an even bigger budget and would have been a more popular movie for people to love like with lord of the rings, star wars, pirates of the Caribbean and even transformers. sadly it was made by Shyamalan and it became bad therefore and i hope Shyamalan regretted this because he really needs to stick to his own genre and stay away from a great franchise otherwise that would save his reputation as director. all i can say is this movie was awful and it was definitely as bad as i remember it and not even the soundtrack nor special effects can save this film from being an atrocity. this movie was an absolute disaster from start to finish anyhow avoid this at all costs it is extremely awful and stick to the cartoon and if there was ever going to be a sequel to this then find like i said either Gore verbinski or Michael bay and then the sequel would be way better just like how the first ouija movie came out bad but the Sequal turned out good, otherwise do not watch and pretend it doesn't even exist and that Shyamalan never made it, Final grade score F",The Last Airbender

Lots of action, and vivid imagery.Was I expecting Academy award winning performances? No.I appreciated the fluid movements of the actors when they were doing the bending.The scenery was pretty amazing. Visually interesting, amazing sets. Like going on an exotic vacation.Costumes, were pretty cool too. I didn't see the 3D version because 3D bugs my eyes.

326,madonnakp89,Why I didn't think The Last Airbender was terrible,7,8 August 2010,"I've read a few of the reviews here and I just had to stop. Most of the reviewers are being quite ridiculous and misleading about the movie. I figured one book (or season) of Avatar would have to be fit into 1hr 30min-2hr movie, so I was prepared for them to skip some things and for everything else to be rushed--as all of you should have expected. Avatar is one of my favorite TV shows of all time. I am 21 years old and I have the whole series so that I can watch it over and over. Although I really enjoy the show, it has this weird quality about it...the whole slowness about it that has always eeked me. It felt like they could have ended the series a lot sooner and every other episode was a filler. We were constantly reminded of Aang's duty while he was just trying to be a normal kid. It got pretty monotonous but I didn't care. It's a charming series and it keeps you on your toes, but offers a lot of comedic relief for all those disappointing defeats along the way. This movie gave me the same feeling. Even though it was rushed, there was something slow about it. How could I possibly dislike this movie if I loved the show. It was simply a live actioned summary of one season (book) from my favorite TV series. I was so impressed by the visuals. That was one of the things I was worried about before I saw this film. I wondered just how they were going to pull off all of those effects without the movie looking like a mess. By mess, I mean something equivalent to a terrible photoshop job. Just one of those films where some of the 3D affects just don't fit in with the natural and real world. Well boy was I surprised. Oppa looked amazingly realistic, Momo also looked completely real. The bending was fantastic. This was like Avatar porn for all of the true fans out there. This eye candy was more than enough to keep me interested. If anything I could take from this film is that it's like a great portrait of a famous person done by a famous artist. It does the real person justice even if it doesn't look exactly like them. On visuals alone, this film did the Avatar series proud. As far as bad acting is concerned, having become very accustomed to the characters in the TV series and knowing very well that the TV show/series/book itself is targeted at a young audience, I saw nothing at all wrong with acting. When you're doing anything for children you have to act a certain way or you won't have their attentions for long. These actors sounded like and had those same qualities of the characters in the cartoon. If anything, as far was actors is concerned, I would complain about the casting on Prince Zuko and Katara's part and the fact that Sokka's character came off as more intelligent in the movie. Sokka wasn't as clumsy. Katara wasn't as bossy. Aang wasn't as fun. This movie actually toned down the acting. If you think the acting is bad in this then stay away from the cartoon. Overall, I liked the film but there were things to be disappointed about as there will be with any remake. First, the pronunciation of two of the most important characters names. Aang and Sokka's names aren't pronounced correctly at all through the whole film. After watching 3 seasons of it being pronounced (Eh-ng) and (Sock-ah) it was annoying hearing Aang (On-gh) and Sokka (Sew-ka) throughout the whole film. Another thing was that the most dramatic scenes in the TV show weren't as dramatic as M. Night Shyamalan tried to make it. He would get so close to peaking all of that drama but he felled short even at the end! The most important scenes were belittled. Lastly, M. Night Shyamalan completely ignored the comedy in Avatar. Children love things that make them laugh. This movie stripped away all of the childhood joy and stayed serious all the way through. I can see only one reason to keep a movie--directed at a young audience--so serious: to give it an older fanbase. I don't see why they'd feel a need to do that when Avatar the TV series already solved that issue, they already balanced out the seriousness and the satire in a way for adults and children to enjoy in their own ways. It should have kept that quality because no matter how serious it gets, its difficult for older audiences to take it seriously with all the mystical and magical things going on. So why punish the humor when taking it away will only get rid of the younger audience?",The Last Airbender
327,phoenix_100,Review for 'The Last Airbender' - 2010.,2,29 December 2010,"The Last Airbender doesn't work as an adaption of the well written cartoon series, and it doesn't work as a stand alone film. This film is deserves its low rating, starting off with a decent opening scene, however rapidly losing energy from there onwards. The audience doesn't feel much connection with the characters as most of the scenes are constantly changing with characters constantly moving. 'Bending' was well done in my opinion, however when it was actually used in battle, a string of moves only yielded a small gust of wind, or a few raindrops.What the audience is left with, is a badly written film, and a poorly played one. I think that the person in charge of casting should have picked someone who resembled Sokka and the other characters from the series, and while I didn't mind the appearance of Aang, his voice didn't fit him. The film was very messy, and if your not familiar with the series, you'll soon be lost in the story - because the individual season was always a mixture or series and serials.Overall, the highlights of this film were the icy scenery which looked extremely good on the big screen, however overall, due to a lack of plot and terrible writing, I gave it a final score of 2/10.",The Last Airbender

You want the short version: Go watch the animated series. Where as the television show has enough episodes and build to keep you entertained, this 'thing' not worthy enough to be a movie is a slow, boring, and nonsensical pile. I mean, in terms of good, bad movies (you know the ones you can enjoy by making fun them like the 'Twilight' series) it's not even worth it! Yes, the 'Twilight' series is better than Shyamalan's 'Last Whatever'! The shame is, this was a movie premise with potential. It had a script, setting, costumes, and more already laid out as an amazing blueprint from 'Avatar: The Last Airbender'. What more can you say about this thing? The cast is unlikeable, the script is horrid, and the action/'bending' (act of controlling the elements) is to the point of ridiculousness. This isn't even a good movie alone and if you think so then your standards are not high enough! I'm glad that we wont be seeing any wishful sequels from this movie and in twenty or so years, we might see the job done by a better movie team... sans the Shyamalan.",The Last Airbender
329,Doke,Should have been a photo book,3,9 July 2010,"I saw this in 2D. I'm not familiar with the anime series.This film is visually beautiful. The cinematography was amazing. The scenery, sets, and costumes are intricate and gorgeous. Most of the dynamic special effects are well done and convincing. The soundtrack is beautiful.Unfortunately, all the other elements that make up a movie are very weak. The script was terrible, with inane dialog, no sense of elapsed time, no character growth, too predictable action, and disjointed flow of events. There was almost no character development, making their motivations incomprehensible, and preventing us from caring about them. There are no surprises, the plot proceeds along the most predictable course. There's little emotion in the story; no laughter, no joy, no tragedy, no sorrow. Events occur that might have promoted those emotions, but they're presented so badly that they have no impact.Most of the acting was stiff at best. The single exception was the actor playing the uncle, who was the only one able to portray emotion with tone of voice, facial expressions, or body language. He wasn't given enough chances to do so.The plot has huge holes. Many things are not explained. The characters ignore obvious opportunities.I won't say how it ends, just that the ending feels both deus ex machina and silly, and contains some of the least believable CGI in the movie.I could almost recommend seeing this at a discount theater, or matinée. Ignore the stupid characters and action, and think of it as an artistic photo exhibit. The beautiful visuals will not survive transition the small screen. Don't bother seeing it on TV.",The Last Airbender
330,mrbill-18,Looking forward to sequels. . .REALLY!,8,2 July 2010,"(no spoilers here)It seems our society in general has become one where it is fashionable to bash people, and the harder the bashing, the better. Shyamalan seems to be particularly targeted for bashing. But regardless, here are my thoughts.Shyamalan's ""The Last Airbender"" is a visual and audible feast for the eyes. Visually, for both the excellent but not dominating settings and for the balletic, mesmerizing movements (a la Tai Chi) of the characters, and I mean the main characters and ensembles of ""background"" characters. Whomever the choreographer was, my kudos to him/her.It is an audible feast for, not surprisingly, the appropriate and sensuous score by James Newton Howard, who collaborates on all of Shyamalan's movies. (My favorite soundtrack -- I don't have this one yet -- is his score to ""The Village"".) The inclusion of ethnic (?) gongs and drums are woven beautifully into the wonderful score.Now the movie. I thought the cast was excellent -- I'm not buying into the whole ""racist"" talk, considering this to be more about the popular Shyamalan criticisms than anything else. The main character, Aang, is particularly well cast.The problem, as I see it, is one that plagues any first movie of a proposed series that must present a great deal of information to bring the movie goer up to speed with the story. When a movie has to cover a great deal of ground -- in this case several hours of original animated stories from the popular Nickelodeon series -- of necessity some character development and story telling suffers. (This was also true of the first ""Harry Potter"" movie, IMO.) Some have commented about the ""modern"" idiomatic English of the movie. Well, the Nickelodeon TV show was that way. I do not know whether Nickelodeon had any input in this area, perhaps influencing Shyamalan to retain a linguistic style that is more appealing to Nickelodeon's audience, or if Shyamalan just wished to honor the original. It was a bit annoying at first, but acceptable. (NOTE: Shyamalan's movies all are set in contemporary times, so contemporary speech is M. Night's usual fare, except for the isolated people in ""The Village."") Summary: a great story, well-told, and especially given the huge amount of story line to cover. Great cast and music and settings that add to, but do not detract from, the movie.See it. I for one am looking forward to the next installment.",The Last Airbender
331,escapeN2flixtion,One of Those Films That Gets Absolutely Nothing Right,1,19 May 2019,"As someone who considers Avatar: The Last Airbender to be one of the greatest television series ever made, this film is nothing short of heartbreaking. The show may not have been perfect, but it was darn near close to it, with rich characters, beautiful animation, and an entrancing fictional world, expertly realized. Each episode left me hungry for more, a rare trait which all works of fiction strive for but few achieve. That the film fails to capture any of the magic that made the show so great is an understatement.But even if we ignore the source material and judge the film on its own, it still ranks as one of the greatest cinematic catastrophes of the 2010s. This film fails to engage on ANY level: the characters, story, acting, pacing, and editing are all the absolute pits. Even the special effects are subpar. The film as a whole is a colossal bore. Watching this was an endurance test. I almost fell asleep three times. Looking back, I shouldn't have resisted; a little shuteye would have been a better use of my time.The story is absurdly rushed. Anybody not already familiar with the show's plot may find the film hard to follow. Part of the problem is the amount of material they had to cram into this thing. The film covers the entire first season of the show - 20 episodes at around 22 minutes apiece. The movie is just over an hour and a half long. MANY side characters and subplots were removed in order to make the time limit. Had a sequel to this movie been greenlit, the writers would have been screwed, because many of the characters they removed played major roles in the later seasons.What characters they kept bear little resemblance to their animated counterparts. Aang, our star, has changed from a fun-loving optimist who must come to grips with his duty to save the world, into a bland scatterbrain who always seems to be on the verge of tears. Katara, once a strong and hopeful young woman, is now a girl with all the acting range and charisma of a shopping mall standee. Sokka is cold, awkward, and angry, a far cry from the crafty wisecracker we all loved in the show. Dav Patel has been called the best actor in the film for his performance as Zuko, and I'm inclined to agree, only because he's one of the few actors here who displays any actual human emotion. The rest of the cast are about as lively as robots. Dialogue consists mostly of exposition dumps, spouted choppily and hesitantly.And speaking of exposition dumps, that's one of the film's biggest problems. See, in spite of all the details they cut, there was still too much worldbuilding and backstory left over for the writers to handle. Every scene in the film is nothing but exposition, raw and naked. Characters don't have the time to have conversations; they exist to spill ever more information as the film drags on, desperate to keep the audience up to speed with what's happening (or at least what's supposed to be happening). There is so much explanation and so little genuine character interaction that the film plays out more like a lecture than a story. I've seen more character development and human emotion from documentaries.The fight scenes in the show were always riveting. Here, they're just as dull and lifeless as everything else, but hey, what more could be expected from characters with all the vim and vigor of rotting wood? Choreography isn't even attempted, really. The show put great effort into modeling each character's fighting style after a real-life martial art; obviously the film didn't have the time or inclination to do the same. Even the special effects are poor. CGI elements never seem to look like they're actually a part of this world. Just how little did the studio care about this film if they weren't even willing to pretty up the CGI?If you want to know if there's anything in this film worth salvaging - any silver lining at all - all I can tell you is that the soundtrack's pretty good. A few of the tracks are quite moving. Now if only there were a good story for them to support!Many blame the entirety of this disaster on M. Night Shyamalan, but I don't think that's fair. I'm willing to bet there was some executive meddling, but since I know nothing for sure about what happened behind the camera, I don't feel right pointing fingers. Instead I'll say all that needs to be said: The Last Airbender is a disgrace to the show that inspired it, a disgrace to film in general, and a disgrace to any poor soul who managed to slog his way through it.I know there are many people out there who inadvertently discovered the show through this film, and became devoted Avatar fans as a result. And if this train wreck at least managed to spread awareness of the show to a few new crowds, then I guess I do have one thing to thank it for. So I thank you, movie, for that. And now that I've done so, I will try to forget you ever existed. Good day.",The Last Airbender

333,getmeagasmask,"Stunning, Jaw-Dropping.... In the WORST way!!",2,1 July 2010,"When I first began watching Avatar: The Last Airbender on Nickelodeon, it took some coercing from my friends to do it. I hadn't watched cartoons for a loooong time, but as soon as I saw one or two episodes, I found a deep maturity in the cartoon and could only agree when other fellow college-aged people raved about it (compared to laughing at them playfully, as I used to). Thus, as soon as I found out a movie was being released, I was excited. I was on board with everyone else to go and see the epic, enrapturing cartoon on the big screen.I will not forgive you, M. Night Shyamalan. Now, I'd seen some of Shyamalan's other films, and they sucked. So, when I learned about the Airbender movie, I was expecting this big turn around from him, for him to realize he could make a new, good name for himself.It was likely less than half an hour into the movie that my excitement and expectations for the movie were crushed. And I mean, crushed. The acting was poor in almost every case, and throughout the movie I almost found it laughable. Now, I'm not just saying that because of some resentment about the ""racist"" casting, because of course like any fan I expected the main characters to at least resemble their cartoon counterparts.... No, I'm saying it because it was. It was cheesy, and couldn't be taken seriously. OH, and what the heck was up with changing the pronunciation of all the characters' names??? Honestly I can give a little understanding if you couldn't find good enough actors that resembled the cartoon ones, but there was NO reason to change the name pronunciations! I just don't get that! And why leave out an important main character from the series?? Also, the movie skimmed over parts that were monumental in the cartoon series and focused on parts that Shylaman probably thought he could get the best action sequences out of. And even then, those scenes were littered with cheesy slow-mo moments and were not NEARLY as good as they looked in the commercials. In fact, they seemed different as portrayed in the trailers! The scenes of bending consisted of what soon became an obnoxious amount of whimsical hand movements followed by actual evidence of bending. At one point I whispered to my friend, ""First they dance. Then they bend."" It was SO annoying.All the moments in between the deeply disappointing battle scenes left no room to be forgiven. In-film narration can only work in some cases if it's done properly, and this wasn't a good case. The lines? Some of those I don't even know what the people were the thinking! The scenes themselves were poorly written. Character development was awful. If you haven't watched the cartoon, you'll have a hard time figuring out this film. If you have, you'll still have a hard figuring it out... figuring out how it could be so deeply butchered!The only good thing I can say is that the special effects were good, yes (though I've definitely seen better concerning 3D, but just in general they were good)... and I do have to admit the actor for Aang probably fit the bill better than anyone else could. Otherwise, don't expect much.If you are a fan of A:TLA, do not see this! Do NOT give M. Night Shylaman your money, because he has done terrible things to an amazing cartoon series. If you're not a fan of the A:TLA series, don't bother. Really. Don't.Wait for it to come out on DVD if you really want to see it. It is not worth your money!!",The Last Airbender

Night Shyamalan after The Village. I was not let down by how bad I thought The Last Airbender would be.How bad is it? It should have been a nickelodeon TV movie instead. The 3-D was useless, and the entire movie was just painful to watch.The acting--by everyone-- was terrible and had me cringing at the terrible script and attempts at comedy. Aside from bad acting, the pronunciations were horrendous, maybe because Shyamalan couldn't purchase the full rights to the words ""Ong""(Aang), ""Ovatar"" (Avatar) and ""So-ka"" (Sokka).There was nothing good or fun about this movie, and even the 'bending' was over acting.

335,silkshadow,This is what self hate produces,1,9 July 2010,"Its funny, my intention coming here was to pan this movie, but its been done so many times here already, and with much more scathing wit than I can produce, its a waste of time. So let me just say what a terrible movie! Instead I will talk about the controversy. I should say that I liked the TV series but am not a big fan and had only watched episodes periodically babysitting my cousin. I had not read anything about the movie. In fact, I didn't even know they were making a movie. I was invited, last minute, to a private sneak peak. This movie won't even start to play locally here for a couple weeks.I was shocked at the casting. Was there even an Asian actor hired to play any of the Asian roles here? I don't think so. I've just been been Googling and I am now up to speed with the http://www.racebending.com controversy.The puzzling thing is Shyamalan calls himself an Asian American. So its pretty obvious what has happened here: self hate. I could understand if, say, some of the roles were replaced with non-Asian actors and the actors were good. I could understand if, say, a box office draw for the younger audience like Robert Pattinson was used. None of that happened. All the Asian roles were replaced by unknown non-Asian actors and they all sucked.There is only one reason for this I think: self-hate. In every minority group, it happens. You get the occasional poor soul who just hates themselves and their race. Clearly this is Mr. Shyamalan's problem.The problem with that, is when you hate yourself, it clouds everything. This also explains Mr. Shyamalan failure on all his recent movies. He needs help and I suggest no one in Hollywood hire this man to make a movie again till he gets it. It will save us all from summer movies that are actually so bad it might damage a human brain.Seriously, as an announcer said during the Japanese round of 16 match: this maybe not the worst movie I've seen but its quite comfortably the 2nd worse movie I've ever seen.Get help Mr Shyamalan and learn to love yourself and your race!",The Last Airbender

338,zac-warsteiner,For a non-toon watcher...,1,21 January 2011,"As the Summary says, I haven't watched the series. Never really interested me, when it came out for Nickelodeon, I figured another 'toon for retarded 6-year-olds and didn't bother even glancing at it. I will allow that apparently the 'toon is better than that.But this means that in watching the film I have nothing to base it off of. Can't say how awful it is compared to anything. Except getting your head caught in a wood-chipper. In which case, the wood-chipper would have made me feel less annoyed afterward. The movie consists of 103 minutes of people almost crying, including me, by the time the credits come. I think even some of the credits were about ready to cry as they scrolled up. That's all I can come away with. Every single character in the movie looked like they were going to cry in two seconds, except the evil leader, who looked like he needed a toilet. I don't know if that counts as a spoiler, but it seems he never found one.Delving into the technical makeup of movie never interested me either, so the music existed and the special effects are no longer what drive movie creation, unless the director just goes bonkers, ala Dances With Smurfs. The storyline was incomplete, which is dangerous, given that you may flop before you can get your trilogy out, and then look even more stupid than you would have with at least one complete movie. And given that some of the people on Earth haven't watched the 'toon, the storyline becomes that much more important. The Avatar is supposed to enforce balance between the elements, even tho' he/she/it is born to one of them. That doesn't make sense, nor does enforcement if the Avatar's not supposed to hurt anyone. The job consists of flying all around the world 24/7 putting up walls of elements until everyone gives up and goes home?So we end up with a very long episode of 'Tai Chi Tonight', and everyone's gotten a lot of practice at looking like they're going to cry. I suppose that could be something said for the actors. They managed to act. Like they're going to cry. Actually, the General managed to have some ability to act, and he didn't have to perform a kata for an hour to use an ability. So there, one good point to the movie. That and it wasn't 2+ hours of wishing you were in a wood-chipper. Other than that, stick to the 'toon, or just do what I've been doing until tonight when I made a mistake.

339,dokkelly-120-943270,"This is just sad to watch, what a waste",1,17 July 2020,"This movie is absolute garbage. I doubt even kids would like it, especially if they watched the brilliant show it was based on.
M. Night Shymalan directed this and it has his pretentious finger prints all over it.
The movie trys to squeeze 20 episodes of content into an hour and a half movie which is a recipe for disaster. Most of the dialogue is just characters explaining the plot and it's boring and not immersive at all.
The child actors look constantly confused and the girl who plays Katara always looks like she's on the verge of tears.
The effects look like they weren't even finished. Appa looks espically bad.
As someone who absolutely loves the show and has watched it a couple of times, I feel this movie was a huge wasted opportunity. This could have been something great if it was longer and was made by competent people. Let's be thankful there's never going to be that sequel they actually thought was going to happen",The Last Airbender
340,vikingfan-126-976360,So So Bad,1,4 November 2011,"If they had only said screw you to the cartoon and made this a PG-13 movie and made the lead actor a lot older and all the supporting actors. If this was PG-13 with better fighting and special effects, this could have been as good as Lord of the Rings. Also get some actors that people have heard of. I have not seen worse acting in my life. It also tried to go too closely with the cartoon. They skipped so much of it that the movie was pretty much a summary. The idea of element benders is just so cool that this could have been amazing. Please reboot franchise, and by reboot, I really mean start over with only the idea of benders. Ditch everything else and this could be such a good franchise!",The Last Airbender
341,kneazles,"Ouch, if you're a fan!",5,1 July 2010,"I'm being polite with my rating of 5/10. OUCH - if you're a fan of the TV show. I'll admit that for the first 10 minutes any fan would be quite pleased and excited to watch Avatar: the Last Airbender, mainly because it is just jaw-droppingly WOW.But from there on in, it's downhill. Names are pronounced wrong, crucial characters and details for the future Earth and Fire books are missing, and some of the direction is shoddy and jerky - worse than most steady-cams. Explanations are changed to narrative voice-overs by Katara, and some aspects of the storytelling are changed to suit the 1:43 min runtime instead of building character development and letting the story naturally develop over the original 3-seasons.Some positive pointers? Lucas Films does the graphics, which are quite nice. But if you're looking for some amazing bending, keep to Nick. Some explanations about the characters' pasts are quickly explained and changed as well, but these surprisingly help add to the characters backgrounds and to the story and feel of the film.Yet, despite all this, you know you're watching a film and unfortunately unlike the TV series, you don't get captivated or engrossed into the large and exciting world of Avatar.M. Night Shyamalan does have some fairly good films to his name: the Village, Sixth Sense - but that says little for his career and he can add this film to another long list of failures. My opinion? Quit while you're ahead. As for a fan tidbit - his daughter was the one who got him interested in Avatar in the first place. I highly doubt she's going to be pleased by his adaptation of the popular TV show; in fact, her words might just echo mine: ""Wow. That just plain SUCKED.""",The Last Airbender
342,georgehogg,"Take away the cartoon, and it's STILL garbage.",2,13 March 2016,"The film's main problems of many are pacing, acting and blatant lack of any fun or emotion. The pacing is horrible. The story just rushes out it's plot, evident by it's lack of emotive dialogue and mostly just establishment thrown together. The characters are so boring that it's hard to believe they are based off the main characters of the series it is adapted from. They always just stick with one facial expression throughout the whole movie, and it's on Kristen Stewart levels of devoid. Among the film's positives are the decent effects (some of them), the costume designs and the sets. The sets are admittedly quite breathtaking, but unfortunately wasted on a film barely worth sneezing at. The camera angles are also a problem. The shots are just plain ridiculous at times, like an overly dramatic shot right up in the the main character's face when all he is doing is establishing detail that could have been established much quicker. The fight scenes are also very jarring. Shyamylan constantly tries to do big dramatic fights all in one shot, but the actors always feel like they have no clue what to do beside stand there and look prepared to battle. I would like to say that the TV series in my favourite show of all time, yet I have constructed this review from a perspective of which I believe to be unbiased. However, the show is still far better to view rather than this film. I advise you to get your children to watch the cartoon over the movie. I do believe that a movie based on the series can work, but not in this way. Cast people with actual experience as the main characters, slow down the storytelling, angle it correctly, and kick off m night shyamylan. He is not cut out to make fantasy action films, as this film proves.",The Last Airbender
343,mikyb21,Did Shyamalan enjoy the animated series at all?,4,2 July 2010,"M. Knight Shyamalan must have saw something completely different from me in the animated Avatar series. Action sequences aside, Shyamalan managed to remove every enjoyable aspect of the original from his film. For me, the most enjoyable part of the animated series is the comic interplay between characters. There is a pervasive silliness and humor that gives it it's charm. This live action version is sloppily melodramatic and all the characters over-serious. They do manage to make Aang playful in flashbacks, but he is essentially a mopey kid for the remainder of the film.The story suffers in other ways as well. Most of the acting is on par with a high school play, especially Nicole Peltz as Katara. While some characters were cast OK (Prince Zuko), many were horribly miscast (Uncle Iroh - He's supposed to be chubby!). The script was horrible and every line felt forced.I Love the original animated show, but this film just does not do it justice. Shyamalan apparently only thought about how to do cool martial arts stuff, but completely skipped over the character development and script writing. He obviously expects to do a trilogy. All I can hope is that either he wakes up and does it correctly next time, or the films are handed to a better director.On the upside, my 10 year old liked it a lot, and the score was pretty good.",The Last Airbender
344,Datrebor,WHY? The Last Airbender: Just that bad. With Spoilers,3,11 July 2010,"****Contains Spoilers**** I agree with the other reviewers but I'll add this as it just ticks me off on how they did this movie so wrong.To start off (spoiler) Aang was found when Katara and Sokka was out fishing in his boat(not on land) and it was a argument between Katara and Sokka that Katara started using her water bending skill and freed Aang from the ice and the fire nation was notified then but then later when Aang and Katara found the fire nation ship, after penguin sledding(not in the movie either) and set off one of the booby traps that sent a flair up.Aang's arrows are just blue not tattoos. Katara and Sokka's hair are wrong, Katara's are missing the 2 strands from the back clipped to the front. Uncle Iroh or Iron as he's called on their website under characters, they used the wrong person for that role, wrong height, weight and hair, Prince Zuko's hair was wrong and so was his scar, and his father the fire lord is wrong. Katara was not given the water bending scroll but Stole it from a pirate who stole it from the water tribe. Katara started teaching Aang before they reached the northern water tribe and he was picking it up fast which made Katara upset cause it took her months to learn. There were so many character left out. The trip to the fire nation temple where Aang found out about the comet and how the war started also earlier when Aang was in the spirit realm it was left out when he found out when he is killed in the Avatar state. The biggie at the end they left out when Aang was captured by Zuko and did the final battle all wrong maybe they couldn't pull it off but that was not how it ended in the cartoon and they should have tried to end it the right way.Some of this will probably seem petty but its important to me to have character look right and main points included or done right.",The Last Airbender
345,hitek_dialekt,That was my last M. Night dollar.,3,2 July 2010,"OK I'm going to give a BRIEF review from a different perspective.I'm a father of 2 kids who LOVED the Avatar series and they brought me along for the ride. I too fell in love with the animated series and thought it was as beautiful as it was entertaining.SO - my kids and I had the date circled on the calendar to go and see the film for about 7 months now.Here is what I liked about the movie: 1) The costuming (with 1notable exception - Zuko's burn was pathetic.)2) The special fx. Here's what was terrible: 1) The acting was wooden, forced and pathetic. That's the director's fault2) Who told you to change the pronunciation of the names? 3) Ummm... what part of Buddhist Monks (Airbenders) Japanese Samurai (Firebenders) Inuits (Waterbenders) and landlocked Asians (Earthbenders- maybe Laotian?) don't you get? Seriously? Indian Firebenders? White Waterbenders? I know enough has been said about the casting - but come on, Night. Who told you to reimagine everything when it was ready-made for any competent director?4) Where was the funny?! An UNFUNNY Sokka? An always serious Aang? WOW.5) Dev Patel being cast as a angst-ridden 15/16 year old Japanese boy was ridiculous.. but not as ridiculous as6) The guy from ""Daily Show"" being a Fire nation commander? SERIOUSLY? I was looking for a Jon Stewart drop-in.7) The last time I saw the guy playing the Firelord, he was in TRAINING DAY as a Latino gangbanger. Wow Night. Wow.8) Ummm - since when is Zuko's uncle a 6'3"" 145 lb 44 year old Indian? 9) I fell asleep. 10) My kids LAUGHED at Appa. Not a good thing.So in summary, something I loved was MANGLED by a ""director's vision"" once again. I used to love ""Dungeons & Dragons,"" and it happened to that too.M. Night should be through in Hollywood after this one as this was a boatload of money wasted.The Last Airbender deserved better... If I were Nickelodeon, I'd probably want to sue - and I doubt the studio would give the greenlight to a new director and CASTING agent.What a waste.

346,logeesp,"The movie is okay, at best",6,21 May 2019,"A lot of people hated this movie, and it's not hard to see why. The acting is very lackluster. Noah Ringer's performance as Aang lacked the energy and happiness that is seen in the show, Sokka lacked his comedic lines, and Kitara? Whoever played her was freaking horrific. Every time she talked, it sounded like she was reading her lines instead of really acting. Speaking of the names, they are butchered. Is it that hard to get their names right? The use of slow motion is overused, but I still enjoyed it. Some parts looked really cool to me. The movie is guilty pleasure to me. I watched it the other day on Amazon Prime, and I enjoyed it. The fight scenes were entertaining and the score was POWERFUL. The special effects look really nice, (except the airbending scenes. It just looks like it was added on at the last minute). The thing about this movie is that it stuck to the source material some of the time, which is sadly, a lot more than the Percy Jackson movies and Dragonball Evolution. I felt that it was rushed. It tried to fit too much into an hour and a half, and some really important things were missing. But then again, I found this movie fairly enjoyable despite its horrible flaws. I don't know, I guess I just find enjoyment in bad movies.",The Last Airbender
347,chrsstout,Doomed from the beginning and snowballed negativity,8,10 September 2021,"I was a big fan of M. Night for a long time leading up to this movie. So in order to understand what happened with this, you have to understand what happened leading up to this movie.Before TLA, M. Night found himself butting heads with critics. He felt like they were being unnecessarily picky with his works, and I would agree.So, in 2006 he made a movie called 'Lady in the water' where one of the characters was a pompous movie critic who got eaten by a monster, all the while mocking critics as a whole.Critics lost their collective minds. They thought it was such bad taste they went on a rampage. This was during the early days of Facebook.Then he released the happening, which everyone hated because it came out in a time where people didn't believe in climate change, also carrying over hatred from critics. So people automatically hated it.Then came TLA. I watched it closely because I was a fan of the cartoon and also M. Nights previous work. So I was excited. But since it was the early days of Facebook, people had no concept of 'article credibility' so a flurry of articles came out absolutely SMEARING The Last Airbender. Which was impossible. It hadn't been released for any screenings, and yet everyone hated the movie. So they literally BUILT a bad reputation from the start. Politics might have had something to do with it as well being that climate change wasn't even acknowledged back then.So then it released, and M. Night did a lot of stuff right: the action sequences were dope. The character/story development were en pointe. He even said he wanted to make it better for Asian culture (because the source material is American). So he changed the way Aang pronounced and added some traditional Chinese film styles. But it was doomed from the beginning.People turned on a critical eye, and that was that. The movie has its flaws, sure. But, it's definitely not as bad as everyone says it is.People say they hated the kid who played Aang, but I thought he did great. Also they think he should have been Chinese? Which is also ironic because the Cartoon is American. I guess people just weren't ready for that melding of cultures. Similar to the way people weren't ready for climate change in 2008.",The Last Airbender
348,mechachan15,"It's not that bad, just don't have high expectations.",6,13 July 2010,"Before I say anything else..I want to state that this movie WAS NOT as bad as everyone was making it out to be. I'm going to give a breakdown of the film: Plot: The basic plot was fine. It was pretty much the same as the cartoon show. 9/10 Characters: The characters in the movie all looked the part. The main problem was their acting. Noah Ringer(Aang)needs to be cut some slack, since this is his first film. I do think that the guy who played Commander Zhao needs to work on his acting though, as well as the actors who played Katara and Sokka. Both of their portrayals were limp and I think they could do much better. 6/10 Music: The score was excellent. 10/10 Writing: some of the dialog is cheesy..most of it is passable, but there isn't enough of it. This movie is heavy on the action, but not so heavy on the character interactions/development. The pace is also too fast, which is why I'm hoping the sequel gets a longer runtime(if it gets made). 7/10Special Effects: The bending effects were great. The least realistic element was probably water, in terms of appearance. It still looked awesome though. Overall, the cgi was enjoyable and well done. 9/10 I believe this movie suffered from a short runtime. I think that M. Night wanted to include more material, but couldn't. While I think this movie could have been better, it certainly isn't the ""worst movie ever"" like all the comic book guy wannabes are saying. M. Night was good at capturing certain specific ""moments"" of the show, but not capturing the overall appeal that the show had. He tried though and I can tell he likes and respects the animated series. I hope that if a sequel is ever made to this, that M. Night will improve upon it.final rating: 6/10.",The Last Airbender

Of course, they are not 100% identical. But if you except ANY movie to be EXACTLY THE SAME like the animated series (or a book), I can guarantee that you will be disappointed. Just compare the original ""Star Wars"" movies to the animated ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" series. Or compare the ""Forrest Gump"" movie to the original books. They play in the same universe, but there are MANY differences of course, partially due to the medium (real actors VS. animation or book). I saw many movies which butchered the original book or animation or vica versa (e.g. Aldous Huxley's Brave New World is one of the best books ever, but the movie was terrible), but this is not such a bad one.

351,theHAMster999,Horrible Excuse For A Film,1,12 July 2010,"I love M Night Shymalan. I really do. After this movie it is hard to even recognize him as a filmmaker. I loved Sixth Sense, best thriller ever made, loved Signs, liked Village, one of the few who liked Lady In The Water. I was a fan. I thought The Happening would be the low point of his career. I was wrong. If you thought The Happening was bad this movie is disgusting. The story is interesting it has a capable story. That is probably why the television show is so popular. I have never seen the show and my friends who are fans of the show were so upset about the destroying of there show was unbelievable. Now to point out the flaws: 1. The script was terrible sometimes laughable but mostly boring. The best thing about The Happening was that you could laugh at the cheesy lines. During this film you just find yourself falling asleep. 2. No character development AT ALL. You do not care about anyone in this movie. I was so bored I just wanted them to all die so the movie would be over. 3. The acting was significantly bad. The only actor worth mentioning in this film is Dev Patel but even he could not save his role from the horrible script. Which is the reason for most of the bad acting because these really are not the most terrible actors. 4. Long dancing around with nothing going on along with long actually boring action sequences. There is probably only one cool effects moment. 5. I did not see this movie in 3D, but from my sources I have heard that that was the worst part of the movie. The last minute 3D upgrading. I hear it makes things blurry, discolored, and distracting. If 3D is the worst part then MAN that must be bad. The movie was bad enough without the 3D. Movies like Twilight they really are not good movies. I like to see great movies like the old classics and academy award nominees but at least Eclipse is entertaining and fun to watch with your girlfriend. The end of the film hints a sequel but that definitely will not happen. It will be like Eragon and Inkheart a first movie FAIL. I hoped this helped.

I didn't expect the movie and the show to be the same and I was hoping I would be pleasantly surprised. I still knew this movie would be terrible. I just wasn't prepared for how BAD it would be.The cast, the acting, the writing, the storytelling; just about everything was AWFUL. All the elements that made the series charming and fun are completely gone in this movie adaption. It's so busy trying to be an ""epic"" that it doesn't capture the actual epic element that was in the show, nor does it capture the quirks that made the characters so memorable, whether you liked them or not.And most of all, this movie does not have COMMON SENSE. Example, the Firebenders in this movie, in contrast with the show, need a source fire to bend. It never once seems to occur to non-Firebenders that putting out the source of their bending would put the Firenation at a disadvantage. Especially the scene with the imprisoned Earthbenders. There's earth all around them they significantly outnumber the Fire Nation soldiers, and earth DOES put out fire... and they don't... they can't... It just... This movie lacks so much common sense, it insults the viewer. Several times, I wanted to scream because I felt so insulted. And I probably would have felt that way regardless if I'd seen the show or not.The movie, however, does get some props for excellent musical scores (which retain some of the original score from the show) and stunning visual settings and design.

355,louissaphire,How To Make A Bad Movie Worse Part II,1,5 July 2010,"Not another crappy wanna be blockbuster hopeful converted from 2-D to 3- D at the last minute. NOTE to Hollywood, PLEASE STOP DOING THIS! It is not going to make your expensively (reportedly 210 million) crappy movie any better to have it quickly converted to something that barely looks like real stereoscopic photography. The only kind thing I can say about the 3-D is that it's a just a few tads better than the pop up book looking Cash In Of The Titans - Er, I mean, Clash Of The Titans. This quickie up converted 3-D is murky and unrealistic which screws up the cool looking cinematography. And considering that is just about the only thing the film has going for it, that's really bad news. This is just peachy, we finally get the problems of 3-D projection fixed and all of a sudden we start getting unreal 3-D. Remember coloration of old movies. Well after three decades they finally have nearly perfected it, although nobody knows this because very few films are converted to color anymore and no one really cares. If you still insist on converting you 2-d to 3- D at least take the time and effort to compose each and every shot for the process. And take the time to get the conversion as perfect as possible. So far Alice In Wonderland is the only well converted 3-D feature and look how long it took for that to come out. Here is an idea for the studios to make an easy buck (because that is what it's all about, right?), why don't you guys just restore your old 3-D movies from the fifties and give them a small limited run. I can almost guarantee you that it wont cost more than 6 to 8 million per film, maybe less. There is some mighty fine 3-D stuff just sitting around collecting dust - some of it never shown in public in its original format. John Wayne's Hondo, for example, was stereoscopically restored over a decade ago, and it's still sitting in the estate vault collecting dust. What a shame, because once you see this stuff you can see that 3-D is more than just shoving things into theater space. Although that's cool once in awhile too!",The Last Airbender

As i saw the trailer i was really excited about it and went to it immediately with my friends and came out with a HUGE frown and was disappointed.let me talk about the movie a bit(no worries i never post spoilers): 1-Aang(Noah Ringer) had absolutely no acting performance,weak,trashy,and whatever you name it i saw a boy who is lost and can't find his way. 2-Way too much fast-paced, as i watched the movie the plot was way to fast to understand, in the anime it said in the first or second episode the reason why they are headed north,in the movie they say it half way through and sometimes you just pause and say:when did they get here? 3-The show was based in Chinese environment Shyamalan thought it would be cool if he brought Indian actors(not to criticize about them but they really didn't fit the characters)and we get to see Fire Lord Ozai(which in the show we see him in the 3rd season) 4-NO COMEDY AT ALL!! the show was pretty hilarious specially with Sokka but in the movie he doesn't try to be funny.After all this the movie doesn't cut it and i'm hesitating to see the 2nd and the 3rd installment if they are done by Shamalan himself.",The Last Airbender
359,roelsemail,I became physically ill,1,1 December 2014,"This was amazingly dumb. For a number of reasons.Firstly, they changed all the names. Iroh, became Eero. Aang, became ohng, Sokka, became Soak-ha... What could the reason be of this? It's not serving any purpose! You get the feeling you're not watching ""the real deal"" but some cheap rip off. If you know Coca Cola, then Cooka Cola just seems like a cheap alternative. That's exactly what this name change thingy did for the story. Secondly, the races of the characters. Why is the fire nation made of Indian people? Are those personal friends of Shyamalan? I call it rather coincidental that a big chunk of the cast is of the same ethnicity of the director. Eventho Zuko is incredibly pale in the series, in this movie he is Indian. So is Iroh, Firelord Ozai and commander Zhao. Even Azula is kinda Indian.Katara and Sokka were white... While in the series, they have a darker complexion. And Monk Gyatso... Was black! Except from an Asian Earthbender, there was no Asian to be found.Zuko, even tho Dev Patel was one of the better actors, was not at all as he should've been. His scar was not at all that visible. While it's like the most important part of his face. And, you know, he was Indian...Aang, played by Noah Ringer, looked a lot like a real life Aang... But his acting skills were practically none existent. Sokka, played by Jackson Rathbone... Sucked! Not funny AT ALL, and poor poor poor acting. At times I just felt embarrassed for HIM!In the end... It just seemed that Shyamalan lost interest in making the movie at the first scene. It seemed as if every scene is 'take 1' and that he just wanted to be done as quickly as possible.I don't have an evil personality, but deep down inside I hope Nickelodeon and Paramount have punished Shyamalan for this injustice. I actually feel wronged... Robbed and cheated. Leaves me to question once again, why this director has such a big name. Time and time again, he messes up movies... Just like The village, this movie would've been better off in the hands of a director with talent.",The Last Airbender

If you have seen the avatar cartoons, you will definitely love this movie.I have heard people criticize it, and I don't understand why. Its highly enjoyable, well made, just perfect for kids.I particularly love the statement of the director that I made it for kids, and not for their ""parents"" (like transformers, putting in sleazy scenes of Megan Fox in what was supposed to be a kids movie).This movie is great hands down. I love how they compressed a very long series of cartoons into a very meaningful short duration which does not miss the important elements, and can still be enjoyed on its own. The effects of bending are also great.",The Last Airbender
361,dark_scionproductions,Long Overdue,1,25 December 2012,"A lot of people have railed against this for some of the more silly reasons (the name mispronunciation, the firebending, the 'racebending') and I'm going to try not to gripe on them too much, I mean they are pretty horrendous but they don't drag this movie down. It takes a lot for me to keep saying this, but I used to like Shyamalan's movies, I can remember watching movies like the sixth sense and liking the experience I had, I even like(to this day) lady in the water, even with the prophet of greatness bit. These days, if I see the name tagged to a movie or even hear it, I instantly go the way of everyone else. This movie was what did that to me. Back in mid-06' a friend of mine showed me the first DVD of Water and I was hooked, so when I'd been through the mess of DB:E, I felt the same feeling rise up in me: little to no actual shots of the movie, little to no promo's of other things in the movie, little to no actual stuff coming out about it, I was worried, so I chose to leave the movie alone and wait til it came on the TV. I have to say I was glad of it, because after reading and watching reviews of this, I felt elated that the most I'd have to pay was a TV license fee. Then I saw the movie. And I wanted my time back, I still do, it's an hour and forty minutes of my life I want back that I will never have.Everything from this was so slipshod, simplistic and downright useless that I still wonder how this got past the initial script stages(it scares me that this could be the 'good' script left over after rewrites) because it feels like no-one had anything but a 'Meh' attitude to this project from the moment go. We have Noah Ringer as the titular character and nowhere does this movie show it's flaws more than this little... He doesn't perform any of the great qualities that people would allow to like a character, he's just there and he's 'so' hard done to that it makes me want to have Jake Lloyd's 'I'm a self-important douche bag' on the screen, at least with him he's being something. This is always going to be the problem when converting something like animation into live action, having a wise cracking character like Sokka that can go from insanely goofy to serious and world weary, to food crazy is going to VERY difficult to pull off, you can with animation because all you need to do is have separate sessions with the VA's, setting up scenes in where Sokka complains that he's hungry, see's a lemur and wants to kill and cook it, see's the enemy of everyone that had obviously killed everyone in the temple they're in, then see's his friend going through obvious and gut-wrenching grief is next to impossible, so most would lock onto one aspect and hope it goes well. Shyamalan merely chose to make him unemotional, like everyone else in this movie.I've never liked Dev Patel, there I said it. I live in the UK, I see people like Patel on a daily basis and I grew up around a lot of that kind of personality, he's not special, he's a Londoner and that's not that special where I come from. Because he was in a movie that made everyone swoon and gawk, doesn't mean he was great, he had good direction and a good script, in this he is pretty much himself and-as I know he CAN act, I don't know why Shyamalan(that's a lie, I do)didn't use him to his full potential and explore Zuko's inner rage more and how that's messing with both his Firebending and his personality.This movie is possibly worse than DB:E, but it's a fine margin and it's not really worth it to argue, the two recent movies adapted from much beloved Animation's have been terrible and that should be the warning light for anyone who thinks Hollywood can do justice to an cartoon.",The Last Airbender

363,TheMovieGal,"""The Last Airbender"" a good family film despite controversial casting decisions",5,24 July 2010,"M. Night Shyamalan, most known for his huge hit film ""The Six Sense,"" has taken on the task of adapting Nickelodeon's most popular cartoon series ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" to a feature film series. The first of three films to be released is entitled ""The Last Airbender."" The cartoon series on which this is based is a story of an Asian-inspired mythological world divided into cultures that are connected to one of the four elements of air, water, earth or fire.The controversy came during the casting of the film. Non-Asian actors were selected for the film and fans of the series were horrified. It is truly amazing that Hollywood would still cast Caucasians into Asian parts, and hopefully the controversy over this film will put to rest this antiquated and racist practice.None the less, the film is overall a good children's movie. The story focuses on the character Aang, an air bender. In this world some special inhabitants possess the ability ""to bend"" or manipulate one of the four elements. But Aang is the most important of his world. He is the Avatar. He is uniquely capable of bending all elements and communicating with the spirit world. With these abilities come the task of maintaining peace and balance in the world. But Aang's training was interrupted for over 100 years and when he returns to his duties the world is in the process of being enslaved by the fire nation. With the help of a water bender and her brother, Aang returns to his training while in the midst of trying to restore peace to his world.The story is a pleasant departure from Shyamalan's more adult and scary films. It should be noted that his adaptation does stray from the original series and ardent fans may disapprove.For more film review by Kay Shackleton, copy and click this string onto your browser: http://www.examiner.com/x-53875-Palm-Springs-Film-Industry-Examiner For Kay's work on Silent Films, go to www.SilentHollywood.com",The Last Airbender
364,jtrascap-1,"Honestly, it's not half-bad",5,24 February 2011,"It's not half bad - certainly beautiful to watch (I saw it on blu-ray in 2D) and I can understand the character development and the processes the characters went through, unlike the Narnia movies which seems far less involving. Is it the cartoon/anime? I don't know - never saw it, probably never will. Certainly don't care to. But not unlike ""The Shining"" or ""V for Vendetta"", I think the movie tries to carve out it's own existence and does so admirably for a family film. I do think it's trying to jam a lot of plot into it's time slot, but I have a feeling it didn't have much of a choice. Trying to get a 4- film franchise for earth, fire, water and air would be hard. I also don't think the director had the clout anymore to say no to having post-processed 3D foisted upon him. Of course everyone has to say it was designed to be so, but if you see the blu-ray print, you'll see some truly beautiful lighting and set design, perfectly balanced for normal, flat movies. 3D is a phase - let it die. Lastly, I can't get into the hate. If you read many of the user reviews, you'd believe this thing is a harbinger of the apocalypse - this is because there's an internet phenomenon whereby people believe they're more deeply invested in the material than the writers, director, actors - it doesn't matter. They'll hate it into submission, and that kind of hate campaign works too. Will it cost the studio money? Almost certainly - that's the game plan. It's like shampoo - create fake accounts, spend your life ranting how awful it was, repeat daily. Manos - Hands of Fate, now that's a 1-star movie, not this. Ignore the haters - they'll just go swarm on the next Stargate series instead.",The Last Airbender
365,Murder-Meatball,Why beat a dead horse?,1,22 September 2013,"Because it deserves it!Like most of the reviewers of this disgrace of a movie I fell in love with the animated series in my mid-teens. It had everything an epic story should have and had an almost perfect balance between action, character development, story progression and contemplation of grand philosophical questions, as well as mixing adult themes and more child friendly elements, like no animated production I have ever seen (well except for Pixar I guess). Most of all it had an aura of joyful passion about it; even the weakest episodes still had a tonne of passion, playful energy, effort and commitment put in to them!This is why it is so incredibly sad when Mr Shyamalan managed to suck all that great stuff right out of the source material by the gallon when he made this abomination; Poor acting (even by child actor standards), sub-par special effects that where an embarrassment compared to the show (casually soaring rock anyone?), horribly lifeless character interaction which only served as exposition and complete failure to adapt any of the qualities that made the animated series so amazing sinks this movie to the very bottom.If I had not known the series before I saw the movie I might have given it two or three stars but as it is I wish I could give it zero.

So ya this movie had already left a bad taste in my mouth before it even actually played. Truth be told I didn't expect it to follow every single detail the story of the first season (or book as it's referred to in the show) but goddamn it goes beyond that. The characters are portrayed the exact opposite from the show, missed quite a few plot crucial moments, the effects are laughable (the only thing people can give this turd praise for), the choreography is like something out of a parody music video, the humor is nonexistent, and finally the climax blows. I can't believe how badly botched this adaptation is, my god the video games are more faithful than this sh**.

368,chasebangerter,The Soulless Adaptation,4,27 November 2015,"This is kind of a fascinating movie, mostly because of the amount of hate that this movie brings to it and its director, M.

I have to point out that I am a huge fan of the TV show but I won't point out the differences between that and the movie as I'm only going to judge the movie on its own. Despite what most people think, there are a few good things about it. First of all, I really like how they handled the villains, specifically Zuko and Uncle Eyro. The two actors did a good job and I bought into their relationship. And some of the action scenes I thought was pretty decent for the most part. Everything else, however, it's not well made. My biggest problem with it is that the story goes by way too fast. There will be moments in the movie where they'll rush through scenes in order to get the story going without spending anytime to get emotionally invested with the characters. Not only that, the acting in this movie kind of sucks, specifically from our main actors. It also doesn't help that there are a few unintentionally funny scenes. But despite of all that, while I do think that it is a bad movie and everyone has the right to hate on it, it didn't really make me angry and I found some entertainment in it.

374,MovieManPat,The most inept film-making I have seen in years,1,1 July 2010,"The only thing I can really say about The Last Airbender is this: Epic  Fail. Just how epic? Paramount Pictures gave M. Night Shyamalan $150  million dollars to adapt the popular Nickolodeon cartoon for the big  screen. What they got is an absolute mess of a movie, complete with  poor acting, the most hackneyed script ever, and a last-minute  conversion to 3-D that only serves to destroys what was possibly some  lush cinematography.  The Last Airbender is perhaps the worst film of the summer, a feat I  thought Jonah Hex had locked down. However, Airbender makes a  determined effort. Let me put it this way, as good as Toy Story 3 was,  Airbender is just as bad. It was hard to find anything wrong with Toy  Story 3. It is nigh impossible to find anything right with Airbender.  The story is ridiculously complex. In a world where people can  manipulate (bend) the four elements of air, earth, fire and water,  depending on their tribal affiliation, there exists a being (the  Avatar) who can manipulate all four. This person is also the sole being  capable of communing the the ""spirit world"" which serves to keep things  in balance. This being went missing 100 years ago, only to be found in  a giant ice sphere by two children of the water tribe. In the 100 years  the Avatar has been gone, the Fire tribe has begun conquering the  others, though we're never really told why. The disgraced Prince  Zuko(Dev Patel, the Slumdog Millionaire himself) of the Fire tribe  wants to the Avatar so he can return to his family. The Water children  need to save the Avatar to ensure the Fire people don't win. For this  point on it becomes to silly to try and summarize.  Shyamalan succumbs to his own hubris, loading the film with long,  boring exposition communicated through long, boring speeches that I'm  sure were meant to be inspirational. Instead they are clichéd,  burdensome mounds of words that only slow down an already languidly  paced film. He heaps some unnecessary narration on top of the  exposition, condescending to the audience as he does it. Perhaps the  narration was put in to help the film's target audience, the  prepubescent b0ys and girls who watch the cartoon, understand where  this convoluted story is going. Sadly, it doesn't. The dialogue is so  corny, it left me squirming a little. Also bothersome is the ham-fisted  way Shyamalan expounded his themes, which seem to be responsibility,  responsibility, and the horror of industry destroying nature (lifted  with little change from the Lord of the Rings). Seriously, the Fire  people sail their world's oceans in giant steel yachts that feature  gigantic smokestacks over visible flame. These stacks spew out a never  ending cloud of dark, ashy smoke. The metaphor could not be more clear  had it just been printed as a subtitle across the screen.  The acting is bad across the board. The child cast as Aan, the Avatar,  Noah Ringer, a wooden child actor if there ever was one. He speaks his  lines as if reciting them of a cue card just off screen. The two Water  tribe children, Katara (Nicola Peltz) and Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) are  no better. A colleague of mine I saw the film with noted that Rathbone  seemed downright anxious every time he was on screen, delivering his  lines tersely, with little emotion. The older actors just phone it in.  The usually reliable Cliff Curtis looks bored stiff as the leader of  the Fire people, while the main antagonist, a Fire general played by  Aasif Mandvi, is neither menacing nor scary. He comes off as a  schoolyard bully, all bluster and no balls. The only actor I found  brought any sort of depth to his role was Shaun Toub (Yinsen from Iron  Man). Playing Prince Zuko's Uncle Iroh, he's conflicted between his  duty to the prince and his beliefs in the spirit world, something the  Fire people have come to consider children's superstition.  Perhaps the most egregious error of the movie is the 3-D conversion.  3-D tends to suck all the light out of the images it portends to  display, leaving viewers with a murky picture where shadow and light  blend together. There are no crisp lines in the film, no real detail.  Which is a shame, as the film's setting should've been its biggest  strength. The movie travels from an arctic campsite, where the whites  should have popped against the bluish hues of the ice and water around  it. When it travels to warmer climates, the greens and browns should  have been awe-inspiring. It's not. It all looks faded. Much as with  Clash of the Titans, the 3-D is barely noticeable throughout the film,  and contributes nothing. I fear that Hollywood has cynically latched  onto this fad for the high ticket price it commands rather than for any  real artistic merit. My only relief was the movie was short, so I  didn't get the usual headache 3-D movies tend to give me.  I didn't expect much going into The Last Airbender. However, I didn't  expect it to be quite so bad. It's like watching a train wreck unfold  over 94 minutes. The problem is, that 94 minutes feels like an  eternity. The end of the film hints at a sequel. I hope some divine  being takes mercy on us all and never lets that happen.",The Last Airbender

376,Snespy04,"Directed, Written and Produced by M. Night Shyamalan. Enough said.",1,14 July 2010,"M. Night Shyamalan's adaptation WAS a highly anticipated major motion picture that appeared to be very promising. The film is based off Nickelodeon's notoriously successful animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender. The show that has charm, wit, heart, clever writing and likable characters created a perfect blend that not only kids could enjoy, but everybody of all ages. Despite the odd casting the movie presented my main focus was did the actors embody the lovable characters such as Aang, Sokka or Katara? Or what about the villains Zuko? Lord Ozai? General Zhao? Or even Uncle Iroh? The sad and unfortunate truth is, no. Although, I have to give the exception to Shaun Toub who portrayed Uncle Iroh. Along with bad characterizations is the incoherent narrative, poor acting, dialog, direction, race miscast, and cartoon like CGI.This film adapts Book 1: Water, the first entry within the Avatar series. Shyamalan essentially took certain plot points within this book and just plotted them in chronological order. The transition from point A to B to C and so on was for lack of a better word, off. It wasn't smooth, it didn't fit, it just happened. To make matters worse, embarking on an adventure with wooden characters didn't help much either. Noah Ringer who plays the character Aang comes off overly serious and has no range of emotion. It's almost as if he took his cue from ""Twilight's"" character, Bella. No variety of emotion whatsoever. Aang in the animated series is very upbeat, charming, full of life and just a joy to watch.Jackson Rathbone, who is most popular from the ""Twilight Saga"", plays the character Sokka, the brother to Katara. Sokka, in the animated series is a teenager who has the mentality that boys are superior than women. Also, he comes off as an ass but at the same time his heart is in the right place. After his and Katara's dad left for the war, he tries to be the ""man"" of the tribe. It's an honest and endearing attribute that he lets get to his head. Thus how I mean he comes off as an ass but the heart is in the right place. Lets be honest, what typical teenage boy hasn't had that kind of mentality? In the film, Sokka is filled with so much angst and anger. He too is overly serious.Nicola Peltz, plays the sister Katara. She is the only water bender left in the Southern Water Tribe. In the animated series, she is definitely a good role model for girls. She is opposed to Sokka's mentality towards girls, very optimistic and has a vulnerable side to her that is very endearing. I truly adored this character. In the film she came off as annoying. I didn't like her. Nothing about her is worth mentioning. Shyamalan completely excluded her as well as the other cast members having any kind of chemistry between each other. It was dull, flat, boring and mind numbing.Dev Patel is the obsessively, angry, exiled prince Zuko of the Fire Nation. He feels to regain his honor from his dad is to capture the Avatar. Along with Zuko is zen like and wise Uncle Iroh, who is wonderfully portrayed by Shaun Toub. These two characters I did feel that were relatively close to the animated series. Aside from their different racial stature, I felt they understood the gist of these characters. They were the light of the film that gave me a sigh of momentarily relief.The dialog, wow, I don't where to begin with this. Every ounce of dialog was exposition. Not only did the narrative cram too much information in the viewer, the dialog added insult to injury. This film just had so much exposition that it made unbearable. Shyamalan felt the need to put so much so the viewer can understand what was going on. Instead, the viewer will get lost in the amidst of comprehension. By the time the audience is done processing the information the movie is 3/4 of the way over. Now, we are at the big battle scene. Huh? What the hell just happened? Dammit. The dramatic pauses that took place during conversations became quite laughable. I guess Shyamalan thought with these overly long pauses that there was suspense. Uh, no.The CGI was provided by ILM. ILM is famous for producing the top CGI and animation in the business. However, their quality was rather sub-par. It wasn't the ILM I am use to. The year is 2010 and they produced shoddy CGI but yet they can crank out believable looking dinosaurs in Jurassic Park which was about 10 plus years ago? I guess the money didn't go to the visual effects department.The action was horribly constructed along with the framing. It was unexciting. The animated series was able to catch dramatic angles whereas the film was rather straight on allowing you to see the action, which is nice, but the framing was generic. It was nothing to boast about.This film is the complete antonym of the animated series. If you are like me, a person who has watched the whole series, it's a big middle finger to you. No heart or care went into this film and it shows.",The Last Airbender
377,TalkingContradiction,Without a doubt M. Night Shyamalan's worst movie to date,2,20 July 2010,"I'm not going to dwell upon the controversial casting choices or the way the movie diverges from the source material(Which I highly recommend), because quite frankly those are the least of this movies problems. Muddy, confused, and quite honestly boring fight scenes, laughably stilted and awkward dialogue, disjointed scene transitions, zero character development, a gross over use of narration almost, not a single aspect of this movie works. Much of that could easily be attributed to the fact that there's easily over 2 and a half hours of story here being truncated into less than 2 hours. Consequently there's no time to allow for either the plot or the characters develop organically, and therefore everything that occurs on screen is neither convincing or interesting.Its quite actually staggering how bad this movie is, if nothing else M. Night Shaymalan could at least successfully establish a palpable sense of mood and tone in all his past films even if it failed to ultimately payoff, but there's not one moment of awe, wonder or suspense to be found in this film, just the anguish of having to watch one sorely inept scene clumsily lurch into the next one and the relief that you won't have endure another one when the it finally ends.",The Last Airbender

382,brandon-jimenez-644-272895,Did Shyamalan even care?,1,4 November 2013,"I'm a big fan of the Avatar: The Last Airbender Series. I remember seeing the series as a Kid and was blown away by it. Long Story short, it's not only one of the best animated series of all time, but one of the greatest TV series of all time period. I don't know what Shyamalan had in mind with directing the movie. But I really don't think he even cared about the series to begin with. I think he only knew a little about it because of his kids but did not pay attention to or examine what mad the show so great to begin with. It feels like when he was given the job to direct the adaptation he was like: ""Oh God! I gotta direct a cartoon? Okay I'll do it. But I'm doing it my way."" It's obvious he did not really pay attention to what made the series so great to begin with and did not care to properly represent it and rather make it in his own vision. The movie feels so lazily done in almost every way. The acting is horrible, the action is slow and boring, the characters are nothing like they are in the show. Sokka in the show is the funny wise-cracker, but in the movie, he's the most stoic and serious gruff I've seen since Edward from Twilight. Katara barely has a role in the story, and Aang didn't even crack a smile ONCE, and he's the most fun loving and happy character. The dialogue is so terrible; it's all exposition with no emotion. The whole movie feels like Shyamalan just wanted to get it done as soon as possible. I bet he only saw a few episodes, wrote the screenplay in one draft, and did every shot in one take. There's so much exposition, its ridiculous. I think when Shyamalan was writing the screenplay, someone was on the side telling him what happened in the series, so he found somewhere to squeeze it in, mainly in the form of dialogue. The movie feels so rushed and so lazy. Like there's a scene with Earth-benders who are imprisoned in a POW Camp in a rocky ravine. Seriously? You didn't think about how this is a stupid idea, Shyamalan? And the action is so boring. Its obvious that neither the director nor the actors even knew about martial arts or how they were used in the show, so they filmed what looked like martial arts and added special effects around them. Shyamalan must have seen Avatar: The Last Airbender, but did not care about the series enough to really try and represent it, and decided to make it his way instead.",The Last Airbender
383,olympiantem,"""Airbender"" Is Just an Average Time Killer",6,7 July 2010,"The Last Airbender is an adaption of the hit nickelodeon TV show, I went in to the movie expecting nothing, just a good way to kill time. I came out correct.Although the mispronunciation seems to annoy a legion of fans, In the end it just comes down to how good the movie was, this movie was watchable so i can accept the mispronunciation.I'm a bit sad that I didn't see Suki, the kyoshi warrior and the ending was changed around a little, instead of aang turning into the koi monster instead they just had 3 waterbenders finish off Zhao, what happened? No money left for the effects.There should of been more explanation about the avatar's past life. Aang wasn't funny enough, Same goes for Sokkha, Yue was gave little screen time. So nobody felt sad when she sacrificed herself, basically what i'm trying to say its all abit rushed. but hey, so was Percy Jackson.The end scene could've been way more suspenseful rather than YES FATHER, so the dialogue wasn't perfect but i don't care.Its an adaption so nothing is meant to be perfect, Its a good way to kill time if you're bored. But don't expect anything other than a time killer, not an epic blockbuster. i think to many people went in expecting that, which explains the low ratings.overall: 6/10",The Last Airbender
384,twilightasm15,It Sucked!!!!!,1,1 July 2010,"OK. So last night I went to the midnight showing of The Last Airbender. Where do I begin.Spoiler Alert...well a lot of this review is a spoiler alert. So read on with caution. So the story was as I thought it would be for awhile and all was well with the storyline. But then I started to notice something odd. The pronunciations of their names were changed. Aang was now Ang, Sokka was now Sokea, and Iroh was changed to Eeroh. It's minor but to someone who was devoted to the shows, it kind of annoys them. So the story continued on like it should have with changes made. These subtle changes were fine though.I guess I should say SOILER ALERT again. The first Earth Kingdom city they went to was KyoshiIsland? Yea, as far as I knew, it was Kyoshi Village. At first you think it is the village where Haru lived but in this movie they are one in the same. O and ladies, don't get your hopes about the actor for Harunot many 10 year old boys are sexy.Well except for Justin Beiber. I'm probably boring the heck out of you. O wait, that's what this movie did. And to think I waited two years for it and spent 20 bucks to see it. I mean what were the writers doing for the past like few years. When they were supposed to be writing a storyline they probably went golfing or something. UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm sorry, I didn't really explain the failure of this film. I'll make this short, sweet and to the point. It Sucked!!!!! I think when the director went to write the storyline he took the original stories we all loved so dearly and burned it. Then he decided to make the worst movie ever made. (starts to cry) I've been waiting so long for this movie and that's what I get. He only used like 5 episodes from the series and eliminated all the drama, love, and comedy.There was practically no relationships built and most of the characters were dead. The only relationship there was was Yue and Sokka. They didn't really emphasize it at all. I have to admit, this film almost had me crying. Not for any good they did in the film. But for how my dream of seeing the greatest show on earth on the big screen and done right being crushed. When I went to bed I finally let the tears go. Though, out of all the terribleness of this film there was one good thing. The actor for Iroh was amazing. He was like born for that role. He actually acted and was the character of Iroh. To bad his fellow colleges sucked. Although the Zuko actor wasn't half bad. Well that's all I have to say. I think I going to go cry in a corner now.",The Last Airbender
385,blanknamedstuff,If Cliff's Notes made a movie...,4,9 July 2010,"I have to admit I'm a fan of the animated series. Book 1: Water (which is the story for the movie) is 20 episodes in length. The movie took app. 10 hours of information and condensed it into a 90 minute film. What we're left with is a discombobulation of scenes with no point of reference. It plays like a sanitized Tarantino flick. The travesty of the movie's storyline is that it could have focused on one major aspect of the Last Airbender world, or better yet been an original chapter. Instead it is a plot less, unintelligible, mish-mashed 3rd grader's plagiarism.There is no time for character development. The actors are doing their very best to convey emotion but, without understanding their motivation, it's impossible to feel involved in their plight.The one high point of the film is the visual effects. There are some amazing Bending scenes, Appa and Momo look great, and I'm quite pleased with the glowing avatar tattoos. But alas a movie cannot exist on eye candy alone.If you have never seen the series then the movie will be confusing (at best) and you won't be able to identify with the characters. If you have seen the series you'll probably demand your money back.",The Last Airbender
386,thethundersd,Audacious experiment,3,18 April 2011,"I saw almost all the movies of Mr. Night Shyamalan: The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs and The Village; and I have an idea about his other movies: The Happening and Lady in the Water. The Last Airbender is completely out of the usual style of its predecessors, Mr. Night use to give us a new perspective of known and unknown things, simple and complex, with an intelligent storyline, strong believable characters, and a message. None of those things is present in ""The Last Airbender"", it is completely shallow.Because I respect Mr. Night and his record, I did a little search about the work, and found first that the story is an adaptation of an animated series: ""Avatar: the last air bender"", which was a big success according to the ones whom watched it, they even say that the movie has completely destroyed the spirit of the series. Secondly I found that the movie was hated by the majority (specialists and audience) -so it is not just me-, and it received with the director respectively the worst picture and the worst director award of 2010 (which I think is exaggerated).From a talented and an intelligent writer and director like Mr. Night, this movie can not be a mistake, it must be deliberately and purposely done this way, I don't believe he is the one who puts to much effort and money in something he knew that it will be a disaster, I think it is a kind of an audacious experiment he is conducting on us, which we will see the results in the coming years.--http://theearthdiary.blogspot.com/",The Last Airbender

Is somebody forcing M Night Shyalaman to continue making movies in some sort of elaborate blackmail sting? The very idea of somebody who isn't un poco loco legitimately sanctioning another feature length car crash is ridiculous. Or should I say, somebody ELSE? Yes, M Night is yet another terrible writer/director with his own production company. As with many an ailing artist he has resorted to doing cover versions, and particularly badly. It may well be based on a popular franchise, but then again so were the last three Star Wars movies - and they were truly disappointing to anyone with life experience. I can confirm however, that M Night did not give his immediate family members the main roles in the movie, however I do understand the confusion. It seems that the 2 magic words and 1 magic acronym 'straight to DVD' have not been heard at Blinding Edge Pictures production company.

Another great show is destroyed by another horrible adaptation.",2,25 July 2015,"The only reason I didn't label this movie as 1/10 is because the actors doing Zuko and Iroh were OK. Aside from that, it's terrible! Most of the actors are either bland or bad, the effects are poorly done, and it felt like the child actors were in a school play. Hey, remember that one episode where the avatar group is watching a show starting their adventures but it pisses them off? Replace that play and put on the movie. Wouldn't that make more sense. And what makes it worse is 3 more problems. 1) there could be moments in the movie that can work, but they just explain and explain and explain exposition (thanks to the Nostalgia critic). 2) the characters are not the characters in the show. Sokka is more serious and Whiney instead of being fun and likable. Katara in this movie is really stupid and can't protect Aang no matter what she does. I mean, she asked him his name 20 minutes into the film! How are ya gonna protect him if you don't know his name??? It's a good thing that actress moved onto transformers 4--- oh wait! We all know bad THAT was! And 3) and most importantly: Is that earth-bending or is that the ""I'M A LITTLE TEAPOT"" DANCE????!!!?? That's not bending. Those are dance moves you make on the Kinect!

I think all of the actors did a great job on their performances (Except for Aasif Mandvi as Zhao. Watching him was just painful.) and did what they could with the script.The script is really my problem with this movie. It's written so poorly. Aang doesn't even introduce himself until they've reached the southern air temple. The lines are cheesy, awkward, unnecessary, and cringe-worthy. The other short-fall of this movie was the editing. It was choppy, and it FELT like they'd sloppily cut huge sections out of it. I'm sure people have already mentioned the bothersome change of pronunciation in the names.

400,jjeffrey,Don't believe the naysayers - it's a Fire Nation conspiracy!,9,20 August 2010,"The low ratings for this film are, frankly, mystifying.There are some very odd reviews of it, many seemingly 'politically' motivated as part of the 'You see! Shyamalan really was a one-trick pony' variety and many more obsessing about differences between the live action feature film in question and the animated source material: did they really expect it to be exactly the same? I took my ten year-old son to a nearby cinema to see the film in 3D this morning. We had watched the series together and both hoped for the best given the promising trailer but despite some of the adverse reviews. Bizarrely the nearest cinema was screening the film from 8.45p.m. at the earliest thus preventing many of the likely audience from seeing it. Anyway, on leaving the cinema he gave it a 9.5 rating: that was higher than his evaluation of Toy Story 3! He was entirely satisfied by the movie and is really looking forward to the films of Books 2 and 3 and, frankly, so am I.As an adaptation of an animated series, I cannot really think of many ways that this could have been improved upon - a four-hour running time is not an option. It was coherent, well paced and showed high production values. Think of some of the recent SFX-heavy entertainments (Transformers 2, G.I.Joe anyone?)that were so lacking in these areas. Certain changes were made to characters etc. but the essential core of the story remained and made sense! Performances were adequate (another area where some have been very critical)- OK the ensemble aren't the RSC at their best but there's no Jake Lloyd woodenness from the young lead and everyone else does a reasonable job and the SFX, as my son noted, were exceptional.As for Shyamalan - well I didn't go looking for any auteur trademarks and wouldn't have found many if I had. The direction did not slap me in the face and I would have been disappointed if it had: it is skillful but unobtrusive: just what it should be in a film like this.So - what IS wrong with it? Lots of motion blurring during sweeping camera pans were a bit distracting. This one might be better in 2D.

Chemistry has to be there between actors for the viewer to engage with and i became bored with the stilted performance of them especially from Noah Ringer (Aang)who seemed to be sleepwalking through this entire film.While the film does faithfully recreate key scenes and has visuals that are surprisingly good, i fear to much attention has gone into getting it right rather than getting it good.The dialogue is fine for the most part, the story moves along at a fair pace and covers most of the key points in the first book, so from this perspective it fulfils the mandate and I'm sure some of the younger viewers wont be as critical of some of the points I've mentioned.Great for the kiddies not so for fans who were expecting the same quality from the animated version",The Last Airbender

408,nephilistpost,The hate is disproportionate,7,16 August 2010,"My son introduced me to the cartoon of avatar a couple of years back and I watched every episode with him more than once. As a result of our both being fans of the series we read the reviews once the film was released in the US and waited for it's release here.The level of vehemence toward the film from the reviews didn't fill us with any confidence but we weren't going to be put off watching it; as we did last night. I am not at a loss as to why it was hated so much but I do think it is out of proportion unless you are expecting an experience akin to seeing Lord of the Rings for the first time or Matrix and just walk out disappointed.It is easy to see what went wrong; too much information packed far too tightly into the time, scenes cutting abruptly from one to another, acting that is stiff and not enough time spent developing individuals. I'm sure the haters could add to the list.However it is also easy to see what the director was trying to do in his efforts to stay true to the storyline. Creating an epic is like baking a cake.. sometimes you can have all the ingredients right but it can fall apart on the simplest of things like the timing and this is what happened here.. to a point.The positives: I walked in with low expectation and enjoyed it. It was true to the story. The fight scenes were not what you'd call disappointing. The musical score was excellent as was much of the scenery.

410,ElvenNights,The Latest Epic Trilogy,9,5 July 2010,"People who don't like this movie should just give it a rest. I've heard nothing but horrible things from the newspaper to reviews. I loved it and yes I have seen the show before. The characters look a lot like the cartoon versions and sound even more so. Noah Ringer was basically spot on from how the Avatar is portrayed on television. His acting was excellent as well. Some characters were more ethnic in appearance some less. Not an issue. The names also sound fine the way pronounced in the film. This is live action and not a campy cartoon. Get over it. I'm multicultural so this is coming from a neutral source. In the cartoon there's a lot of making fun of itself and the movie was a lot more serious. Take Uncle Iroh, in the series, he's a bumbling idiot, the film has him being an honorable warrior not to be trifled with. For one, the movie is about communal love. I commend this film. It shows people's true nature when someone tries to do something positive and the response is nothing but negativity. Hypocrisy. It's an adaptation of a cartoon, not the holy sacrament. What is wrong with you people. All I hear is that the names were pronounced differently. If that is all that you can think about when there are so many deeper issues such as peace, responsibility, unity, and fighting oppression than I feel sorry for you. This is one of those movies that is inspiring and uplifting. The CGIs were fantastic. Appa, Aang's flying bison was tremendously well done. Flawless effects. Loved the bending of elements and landscapes. The fighting scenes were also really well done. The stunt coordinator did a good job on the acrobatics and martial arts. Dug the slow motion effects. The character development was great for me too. Prince Zuko goes from being inept to dishing out major smackdowns, Aang transform from runaway to guardian of nations. Shyamalan also incorporated a ton of material for being less than two hours. Being that most kids are hyper active with ADD, me included, he probably didn't want to make it too drawn out to keep the audiences' attention. I could have gone for another hour personally. The chemistry is also there in this cast. Very similar interactions to the cartoon series. Too many movies have tons of talent but no chemistry, rendering the picture unwatchable. I liked just about everything about this film and can't wait to buy the DVD. I hope that it comes out in 3D like Coraline and not only in 2D like Cameron's Avatar. For those complaining about the casting, look at movies made overseas. There is virtually no diversity. Everyone is basically from that country. This film had tons of diversity and carried a strong friends not foes message. I can't wait until the next two. Finally a new entertaining epic adventure.",The Last Airbender
411,courantesiii-782-91305,Enjoyable like any other kids movie,7,26 November 2010,"I watched this movie with my nephew, and I just assumed it was going to be horrible...But to be honest I was pleasantly surprised...Well first I should say...I have never heard of this movie or the series until tonight....After reading a few negative reviews, it seems that it didn't really do any justice to the original cartoon series....Lucky for me I never saw it and had nothing to compare it to...It seems like the only people who can really enjoy this movie are those like me, who have never heard of it before and have nothing to compare it too...I went in to it totally expecting to be a simple kids movie and that is exactly what I got...I put it on the same level as Disney Cartoons or Pixar animations (i.e. A Toy Story, or The Incredibles).",The Last Airbender
412,strigliariko,Boring.......,2,18 July 2010,"Well i never write reviews for movies, but i feel obliged to talk about this one. Please if you are reading this save time from your life and your hard earned money and watch something else, or just do something else. I was never a big fan of Mr Shyamalan, indeed i believe he has a unique charisma of messing a movie up and making it as boring as it can be but i said, last airbender is an action film so how bad can it be? Well it can be unimaginably bad. I have no idea about the comic or the TV show so i was supposed not to be able to be extra disappointed. But everything is bad. Acting is bad, story plot is bad. It seems like the movie is rather a collage of bad acted scenes that they were taken from a big long story rather than a solid thing. Even the action is bad. I never found myself sympathizing with the heroes,i never found myself wondering what's next. It was just a flat boring movie. Please take my advice and don't go. Even the special effects aren't worth the time because i don't know how but at the end they seem boring too!",The Last Airbender
413,brendan-ralph,M Night,1,10 October 2010,"There can't be anything bad that I have to say that's not already said but I must continue to bash this movie like the other Avatar the Last Airbender Fans have done. I'd be lying if i said that I didn't have any hopes for this movie because it lead me on visually, and it looked great. but sadly, the rest did not satisfy me. The poor choice of casting is just the start of what made this movie so horrible. the characters compared to the TV show are complete opposites. Aang in the cartoon may be the last Airbender but they show us that he can be a kid at times, he has fun, unlike the live-action Emo-Aang, who mispronounces his name correctly. I could fill this review with how much i disliked the casting and comparing them to their original cartoon versions, but one major problem i had with this movie was that it had no comic relief. even Prince Zuko's Uncle and Sokka didn't provide the humor that this movie really needed. Luckily for me I didn't waste my time and money in the cinema and wasn't fooled on the '3d experience'. so if your a big fan of the show and don't want to be disappointed, don't follow any of our footsteps and avoid it with all costs. this could of been a turning point in M Night Shyamalan's career but he just disappointed all of us. So Please! get some one else to write and direct the rest of the trilogy!",The Last Airbender
414,nnguyen0297,A sad excuse for a film. But what did you expect from M. Night Shyamalan?,2,11 August 2012,"Let me clarify that I'm a huge fan of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"". So when I figured out that there was going to be a live action movie based on the show, I was super excited. So the day came and I went to the midnight premiere, and by god, I literally came out crying. It was that bad. I couldn't believe how disappointing the moviewas. I mean, how can you make such a bad movie based on such a great show? The plot is pretty much the same as the show, but in case you've never heard of the show, then I'll clarify it for you. Basically there's this Asian-like world were 4 nation full of people with the ability to bend elements(water,earth,fire,air) roam. Only the Avatar can master all 4 elements. When an Avatar dies, a new one is chosen. Well unfortunately, the fire nation attacked the other 3 nations, and the only that can stop them is the Avatar, but he vanished. 100 years later, a girl named Katara and her brother sokka discovered an iceberg with a young boy in it. They soon find out that this boy is the Avatar, and they go on a quest together to stop the Fire Nation. Sounds interesting right? Well it might have been a good movie if it was done well. But unfortunately, this film was directed by M. Night Shyamalan so...... It's not. The effects are pretty decent but that's all I can say. Everything in this movie is just awful! The acting is bad, the story is rushed, the dialogue is bogus, and I actually found it to be quite racist. In the original series, everyone was Asian. In the movie, only the earthbenders were Asian. The water benders were white, the fire benders were Indian, the main character was also white, and the air nomads were mixed. Are you telling me that white people can splash water, Asian people can hurl rocks, but Indian people can breathe fire?! Just because Dhalsim from Street Fighter can do it, all Indian people can?! The movie doesn't even stay true to the original series. They pronounced half of the character's names wrong. They could barely pronounce the word Avatar! On top of that, a lot of characters in the series was left out, the characters that are in the movie has no similarity to the character they're based on, but the biggest flaw of all is the bending. Everyone here is so weak! In the series the firebenders bend fire like crazy but in the movie they need a source of fire to bend. The eartbenders in the show can pretty much cause an earthquake but in the series it takes 6 guys to do some maniacal dance just to hurl one rock. There are more flaws in this film but it would take me forever to list them all. So I'm just gonna warn you to stay away from this movie and watch the show instead because the show is great and is much better than this movie. Overall rating 1/5.",The Last Airbender
415,ballerina_feet55,Screw up....,2,22 April 2012,"The Last Airbender is one of my favorite series. I am aware when they base movies off of TV series or a book series like this that the movie is generally choppy and disappointing. Right from the beginning I didn't feel like the characters were as good. Sokas funny sarcastic personality was lost. It felt like they did way too many movements for a little bit of bending. The things they say seem awkward. Zukos scar is barely noticeable. He is not angry or impulsive enough. Zukos uncle isn't old enough. And he tries to act like zukos uncle from the series but it's not very good. And agnee kee? angai kie kai or however you want to spell the correct sounding. The least they can do is say the words right! Mind you, the string of events makes very little sense. All the emotional obstacles the characters face are underplayed or nonexistent. The setting for where certain things happen are wrong. I mean, you are making this off a TV series. There is little left for you to imagine. The fact that they can screw it up this badly when given all the tools they need to make it great and to please everyone. That is just sad.",The Last Airbender
416,dolphin305,Why it's a bad movie,1,2 March 2014,"(May contain spoilers from Harry Potter and Xmen too) First of all, I'm a fan of the show, but I'm also a writer, so I'm looking at this from both point of views. Also, I couldn't get past the beginning of the movie for how bad it was. These are notes I made as I watched the movie:Why are tons of movements made for one bit of bending? Even the most complex bending doesn't take that many movements.""Even the fight scenes are boring, as the characters perform a little martial-arts —waterbending looks a lot like Yang-style tai chi — and only after they're done with their moves do the elements start flying around. This means that the opponent is usually just standing in the corner like a simpleton waiting for the hit to come."" (Nick Mamatas)Where are Katara's hair loopies? They got all her hair wrong. She's supposed to have a braided pony tail and two hair loopies, not two pigtails. The least they could do is the braided pony tail.Why is Aang immediately revealing how he got in the ice? Aang didn't want to become the Avatar and didn't want anyone to know he was the Avatar, so he kept it secret till later. The whole reason why he ran away from home was because he didn't want to be the Avatar. He doesn't even show any sign of being upset! It's as though he were thinking, ""I ran away from home and now I have to go back. No big deal."" People don't just run away from home, something has got to be bothering them, and yet Aang shows no sign of that.WHERE'S ZUKO'S SCAR?!! Just saw the scar a moment later, but it's hardly noticeable. The scar is a big thing, just as Harry Potter's is. Heck, it's exactly like Harry's! Harry's scar came from Voldemort when he tried to kill him. Zuko's scar was given to him from his father for disrespecting him. This happened before his banishment. Just as Harry is identified by his scar, Zuko is identified by his.Aang's tattoos are also barely noticeable. Same as Zuko and his scar, the tattoos are supposed to identify Aang.Is that Zhao?! The voice is all wrong! He's supposed to sound and look, like a real tough guy, but he looks and sounds like any other guy! His appearance doesn't support his character's position at all. In the show, he's a real bad guy, often seen chasing Aang and his friends. He's also a threat to Zuko.Zuko just saved Aang, but he looks weird. What's with the long hair? Just saw Aang airbending at the Northern water tribe. He has to do a ton of movements for just one bit of airbending! The bending should move along with the body. Imagine Jean Grey or Magneto having to do so many movements for one bit of levitation or metal bending.",The Last Airbender

418,biatch0,Should have asked Beckham about bending instead...,2,6 August 2010,"IMO M. Night Shyamalan has always been a hit/miss kind of guy... I figured after his string of (IMHO again) 4 misses, this should have been a hit based on the trailer (I keep telling myself to never trust trailers but never remember when the time comes). It all started falling apart as soon as I saw the opening credits and Nickelodeon.Acting was mediocre at best (0.5 points); many times during the movie I found myself with my face in my palm. A couple of times I actually considered leaving the cinema to go buy something to eat.Storywise I felt like a psychic (0.5 points); I had a feeling there was going to be a part 2 about an hour into the movie when the bald tattooed kid had only just started learning how to bend water. Plot twists (they were more like bends rather than twists) were about as easy to see through as cling wrap.Remaining 1 point comes from having a single reasonably cute girl playing the princess.Might have tricked me into watching this one but I'll be skipping the 2nd (and any subsequent) for sure.",The Last Airbender
419,blackwolf33914,Another failed attempt to make a hit show to a movie,2,19 February 2014,"For literary having a blueprint for this movie it was shockingly horrible, even the names were said wrong. The show that had so many fans around the world wanting more episodes and an action movie was ruined, what saddens me the most is that those that saw the movie first are probably turned off from the show now. Bad acting, with actors that didn't fit the ethnics of the show; fire benders were Chinese, water benders were Eskimos, with air benders as white monks but the actors in the film were all Indian. Not being prejudice or anything but they should of stuck with the show. I'm assuming that the movie writers wanted to show off the martial art skills or something since for a bender to create an element they practically had to do a whole karate sequence, overdone and it got tiring. Please, if your a fan of the Avatar: The Last Airbender then don't watch this movie, if your not a fan of Avatar the Last Airbender then still don't watch this film; two hours of my life that could of been more useful elsewhere.",The Last Airbender
420,diseriq,A terrible debasement of great source material,1,2 June 2011,"Just don't even bother unless yr gonna get high and drink copious amounts of red wine whilst mocking this terrible terrible movie. The original nickelodeon cartoon is great, just simply fantastic. I wish they had had programs as good as it is when I was a kid. But let's discuss this film adaption! M. Night Shymaballs has proved himself completely incompetent. Why was there no action in Unbreakable? Because he is completely incapable of directing action, as demonstrated in the Last Airbender. He should not be writing scripts either, terrible stuff in here. Casting was outright horrible. It's one thing that the cast was predominately white-washed, but that wouldn't have mattered if any of them could act. Airbender kid has this constant look of a little stunned rabbit, like, um what do you want me to do next. Only Dev Patel as Zuko is any good (or at least passable). He probably thought he was in a good movie, I'm sure he was astounded at the flatness of the line readings of the other actors upon seeing the finished picture. And why are all the character names mispronounced? It's like they were half way through shooting and someone said, oh Shymaballs, you messed up the names, and they were like, whatever.The film was probably a lot longer, probably 140 minutes, but they seem to have to cut it down to the minimum length necessary to be able to release this turd and still have it be semi-coherent. Even then, it drags and is too long. The editing is atrocious and nonsensical, as shots linger incoherently, and attempts at montages are outright lazy and sloppy. Really, the whole film seems like it was shot by a second unit director with no tangible film experience. Everything else, from the effects to blocking is just completely phoned in.In summary, the film plays as if z-grade studio The Asylum had produced and adapted the source material and made this film. Only without the Mega-shark and Giant Octopus. Shymaballs should be serving a lifetime sentence in director jail already.",The Last Airbender
421,torresarroba,*****PEOPLE are over reacting*** Is an OK Movie***,10,11 July 2010,"Since this movie came up I just heard only bad and bad and bad critics. I always knew that this movie was for children, but adults, like me, were excited it because the story. We all know that Shamalayan now have kids, adding to that the style his style is kind of dark. I know that we always want to see blood, and darkness and head and limbs flying everywhere, but again. We forget that after all, its a kid story. Did anyone see the logo of Nickelodeon at the beginning? I sure you do. This is not NARUTO. Is Avatar, a comedy/adventure for kids. You know what? I even dare to say that this movie compare side by side with the series is kind of dark.As soon as I saw all those bad critics, I went to the movie with the EXPECTATION of: ""MAN, this movie will Suck BIG TIME"". The first comment that came out from my mouth when the movie end was: "" PEOPLE OVERREACT IN THE CRITICS"".In my own opinion there was things that I didn't at all since way before the movie came up, like: 1) I didn't like Zuko's short Hair and his scar and even the cast they chose, but I give him a chance.2) The uncle is a good actor, but he was suppose to be fat or at least chubby in order to make you feel the sensation that he was wise, but I give him a chance.3) The Kioshy Warrior never came up, but I say maybe they will come later, in the next two movies cause the story is to long to fit it in a Big Screen Adaptation, so I give that a chance too.4) I hate the fact that they show the face of the Emperor so fast, when in the series he came like at the last book. Adding to that, he didn't have any facial hair, or long hair or like the throne of fire or that weird crown. I can't give a chance to that anymore.5) I love the cast they use to OONG hahaha sorry AANG, Katara and the other guy that i can't remember the name now (blue eyes guy), and people even say that momo and Appa were like weird, but they were OK.6) I hate the fact of the narration. It was better the guy from the trailers, but that Katara girl fail is grammar or what.Well I got tire of write and try to defend this movie cause at least they made it and it was NOT that bad. If you want to talk about bad adaptations, talk about Dragonball or BAtman and Robin or I dunno. you mentioned. But don't say that it was the worst thing ever. Look what happen with Pirates of the Caribbean. Part 1 was OK, part 2 was like WOW, awesome. But part three was like, whats the movie about? Is today and i still don't understand it.

(Answer: no, but I couldn't resist the temptation to write a review for this God-awful movie, and I never use the term ""God-awful"" lightly).This movie is an abomination that should never have been made. You know it, I know it, pretty much anyone you'll ask will know it.It has no respect for the source material, good writing, good effects, or really good film making in general.It's bending sucked majorly and none of the characters were treated correctly. They pronounced the main characters' names- the main characters of an incredibly popular TV series enjoyed by people of all ages everywhere- wrong. And Sokka....poor, poor Sokka. What did they do to you? T-T Sorry. Got a little emotional there.I'm literally just saying what everyone already knows, but it's kind of fun to rant about stuff like this, especially when the world agrees with you. Not that that makes me happy that this movie exists. Because this movie really shouldn't exist. Don't watch it. Don't buy it- unless you plan on buying it for the sole purpose of destroying it, in which case I suggest using all four elements to do so.

424,haroldcrane,On that other show you seam to be such a fan of,2,15 March 2017,"This is a disgrace to the memory of Avatar. This missed every aspect of the original show, the child actors where monotone and looked like they where receving no direction, the story moved slower than bosko with a stomach ach. The adult actors where not much better, the only slight exceptions where the portraials of Iroh and Zhao. Although still not good they where the best of the worst, i have seen better of the actor who played Zhao.The show has more exposition than story or emotion. Although this is meant to be an adaption but they should make sense. Like when Haru and his dad where imprisoned in the Show they where on a completely metal structure in the ocean with nothing to bend. In this ""adaption"" they are in what looks like a quarry which makes no sense since they are surrounded by the elements needed to fight back with no way of being beaten down as they where in the show.The most glaring problems with the show are with the firebending. Which in this version must be done with a source to be able to bend, which in the original was able to be made from internal heat and amplified by the sun, in this version Zhao is surprised that Iroh can do it with out a source.A failure in all respects.",The Last Airbender

427,stutsb,What can I say... (May have some spoilers),2,20 July 2010,"The Only reason I gave it a 2 is because young A-ang (hated the movie version's pronunciation) was a new kid who did the best he could and was actually adorable and looks the part. He could have been a lot more cheerful, but as this animated series fans know, Ang (pronounced ahng short ah sound) just awoke from what he thought was a short sleep, realized he has been away for 100 years, and lost the only family he knew. He is the last of his people, and is lost and alone for the first time in his young life (However, Ang is a cheerful person who tries to be happy at most, even at the worst times, so Young Noah, be a little more cheerful OK?) . The animated series is fun, loving, and anyone who watches it falls in love with all the characters. What M.Shymalan do is ruined this and placed a whole series of clips, omitted the important ones, and just placed it all in one big jumbled mess. I am sure it is hard to place I don't remember exactly how many chapters into 1 1/2 hours, but at least he could have had a decent writer, or writers put the story together right so that the movie would be somewhat comparable and not confusing. To put it short, anyone who doesn't know the series, would probably think the series was terrible, any one who knows the series, know this movie is no way comparable to the series...the movie is terrible...not the series. I hope they find a new director who knows the story, and understands it. Someone who can vision what the world of bending is and capture Ang and his journey the way it should be.

The music was pretty generic. The cgi, which could have been great, was too heavy and transparent. I wonder and slightly hope if this is going to be M. Night Shyamalan's last movie.

433,Mr_Beale,Competent Film That Could Have Been Better Given The Source Material,6,1 July 2010,"I was at a midnight screening last night. My overall assessment was that it was certainly not the crap-fest Shyamalan is capable of making, but it wasn't the epic masterpiece it could and should have been based on the source material. I should also predicate this review on a brief assessment of how I think other people in the theater reacted. When the credits rolled up, a lot of people applauded, but a lot of people booed. I saw it with a group of five (myself included); me being the only real fan of the show in that group. Most of them liked it, except one who hated it. Now, on to the review. Warning: there be spoilers: The Bad Truncated storyline: Obviously, they needed to cut things out. But they should have made a two and a half hour movie. Many important plot details are left in or worked in clumsily (in the final scene, Ozai states several plot points that should have been revealed earlier), and they don't spend long enough in any location to develop much of anything. Some things that are put in from the series are not worked in well, either (the ""we could be friends"" line does NOT come after the Blue Spirit segment (which ultimately makes that sequence seem pointless) and is presented as a throwaway line that doesn't have nearly the impact it should have). And despite the promotional images and clips, Suki and the Kyoshi warriors are NOT in this movie. Lack of character development: Only Zuko is truly realized from his TV series counterpart. Aang is reasonably developed but is conceived as pretty deadly serious, robbing him of much of the complexity he displayed in the series. Katara, Sokka, and especially Iroh are woefully underdeveloped. Action sequences: One character throws something at another, and then just stands there waiting for them to block it and return fire. The action goes MUCH to slowly. The already revealed clip of Aang taking out several soldiers in a row with water and ice bending is probably the best action sequences, which is probably why that's the one they revealed. Dialogue: While not consistently terrible, there are some moments that fall flat (most egregious is an over the top ""Yes!"" from Commander Zhao; whole theater laughed at that one. Expect that to become a meme), and Katara's narration often serves simply as a way to truncate the storyline even further. The dialogue is usually just as competent as it needs to be; nothing particularly stirring and not as quotable as the series. The Good Look of the film: They were definitely loyal to the series in terms of the look: if you take many individual frames of the movie, it really looks like it came right out of the series. It's beautiful to look at, though there are only a handful of sequences where the 3D adds anything. Musical score: The music has been out for a while and most have already heard it, but it really is beautiful to listen to and helps make some sequences at least somewhat interesting that otherwise might not have been. Acting: I still say racebenders can suck it. While the actors aren't given the time they deserved to develop their characters and won't win Oscars for their work, they nevertheless do a fine job with what they have, Patel and Ringer in particular. The one exception is Mandvi, who just isn't able to be as menacing as Zhao should be. Basic story: The basic storyline of the original series remains intact despite the truncating, and it remains an interesting story. If you're not familiar with the series, you can still enjoy the world the movie creates and the journey that the characters take. Bending effects: While the action sequences as a whole are often somewhat dull, the effects of the bending really do look good and stay faithful to the series. Well, those are my thoughts in a nutshell. Enjoy! And see the movie and make up your own minds.",The Last Airbender
434,sjmutchie,"Only fans will like, but then again...",5,1 July 2010,"To start this off, I am a fan of the series. Not a HUGE fan, but a fan nonetheless. When the trailer first came out, I was already skeptical and frustrated. I knew that it would be hard to make a movie out of a series. I walked into the theater with a few expectations. Only one was met.Let's start with the plot: The entire plot is scattered, and the dialogue is no better. Unless you're a fan, you will have absolutely NO idea what is going on. The scriptwriter tries to throw in significant events, (such as Yue's sacrifice) but they come across as time-fillers to the audience members who haven't seen the show. The only reason I saw the significance of lines, scenes, and locations was because I was familiar with the series. Most of the actors were very flat, but not to the point of dull. Aang, (pronounced Ahng in the movie, ARGH!) Plays a boy that has been in hibernation for a century. When he wakes up, I was expecting him to be a little disoriented like he is in the series. Turns out, he's bubbly, and childish. Don't get me wrong, Aang is supposed to be those things, but the way the actor delivers the lines makes Aang seem like an idiot. Katara and Sokka tell him many times what is going on, and he seems to keep brushing it off.Katara and Sokka were a little better than Aang. Katara did a good job of making Katara seem annoying, yet not overbearing. Her lines were a little rushed, but they match the actress who voices Katara in the series. Sokka does a good job of being jumpy and fidgety. He didn't offer nearly as much comedic relief as he is supposed to, but he does have a few funny moments. A few of my acquaintances say that Sokka doesn't consider himself to be funny, he just does things, and makes everyone think he's funny. I only partially agree with this statement. I was waiting for Sokka to complain about being hungry. Unfortunately, he never did. :( Zuko: now there's disappointment. The Slumdog Millionaire kid? Seriously?! Bad choice. The Fire Nation was made up of Mediterranean looking actors, giving them a distinct look. Zuko's scar was BARELY NOTICEABLE. If I didn't know any better, I'd think that it was just a skin problem. His acting is bitter and harsh, but without reason or motivation. There's no pain behind his voice when he talks about his past. Especially when the little boy answers his question about Zuko's banishment. Show some emotion, would ya? And the Fire Nation commander? Don't even get me started on how harmless he was...One of the only expectations I had was concerning Zuko's sister, Azula. I was waiting for the trademark voice, and demonic facial expressions. This expectation was dashed. The actress has a high pitched voice that makes her seem not threatening. Not looking forward to Book Two: Earth.The rest of the cast was fine, Iroh, Katara's grandmother, the Fire Lord, Yue, etc.Hardly any 3D at all; not worth paying four extra dollars for a few effects that aren't that interesting anyways...There was one little scene that I was very impressed with. Even though the character Yue was only introduced a few minutes before she was sacrificed, she made a good enough impression that it made you sad when she gave herself to the moon. Sokka's reaction is genuine, and also heart-wrenching.All-in-all, you will only like this movie (if you can get past its bad points) if you have seen the series and understand what's going on, but then again, you will hate this movie if you've seen the series. The opposite goes for the unenlightened audience. If you've never seen the series, you'll be lost completely.5/10 because of the special effects and compensating acting from Sokka, Yue, and the adults.",The Last Airbender

This movie could have been just OK if there was never a cartoon series that I am a very huge fan of, but this movie does no justice what so ever to the animated series. Basically just take the previews and add a bunch of nonsense time wasting in between and thats the movie! The entire movie was dry, boring, and had a lot of gaps. If they added an hour to the story to include key points from the animated series and more character development, then this film could have been saved.I was expecting to see an opening sequence with Roku battling a volcano and fire lord sozin leaving him to die, then it go into some detailed story telling about the start of the war or something to that nature!!! Where in the world was Koh the face stealer? He was a very awesome and pivotal character toward the end of book 1...In the military, we are taught attention to detail! this movie had absolutely none of that...What a shame for a potentially huge opportunity!!!",The Last Airbender

437,teeleigh417,The first time I legitimately felt I wasted my money.,2,1 July 2010,"I love the Avatar series. It is absolutely on of my favorite shows ever. It has wonderful characters, intense story development, and it kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat the whole time.The Last Airbender took all that and made me want to quote the great song by Queen, ""SO YOU THINK YOU CAN STONE ME AND SPIT IN MY EYE?!"" M. Night Shyamalan, this is a disgrace. Everything you did with this movie was dreadful. I won't go too much into everything that made this film an abomination of the series and film-making altogether, but there are a few key points that really frustrated me and what seems like most other fans.CHARACTERS: Where did they go? Why didn't they appear in the movie?! Where's Aang, the fun-loving kid who strives to embrace his destiny? Where's Sokka, the humorous complainer who actually has a purpose in the story? Where's Katara, the confident and motherly girl who becomes a Waterbending master and teaches Aang? That's just the start of character-raping. I suppose the only character to come even close to the original intent was Zuko, though he still not the same banished prince that became my favorite character (not to mention the lack of menacing hair-do and BLATANTLY DEFORMING SCAR?). Oh, and let's not forget the pointlessness of Appa and Momo in this movie. Character rating: two out of five sad faces and three angry faces. :(:( >:(>:(>:(STORYLINE: Why do I get the feeling that the only contact the director and writers had with the actual story was someone loosely summing it up? I'll admit that it is incredibly hard to squeeze 10-hours worth of story into a single movie, but M. Night, you're doing it wrong. I can forgive not having Jeong Jeong, Koh, or Bato; but Suki, the Kyoshi warriors, Jet, Bumi, and the Order of the White Lotus all are very important to the plot. Perhaps I can even forgive not having those, but it feels like they glossed over a lot of stuff that would have made the movie make a lot more sense, especially to those who haven't seen it. From a cinematic and stylistic perspective, the movie was too rushed and left no room for character development, except perhaps a little for Aang at the very end. Another point I would like to make is that the entire movie told and didn't show. The narration was irksome most of the time and made the movie seem like it was just some guy sitting down and telling a story with a few pretty pictures to go with it. That makes me disappointed most of all because it's a movie. THE WHOLE POINT IS TO VISUALLY SHOW A STORY. And then they've gone and thrown it all away. Storyline: four out of five sad faces and one angry face. :(:(:(:( >:(DETAILS: Some might say that hatin' on the movie's pronunciation of names is too picky. But picture this: imagine going to a Harry Potter movie and the actors pronounce Hermione's name ""Hermy-own-nay"" or Harry as ""Hah-ree."" That's what it's like for a fan of Avatar to hear names in this movie and relate it to nails on a blackboard. I can understand wanting to make the pronunciations more true to Eastern phonetics, but AGNI KEE?NO.No matter how you may mispronounce Sokka or Aang, THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN MESS UP ANGI KAI AND NOT FEEL FANRAEG. Seriously, Agni Kee? Do you WANT us to face-palm?As for another detail that no one but my OCD self may have noticed, the map of the world seemed entirely wrong. I mean, it's not that big of deal and maybe it was at a weird angle. But if the case is that they changed it, why?! What point is there? WHY DO YOU RUIN ALL MY DREAMS OF HAPPINESS, SHYAMALAN? Details: one out of five sad faces and four angry faces. :( >:(>:(>:(>:(ACTING: There are no words for this. I am disappoint. Acting: five out of five sad faces. :(:(:(:(:(On a final note, please don't see Avatar. While it makes me sad to see a movie based on such a great series be a flop, it will only save you pain by avoiding it. See Toy Story 3, because that movie is wonderful. And I never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever thought I would say this, but I even enjoyed Twilight: Eclipse better than this. At least you can laugh at Eclipse because it's ridiculous and actually TRIES to have humorous moments. But The Last Airbender just made me sad. Sad, disappointed, and quite resentful about wasting my money. Please don't see this movie. :(",The Last Airbender
438,khororus,This was a terrible movie...,1,9 July 2010,"I don't want to sound funny, but anybody who has seen entire cartoon series would probably agree that it is a very fascinating story with some deep insight. In the cartoon each of the characters are developed and everything has a sense. After only 20 minutes into the movie the only feeling I had was anger. Just imagine these Caucasian kids in the middle of the arctic village! And their grandmother a lady from London?! What they turned poor Appa into? The animal was scary and ugly, and had no character whatsoever. Iroh, the actor is the only bright spot of the movie, but he has lost all the funniness of the old guy from cartoon. I was so angry to have to wear those stupid shades for now good use. What were the 3D effects?! Somebody should apologize for this crap. I hope they will put some money and find new director for next parts...",The Last Airbender

No movie absolutely perfect, but if this is a bad movie, I don't think that people don't know what a bad movie is. I loved the sets, the costumes, the creatures, loved the performance of the lead actor, and the rest of the acting wasn't bad either.

440,roemorg,"Good, but not good enough",5,28 July 2010,"I just saw the last airbender, and I must say this film doesn't live up to the hype its getting. There are 8 reasons why I didn't like this movie.1) The pronunciations made me want to gag. Ang? Ear-o? Soak-a? I wanted to soak M night in gasoline for changing the original names.2) They left out some important characters. For example: Suki and the kyoshi warriors,Jet and the freedom fighters, king boomi, the people who live at the northern air temple, and other people who I cant remember at the moment.3) Where the heck is Zukos ponytail! And his scar is really unnoticeable.4) The special effects were iffy. At times it felt I was watching the first clash of the titans special effects.5) In the show, I don't remember it taking 4 hours just to bend an element. All of those fancy moves that lasted who knows how long really bored me.6) During the whole movie I felt that I really didn't really know the characters. In the northern water tribe, I wouldn't have minded if they got hit by fireballs and died. I didn't care about what happened to them.7) In the show, even in the first season, you could tell that aang had a crush on katara. But in the movie, it was like they barely liked each other. That kind of made me mad.8) The movie was too rushed. M night could've added like another hour. I think fans would sit through a 2 and a half hour movie, just to see more of the series.Overall an inaccurate portrayal of a powerful show. But I have to say I would go to see the second airbender movie. Im mildly curious to see how much more of this series M night can ruin.",The Last Airbender
441,mr-hulseycedeno,Shyamalan took a great thing and made it into a disappointment,3,9 July 2010,"Ill begin with some good aspects of the movie. I enjoyed some of the visuals and the recreations of certain places and people, and while watching this it made me reflect on how simply amazing the anime show was. I appreciate that Nickelodeon studios finally signed on to make a remake into a sequel. As you know they also funded ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" and ""The Spiderwick chronicles"" both incredible opportunities for movie magic.These movies came out quite decent to what they could've been butchered into,but i don't believe that they were created to their full potential.When I heard of a ""Last Airbender"" movie,i immediately thought of nickelodeons past movies and had a feeling of some hope since this remake was actually a Nickelodeon product.As far as the hit-or-miss Director,M.Night Shyalaman, i simply figured he would give it a cooler more eerie presence which, in turn, would create a more realistic and modern feeling.As Soon as the movie began i began telling myself ""well...thats odd,why would they do that?"". I felt since this movie was already set up for sequels, that they would take their time and not try and zoom through the whole story, and boy was i wrong! As soon as Katara and Sokka find Ang, he is taken away by Zuko, which leads me into my next point, no character relationships. During the Anime you felt a strong connection between all characters which, as you all know,this makes believable character.Since this movie always seemed to be in the fast lane,the creators denied you any scenes in which the characters became closer.As far as the acting goes...well lets just say that there will be no Oscar nominations in that category, but i think an actor is as good as their script,which was made very half-ass and filled with unnecessary and,frankly,annoying dialogue. I think if they added extra 20 minutes of film and they could've added plenty of scenes which could've tied the movie into a somewhat of a okay film, but then again could you last another 20minutes watching it? In conclusion i believe Shyamalan takes great opportunities and creates pieces of work that are practically unwatchable. Now if you excuse me... i'm going to go watch the Anime ""Last Airbender""",The Last Airbender
442,fantasyfilmsman,Torn in Two.,7,30 June 2010,"Let me just say I'm not the big Avatar fan like my son and daughter are but I am aware of the show and have seen some episodes so when I sat down for the screening I really didn't have any expectations. So I am coming at this movie not as a raging fan but a fan of film and there are elements of the film that I really liked and others that I did not. First the bad. The child actor who played Aang was really not that good, but also the script for him was also not very good. Stilted dialog will do that and it really is a shame because the bending parts and martial art scenes the kid is quite good. The other two kid actors are really not given much to do, the girl is so-so and her brother looked like he could have done something with the role but for the most part was relegated to the back. Also there are some continuity gaps in the film that kinda make you go huh? Plus and this is a good-bad thing the movie only runs about 90min and I truly would have liked to see the movie run a little longer. There are some great scenes with the Firebender banished prince and his uncle and a scene with Saka and the princess about her blonde hair that makes you look at the screen and go yes, but then there are parts where the film is rushed to get to the action. And now the good. I'm glad to say the action in the movie is really well done. The SFX are very good and very organic so they don't stand out at you and go look FX. Also the action isn't all cut up MTV style. M.Night chose to film some of the action in long full shot takes and I truly enjoyed those elements. As for fans of the show I think it will be a mixed bag. I think the movie should have used Asian actors and dealt with the relationships more but on the whole if I could I'd really give this movie a 6.5. It's one of those movies that could have been really good, but just misses the mark. Plus save your money and if you see it see it in 2D. The 3D adds nothing.",The Last Airbender
443,davesam1312-780-608821,The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen!,1,1 July 2010,"I don't even know where to begin with writing this review. Lets start with some background. I have never personally seen any of the 'Last Airbender' TV show but I have heard many people say it is extremely good.Knowing the movie was directed, written, and produced by M. Night Shamalayan I knew the movie was going to be mediocre at best.Now to the movie...What a worthless piece of trash! I couldn't even imagine that it would've been this bad. The acting was stiffer than cardboard but (as Roger Ebert says) that's insulting a useful packing material. I suppose the bad acting partially goes to the ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE writing by M. Night Shamaylan. Many of the lines seemed out of order and made no sense in the scene they were in. Also, the main character, Aang, actually screws up one of his lines when he was supposed to say something else. Many characters also repeat the same line with different words right after they say it as if to add more ""dramatic"" effect.The filming was bad also. There were many awkward, cheesy close-ups of character's faces. Also, at one point, when the camera is moving through the woods you can see a leafy branch crumple as the camera hits it.The story itself sucked and was entirely disappointing especially when it came to the climax which ended up being an utter failure. * SPOILER ALERT* - Remember when you see that giant wave about to crash over all the Fire Nation's ships in the TV commercials. Well guess what. All that happens is that Aang holds the wave threateningly over the ships and then slowly lets it back down. The Fire Nation decides that this was too freaky for them and so they simply just turn their ships around and head on back. I mean...WHAT THE HECK!!!!!! Around the last half hour or so of the movie they decide to throw in a romance between two characters that has absolutely no development and ends with them kissing as one of them willingly dies to save (wait for it)Moon Spirits. And we are supposed to be feeling that this is a sad, dramatic part of the film. Nope! The visuals themselves were extremely cheesy looking. The water bending looked more like transparent tentacles flying around and the glowing fish didn't even look like fish.The only reason I even give this film 1 out of 10 is because there was one, semi-good bit of acting and that was from Dev Patel (super great actor from Slumdog Millionaire). With all the wooden, terrible lines he has to deal with, he manages to make the most of them. I applaud him from that.But I don't think you would pay $12 bucks just to watch one person do a semi-decent job acting. If you want to spend money on this, be prepared to feel completely used. Absolutely terrible acting, terrible dialogue, terrible stories, terrible visuals, and a terrible climax all add up to the worst movie of the decade: The Last Airbender.",The Last Airbender
444,son-jeff-nguyen,A complete disaster of a movie.,1,3 July 2010,"I don't get why some people give the movie a bad review, yet still rate it at 4 or 5. Even movies like Grown Ups, where things are not supposed to be genuinely intelligent, the audience enjoyed a good laugh.There are nothing to get from The Last Airbender. The entire cast is a disaster save maybe Zuko. The acting are horrible. Really, did you audit them from high school or the mall? They managed, for almost two hours, let the audience to one disappointment level to the next. The make-up is comparable to that from a third-world country movie. Whatever happened to the Hollywood-level makeup? One word to describe the cast: LAME.I'm not a die hard fans. In fact, I've never read/watched The Last Airbender on books/TV. But this is just too much. At the end, the plot is left open for a follow-up. But clearly, no thanks. The Firelord and his Commander looks like some cab drivers from Middle East. The Firelord's daughter acts like she's just got a free ticket to go clubbing. Really? I didn't just paid 30 bucks to see this..",The Last Airbender

Eventually, the excitement just went away. Three quarters in, to my surprise, my 8 years old turned to me and I quoted, ""Dad? This movie sucks! That little boy supposed to be powerful..."" I said, ""Yeah, I know."" Honestly I have been waiting for the credit since the first 15 minutes. I looked to my right, my 6 years old had actually fallen into sleep. I almost laugh out loud in the theatre. When I was a kid, I almost like any movie. I guest whether the kids had gotten smarter or this movie is just so bad like my 8 years old stated. I had no comment on the acting because there was none. The writing is so bad if this movie is indeed written for kids and not Hollywood morons. The directing is just shameful from an Oscar nominated director. Stay awake if you are being dragged into this mess by your kids. Better yet, stay away.

I don't understand how Shyamalan manages to convince the producers to invest $150 mil !!! in his films even after making so many horrible films. I think Shyamalan should start taking directorial lessons from great directors like ""James Cameron"" and ""Christopher Nolan"".This movie has flashy effects but it couldn't manage to entertain people.Overall i would not recommend this movie. so please stay away from this : rating --- 1/10",The Last Airbender

It was an interesting experience watching real people doing what was only done before in cartoons. I am well aware that two more movies are going to be made after this. Here is a few thing that I hope will be included in the next films.3D: The the 3D was not the greatest. It was only noticeable if I was really looking for it.Acting: The acting was not the best ever and could use some improvement. Although I love Shyamalan's dark thriller look in all of the rest of his stories, I don't think this was quite the place for it. In the cartoon, Aang was this carefree child that could and would laugh at anything funny. Same with sokka. When Toph is brought into the story, she better not be a dull person like the rest.Special effects: The special effects were amazing. Every type of bending looked like it was really happening.Music: No movie that I have seen has had better music that this movie. James Newton Howard needs to continue doing what he is doing for the next two movies.In the end, The last airbender was a great experience in which was very enjoyable.

448,Vr_Lux,This could have been Epic...,5,17 April 2012,"Okay...My opinion is that M Night S. is not the right guy for this kinda movie,regardless of whether or not this project came from his heart. Actually this movie could have been epic,if been handled by the right hands. Don't get me wrong, i have no hate for this movie, neither for the director...I'm even a fan of him, truly, and i was always waiting for each of his last movies with high expectations, but this film was like spikes on the road! The story is tremendous, so are the characters, but on the screen there was unfortunately no spirit, no soul..! The acting is bad, so is the casting for some characters, like Dev Patel (Prince Zuko), who is clearly not THE guy for this role. the CGIs are average (not to say cheap), despite such a budget. The screenplay is lacking sometimes, and the intensity that some moments should acquire never comes as it should, letting the involved viewer frustrated and disappointed...the fighting scenes are poorly choreographed, there is nothing impressive, nothing new...the score is okay, the volume levels well mastered thru the whole movie. If all these details would have been better handled by another director, this movie would certainly not have received that much bad ratings and critics, i'll bet on that! Anyway, being a pretty creative person, i don't have that much hate for this movie, but compassion, and every time when the director missed the point i just created it myself in my mind, i tried to remain open mind, to involve myself in the action, to put some dimension into the story, so that at the end this looked okay to me...but its not normal to have to do this, if the movie was good enough this would not have been necessary.",The Last Airbender
449,edkwong317,Waste of my life,1,6 April 2012,"I came into this movie with very low expectations and somehow, Shyamalan was still able to disappoint me. I don't see how he can make this film, sit back at the editing table and say to himself 'yes this is a good movie'. It is freaking mind blowing.First, there are the names. M. Night knows he is mispronouncing them because he wants to stay 'true to the Asian influence'. Well guess what. The way they pronounce it in the cartoon is already true to Asian influence. Doesn't take a genius to see that most of the influence was from Chinese culture and for an Indian guy to say this is how you pronounce something in Chinese is ridiculous. I can kind of see the difference in Aang's name being pronounce ""ang vs ong"" but what about Sokka? They pronounce it 'SOAK-ah'. What the hell is that? General Iroh went from ""EYE-row"" to ""Ear-roh"". Why?Second, he has changed the nature of bending. Fire benders don't need a ""source"" and can conjure fire from their own Chi. The portrayal of bending is also done poorly. Every time someone tries to bend, they have to do 2-3 lavish moves before anything even happens. It's almost like they're conjuring something up. Bending is supposed to be an extension, not voodoo magic. For example, the scene where the imprisoned earth benders fight back, six earth benders practically do a dance for 5 seconds to get a small rock to move. Speaking of the same scene, fire benders ""imprison"" earth benders next to a MOUNTAIN and on LAND. That's like putting an armory inside the prison cells.Third, a TV show primarily set in Asian culture is littered with white people. No offense to white people, but WTF? Shyalamalan could've used this movie to break in some great Asian actors but instead goes the typical Hollywood route.",The Last Airbender
450,scholmes0,Disappointing,1,7 February 2014,"Hey everybody, this is my second review. I'm just going to politely say what everybody else has ranted and raved about. I was an enormous fan of the TV series, which in my opinion was close to perfect, and yet they brought out a movie like this. It saddens me to see people go so wrong in every aspect of the movie. The acting was stiff, and frankly the director was well off course, for every aspect was disappointing. I'm sure they all tried their hardest, but frankly this is not an enjoyable movie. I heartily recommend anybody who has read this to watch the TV series, which was an incredible source of entertainment for me, for quite a long time. The series is honestly one of my favourites, but this movie is not worth seeing. If you have seen the series and are deciding whether or not to watch the movie, please don't. The movie will almost certainly take some of the magic away from the Avatar: the Last Airbender series that many people have enjoyed for such a long time. It is a shame that such a good run had to be spoiled by this movie, but i suppose you have to look on the bright side. Look at what we had with the series, and be content with that.

So it is a fault about the people really into it, must of us ain't no kids, but that was the supposed target.I gave it 10 stars just to rank it a little because good darn it...works with that awful final and at the same time feels less shoehorned than that...and this movie really goes all the way shoehorned.",The Last Airbender
452,matthewmensing,A Curious Rarity,1,20 September 2021,"At the time that I am writing this, this movie is well over 10 years old. I saw it opening weekend, meaning I've had over a decade to think about this. And I can confidently say that this is one of those rare cases in cinematic history where this movie is complete, 150% garbage. Usually with a bad movie there's something the filmmaker gets right, no matter how small, or at the very least the film is such a train wreck that you can get ironic enjoyment out of it, as is the case with most Shyamalan films past the year 2002, but not this one. This film is boring lifeless, devoid of character or wit or charm, which is even more of an insult considering how perfectly the original showrunners mastered those elements of their story. It's as if he read a Wikipedia summary of the first season and wrote a screenplay that made that summary less comprehensive. I'd say the actors are bad but I don't know if they are because Shyamalan is a master at getting horrible performances out of good actors, so it's anyone's guess who's to blame. Actually, it's not. It's the former Academy Award nominee that was once declared 'The Next Spielberg'. Yeah, that aged well. This film is an insult. It's an insult to the fans of the original show, of which I have been one for almost 20 years now, it's an insult to all the people who worked on this following the direction of an aimless director who clearly had no idea what he was doing with a big-budget movie, and it's an insult to the art of filmmaking. This is objectively one of the top 10 worst movies ever made, it's Shyamalans worst film which is saying a lot considering he has The Happening and Old in his filmography, and it is my personal least favorite movie of all time, and it makes me sad that this comes from a filmmaker that once showed such promise, talent, creativity and passion. If you want a better use for your time, watch Samurai Cop or The Room.",The Last Airbender

The world building was the best part for me , I wanted to see more of this world and explore more the benders.

457,jadakiss602,"Excellent story, very bad execution.",4,2 July 2010,"I am probably the most fairest person on IMDb. As a film-maker my self I know that it is extremely difficult to make a movie, let alone a good one. I also am first to claim that M. Night is a excellent director and that he has a very well paced style. With that said, The Last Airbender, was a complete disaster. The good things about are: The cinematography on some shots is very strange and abstract but very beautiful. M. Night employs some very smooth camera moves and the overall movie polish is clean and slick. Some Action scenes where cool and the CGI overall looks OK. Nothing too fancy but some bending of the elements does look cool, especially water and earth. The cuts are excellent and M. Nights editor really knows how to make the best of a bad movie.Now for the bad part. The cuts have to be excellent because they cut from scene to scene extremely fast. Imagine the whole cartoon season played on fast forward, thats how fast it was made. Almost as if M. Night shot the whole cartoon scene by scene and did not want to leave anything out. The acting! The acting was just horrible. It is probably the cheesiest, most badly-acted movie I have seen in a long time. Sokka is not funny, he is a wanna be macho guy. Aang is not fun and bubbly, instead he is serious and unlikable. Katara is not that motherly character, Zuko is not that cool complex guy, he is just mad all the time. Uncle Iroh, like Sokka was comedic relief and also a likable Yoda type of character; Well not in this movie; he is a skinny old man who seems cold and distant. The martial art stuff was really bad, in fact, most of the stuff is just close up of fire nation soldiers looking scared. IDK why many things where in slow motion but it got annoying. It had a lot of cheesy camera zooms which where completely unnecessary. In conclusion this movie is not bad because I disagree on some things or I didn't like something and Im a troll.. No, this movie is bad because it is fundamentally not well made. M Night should know better than that. How dare he make a movie this structurally unsound? The most basic of things like character development, pace, timing, rhythm, attention to detail... nothing! Its not even like of well I didn't like this part, not there was no part to dislike, in fact I think there is a lot of missing scenes, its almost as if we watched a 6 hour movie chopped down to 2 hours and the missing scenes are blatantly obvious. It really is a bad movie in every sense of the word.Should you watch it? If you like the Last Airbender than go ahead, if you are a hardcore fan then no, because it will ruin Avatar for you. Some movies are so bad you just have to see them to understand, and there for I recommend this as a rental, but you will feel disappointed if you bought theater tickets, and even worse if you paid extra for 3D. Because the 3D was really bad on this also. Trust me, as soon as the first 10 seconds rolled by and I herd the first words come out of Katara's mouth, I though to to self, oh lord no... oh God no, this is going to be a horrid movie, I could not believe how bad the acting was on it from the beginning.",The Last Airbender
458,Peeb_Alex,Worse than I remember,1,30 May 2020,I remember watching this movie back when it first came out and I didn't think it was that bad. I just finished watching the cartoon series on Netflix and I figured I would re-watch this to wrap it all up. Now I wish I hadn't watched it. It's NOTHING like the show. I wonder if the people who worked on this movie even saw the show. Stay away from this movie. It's so bad that it actually hurts to watch it.,The Last Airbender
459,galaxychick,Not the greatest adaptation - But not THAT bad either,7,10 July 2010,"Don't be swayed by critics – Just see it for yourselfThis is a principle I have adopted a long time ago with movies critics. Especially since people with negative comments are more likely to come online to voice them, to be more vocal, vociferous, and tenacious than those with positive stances. I am big fan of the Avatar-TLA TV series. At first, I didn't want to be spoiled by this movie's critics. Then I broke down and read them. I was rendered speechless by the all-around rabid tone. I know ""band-wagon critics"" are common online phenomena but I was still awed by this. Ironically (and having disagreed with critics enough times before) the rants made me even more determined to see the movie for myself. So I went to see it knowing that with any screen adaptation changes (i.e. elision, interpolation, omission, etc.) will be made. But in the end, if the main essence of the story remains then the adaption is successful. And I think TLA was successful in that extent. I think that it DOES capture the essence of book 1 saga. And a particularly good work was done with cool effects and a nice physical reproduction of the universe created in the cartoon. Even though biased by the more complex TV series, I was still entertained by the movie.I DO agree though with the critic that it was quite a rushed plot. This hurt characters' interactions and development. I can see how someone who did not see the cartoon might have difficulties to connect to the characters and plot as they could. Narration was used to explain parts of the story, but narration cannot compensate for certain things. And especially it cannot make us care more for the characters and their predicaments nor build on their relationship. In all for me, while it was certainly not the greatest of adaptations, it was definitely not the ""craptacular"" piece of work people are clamoring it to be. I found it enjoyable albeit its imperfections. I give it a C+/B-. If you don't want to pay to see it in the theater, fine. Wait for it on DVD, or online, or on network TV. But don't let the bandwagon of critics choose for you whether or not you should see it.",The Last Airbender

The computer generated stuff was good though but i got less than what i expected. What a waste of time and money. I'd rather had stayed home and watched the original cartoon instead.The original cartoon is ten times better to watch. Even if i consider this movie as a unit in it itself, its missing a lot of story where a new viewer wouldn't be able to connect the points. Although it has good computer generated animation and stuff but you still get less than you'd expect. There are bits where you expect it to be funny and it ain't, no fun. Anybody who has watched the original cartoon will tell you how much of it they have skipped in the beginning of the movie.

461,Obiwindukin,All ShowBiz and No heart,1,3 July 2010,"As fan of the series I was extremely excited when I heard they were making an Avatar movie.I am writing this review with great sadness. My heart feels as if though it as been ripped out. The original series was so popular because of its heart, its soul, and the connections we formed with the characters. The Last Airbender loses all this heart and soul. The audience is never given a chance to connect with the characters because we never get to explore them.Even putting aside terrible casting, miss-pronunciation of names, and uncomfortable close ups, Shyamalan simply misses the point. He doesn't tell us a story, he simply cuts and pastes epic moments and expects that the audience will be dazzled enough to dismiss wooden acting and choppy dialogue.There were not enough moments of comic relief and all the redeeming qualities of these characters was stripped away.If you loved the series there is no need to watch this catastrophe of a movie. If you are new to the Avatar, you are better off watching the original series.1 out of 10...this was just plain awful.©2010 All Rights Reserved.",The Last Airbender

I thought the 3D was amazing, the acting was very good, and the plot absorbing—enough so that I went back and saw it a second time as did my wife who is very hard to get to watch anything twice, and I bought the blue-ray DVD.Also note that all the pluses in this movie were accomplished while maintaining a PG rating, clean enough for my sister and niece who will not watch anything but G and PG movies.

465,appubhai007,Truly amazing if you haven't seen the animated series,7,3 April 2011,"I must tell you that I haven't read any of the ""airbender"" books or seen the cartoon series so I didn't really know what to expect out of this one. But boy-o-boy this was super awesome in that sense.I read few reviews before watching this one and they were mostly negative just because everyone compared it to the cartoon series which I am assuming was super awesome. But then, if a film is being adapted from a series you cant just expect every detail to be there. So in that sense it was good enough. But yeah, being a fan of some nice vfx stuff this was super fantastic.What it lacked was some nice actors, script and maybe few dialogues. Except for Dev Patel, who has done a fantastic job all other actors seem to be just reading the lines off the script without any punch. The love chemistry between Sokka and Yue (who by the way looks gorgeous in the movie :D ) doesn't really seem like chemistry. And even though I haven't seen any of the cartoon series but I could still make out that they were kinda rushing the movie. If Shyamalan was really spending so much why not make it a little longer and kinda establish everything.But anyways the awesome visual elements make up for most of it. In fact that was the only thing that kept me glued to the screen. Really brilliant action and nicely choreographed and done.No matter what, when it ended, and the fire lord appointed his daughter to capture Avatar, i really wanted to see it go on with Avatar learning to control the other natural elements. But i guess with all those negative reviews, there isn't going to be a second part, at least not anytime soon as they don't yet have any plans at all.So i guess, the acting was the only part where the movie couldn't score and little bit on the script but overall a really fantastic piece, at least for those who haven't seen the cartoon series.",The Last Airbender

470,judyoz,Works for me,8,22 July 2010,"Boy, are there some angst-ridden negative comments about this film!! I was quite surprised at the low overall rating given to The Last Airbender, so I read some of the worst, and best, comments before seeing a preview earlier this week.Having now seen the film I veer very much towards the positive end of the spectrum. While not being a huge devotee of the original cartoons, I did watch a number of them and found them inventive, entertaining and really interesting. But just as with The Lord of the Rings films, which can never fit in all the detail of the books and will change some elements for the sake of cinematic issues (or brevity), choices have had to be made for The Last Airbender ... and some choices are bound to cheese off the cartoon fans mightily.But this review is for the rest of us, for whom there is the real possibility of going to see this film and departing perfectly happy. The story was engaging, entertaining and (unlike a number of others who have commented) I didn't find it hard to follow at all. Even enjoyed the whiz-bang martial arts and CGI effects, etc - although I have to say that the 3D element really doesn't add much at all. That IS a waste of time, put in place entirely because it's the latest craze.That said, I'll be doing a birthday party at the local cinema for my 12yo daughter and a group of her friends as soon as the film comes out. I'm confident they'll all have a whale of a time. :-)",The Last Airbender

472,amitnagpal1985,it's become fashionable to criticize this movie,6,9 July 2010,"I went to see the Last Airbender but i came out wondering if maybe i should buy one of those livestrong arm bands to support cancer patients. Weird i know, but the lead actor looked like a recovering cancer patient throughout the movie.Anyways, So i am from India and M. Night whats-his-name (if u think we can pronounce his name right then think again) is a success story. Born in India, made it in America by directing a movie without any songs and dancing on the streets (shock & awe) So everyone who speaks English and likes Hollywood flicks almost always goes out to watch M.Night Whats- his-name's movies in my country.Once we were proud to say he was born in our country but after watching The last Airbender i'm sure most of us will probably say he's from Sri- Lanka. I read many reviews which totally grilled this movie and someone who i am following on twitter even compared it to terrorism (??). After reading so many unanimous and sometimes very creative criticisms i really wanted to check this movie out for myself.So i went to see it with very very low expectations (By low expectations i mean i actually carried my ipad with me in case i wanted to play NFS if something like ""Lady in the water"" happens to me again)But surprisingly i was mildly entertained, sure the acting, directing, screenplay are all mediocre but its not as bad as people are making it out to be. I think its become fashionable to criticize this movie and thats fine by me, i don't recommend u see it unless u have time to kill (or if u like to see cool things happening with air and water with CGI effects)i understand people who follow the series on TV hate it but for someone like me who knew absolutely nothing about it beforehand, found it to be a popcorn, leave-your-brain-at-home kind of flick.",The Last Airbender

474,tolliver11,A Movie Worth Seeing,8,13 July 2010,"I almost didn't see this movie because the reviews were so awful, both from the public as well as the ""professional"" reviewers. I am glad I followed my instinct and my own judgment opposed to following the opinions of others who appear to be influenced by special effects, gratuitous violence and story lines that are completely influenced by western thought.I loved this movie. I loved the concept of the original Nickelodeon Cartoon, Avatar – The Last Airbender and I loved the movie's direction under M. Night Shyamalan. Mr. Shyamalan is a story teller that puts the story on the screen, not just with words but also through visuals. You have a world that is naturally balanced with the four classical elements reflected by Earth, Air, Water and Fire. You have a people that have evolved to become one with the Classical Elements that define their society. The Air people live in the mountains and have a natural symbiotic relationship with the wind, Earth People within the midlands, Water people along the coasts near seas, rivers, and the Fire people in dry, hot climates. Each people are one with their environment and together there is a balance within their world. There would be a natural rivalry between people of different cultures and beliefs but the rivalries historically had been minimized with the evolution of an Avatar – an embodiment in human form of all the Classical Elements. Each generation an avatar was born cycling through the four people in order to maintain balance. During the generation that the Air People were to host the spirit of the avatar, a child is identified as the reincarnation of the avatar but runs away from his responsibilities prior to his complete development. With a void in the balance of nature one nation of people, the Fire People, take advantage and begin their conquest of the world. They go unchecked for at least a century until such time as the avatar is revitalized.There are concepts within the movie that many movies do not directly deal with, such as consequences of not acknowledging responsibilities, the inability to cope with anger and grief, the fact that vengeance is not a solution to a problem and mercy can be a stronger weapon than sheer force and destruction.I thought the movie was refreshing and stayed true to the concept of the original series on Nickelodeon. The acting was OK, (I really liked Shaun Toub who played Prince Zuko's Uncle Iroh – the voice of this character was played by Mako in the cartoon) the scenery was breath taking, the story line was up lifting and calming. The young actor who plays Aang will grow into his acting role, but more important his movements and grace are beautifully captured on the screen. I look forward to Book 2. I am just so very sorry that our American culture didn't understand the story line and were unable to evaluate it on its own merits. It really doesn't take much of a leap to parallel modern cultures and their quest for power and glory and how those actions brings unbalance to the entire planet.",The Last Airbender

And like many others I was excited that it was being made by M. whatever his name is. I personally liked all of his movies (except lady in the water). I in my profession got to watch this movie a few days in advance. Airbender started out amazing. The intro to the film was a direct live action version of the cartoon (the red background with the 4 different benders each doing a style of bending). It looked so cool and I was excited to see the rest. Unfortunately the movie did not deliver anything I was hoping for. This movie LOOKs great and that's all. M. Night.... made everything in the movie look EXACTLY like it did in the TV show which looked great, and the special effects were amazing too. The one problem was that he took the 10 hours of season 1 of Avatar the Last Airbender and crammed it into 2 hours cutting out 90% of the substance. Watching this film I had exactly 0% sense of time. 1 second it was 1 day and the next it was somehow 7 weeks later. The acting was bad, the actors had little to no emotion. And the ending was awful. For anyone who has seen any of the TV show I urge you not to watch this abomination of a film that butchers a truly great show. I only wish I could get back my 2 hours and beat the crap out of M. Night Shamylamdhakfjld whatever for destroying Airbender.On one side note.....

478,KartofflMuter,I had great expectations and I'm totally angry at M Night AGAIN.,1,26 January 2013,"Look- I'm not a fan of this director. Lady in the Water was rather good. Some others weren't too dreadful. He inserts himself frequently into his own pictures-cameos. Whether it's an homage to Hitchcock or just a sense of undeserved pride,who cares? It's embarrassing. Boo. Hiss. I read the controversy about ethnic origin. I agreed.In this day and age,there is no excuse not to use the cast of the right ethnic type. It's OK to substitute a Korean martial artist for a Chinese one or a Japanese one (etc) especially for the little boy,but a Caucasian-no. My son was in martial arts for 10 years. There are many Karate and TKD and other studios all over the country with children who can act. I really thing film,even for children,should require some acting skills by the cast before they are hired. You can't just hire Jeff because your daughter has a crush on him,for example. I was really looking forward to Dev Patel's next vehicle after Slumdog Millionaire but clearly ,giving him a cape with a hood and a burn scar and telling him to ""act wounded,angry,unloved,and monosyllabic"" was not useful. Patel is a mature actor and M Night made no use of him. Next to the little white kids parading around in costume, shorty trying to find something besides air and confessing he's a coward (why did I keep thinking of Kung-Fu Panda?) the absolute whipped cream and cherry on top of this sundae was Assif Mandvi.Laugh or cry? Could you decide? I really couldn't. The dialog was so horrible. (Yes- everything IS the director's fault) But the minute Mandvi speaks,with that distinctive voice, you know it's him. Alright-fine. If he could act. But he can't He can only read lines. So whenever he speaks,you expect the punchline. Where's Jon Stewart? Is a Republican in the wings with a large cigar and a poster of Mao? Can it be any more sadly hilarious? He can't play a villain. But he's trying,I suppose,for a really nasty Asian used car salesman.Directors in the good old days have re-shot half the film when they found the voice wasn't right,or a character died,or a test audience didn't respond well. I guess these days,you just puff out your chest and say,""screw the audience. I'm M Night Whats'it's.""",The Last Airbender

They literally stripped the whole book one of the original and paste it together squeezing it to an hour and forty three. Well i could've forgiven them but see, they included unimportant dialogues and scenes that are not pertinent to the development of the story. They didn't even get the names right. It literally looked like m. night didn't even try to watch the whole Avatar Animated Series. He didn't even tried asking about what it really is and what's going on! And don't get me starting with the supporting characters. Appa is ignored, momo is ignored, hell all of the important supporting characters are ignored(except for aang). You can surmise that even if they all die at the end (including sokka and katara), nothing would ever matter. Because character development IS NOT in Shyamalan's vocabulary. Even Aang(the hero) lacks his character build-up he needed. In his defense, Shyamalan did try. He just tried! No actual substance can be found on this disgraceful movie. It's not even a movie, it feels more of a video clip. A video clip with very expensive cgis and sets. And if there's moral to this movie, well... one can only guess what it is.There are many inconsistencies to the characters and to the logical organization of the thought it wants to convey(like m.night is high on burning rubber or something). The acting is horrible. The dialogue is freakin' repulsive. It's as though every scene is very awkward and we feel a spine tingling sensation whenever they talk to each other leaving us to think of walking out of the theater –but was always hindered by the mere thoughts of hope for them to redeem themselves in the end which kinda sucks because they didn't.If you are a fan, you might get the gist on what they're saying because you already knew what's happening. You're just waiting for it to happen. But if you are not then you'll just scratch you head and pray to whatever your God is to rewind time when you can chose some kick-ass films like INCEPTION to watch instead of buying the lame tickets that you're grinding in your palms.This movie is so wrong.

481,jasonisu4,Does not capture the same drama that the series did.,4,2 July 2010,I just finished watching The Last Airbender and I have to say I was honestly very disappointed. I was so excited to see the movie but I now regret the fact I paid for a movie ticket. First all of the bending looks so much more difficult than it does in the cartoon. It takes every bender of every element about 10-15 seconds for them to start controlling their elements. In the series every bender could almost instantly control an element. Another thing is that they seem to under-use all of the bending. There are several scenes in which you remember similar scenes from the series and think that you are about to see an epic bending battle but instead the scene consists of fist fights. There are some great bending scenes but the director did not seem to use them as much as they could have. The biggest problem I have with the movie though is that it does not even come close to capturing the same drama and the emotion that the cartoon did. Those who have seen the cartoon will know what I mean when I say that the cartoon is so much more dramatic and the characters show much more emotion in the animated series. None of the actors from the movie capture the same drama and emotion as the characters did in the series. The fight scenes also seem to lack that same drama that the series had. One more thing that I was disappointed by was that in the series the creators of the show always showed Aang's flying bison Appa as one of the main characters and not just a flying vehicle. In the movie he is exactly that: a flying vehicle. Overall I have to say I was very disappointed with the movie. It does not at all capture the same emotion and drama that the series did. I know they will probably make a 2nd and 3rd movie but I will not be wasting my money on tickets for either of those. There are some who are fans of the show that may like the movie but chances are if you were a big fan of the show you will not like the movie.,The Last Airbender
482,Intricase,The Airbender. Unfortunately,4,9 February 2011,"Yes, I am giving it a 4. Why? Well let us explore the areas of entertainment. This story, like so many great and wonderful tales of adventure, is one that is so complex and unique that it takes a dynamic approach to character development. What we see in this movie is Mr. Shamlan's pockets grow bigger as his production grows narrower. I have never been a fan of his work. He is to the Movie industry what a 3 years old finger painter is to art. This movie had the absolute potential to become one great series of movies and instead of embracing the empire that would follow such a wonderful plot, it absolutely failed in the most key aspect of the Avatar series. The reason that we grow fond of the anime version of this masterpiece of a story is due in part to character development through out the series. Mr. Shamalan obviously rushed through the series and did not pick up on this. I have died inside tonight as he has ripped apart a beautiful story and pieced it together like a broken vase never to be restored to its perfect original form. This was never meant to be a 1.5 hour movie for the entire book of Water. It needed to be a trilogy just to tell the story and to identify with each actor which, by the way, played their parts beautifully.Mr. Shamalan if I could give you one bit of advice in an ocean of people looking over your shoulder and pointing out your flaws, it would be this: Embrace others originality and bring the qualities that you hold true to your genre of entertainment, to tell a story takes more than just plot twists and suspense. I am afraid you will never really know how it is for us to be saddened by the mistake you have made with this franchise. I only hope that Nickelodeon will see this and know that they have hurt something that is respected within the membership of the Nickelodeon brand and that they will learn that a well known director isn't going to be the best choice to pawn off a large budget.",The Last Airbender
483,eyetwitch0,Fail.,2,1 July 2010,"No word better summarizes M.Night Shaymalan's (i don't even care if i misspelled his name) The Last Airbender than: Fail.There is ONE redeeming quality to this movie. James Newton Howard.Other than that I shall list everything I can think of that makes this movie so miserable.1) The people casted as the characters from the show (I would call it acting if there was any in this movie...) Dev Patel and Shaun Toub were the only actors in this movie. Aang, Katara, Sokka, Zhao, and all the various extras and smaller parts were awful. It's as if M.Night forgot to ask the 'actors' to actually try out to get the parts. As if he saw them all on the side of the street and thought ""hmmm he looks like Sokka! I'll get him!"" 2) To the ""actors"" credit, very few people could have made due with that script. The dialog was absolutely horrendous. I can't begin to communicate how bad it was. The show thrived off the cheesy/kiddy dialog, and so it's dialog could be pretty bad sometimes...but this dialog actually managed to fail in doing that justice. ""Who are you?"" ""I am Katara the last water bender in the souther water tribe"" ... 3) The Camera-work (again, i'd call it cinematography, but that would be insulting to those that claim that profession) was miserable. From the wobbly tracking shots to the uber-close-ups. The audience in the theater began laughing at a couple of the close-ups... 4)Plot. 8 hours of season 1 crammed into 102 minutes. The things that M.Night changed in the plot to make it fit into a movie, were ALL wrong. ALL wrong. It was rushed, certain scenes unworthy of spending time on were emphasized, scenes crucial to plot development in the show were left out, entire episodes were mashed into one terribly written piece of dialog, character development may as well have not existed, Sokka and Ihro weren't funny, and quite frankly if you hadn't seen the show there is no way you'd have known what was happening.DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE IN THEATERS, DO NOT BUY THE DVD, DO NOT SUPPORT M.NIGHT'S GARBAGE AT ALL. If you must watch it, wait until you can see it for free. It is not worth the 102 minutes it takes up, let alone 11$ at the theaters.",The Last Airbender
484,ajharper18,There is not one good thing about this movie. And that's coming from an Avatar fan,1,3 July 2010,"OK, for starters, I thought this movie was gonna be pretty cool when I saw the teaser trailer. But then when I saw the official trailers, I had my doubts. Then when I saw the movie, it just shattered me into pieces. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, in that movie looked like the show. The only thing in the movie that was like the show was that they had to go the Northern Water Tribe to find Aang a water bending master. Other than that, everything was just made up. OK here are the reasons why the movie was not like the show: - In the beginning, Sokka and Katara were walking on ice when they found Aang. In the show, they were hunting for fish in a canoe in water.Their names weren't even pronounced correctly, and I don't even know why. That's just retarded changing their names. I mean the Aang's name sounded like ""Ong"", instead of ""Ang"". Also Sokka's name was also pronounced incorrectly. The ""O"" was long (like in soap) instead of short (like in rock). Oh and I do remember Iroh's name was also pronounced incorrectly, but I do not remember how. But those changes just bugged me.Most of the time, Aang was wearing a dark red hood. WTF, in the show he never wore a hood. That was just plain stupid to add to the movie.OK, the fire lord, was shown almost in the entire movie. OMG, he was never, EVER, shown in the season 1 of the show. I don't know why they would have him in the movie. That was just retarded .And finally, the most irritating thing in the movie, the fire benders can ONLY fire bend if there is fire near then. That is the most retarded thing I have ever heard. ONLY when there is fire near then, I mean WTF. In the show, they can make fire out of their finger tips, that was very pore writing. Only Iroh made fire, and everyone was shocked because I guess it's not common for a fire bender to make their own fire. That just ruined the entire show.Also, the supporting actors' skin color was completely different than in the show. I mean they could of found actors with at least similar skin color to their character from the show. I don't know why M. Night would even make that movie, because the show has too many important scenes that it would be too long to have in a movie. I mean he should know that the variety of the people who are going to watch this will be fans of the show. And I'm sure many of them are very disappointed. I think whoever does like this has not seen the show. But if they have and are a fan of it, and they do like the movie. I don't know what is wrong with them.The Last Airbender, Worst movie of the summer.",The Last Airbender
485,j-delcolle,A different perspective,2,1 July 2010,"Many reviews I've seen come from fans of the TV show, so if you've never seen it, you might be able to relate better to this.After hearing what a masterpiece the show is, I decided I should check out the movie. That, and as an upcoming film buff, I needed to see a few Shyamalan flicks. This was NOT the one to start with.Aside from the constant mispronunciations of names and words (Awng, instead of Aang, Awvatar instead of Avatar), the characters were incredibly bland and uninteresting. Instead of having set personalities, they just said whatever would be convenient for the plot. And there was, I kid you not, a single character who I think did a decent job portraying what was obviously supposed to be portrayed (Shaun Toub as Ioh, if you care.)The plot itself had potential, but felt like it was trying to squeeze to much into one spot. I know they were trying to cram an entire TV season into one movie, but they definitely should have left a lot more out. And apparently, the show is supposed to have a strong comedic element. Any joke in this movie was painful to hear.But the two worst parts for me would definitely have to be the constant plot-holes (I can always forgive one or two, but these were constant), and the special effects (Appa looked alright at times, but it wouldn't surprise me if this beast took up 90% of the budget.)I could honestly spend hours of your life complaining about this movie, but there's a one thousand word limit. If someone's forcing you too see every movie released this year, and only allowing you to skip one, let it be this. And if you're wondering, I give it it's second star solely based on the effect of Appa, the performance of Shaun Toub, a single almost decent action sequence, the good part of which lasts only a few seconds.",The Last Airbender

Our review of the movie was the same: Terrible! The plot didn't make much sense. There was too much going on, and not enough character development. Additionally, the script was horrendous. Too many pauses. Also, the narration of the story only told us what was going on in the scene and on the whole unnecessary. The acting was sub-par. The graphics weren't very good (especially the 3D rendering)...you could tell there was a green screen during most of it.All in all, most of my friends who didn't see the cartoon, thought the movie was garbage.Now to compare it to the cartoon. Right after watching the movie, I started watching the cartoon again to see if maybe my memory of it was jaded. No...the cartoon was epic. The characters had depth, the visuals were great, the dialogue/script was carefully/amazingly written, and the accompanying music was well matched with the series.The movie was the complete opposite of the cartoon and I would recommend you watch the later. Even if you only watch the first 2 and last 2/3 episodes (of the first season), you will be able to see the massive difference.",The Last Airbender

I'm a fan of the cartoon and I did not have any high expectations, but I didn't think it was gonna be this bad! The story was a mess, the acting could and should have been much better, there was no emotions, no depth, the fights were disappointing and Momo could as well have been completely left out, he had no function at all! They've made something so beautiful seem so unserious and meaningless. They had good effects and the cool look, but they didn't have the story nor the right acting. This could have been so much greater if the story had been better!! I've read that many are mad about the pronunciation of the names, which I don't really understand. Of course I watched the two first seasons in danish where they pronounce the names kind of like in the movie, and apparently it's also the way it would be pronounced somewhere in Asia, but I only think it gives the movie a little sprinkle of exoticness. The few positive things to say about this movie was the northern water tribe. It was beautiful! I was always a little disappointed of the cartoon northern water tribe,'cause that was just a lot of walls, but here you could see houses and it was magnificent! And I give my credits to James Newton Howard, music was great. But I'm gonna stick to the cartoon, that is for sure!

489,reylagarto28,One big misunderstood adventure flick!!!,6,8 July 2011,"For starters, you need to forget Shyamalan's the director of the film, or else you'll critique every single thing you see on screen, honestly.I've seen very few chapters of the TV series, so I wasn't expecting to see the exact same translated into a film. Also by the awful reviews the film had received I wasn't even expecting to see a god film and... oh boy, I couldn't be any more wrong.What you get in this is a complete harmless family adventure flick, nothing more, nothing less. Well produced, decently written and with fine special effects. Yes the 3D effects kinda suck, but that's to be expected having in mind the fact that the film was not shot in 3D. The characters fulfill their job and the story is told consistently with few bad steps. ILM completely shows off with the special effects, giving one of the best things you'll see in the year. Everything is in place and the film completely takes you for an exciting ride, humble and with no other intention than entertain.All in all, a good adventure flick (though not perfect at all) great to see with the kids or even to have a good time by yourself. I really hope the give us a sequel since it can really kick it as a fine franchise (hope those 319 millions in the worldwide box office are good enough).",The Last Airbender

The pronunciation of the names sucked too; the character's looks in general, Aang has solid blue arrows tattoos not that gay design, Zuko's white not brown, Socka and Katara are almost Hawaiian colored not white, Uncle Iroh was fat, short and gray haired not tall, built, and black headed.",The Last Airbender
491,Rettaskynhvergi,"I hate this so bad, I forgot to review until four years later",2,25 September 2014,"As a big fan of the original series (well, who is not a big fan of the original series, anyway?) I did expect something good. I used to have a habit of not watching trailers before going to the movies, well, it was not a good habit, so I tried to grow out of it, but I still do sometimes.Back then, I never watched trailers that did not make to the telly and I only assumed the movies by their titles. I wanted to watch this film as soon as it was released in my country with a friend, but my friend declined and offered something else because she did not like movies with sequels. I agreed and I ended up watching the DVD a few months later. Well, everything was not that bad until the fire-benders showed up. I mean, the young actors were left confused with so little knowledge of what they were supposed to do, but somehow I could tolerate.Dev Patel as Zuko was a huge disappointment for me. Zuko is my favourite character in the original series, and Dev Patel ruined everything. The special effects were awesome, no doubt, the martial arts were perfect, but I hate the fire bending technique in the picture. I glared at the screen and then I turned it off. It blew off everything. I could not watch it anymore and I never made it to the end.So, bad acting, good effects, good music, bad script, infidelity to its original story and portrayals, it should be one star, but I gave two because the martial arts were so great and kudos to those who did the 3D special effects.What a shame. I am glad I never paid to watch the film (I watched a borrowed DVD, ha!)I quoted my favourite summarized critique for the film, which is Charlie Jane Anders', ""Actually, my exact words when I walked out of this film were, 'Wow, this makes Dragonball Evolution look like a masterpiece.'""",The Last Airbender

493,Styrophoamicus,For Shame...,1,5 July 2010,"It's been a long time since I've actually walked out of a movie theatre disappointed. And not just ""oh, that sorta sucked"" disappointed, but full blown ""I cannot believe the atrocity I have witnessed"" disappointed. I believe said atrocity lies more in the tragically lost potential of this film than in the film itself. This is something that those who have never seen the animated show will not understand; to them, this is just a boring mess of a movie that jumps from one incomprehensible plot point to the next without any rhyme or reason. But to a fan who has watched the show multiple times and was completely blindsided by just how complex it was, this is an outright damn tragedy.I remained cautiously optimistic about the film when it was in development. I tossed a big 'meh' to the accusations of racism (though, having seen the film, I would almost agree that they were somewhat justified). I looked over the first pics of everyone in costume with an almost obsessive interest; in spite of practically everyone being white, I felt they matched the looks of their characters quite well (particularly Jackson Rathbone as Sokka). I had shivers the first time I saw the theatrical trailer, both on the internet and in the theatre. Having seen the show, I felt that this was basically poised to be Star Wars for the next generation. I knew changes would be made, things would be cut out; I just didn't expect it to be everything that mattered.To be fair, I've honestly enjoyed all of Shyamalan's films (except The Happening). Especially with his earlier works, he takes rather simple plots and weaves complex characters around the narrative and usually ties it off with a twist. Here he does the exact opposite. The characters are tossed around a rushed and incomprehensible plot without any chance to develop or even catch our interest. The animated show balanced plot and character development so that we not only cared about the journey of Aang and his friends, but also about the characters themselves. For a director who spends most of his movies crafting engaging characters, there is practically no character whatsoever in this movie. Everyone delivers their lines as though they were reading them off the page. The personalities of every character is so radically different from their animated counterparts (especially Sokka and Kitara) that they seem more like cosplayers than anything.For a film based on an animated series, The Last Airbender is quite joyless. While the fight for survival and the weight of one's destiny was one of the many central themes of the show, it balanced out with moments of genuine humour and heart. Instead, Shyamalan opted to make this a dark film about war and fighting for survival with little to no humour whatsoever. There's barely any smiles to be had in the film, both from the characters and the audience. Whereas the series made me laugh out loud on several occasions (prompting me to rewind the scene and play it again and laugh just as much) any attempts of humour in this film fell flat and barely invoked a smirk on my face.In making an adaptation of a 24 episode series into a feature length film, it is the director's job of choosing what can stay and what has to go. There are a couple moments, brief fleeting moments, in the film where I feel like Shyamalan got it right. The opening is literally a direct adaptation (minus the narration) of the ""Fire, Water, Earth, Air"" opening in the series, where benders from each nation demonstrate in front of a red backdrop. Aang's flashbacks, particularly the one where he is learning to meditate, really felt like an extension of the ones in the show. The bending was well done, and for the most part each nation retains its unique fighting style. However, a few moments in a 100 minute show just doesn't cut it. The problem is that Shyamalan tried to cram too much into to short a time. The film could have worked as a 2- and-a-half hour long adventure film (akin to Pirates of the Caribbean) and would then have had more time to let its characters develop, lay down more of the plot, and even toss in a few one-off references to the series (cabbages, anyone?). I almost feel like there's a decent (read 'watchable') 2 - 2.5 hour version of the movie on the cutting room floor, but some factor made Shyamalan decide to cut it down to 100 minutes and just barely scrape the surface of its plot and characters. But I don't even know if an extended cut would be able to redeem this cavalcade of failure.As I said before, the real shame is the lost potential of having an epic series of films that could be enjoyed by kids and by adults as much as the original series was. Dealing with heavy themes like genocide, racism and consequences of war is something you never see in children's programming, but somehow Avatar: The Last Airbender did it while still maintaining its humour and appeal to all audiences. It baffles me how such a fantastic show could fail as a live action adaptation, but it did. There's so much potential that has been lost here. We'll never see the city of Ba Sing Se, Zuko's path towards redemption, Toph becoming the first Metal Bender, or Aang's epic final battle with The Fire Lord. The damage is done. As a fan of the series, it pains me to say that I hope this is truly is The 'Last' Airbender.",The Last Airbender

My couch has more interesting thoughts.The ""acting"" was...the acting...w...BAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAHAAHAAA!!!!Haha.Ha.h.But seriously.The acting was about as believable as my thumb. And had about as much connection to reality as that last sentence. And had as much emotive power as, roughly, a napkin. Dipped in stupid.And the pacing. Oh my gawd, the pacing. Is it too much to ask that events in what is, ostensibly, a plot-driven movie, seem *related*, rather than like big chunks of asinine that fall from the sky and thud to earth, deathly-still, opaque, concerned neither for the ground on which they've landed nor for each other, to say nothing of FORWARD MOTION?? There is so much wrong with this movie that I don't even know where to begin, even though I've clearly begun. More accurately, perhaps I just don't know how to continue. Because my thoughts, right now, are a swirling, chaotic mass, much like the movie was, except that ""chaos"" somehow implies ""excitement"", and this movie was about as exciting and edgy as a teabag suspended from a chair in a church attic. It's ""Lord of the Rings"" meets ""I don't really give a s**t about my life, where's the gin?"" It went beyond ""so bad it's good"" to ""please give me a fork so that I can engage in the more pleasurable activity of scraping off my cornea"". Moviegoers, beware: the next time you're egregiously late to the movie you'd intended to see (such as, oh, I dunno...""Toy Story 3"", to pick a completely random example out of thin air, unrelated to anything, hahahaha), be EXCEEDINGLY CAREFUL of the one you choose to see instead. You might discover that you'd have been happier if you'd spent your time shoving nickels up your nose while dry-humping the back of a fan and listening to children scream into your ear as they run their fingernails across three hundred blackboards, with a tuba playing in the background, and a friend holds a hairdryer up to your face while telling you that your house just burned down and you're being audited by the IRS.

496,LunaRaven,M.Night Shyamalan should be ashamed....,1,30 June 2010,"M.Night.Shyamalan ought to be ashamed of himself. I went to the midnight premier of the Last Airbender as a hopeful long time fan of the wonderful animated series. Less than thirty minutes into the feature however I realized that my hopes would be dead on the ground by the time the movie ended.Over the past few months this film has been surrounded by controversy. The casting choices have caused accusations of racism to be leveled and many fans were left feeling disappointed months before the film even premiered. Now, I don't think M.Night Shyamalan is a racist. I don't know him well enough to make such a slanderous claim. Would I have preferred that the characters in the movie had appeared as the fans had come to know them over the past five years? Of course. However at the heart of Avatar fans, I don't think changing the appearances of certain nations was a racial issue. Simply put, I think people just wanted the characters to look the way they were supposed to look. However, had this movie been written well and had the acting been terrific, changing the appearances of the nations wouldn't have mattered. Because at its heart the story of Avatar is a human story with strong themes of redemption and forgiveness. I think people would have been able to look past their disgruntlement and see the beauty of the story. That is, if the movie had been well written. And I'm sorry to say, it was not. Naturally, it was always going to be difficult to condense over eight hours worth of animated material into two-hours of movie. How do you choose what goes and what stays in a series where almost everything is interconnected? It was a daunting task indeed. But successful adaption of books, television series, and even video games have been done before. If the works of Tolkien, the master of intricate detail, could be adapted into a series that left a decent amount of his life long fans pleased, surely Avatar: The Last Airbender could be adapted with the same success. Unfortunately, this adaption was far from successful. In fact I think this movie officially joins the list of the most atrocious film adaptions, right along side of the horrendous Earthsea mini-series, the painful Eragon flop, and perhaps the even worse Dark is Rising catastrophe. So where did this movie go wrong? The better question would be: where didn't it go wrong? The writing was horrendous. High school freshmen could probably manage to come up with a better screenplay. I'm not sure who gave Shyamalan permission to write this film, but whoever it was needs to formally apologize to the fans and to the people who wasted their money hoping to see something worthwhile. The direction was choppy—certain scenes made little sense, the camera lingered on other similarly senseless scenes, and at times the camera angles were difficult to follow. The lighting in the film was too dark throughout and when color was added, it was in too much excess. Overall, there was a lack of balance and cohesion in the way this movie was filmed. The plot was a mess. People who weren't familiar with the series would have been left lost, and people who were familiar with the series were left confused. Certain characters that were supposed to do things didn't, lines weren't said when they should have been said, and elements of the plot were just erased entirely. There was no Avatar Roku, only a dragon spirit that may have been an attempt at Fang, but a very bad one. There was no Omashu, no Kiyoshi warriors, there were no refugees at the northern air temple and Aang never attempted to master fire bending. In fact, in the movie he was too timid to learn water bending, which fans know to be a fallacy. And the characters that were featured were not only acted and written poorly, but many of them modeled new pronunciations of their names. I'm not sure of the reasoning behind this. Perhaps the changes in pronunciation were more accurate. Even if that was the case, they never should have strayed from the pronunciations in the series. Fans grew accustomed to a certain way of a saying and hearing a name. To change the pronunciations only led to confusion and distastes. I heard many people in the theatre around me growling in frustration every time Aang was pronounced ""Ah-ng"". I won't get into my dislike of the graphics in detail. Appa and Momo were fairly horrendous, the bending was decent but done incorrectly(actors had to make a hell of a lot of movement for anything to happen, whereas in the series each movement corresponds to the movement of the elements), and the 3D was pointless.Overall, I'd give this movie a 0 out of 10. Fans of the series, don't waste your money. People who are not fans and areconsidering giving this film a chance, use the money you would have spent on the ticket to rent the first season at the nearest video store.",The Last Airbender

The overall storyline was interesting, the special effect were amazing and the cast was sympathetic (I do not usually like little children in movies, but the small kid was pretty cool).

498,pi-32,Watch the movie with new eyes,10,19 June 2020,"A lot of bad critics have given a bad fame to this child movie that, of course, should concentrate 50 episodes in four seasons of which only one was produced.
Actors' play is good, story runs efficiently, effects are goods.
We watched the movie soon after released and were expecting seeing a copy of the anime version. Watching it back ten years later with our kids, we were all pleasantly surprised of the way the story goes and the actors play.
If you are expecting a carbon copy of the anime, this is not the right place but if you want to spend some good time with the kids, it's a nice and well done fantasy movie to enjoy. Pity that the three other elements, air, earth and fire have not been produced... Probably because expected financial success wasn't reached and bad reviews !",The Last Airbender

It's an incredible film, a true cinematic achievement and possibly a classic. Some of the images were so beautiful that I gasped at many of them. I felt transported and like I was seeing a movie for the very first time. I haven't felt that sort of magic in a movie in a long, long time.I watched the cartoon and liked it and the film may even improve upon it which is kind of a miracle considering it's about kids, animals and water just about all the time. The spiritual themes are simple and deep and raise more questions about faith and belief than answer anything. No preaching going on here and there could be. Without giving anything away, it's a wonderful story about storytelling and how telling our stories can get us through the most horrible life experiences and to help deal with the aftermath of them.It's an incredible film experience. 10/10 go see it!",The Last Airbender
500,Falkunfetur,I would rather read the Book of Leviticus front to back,2,30 January 2018,"The Last Airbender makes me grieve for the hundreds of millions of dollars lost in economic miss-allocation caused by its very existence. I enjoyed about 15 seconds of this entire film, which, for a movie filled with ""fights,"" is pretty pathetic. It's rare to get a movie that is bad not just in a distracting but redeemable way, but thoroughly bad in an irredeemable hot mass saturating all components of the film. The plot and pacing are exactly what you'd expect from a mediocre thriller director taking close to seven hours of a children's fantasy story and squeezing it into less than two hours. Actually, scratch that, it was worse than my expectations. I could think of umpteen thousand ways to cover the same content with a more convincing and enthralling structure. I was first bored with a slow-dragging, non-eventful journey of our not-so-lovable protagonists. But that wasn't nearly as bad as the rushed and nonsensical third act in which something like a trillion new characters were introduced that no one is made to care about, and I was expected to be sad when one died. I wasn't. The third act especially, but also the rest of this sorry excuse for a film, contains an abundance of ""motivations"" and happenings that make one want to step back and say ""what the actual hell did I just watch?"" The characters were a far cry from those of the TV series, and I actually would not have minded if they all died. That's how annoying and unlikable they were. First you have Aang, who acts like the stereotype we all imagine when I say ""child acting"" and has none of the charm, joy, or character that made his TV counterpart so beloved. Next we have Soka, who is the adaptation equivalent of finding George Carlin's death to be more funny than his comedy. Next Katara, who is an immature brat who won't stop spouting useless and poorly written exposition for more than 10 seconds. Next we have Zuko, an overacted archetypal villain with none of the sympathetic qualities of his TV counterpart. Next we have Ozai, who is unforgivably underwhelming. Finally we have Iroh, whose adaptation was basically the equivalent of stuffing all the world's most famous paintings into the Library of Alexandria, burning it, and then mixing the ashes with human feces. The plot might actually have been bearable if it weren't for the characters, and the cringe-worthy dialogue certainly didn't help. My basic expectation for even the most mediocre of action or fantasy films is good fights, but this waste of electricity fails to deliver even on that. We went from well-developed and smooth fighting styles based on a variety of martial arts to bad karate. We went from massive amounts of earth being flung dangerously through the air to an out-of-sync six person dance that lifted a single rock that would've been easier to pick up without bending. I could go on for days, but I think I've said enough to rate this pathetic piece of garbage a 2.",The Last Airbender
501,olafsson-28076,If Vomit Took Film Form,1,22 August 2015,"Seriously, seriously awful. Atrocious. I literally think I could make a better movie than this, with zero film training and no knowledge of how to direct or write a movie. The scriptwriters must have been phoning it in. The director (curse you Shamalalamadingdong!) must have wanted to personally wage war against those who enjoy films. The casting director must have suffered migraines and literal blindness during the auditions. It really sucks, because the source material is so wonderful. The TV show managed to use humor to really delve into dramatic and wonderful themes; the third episode dealt with genocide for crying out loud! It never lost grip of its characters or its theme or the action. But this....man. No good acting to be seen. The camera seems glued to the actor's faces and is awkwardly cut between conversationalists like a baby looking from mommy to daddy. The bending of the elements is trite and frankly silly. No amazing set pieces. Nothing to remember. Not one of the characters has any depth, due in part to the stale dialogue and in part to the bizarre casting choices. I mean, why on Earth would the cast the lead of a potential franchise based on a tape a kid sent in of his martial arts?! Seriously! 0 stars.",The Last Airbender
502,luisyveronicacastaneda,An incomplete work of Art,4,21 May 2020,"For a film that looks incredible, this felt more like an incomplete movie. I can only explain the experience of watching this movie like me trying to cook something my grandma used to make. I mean, I use the same ingredients, I follow the instructions, I make sure to use the correct measurements but at the end it ends up tasting awful. I guess that is the ART in culinary art. This is how exactly how this movie feels, it has all the great ingredients, but it ends up feeling like an unfinished film and a very confusing movie experience.
I have to confess I did not follow the series, graphic novels, or any other source from which the movie is based, so this review is solely based on my experience with this movie.
Let me start by saying that it is always hard for a young actor to carry the whole movie over their shoulders and Noah Ringer (Aang) does an incredible job. The camera likes this child and it shows. There is a sense of importance in the way he reacts, and we can't get our eyes off of him. But every hero needs an important antagonist, and Prince Zuko (played by Dev Patel) is nowhere near that standard. His reactions (direction?) is off and a bit dramatic. It just doesn't fit the movie as a whole and the editing makes him seem like a crazy incomplete character.
I may repeat over and over again how incomplete is this movie in many areas, from the script, the theme, and the direction. Perhaps there is a climatic scene that illustrates the frustration an audience may feel when experiencing this movie.
After many weeks of training, Aang seems to be able to control water. During an attack from the fire kingdom, he is able to create immense waves that raise up to protect the ice castle, but when it is time to defeat the coming army, he does nothing. I may not be recalling the specific details correctly, but the fact is that there is no resolution to our hero's voyage. He gets there and then there is nothing for him to do, or complete, or achieve by gaining those powers. Even the bad guy, Prince Zuko, moves from wanting to kill Aang, making him friend, and then trying to kill him again. The script by M. Night Shyamalan does not offer a clear plot, theme, or character growth. It is just one static scene after another with no clear end in sight. The movie even ends with the introduction of another antagonist that has had no screen time until the after credits.
To summarize, this movie has a weird pacing, no character development, and at the end it does not provide the audience with a good ending for their emotional investment presented throughout.
I must not forget to mention the great musical score by James Newton Howard, one must listen to it completely, the breathtaking cinematography of Andrew Lesnie, and the prodigious especial effects supervised by Pablo Helman.
I guess young kids will enjoy the movie, but it will leave most of the audience on an empty stomach full of air.",The Last Airbender

505,fmc3,Fun and well worth watching,9,2 July 2010,"I see that the Avatar: Last Airbender Cartoon Fanboys are all over this movie like sharks in a feeding frenzy. Well, do yourself a favor and don't believe them. Go look at how the votes shape up in the ratings section for this movie. Scores are mostly 1s (the fanboys) and 10s (normal people). Yes, there are also a much smaller percentage of votes on every number in between, but the 1s and 10s outnumber all the rest, by far. That should tell you that a lot of people REALLY liked it.This movie was much more than a kid's movie, despite the original kid level source material. I found it to be magic, mystical, entertaining and fun. I rarely go to see movies twice, even movies that I like a lot, because I just don't feel that most movies have much to offer on the second and third viewing, but I do plan to see this movie again, because I feel that I can get more out of it.The Last Airbender has a lot more to offer adults than it offers to 10-year-olds. Is it perfect? No, not at all. But how many movies really are perfect? This movie is much more like a typical oriental folk tale, told in a way that may not make complete sense to our western eyes, but it is engaging and diverting none-the-less, if you will just accept what is, sit back, and go with it.If you can't sit back (in a fantasy) and relax and be entertained by the sense of wonder all through it, then maybe this movie isn't for you.And if you can't get over the fact that this movie started as a cartoon and then grew into something more, if you insist that it must conform to your own fantasies, or if you think magic is something dreary and deadly serious, then you should probably stay away from this picture.Overall, I think it is a movie worth watching, which speaks more to adults than to children,so see it if you still have a sense of magic in your heart.",The Last Airbender

I had heard mixed reviews on the movie and decided to preview it before taking children. Glad I did or DCFS might have been called on me. This movie was horrible. Twice I almost fell asleep and whispered to my girlfriend that this movie stinks just before an action sequence which then peaked my interest for about 5 minutes and then it went back to terrible.I did like brief (very brief) moments of the action sequences. I also enjoyed the special effects. Things looked pretty cool with the different elements. That's it.What did I not like? Story was rushed, inconsistent with the cartoon, actors did terrible acting - most of the characters seemed like the same person, Sokka was not funny at all, Aang (pronounced wrong) was not child-like, Katara did not show faith or feelings for Aang, the entire Fire nation was Indian, Zuko hardly had a scratch on his eye, uncle did not seem wise or relaxed or chunky or anything. All the things I loved about the characters was missing.I agree with many of the other posts about M. Night climaxing on 6th Sense and then plummeting down after.

What was wrong in the movie - 1) The director did not take time to develop any character due to which it is impossible to relate with the reasonings and connect with the emotions, which were so impeccably portrayed in the TV series. 2) For some stupid reasons this director chose to take out all the fun from the TV series and make the movie. For example - the character of Sokka and Uncle Iroh who makes us tickle in the TV series were given serious faces in the movie. No witty comments throughout the movie. 3) Director had no grasp on the concept of the 'avatar' commuting through the spirit world, due to which it was only a light and show in the movie. Due to which the climatic fight sequence fell flat conceptually. 4) It also seems that 3D was planned later in the project as only few scenes has real 3D depth.

I could not believe how disjointed the story became after such a short time. Now I'm wondering why in gods name did they give M. Night Shyamalan to direct this movie. He totally ruined this for the fans. I personally loved The Last Airbender cartoon but this, it is a disgrace.For those fans who are going to see this on DVD or Bluray, please don't. It is not even worth a single cent. Consider 2 hours of your lives wasted if you are a fan and still able to sit through the entire movie.I being a Indian, don't get why the Fire Nation was comprised of Indians. I don't mean to be racist but when did the cartoon make the fire nation folks Indian. The Indian dude playing Commander Zhao, I doubt anyone could have taken him seriously. To make matters worse at one point in the movie he had jerry curls. The Fire Lord Ozai didn't even look menacing, they just got a simple Maori dude to play that role. They also made the names of the characters sound annoying with their eastern accent tribute. That was when I decided enough is enough. At least I'm going to put it as simple as this: 1. The story sucks majorly, too many plot holes and the major plot points were changed 2. The actors were emotionless, bunch of amateurs more like it 3.

518,jake-584,A Complete Let Down,2,12 July 2010,"This movie does not even compare to the animated television show Avatar: The Last Airbender. After seeing this movie I watched the entire animated series over again, and the two are completely different.First of all, I understand the necessity of editing out plot lines for the sake of the length of the movie, but in this process they eliminated all the plot lines that reveal the characters' personality. As a result, most of the characters felt flat and empty. Sokka and Katara were probably the biggest disappointment, because Sokka is funny and sarcastic in the cartoon. Here he was just another random guy. Katara was supposed to be something more than the only water bender in the south pole. For example, the plot line where Katara fought the north pole water bending master because he refused to teach girls was completely cut out. This is an example of what I'm talking about--scenes like that would have added much needed depth to the flat characters in the movie. Some of the costuming was just randomly different from that of the television shows. Zuko's hair stuck out to me because his hair is not supposed to look like that until the second season. Uncle Iroh, while one of the best actors in the entire film, for some reason was not made to look remotely close to his counterpart in the animated show. Because most of the characters were not as believable, like Zuko, or lacking and flat, like Sokka, Katara, and Aang, the film was actually kind of boring. Without the characters, it was just another action fantasy movie. The overarching problem was that Aang had to let go of his anger toward the Fire Nation for slaughtering the Air Nomads, which he didn't do until he arrived at the North Pole. While I understand that only one theme could be communicated, this one was a poor choice because it made the movie seem cheesy.One last thing: the movie made it look too easy for Katara, Sokka, and Aang to just randomly retake Earth Kingdom cities. If it was that easy, surely someone could have done it before them--the Avatar was not even needed. In short, the real Avatar (the television show) was charming, funny and enjoyable to watch, whereas this film took a fantastic show and made into something unbearably mediocre. As an Avatar fan, this film was a huge disappointment and rather painful to endure.",The Last Airbender

I find the settings reasonably faithful to the cartoon series, and most cgi effects are passable by today's movie standards. The biggest failing of this film, however, is the scripting. Rather than reinventing the cartoon trilogy or developing a branch story, they took the easy way out. They took episodes from the cartoon's 1st season and compressed them into a ~2hr movie. This leaves the film very confusing for those unfamiliar with the cartoon and also butchers the pacing of the film. You get no time to understand the story's universe or feel attached to any of the characters. Stuff just happen, more or less. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone besides truly hardcore Avatar fans who just want to see the cartoon in live action for the heck of it.

521,angelwind777,"Sad sad sad! Shame on you George Lucas, Shame on you Paramount!",2,3 August 2010,"I have not seen the TV series (though now I am curious). I am the product of some good marketing that simply made this look fabulous in the previews of the movie's release.I just saw it. I could not believe the ending. I understand when a movie is multi-part but this was just cheap ending. It was abrupt, sudden and had no finesse.So I came here and on another site to see about other problems this movie had. First as others have said, there was horrible character building in this movie. The characters were simply shallow and totally undeveloped. As someone said, it was ""cardboard characterizations"" except the boy who played the Avatar, I thought he was very good as well as the character Dev Patel played. I can understand why he had mixed feelings I read about in regards to this movie.Much of the acting needed tremendous work in this movie. For this budget they could have had acting coaches help promote much of what was needed, but I won't blame all of the actors for this.Then the story, one line comments about things that happened in the story does need lead to plot development. I felt the movie relied to much on peoples knowledge of the story.I felt like it might help book sales to READ and find out everything that happened between a series of barely connected scenes.The special effects, whereas nice, weren't as spectacular as I hoped they might come close to with the previews and so for a second and third time, I felt cheated. For this kind of budget I KNOW they could have done much much better. Simple special effects would have helped but it seems the predominant ones, again, I saw in the previews. I went to find out where the movie was made. When I saw Paramount, I was shocked. When I saw Industrial Light and Magic (Goerge Lucas' outfit) I felt totally robbed and incensed!! I will never watch another Shymalian film again, though would be interested in the obvious POTENTIAL for a good movie if another outfit tried to make this movie.It is SAD, sad, sad...Save your time, save your money for a truly good or even fair movie.I am being generous to some good talent potential with the young actors in this movie by giving it 2 stars when it deserves only 1.Shame on you George Lucas, Shame on you Paramount.

Other reviews say that if you don't watch the cartoon you will have no idea what is happening. I have only ever seen 1 episode from the cartoon from series 2 so was not aware of the plot but the film tells the story very well and I was not left confused at any point. Admittedly, the acting wasn't amazing but it was nowhere near as bad as reviewers have made out (with the exception of Sokkah). Even if the acting was bad I still would have deeply enjoyed this film as the plot was deeply immersive and action sequences blew me away (no pun intended.) The CGI , such as the Air temple, was impressive to look at, as were the different elements being thrown about in the best fight scenes I have ever seen in a film. Also, the magical aspect of the film is really awe-inspiring. This film is amazing and was not worthy of all the bad reviews.

I saw this in 2D because I hate all 3D movies, and word on the street is that this film's 3D was even worse than normal 3D. I don't know. I didn't have to worry about that.The action scenes were all awesome, Shyamalan sometimes becoming reminiscent of Ang Lee or Zak Snyder (although, personally, I wished either one of them had directed it instead of M. Night).The acting was so-so. Jackson Rathbone, Dev Patel, Shaun Toub and Aasif Mandvi all performed well. Nothing particularly great, certainly not great enough performances to balance off the sub-par ones from the rest of the cast, but good performances nonetheless.The pronunciation changes I knew about, and don't really know why everyone's freaking out about it. I watched the show, and I think what should be more important is the fact that they cut out all of the comedy. Aang and Sokka are more grounded, and aren't funny.

M.

The concept of the movie is spiritual, dealing with the basic elements that contribute to our existence namely, Air, earth, water and fire. There are also elements of other movies tastefully incorporated such as Lord of the Rings and the Never Ending Story meets The Forbidden Kingdom to name a few. It mirrors the evil that is rife in current planet earth civilisation as warmongers continue to enslave innocent happy and harmonious ones.

The only redeeming quality is that some of the actors seem to work well with such a limp script (namely Dev Patel), and the special effects sometimes distracted me from how bad the movie was. Let's get this straight- M. Night Shyamalan should not write. I'm sorry, but he should try to work his way back to where he was when he made Signs or the Sixth Sense. The dialogue was repetitive and fell flat and the plot was all over the place. Please, if you still want to see this, be prepared to be disappointed. Just rent it at Blockbuster or Netflix, and if you do go to see this- definitely see it in 2D. The 3D is not worth it.",The Last Airbender
528,cyanideXvampire,I really didn't think it was that bad...,6,10 July 2010,"OK, OK, the mispronunciation of the names bothered the hell out of me. I don't care what MNS's excuse was, there was a show to copy the pronunciation from. It's not like a book that's open to interpretation, copy the damn show.I mean, it stayed pretty close to the show (from what I can remember anyways, I haven't seen it in a few years). The special effects were cool (don't even TRY to deny it) especially when some of that stuff was hard to transfer from a cartoon to live-action. The acting wasn't terrible. I really liked who they chose for Aang. Zuko and Iroh were good casting choices too. Katara annoyed me. Her acting reminded me of Kristen Stewart in Twilight. Sokka wasn't bad, he just wasn't great.I went into this movie with low expectations. I didn't think it was that disappointing. The original is ALWAYS better. Deal with it. Was it the best movie ever? No. Was it the worst movie ever? No (that award would probably have to go to 30 Days of Night). It was a summer action movie, obviously it's going to be a little shallow.I don't understand all of this movie's haters. Yeah we all know the only good thing MNS directed was The Sixth Sense. But this movie kept me entertained enough, gasp, to watch it again or see the sequel.Maybe not worth the theater price, but I'd see it on DVD or on demand.",The Last Airbender
529,d_girl,I cant believe how bad this movie is.,1,6 July 2010,"I am a big fan of the cartoon series, i believe its one of the best cartoons ever made. The story, the characters, the message, everything is incredible... This movie however is not. The fact that a whole 'season' or book was condensed into a one and a half hour movie was a sign a lot of things would be cut out. The amount of story missing in the movie is ridiculous. Massive battles are now 2 minute arguments and important characters and events are cut out completely. The acting is poor at best and the cast selection is better left unmentioned. Sokka is not funny, Iroh is not funny or fat and what is with changing the names. Aang is now Ung. Iroh is now Yuro. This movie had so much potential I hope M.Night doesn't try to destroy anymore of the Avatar series. Shame on you M. Night Shyamalan.",The Last Airbender
530,AlmelchIIX,A enjoyable movie!,8,2 July 2010,"I'm German but I saw the movie in the US and I was surprised. After all this disappointing reviews I didn't thought that ""The Last Airbender"" was so good. I must say that I don't know the series ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"". I like fantasy epics, that's all. And this one is a very good one. The action scenes are very exciting and have a well done choreography. The movie impressed me visual. And the 3D effects are not bad. Not as good as the effects in ""Avatar"" by James Cameron are. The story is a classic action-fantasy story and very enjoyable. I think M. Night Shyamalan, the composer James Newton Howard and the producer Frank Marshall have done a very good work. I recommend it to everyone.",The Last Airbender
531,nintendohero-1,Was pretty gnarly.,3,1 July 2010,"Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of the cartoon series and recently rewatched every episode before seeing this.Now, just to get it out there, I came out of the theater happy.I think most people hated it cause they expected it to be the cartoon show with real actors. When it clearly is not. It follows the basic story, but it's changed around, probably due to the budget and time they had. PROS: The action scenes where great, the special effects where awesome.The actors chosen are perfect. I think all of them did a good job. I especially like the pick for Katara and Zuko. The music is FANTASTIC. It is some of the most epic music I've ever heard, period.CONS:Could have been longer. Unnecessary cuts where made which could have added to it and made it a bit more entertaining. It would have been nice for it to be at least 2 hours 30 mins. It's a big movie taking on a big series.Some of the dialog is kind of bad. Sometimes you'll see the actors state something out of random just to add to the story. This is an example, (it's not in the movie)Katara: You're the avatar!Sokka: Whoa! You've been gone forever.Aang: Yes I am the avatar and I ran away and got lost in a storm with my flying bison and now I must defeat the fire nation.--The characters really needed to be a bit more developed. It was a bit rushed.More humor is a must for the sequel. They humor in the movie, while rare, made me laugh every time. Especially the moments between Sokka and Katara.Overall I give this movie a 7/10. Very entertaining, worth seeing in theaters. Just go in with an open mind and remember that they tried to squeeze 8 hours of cartoon episodes into an hour and a half of a movie.****",The Last Airbender
532,likegoodmovies,"Appalling movie, not worth watching even for Avatar L.A.B. fans. Watch the series!",1,23 October 2012,"Absolutely the worst movie (after the story) I've ever seen. The bending is so crap and movements overdone with hardly any bending going on. The CGI is almost non-existent. The characters are so terrible. The characters and story could not get any flatter or shallow. There is basically no goodness in the movie. Not even 1% of the original series. They had the ethnicity of the characters all wrong. The water tribe are supposed to be olive skinned, but instead they cast a couple of lame white kids. The fire nation are supposed to be white, but typical of racist film making because they are ""the bad guys"" got cast as dark skinned Arabs. LOL",The Last Airbender
533,filmguy450,"Shyamalan makes a visual arresting film, but the script is crazy and disjointed.",6,3 July 2010,"I have seen the show, and thought it was great. Also, I did not see this in 3D, but the 2d, so with that out of the way, let's get on with the show.This is a magnificently looking film. The special effects are utterly incredible. Appa, Aang's flying bison, looks entirely real and believable. The bending elements look great as well, with the fire moving and looking like fire, and the way the light is reflected in the moving water elements is indescribable impressive. The cinematography is very clean, and the camera moves are incredibly fluid, getting the most out of the extreme budget, all of which you can see on the screen. In one scene, near the end of the film, Aang water-bends some Fire nation soldiers, and the camera is just gliding along with your driven hero as he jumps, flips, and freezes. The blocking is great, and the long takes, with an occasional zoom in/ out flourish, that actually allows us to see everything going on (and this is a a massive, epic scale fight), and the clean look helps. When Aang enters the ""spirit world"", it's done in a very cool style, with a weird but cool blue-hued out of focus distortion, with a sort of double exposure trick happening. It's a great juxtaposition to the more natural look of the real world, and the overwhelming blue dims out the other colors, again, making for a striking contrast.The colors just pop, with each tribes color being vibrant, even the dark reds of the Fire nation. The shadows are black, the whites are whiter than snow, the purples are stunning, you get the idea. The costumes are equally as good, with tons of detail clearly being put into them, and the little things, like Katara's necklace, also have great detail. It's Aang's tattoos and air nomad robes that are the best. The tattoos are very detailed, and look real. The flashback scenes, most of which involve Aang telling his new found friends about his people, of which he is the last (as if that's a surprise, it's in the title!), are filmed in a slight golden hue and using fewer camera movements, and we are at an elevated perspective, suggesting looking back at the past and realizing that one must grow up.The acting is a bit of a mixed bag, but ultimately, it worked for me. Noah Ringer as Aang does all his own martial arts, and with the gloriously long takes, you're able to tell, and it makes that much more exciting. His line deliveries are pretty decent, but he's not 100% convincing all the time. Jackson Rathbone, Jasper from the Twilight Saga films, isn't given much to do as Sokka, but he does do nicely in his small role. His key scene is near the end, and you can really feel his heartbreak. Nicola Peltz, as good hearted, Southern tribe water-bender Katara, has a few scenes of really inhabiting her character, she is however, overall the weakest link. Part of the problem might be that 70% of what she says is expository, part of it is inexperience, and the last part is that the dialog is very overwrought, but she never overcomes these to be anything other merely OK.Dev Patel as Prince Zuko is great! He's very convincing conveying the pain and emotional turmoil that this character is feeling and sells the constant crisis of destiny he's constantly going through. Playing the honorable, noble, ex-greatest general of the Fire Nation, Uncle Iroh, Shaun Taub is great. He embodies the character fully, and the riddle way he talks seems natural coming out of his mouth. Aasif Mandvi as the conniving Commander Zhou makes for a great jerk-off, and his lack of tact, while still being seemingly polite at first glance, is all fully embodied. As the oppressive, heartless, take-no-prisoners Fire Lord Ozai Cliff Curtis makes for an impressive antagonist. His cool, calculated way of being mad without rising his voice, all makes for a very compelling character.Now folks, the bad. This movie never shuts up. It's truncated a 400 minute+ cartoon, into just 90, which is way too freaking short. However, not only do they make it so short, Shyamalan and company decided to put in almost every single thing from that 400 minute season one (aka ""Book One: Water"", the subsequent books are ""Earth"" and ""Fire"", in that order, respectively). This means that the movie never stops explaining what just happened, where we are at and why, and because of this character development and story arcs are given a backseat. It's a huge disappointment. The only two characters that are given more than one defining trait, are Aang and Zuko. Aang has so much to deal with, which is a little glossed over, but man, the ending does punch it home, and it's a great ending. Zuko's story is heartbreaking and really brings a great complexity to the character. But we still have a dozen main or supporting characters that get nothing, and it makes the movie a tad disjointed; as does it's predisposition to never slow down and allow us to catch up.As a director, Shyamalan has done everything right. This is one of the best looking films of the year, and might be the best. I guarantee it's got the best action and cinematography, that we're likely to see all year. As a writer though, he tried doing too damn much. Condensing everything from season 1 into such a short time span is an impossible task, and if you aren't familiar with the excellent, excellent show, you will be left scratching your head. With all that, I do recommend this movie. The visuals are undeniably stunning, the cinematography is beyond superb, and action is great. Just don't expect it to make a lot of sense.",The Last Airbender
534,Tamothy,Thoroughly enjoyed it!,10,7 November 2010,"I am embarrassed to admit that I almost passed on this film, entirely as a result of its widespread persecution. After viewing all 103 minutes last night, I am confident that most film critics as well as the general public, have extreme difficulties thinking for themselves.The Last Airbender was a huge success. It is obvious that the visuals carried the film, but what the creative team painted for us was nothing less than spectacular. From the brilliant costumes to the magnificent ice kingdom, my eyes would not leave the screen. Noah Ringer was a treat to watch, and his character was easy to root for. The action scenes were exciting, but more importantly unique. The variety in the supporting cast kept me entertained from one scene to the next, and created excellent set up for their roles in the sequels. Even the score was highly captivating. This complimented the narration of a very enjoyable storyline.The greatest flaw was of course the dialogue. This caused some of the characters to suffer immensely. At one point, I actually questioned Jackson Rathbone's existence in the film. If you are unable to identify with the characters, it is easy to become disengaged.In the context of a children's cartoon series film adaptation, the movie prevails. It delivers on multiple levels, and falls short on a few. This hardly constitutes failure. It is unfortunate that Hollywood has created a scapegoat in Shyamalan, yet amusing that the public has so blindly bought into it.",The Last Airbender
535,Winchester_United,Where was Nickelodeon?/ REBOOOT! REBOOT!!! REBOOOT!!!!!!!!!,3,2 July 2010,"When I heard M Night Shamaylan was doing this film last year I was worried, I had just seen the epic failure that is ""The Happening,"" but then I thought to myself that this is the same guy who did the ""Sixth Sense"" I even like ""The Village"" and even thought that ""signs"" and ""Unbreakable"" were OK. I even thought that since he wasn't the one creating the story there was no way this could go bad...Boy was I ever wrong.The entire first half of the movie made me cringe, the only thing that gave me the ability to stay.Almost everything in the movie was bad, from the scripting to the the majority of the casting. If you had no knowledge of the story you'd be utterly lost in this film, and while many actors did decent jobs in this film, many didn't(the girl who plays Katara for example).The special effects were decent but not as good as they should be for a budget that ended up costing what the entire trilogy was supposed to have.My main question is, where was Nickelodeon during all this? For however bad of a director Shamaylan might be, Nickelodeon still had the rights to this, they are the ones who greenlit the project and approved of the scripte, etc. Is there anyone working at Nickelodeon's studios with even half a brain?Shamaylan has a contract for 2 more movies, but I hope that Nickelodeon has enough sense to find away to scrap any plans for sequels and just reboot the series in a few years to save the franchise's integrity. And if they can't, find away to scrap shamaylan and have the shows writers and creators write up some new scripts or at least edit through whatever shamaylan wrote",The Last Airbender
536,rlezoozoo,I liked this movie,8,25 July 2019,"I'd like to see this continue with the other books. With the CG improvements that have come out since this one came out, it could be great!!",The Last Airbender
537,christopherhelson,A horrible movie from a great TV show,3,7 July 2010,"There are two very important things I want to point out right now: The first is that I am a huge fan of the television show Avatar: The Last Airbender. The second being that the movie, The Last Airbender, based on said show, does sucks on all levels. In a nutshell, the movie is a 90 minute cliff notes version of the show, that has the right elements to it, yet it leaves the heart and soul back in the original cartoon.The movie had horrible acting from everybody. There were small moments when the director had a good moment with the actors, when you thought ""Ok, the character actual has a good moment now, maybe he or she will be like this for the rest of the movie"". Alas, that isn't so. Aside from Prince Zuko, the main villain in the TV show, though only a sometimes bad guy in the movie, no character is truly developed or set up for you to care about. You see Katara and Sokka, Aang's traveling companions, but they barely have enough screen time to make you truly feel for their characters, much and less for you to see who they really are, and also you hear very little about their past. To help bridge a 20 episode first season which this movie supposedly follows, Katara voices a lot of the story between scenes, but her narration feels as if she's merely reading the script.The main character, Aang, is worlds apart from his TV counterpart. The movie shows clips of why he ran away but not how he arrived in the current world a hundred years later. Not to mention he has no connection with his two on screen co-stars, Katara and Sokka. He barely has 10 minutes of screen time with them (ok, maybe 20 minutes), and when he does appear with them, he's usually running away or meditating. The explanation he gives for not wanting to be the Avatar a hundred years ago is ridiculous (hint, his people were monks, and not suppose to have families to begin with), not to mention he has no development as a character whatsoever. He's flat, dull and rather seems out of place with everything that's going on around him.As I said, I'm a fan of the show, and can proudly tell you which episodes were used to make this movie. However, I can also tell you that the script that was used for the film was rather unexciting, monotonous and had no life to it. I will admit that there was an element of the movie that wasn't in the show and actually appealed to me. That was the defacing of Zuko's father, Firelord Ozai, as he conspired to make his son to fail. Aside from this, the rest of the script needed to be retooled, reedited and rewritten, several more times. Much of the actors problems stemmed from this horrible script, which seemed to mock its source material. Much of the script is laughable and rather dimwitted and hard to believe. Case in point, the three kids travel from the South Pole to the Southern Air Temple, a trip that took roughly a week to accomplish in the show, though unknown how much time in the movie. The movie kids ""rescue"" Aang then travel to the Southern Air Temple, all before knowing Aang's name or if he's the Avatar or not, though they strongly believe he might be. Um, these are two VERY important things you need to know BEFORE you decide to help guide and protect someone so important. Especially that pesky name bit.There are other elements of this movie which I could pick apart that would really seem cruel on my part. The list would include that the movie was film way too dark, the fight sequences were ridiculous and stale, the special effects were laughable, Appa (my nephews favorite animal character) was rarely seen despite being a 10 ton flying bison (though he looked like he was from the book Where the Wild Things Are), and the fact that this is a mere 90 minute film that left out huge gaps that would further the story along in the next two chapters/movies. Examples being Avatar Ruko, Aang's current status with going into the Avatar State, the Aang gang knowing about Suzon's Comet, and the Kyoshi warriors just to name a few . Much of this vital data could have been covered in a mere 30 to make this a two hour film. And if the effects were good and the script better, many fans (I believe) would tolerate the film being two and a half hours long. Instead, we got a dismal 90 minute feature that leaves huge plot holes for the next two movies to try and cover, dull characters, a horrible script and bad special effects. The person to blame would be the director and writer M. Night Shyamalan for both directing such a horrible film and using the said script.I can only hope that IF they do a sequel, there will be a new director, new actors or the current ones get better training, as well as a competent script.",The Last Airbender
538,neolondres,It could have been an awesome movie,3,13 July 2010,"I love Nickelodeon Avatar. I don't like much of their other cartoons, but Avatar was special. It blend some oriental myths into a western approach in the narrative that didn't let the history to be extremely dramatic nor a repetitive series of fights, as normally happens to these time spending Animes (like Naruto). And Avatar had a good story that the episodes made a good job detailing them to make the viewer understand the mythology that the series proposed based on concepts that actually makes sense, something kind hard to find out there. So, when I heard that they would make a high budget live action movie based on the series and that would be directed by M. Night Shyamalan, the director of one of my preferred movies of all time The Sixth Sense, I could not stop thinking ""this is going to be excellent, this can't go wrong"". And how wrong I was.The problem was not Shyamalan, even though his last movies (Lady in the Water, The Happening) were a total trash. The problem of this movie is the same as all the other adaptations from videogames or HQs that we have seen so far: people who think that they can make a movie from them! Hey, megalomaniac directors out there, hear this: don't mess with what you don't know! You will only disgrace your careers and worse yet will disgrace the franchises image. It's the same problem of when we saw Resident Evil: a total trash. The same problem when of Prince of Persia: very average. The same problem of The League of the Extraordinary Gentleman: not even Sean Connery saves such stupidity. It's the problem of grabbing really good stories that their authors really had to think over the media that they were working to find a way to transmit to their audiences the emotions of their characters and the power of the stories. It impresses me that the videogames or animations are each moment getting more and more cinematographic and the cinema in the other hand, going every time more like childish dumb. The cinema almost lost their ability to trick the audience into believes that what they are seeing is real (the most important aspect of a movies). Believable. And to make the film believable you need to make sure that the acting is convincing, that the special effects are well merged with the actors to make us believe that what's happening on the screen happened for real, and that the history makes sense, even though is not meant to be moralistic. Come on directors? The Dark Knight didn't teach something important to you? Whatever is what you want to make a movie from, a billionaire stud who likes to dress himself with tight dark leather and big cape like he was in a Halloween party, so be it, but make sure that your film respect those 3 demands and you can probably score something like 1 billion dollars in box offices like Dark Knight did. The audience gets happy, and you earn your so much desired cash. Another clear problem of Last Airbender is that the story is extremely confusing. Of course. Who said Shyamalan knew something about the TV series? If he knew he would not have messed so much with the history like he did with the movie, because the TV series is already done with the right format to adapt to the big screen. He would just need to pick the series important parts and explain to the audience the reason why everything there was happening. For example, how Aang ended up in that iceberg or why Zuko had a fight with his father. Nothing of this is explained and of course the story will be confusing. Nobody knows why that's happening to the characters. So, if you never watched the TV series, please, do it. The story is good, and all is explained in an intelligent way. There's also another problem that is the bending. It would be so good to see the elements bending like we saw in the TV series. The movements were fast and menacing, like a Kung Fu fight, and nothing like this movie Tai Chi Chuan practiced with the speed of an old man. The actors were also something that I really can't swallow. You know that Shyamalan didn't watch at least one episode when you compare the Aang of the movie with the Aang of the TV series. Not only they are not alike, but the Aang of the original is not a saddened boy that you see in the movie. I understand that Shayamalan decided to not use Asian actors to play the main characters since the North Americans would not get very related with them, but I'm sure that they could find someone Asian suited for the role.I loved Nick's Avatar because the story was extremely interesting, with really good scripts, funny moments, awesome visual effects and those awesome Kung Fu with elements control that was so exciting, and I'm still sure that would make an excellent movie. When the director shows at a least a minimal knowledge of the franchise he is trying to adapt, the material of the source is sometimes so good that it can even compensate some wrong decisions that the director took. Take Spiderman 1 for example. And when the director really understood the source, and took a time to envision what he is going to film, then something spectacular happens. Take Lord of the Rings for example. In the end this movie looks like a lot these fan fictions that we saw sometimes in the internet. It would be amazing if this was made by a fan, but it's just too disappointing for being a high budged blockbuster.",The Last Airbender

First off, there were story elements sprinkled about the movie, but nothing of the direct story. The story was modified to a great extent. I hated the actor of Aang, they pronounced everyone's name wrong. There was a lack of ""bending"" from everyone. Admiral Zhow and the Fire Lord looked like someone you'd meet in the supermarket,there was like 2 one-liners, not a lot of comic relief. I think this was more aimed at people who haven't watched the cartoon.

543,albinus01,A total failure in every way possible,2,26 July 2010,"This movie has all the elements of a terrible movie. It has a horrible story, acting/dialog, pacing, and action scenes/fighting. That is the real shame because the movie was based on a cartoon that had all of these things in abundance. Even the special effects were bad due to the woefully unnecessary last minute 3-D.Add the fact that the characters races were completely wrong (the two anglo kids stick out like sore thumbs as members of an Inuit tribe). The main premise of the cartoon wasn't even handled correctly (It was called Last Airbender not Last Interpretive Corriographed Dance With the Elements Guy). They are moving with (bending) the elements, not summoning spells with dance moves.All of these complaints are NOTHING compared to the fact that the characters MISPRONOUNCED THEIR OWN NAMES. How can we begin to take the movie seriously if M. Knight couldn't even get the main characters name right? I can overlook the bad acting and bad writing, and get at least some enjoyment from seeing the action or special effects on the big screen, But when I hear the main characters name mispronounced, it just removes me completely from the cinematic experience.It doesn't matter how someone pronounces Aang in Chinese, Mandarin, or whatever. Ong is NOT his name and that is NOT the correct way to say it. The source material that the movie is based from is the cartoon and nothing else. Using any other pronunciation of the names is stupid and just a slap in the face of fans and the shows creators. There is simply no excuse for this level of incompetence.Also, just to clarify, my dislike of this movie has nothing to do with Shyamalan. I truly liked most of his movies (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, The Village, and to a lesser degree Signs).",The Last Airbender

M night is by far the worst director i have ever heard of. i think we should reinstate the death penalty and allow M night to atone for his crimes against humanity.really, i can't stress this enough - DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! i think i got cancer. ohhh and how hard is it to pronounce the names right? even this, they couldn't do right.",The Last Airbender
546,play_burnman,Pleasantly Surprised,8,6 October 2010,"Let me start by saying, I have never seen the anime. I completely understand how that might change opinions...That being said: I liked it. This is a kid's movie and a fun one but you have to always remember, its based off a cartoon made for children. As such it should be allowed some leeway. The fight choreography is awesome and well paced. M Knight never blows his wad in a way that makes following choreography pale. The world is wonderfully fantastical and for the most part the effects hold up. Certainly there's a couple scenes where you can tell its a green screen but its rare that any movie pulls off the flawless green screen/virtual set immersion. Speaking of green screens the acting is a little thin in parts. I chalk this up to the difficulty of directing actors on a green screen. It takes someone with a ton of experience at it to pull outstanding performances out of actors when they have no visual queues to work with. So I'll let M Knight slide a little on this one too.And I come from a place where I loath M Knight movies...In the end, I say its a wonderful children's movie, filled with emotional content, spiritual undertones, and some saweet fight scenes that I would consider age appropriate for youngsters. (No blood, no death, and many a person gets up and runs away.) I can't wait until my daughter is old enough to watch stuff like this with.",The Last Airbender

As a fan of the cartoon series it left me questioning the changes and just being completely aggravated at the pronunciations of the character's names. I felt like if I didn't like the show so much I might have liked the movie more. But then on the other hand if I didn't already like the show I don't think the movie would have even appealed to me. If I didn't already know the story I might not have even really understood the whole concept of what was going on. I didn't completely hate it, but I never liked it very much either. I just kept waiting, thinking to myself maybe it'll get better, but sadly it never did.

549,marcus-mosesson,"An understandable failure, but yet no excuse for being a descent movie",1,3 August 2011,"I didn't expect that a live action film adaption of the absolutely amazing animated series would be any good at all. Just imagine yourself: you're supposed to make ONE movie of one season of a series (Book 1: Water) which contains 20 episodes, which are over 20 minutes each. To make it possible to fit in all the important and deep happenings in those episodes into one movie, the movie would have to be about 3 hours long. And the movie was only the half of that.In other words, it's understandable that it's hard to make a good movie of such a long series, so people (and especially those who've seen the animated series) should at least be aware of that the movie might not will live up to the high expectations.But seriously: how hard could it be to make a decent movie?! None of the characters has any personal depth, and the lack of personality makes it all uninspiring. Jackson Rathbone as Sokka tries to be funny as the animated one, but he isn't funny or charming at all. The youthful playfulness Aang (Noah Ringer) has in the series is totally gone; or at least, you don't recognize it here. The creatures Appa, a flying sky bison, and Momo, a lemur bat, have NO moment of showing some deeper personality, which they did all the time as cartoons; here, they're only decorations. What a shame.Except no character depth, the acting was horrifying. Of course, what do you expect from children actors, but seriously: how hard can it be?! Noah Ringer acts (does he even ACT?!) like he was reading his lines directly of the manuscript. Jackson Rathbone tries to act funny and emotionally, but he's only lame. Nicola Peltz as Katara is pathetic. The only one who really makes a decent performance is Shaun Toub as Uncle Iroh, and perhaps Cliff Curtis as Firelord Ozai, and Dev Patel as Prince Zuko. But overall, it's horrible.Regarding the visuals and cinematography, it's okay: the effects are decent, and so are the environments. But the bending of the four elements is messed up: in the series, the fire benders can shoot/create fire right from their own bodies; but here, they have to have a source, like a camp fire or a torch. Maybe that seems more realistic, but that results in almost no fire bending in any fighting scene; and that makes it lame to watch! Also, there's overall not enough bending at all. The bending is a crucial part of the series, and the absence of it in the movie makes it very boring. Also, the bending is drawn out: the benders make some Ju Jutsu moves, and then something moves, instead of letting the elements follow their moves naturally as it does in the series. What a waste!So what about the appearance of the actors compared to the series? Well, I got to say that I kind of like Shyamalan's version of making the Fire Nation to look like Indians, Arabs and Maori, even though they look like Southeast Asians as cartoons. Dev Patel fits good as Zuko, and even though Shaun Toub isn't as fat as the original Iroh, he's okay for his role. But if there's something that's messed up, it's the nationality of the Water People: a mix of Eskimos and white people in the South Pole, and only white people in the North Pole?! That's very weird! In the series, the Water people look pretty much like Eskimos, so why did they have to make them look like this? Because of this, the actors for Sokka and Katara doesn't fit visually to their roles either. And Noah Ringer? What did Shyamalan thinking?! He sure has Aang's round head and face, but his eyes and brows destroys the whole picture. Appa looks like a troll mixed with a beaver, and Momo... Well, it could have been worse.Overall, this movie is a disaster. It's filled with so much corny and non-emotional moments, that it's a shame to watch. Crucial parts and happenings in the series are either unmentioned or just mentioned in the haste, and the story has a lack of a red line. It's understandable that it was a hard task to make a descent movie of a whole series of 20 episodes, but that's no excuse for considering this movie as descent or good. My advice is that you skip this movie, and watch the amazing animated series instead. I'm a teenager, and I still love the cartoon. So watch the cartoon instead of this garbage!",The Last Airbender
550,cfarm823,"Atrocious in every possible category, excluding CGI",1,29 December 2011,"This is one film that I am passionate about when it comes to sheer hatred and loathing. When I first viewed in theaters in 3D (which I wouldn't recommend) and walked out, I was disappointed, severely. This was largely in part due my high hopes because the source material was so solid. But then something inside started to decay, and I realized that my malice toward the greedy Indian man know as M. Night Sham-wow would not end until he was burned alive with a boulder tied to his foot, thrown out of a helicopter, and into the sea. Fire, Earth, Air, Water. Character development, imaginative locals, a sense of humor, incredible choreography, and real martial arts incorporated into the different bending styles; these are some of the elements present in the animated show, but lacking in the film. There are so many oddities, fumbles, and screw-ups that I don't even know where to start. Well, what a better place than the casting: Aang? Aang who knows Kung-Fu? OH! You mean Ong! Pardon? Yeah...he's white. Fire Nation? Oh, yeah Imperial Japan! Nope, all Indian. Okay...what about the Water Tribe, are they Inuits? Nope, White Americans. The screenplay was cumbersome and too serious. Another mistake was filming all of the first season into one movie. It CAN'T be done without disregarding the source material and condemning different components unimportant. Special effects? People get hit with fire, ne'er a scorch be found. Water? No one's wet. 3D is horrible, even by 3D standards. What do you get when film a movie using 2D technology and decide to tack one 3D effects in post-production? Not a polite word, I assure you. *SPOILER ALERT* You remember in the movie when the fire nation was imprisoning earth benders from a nearby village and they were put in a camp in a canyon, SURROUNDED BY EARTH? Now in the animated series, imagine the imprisoning scenario, but on a metal barge in the middle of the God damn ocean. This is blatant disregard for the original story because M. Night Shyamalan didn't believe that the Earth benders were strong, courageous, and tenacious. Wrong. Dead wrong. It is implanted in the way they fight, how they move, their stance. *End Spoiler Alert* Just know, that I went into this with preconceived bias due to my love of Avatar: The Last Airbender.

I have not watched or read anything prior to watching this film that would cause me to favor a previous story. I can say unbiased that I really enjoyed this movie. The only thing that disappointed me was that there wasn't more to watch when the end arrived. I felt the chemistry between Aang and Katara was powerful as she was still learning her bending while trying to protect Aang. Aang's longing for a family made him human and easy to relate to. It was easy to see that a ""family"" was being built between Aang, Katara and Sokka.

The director has gone from a person who was making ground breaking movies a few years ago to someone who puts together visual clips copied over from a cartoon.The nature of Aang was what made the cartoon series so much fun to watch. He was a fun loving child who enjoyed playing pranks and got into trouble from time to time because of his pranks but was fiercely protective of his friends. We only ever see the second side of the avatar in the movie, the first side is completely forgotten about.

556,libfredumb,The potential is there,5,8 July 2010,"I generally love a film with a good concept. That being said, it seems that something of the story was lost in editing. Acting seemed a bit off, but it probably has more to do with line delivery.They could have worked that out in editing. How much of Star Wars' dialogue was done after the fact in a sound studio? I really want to blame M Knight Shamylan cause I feel he could have said ""cut!"" Someone should have asked ""you really want people to see that?"" Especially after the Happening, which did have decent acting, but didn't go anywhere. I also felt a little uncomfortable watching the fight scenes, which I know is part of a plot device, but the style seems a little alien to me.We must understand that this is based on a popular Nickelodeon cartoon named Avatar. So, don't expect a three hour fantasy.Although most of the acting was bad, I did like Patel. I really love the concepts. I think the film was rushed and didn't develop a theme. It suffers from being only 90 minutes long. Put an hour on that and an extra month or 2 of getting the voices right, and it would have been awesome. but it's a summer release, and just like the transformer movies deadlines and dollars are more important than a quality film. I give this a 5, which means I don't like it, but if it was on TV I wouldn't turn it off.

I was jumping around my house in excitement. In my head i just thought that it's gonna be great to see my favorite cartoon getting a live action adaptation on the big screen. Then i went and watch the movie in the theater.....with 3D!! And what do i get??Such a poor, poor adaptation..Horrible plot line, cringe-worthy acting, poor action sequence. One of the main reason why it has become such a poor adaptation was because they tried to cram 20 episodes into a 2-hour movie. It just seemed so rushed. No character development was shown. But hey, that's just the tip of the iceberg. The acting on the other hand was something else. I'm not sure if it's awkward or embarrassing but it was really bad. I just cringed throughout the whole movie.Oh yeah, when you heard the name Zhao, or Zuko, what kind of people would you think of?? NOT Indian right?? I'm not trying to be racist, but really?? they couldn't find any Chinese or Korean or even Japanese actor to portray the Fire Nation??I understand that they want to keep it diversed, but c'mon!! I remember when i'm about to watch this movie in my head i was just thinking, ""please don't be like Dragonball Evolution, please don't be like Dragonball Evolution..""

I admired the fact that there was an Indian director doing so well in Hollywood. I was skeptical when he was announced as director for an action blockbuster movie but since the anime was so perfect, how could he ruin it? I couldn't have been more wrong.I've watched the anime more than 30 times. It is my all-time favourite show and with this movie, he destroyed all that was good about ATLA. How could a director mess up such a great show this bad? His ego got too big for him, and rather than take responsibility for his blunder he blames the viewing public and critics for not understanding his art of filmmaking.This movie is one of the worst films to ever be made, the worst anime adaptation of all time and an example of bad filmmaking itself. Half the movie is useless exposition, cardboard characters, terrible acting, racial miscasting (I am Indian and was astonished that Shyamalan made the Fire Nation Indian because his ego called for it). It takes 10 minutes for a group of benders to move even one rock, how pathetic is that? This is not art; it's a waste of our time and money.I lost all respect for Shyalaman after this movie. I don't hate him as a human being, but I do as a filmmaker.

The real question is why yes? This is probably the worst movie I've EVER seen. The pacing is just downright wrong, the casting is bad, the writing is terrible, the direction is ridiculously awkward. Neither Dev Patel nor Jackson Rathbone or Nicola Anne Peltz deserved this, neither did Zuko, Katara, Sokka... Also, where's Suki? She's always been my favourite character, right next to Toph, and she was just looked over completely. Where's Iroh? Where's Sokka's humour? And Aang's charisma? Honestly, Yue is the only character that is well cast, sort of.

The film proved to be excellent from the beginning, and when the film ended, I was pleading for just one more hour. The final battle, the Princess sacrificing herself for the continued life of the Moon Spirit Fish, and The Avatar receiving the acknowledgment of both water and fire nations in the north after ""showing the power the ocean holds"" was awesome.This film could have easily continued for two more hours. It was that beautiful. The young actors who played The Avatar and the Prince were excellent throughout, and I am anxiously awaiting Part 2.I am a fan of M. Night Shyamalan. All his films, and his vision in filmmaking grows more unique with every passing year. I Can not think of another film out there like Lady in The Water. M. Night Shyamalan is a great cinematic artist, and I want more from him every year. Looking forward to the announced Will and Jaden Smith sci-fi spectacle.The Last Airbender is an excellent film. Beautiful in every way. This great director does not need to be sent back to film-school: He already holds a very important position in film history.

565,milenkomike79,Just plain horrible....,1,21 January 2011,"If you are a fan of the series or have anything better to casual watcher... do not waste you time on this horrible film.M. Night Shyamalan butchered the hell out of this movie. The story (or) lack there of was very disturbing. First off how are you going to change how the characters, places and things names were pronounced. Second, how can you take different parts of the cartoon series and put them in different order and make a total mash up of everything.Some major characters were left out of the movie. One that really stuck me as odd was to leave out the Kyoshi Warriors! Suki their leader has a pivotal role later on in the series. Places where left out or two places were made into one. Example Kyoshi-Earth Kingdom-Kyoshi Warriors.A lot of major plot lines were left out or totally revamped. Don't get me started on the ""Dancing-kung-fu-like bending."" That was just plain silly. Ha now I really can use Toff's name for Aang....Twinkle Toes. Showing the fire lord, before he was actually shown was a bad idea. In the series you did not see his face until the 3rd book. This is only the first.Also what is up with the ""dragon Sprit"" in 3-4 different scenes, there was none that I can remember from the series. LOL at the look of the spirit world and where was Koh, the face stealer? (Witch by the way played a major role in moving the story-line in ther series) The portrayal of Aang in the Avatar State was laughable at best. He was not as threatening nor did you feel an impending danger when he was transformed. The chacteization form the actors were just as bad. Just to point 1 out is that Aang is a Air Nomad Monk who believes that everlife is sacred and he was a pacifist. He was at mot an out going kid by nature. In the movie he does a 360 and you feel like he loves to fight when ever he could.I could go on and on about how this movie adaptation from the seies was just horrible, butchered and just plain wrong. What was Nickolodeon and the creators of the seris thinking when the let M. Night Shyamalan direct this movie and even then more when they saw the finished product WHY did they distriute it.

569,redninjaboy,Why Are They Making A Sequel??,3,3 November 2017,"...Shyamalan? What were you thinking?I was SO happy to see that there was a movie about one of my favorite shows. ...That I could burn without a care in the world. Where do I begin? Well, the story is basically what you'd expect. Two children of the Southern Water Tribe find an air bender frozen in ice, who's revealed to be the long lost Avatar, destined to save the world from the war going on between the Fire Nation and everywhere else for the past 100 years. He travels the world in search of teachers to help him learn how to bend the four elements so he can defeat the Fire Lord before a comet arrives, which will strengthen their power. And other than the comet never having been mentioned, that's about all that can be said is similar to the show. Aang is a bland little ball of sadness that shows little fun and excitement in all of one scene, Katara cares about Aang as if he's a lost animal rather than someone she grows a strong bond with, Sokka is a huge stick in the mud with ZERO joy, and the Fire Lord, Ozai, is the most boring, not intimidating at all man in the UNIVERSE. Not to mention, they REVEAL him. He's not supposed to be revealed. It's like Sea of Monsters showing Kronos instead of waiting until book five. Ozai is built up in the show until the final season, always kept in shadow. And when he's revealed, you're kind of scared of him. This guy is less intimidating than Sax from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Anyway, Aang goes to the Air Temple he came from, meets Momo, finds out his race is dead, goes into the Avatar State briefly, then gets talked down by Katara. I don't see how, considering little emotion was put into her acting. Then again, the same can be said for everyone's acting. The best done characters in this movie are Zuko, Iroh, and Zhao. Everyone else is bland and does nothing but explain stuff. Though, it IS annoying how Zuko's scar looks like he'd slept on something wrinkly and it left an imprint on his eye rather than an actual burn. And while the effects most of the time are decent, the way they're used is sometimes AWFUL. There's the scene where the Fire Nation are holding a bunch of earth benders prisoner. ...In a camp literally SURROUNDED with earth. Instead of on a metal ship in the middle of the sea where they can devoid them of hope. And when the action finally starts, it's so bad. One part involves six earth benders doing a dance to push a two-foot long rock towards a fire bender at 0.5 mph. Then there's the scene where Zuko busts Aang out of custody as the Blue Spirit. The fight at the end is decent in some parts, but a lot of parts look ridiculous. Like Aang smacking his staff in some directions, like he's playing whack-a-mole as a three-year-old holding a heavy mallet. Or Aang standing around, explaining what something is while the enemies stand around and watch him. Then there's the scene at the end where he lifts the ocean in the Avatar State. It looks... meh. It looks like water's being lifted, but it's also just a wall. And he does nothing with it. Not to mention, the bending itself takes FOREVER at times. Overall, it was a huge disappointment. So tell me, Shyamalan. WHY are you making a sequel? To ruin it further? I bet you're gonna ruin Azula, too. You're probably gonna call her A-zuh-la, aren't you? You called Aang Uhng, Sokka Soaka, Iroh Eroh, so why not call Azula A-zuh-la instead? And maybe she won't use lightning EVER. Or maybe you'll call Toph Tofe. And maybe she'll be a huge stick in the mud, too. Maybe not even blind. Or maybe she'll wear sunglasses. And maybe Mai and Tai Lee won't even be in it. Maybe it'll just be Azula. I mean, Suki wasn't in this one, so it wouldn't surprise me.",The Last Airbender
570,valentinosookroun,It sucks,1,28 November 2017,"Had high hopes for this film. Turns out it was completely horrible, cast, effects, everything was all wrong. Name pronunciations for the characters were all wrong basically, the film was pretty much the entire first season of the animation condensed into a film which was awful. Movie felt like it had a low budget, the creators of the film must not have seen the animated series clearly. How they failed to pronounce the main characters name wrong is beyond my understanding. If you're going to watch The Avatar, don't bother just go watch the animated series, much much better, more character and story development and their names are pronounced correctly !!",The Last Airbender
571,Yngwie_Wittevrongel,The movie that crushed my childhood.,1,18 May 2018,"I grew up watching the cartoon, Avatar : The last airbender shaped my childhood.
I think it's safe to say or at least in my opinion it's one of the best stories you can have to adapt into a movie.
Back in 2010 when i was only starting to be fascinated by movies and didn't know that much about what makes a movie good, to proof this, in my opinon Transformers(2007) was a good movie...Yeah.
But somehow i managed to realize right from the start that this movie was about to destroy my childhood memories.
They took the characters and destroyed them, fire benders all of the sudden needed fire to bend it and not make it out of nothing like we were used to.
There are many ways to explain things but let's take a look at how to do it and how not to do it.Not : The movie, Katara explains everything. You can pull this off but not by just letting her stand up and explain things, this continues throughout the entire movie.
Yes : Show people the things you need to explain or let Bumi do it in his funny way.Characters : 
Bumi : Why did you leave Bumi out?
Sokka : So is he reckless or not? Wasn't he supposed to be Comic Relief?
Aang : No words...
Katara : Wasn't she supposed to be like a caring character instead of just being there explaining things and swapping being reckless with Sokka?
Zuko : Good try by casting Slumbdog Millionair but didn't work, they even gave him hair?
Iroh : Isn't wise like he's supposed to be.Acting :
Just horrible.Typical Cartoon things :
Missing in Action : Agni kai? Cool things? Good Story?All we can ask now is :
Really Shyamalan? Why?",The Last Airbender

Really hoping for a 2nd one to be made, A wonderful cast,Each born for their parts. The characters well defined and the great actors bring out the best in the characters and make them stronger. Has a wonderful presentation with stunning effects. The last airbender has an original and well thought out plot. This works best with real people for me so the cartoon version can never stand up to this M. Shyamalan Movie!.",The Last Airbender
573,golden_dove88,Colonel Shyamalan's Last Stand,2,1 July 2010,"When I heard that M. Night Shyamalan was directing the Last Air Bender I was excited. My favorite director who had started to go down hill over the past few years seemed to have been given a chance to turn it all around. Avatar: The Last Air Bender was an action fantasy with lovable characters and an interesting plot. This could be the 'back to the basic' film he really needed. No way he could screw that one up, I thought, hell he might even make it better.Boy was I wrong. Where do I even start? First, lets do the positive. Most of the actors from cast for the fire nation characters were wonderful. Totally on par. They were the strong ones in the film and deserve way better.Well that's it. The only positive in the sea of negative.The acting quality of the other actors was horrid. Normally I would give a little wiggle room because the lead actors are children, but it was obvious that they needed more work. Aang was either blank faced or had his eyebrows furrowed, Katara lacked warmth, Sokka lacked the humor that his animated counterpart had. In fact the whole film lacked the humor the animated series had. No one was having a good time while making this film, and it showed.The directing was ghastly. Way better in quality when held up to Lady in the Water, but still doesn't redeem M. Night in the slightest. There were a bunch of pointless shots and in one scene it consisted of all super close up shots of the actor's faces. It was rushed, and it was sloppy. These mistakes mirror those you see in first year directing students at film school. Mistakes a director like M. Night shouldn't be making, he knows way better than this.The screen writing was even worst than the acting and directing combined. Dialog was forced, doesn't flow, and is unrealistic. The story was cramped and jumped around. It was a whole season they were trying to condense, it needed to be hacked and slashed then stitched together. M.Night seemed to only do the hacking and slashing and then did little to nothing to smooth over the rough patches. This made the whole film jumpy and confusing. Practically unbearable to watch.The biggest fault with this whole film was the editing. The script didn't help much, but many scenes felt out of order or out of place. Transitions were sloppy and poorly executed. I could go on for days about this but I'll spare all of you the trouble.I'll be surprised if they push on with the live action series after this flop. However the franchise can be revived if there are casting revisions, the editor is sacked, Bryan Konietzko is brought in to write the main screen play, and M. Night gets the ax. If nothing changes and they do decide to go on, nothing good will come of it.As much as it pains me to stay this, M. Night Shyamalan's career is over and this film proves it.",The Last Airbender

576,hola-1,Not Deserved the Bad Rap it is Getting,8,5 July 2010,"After reading so many negative reviews I was very apprehensive about watching ""The Last Airbender."" However, I am glad I saw the movie, event though it is not an excellent movie, it isn't as bad as most critics have stated.Night M. Shyamalan had a vision and you can see such vision very clearly. No, it isn't messy or a train wreck as many has stated. And the visuals are well done. I must clarify that I did not see the movie as a 3D spectacle but decided to see it as a 2D. The cinematography is good and the direction is also well executed.The movie does feel a little bit slow BUT considering the fact that Shyamalan wanted to do a sequel, I can see how he decided to develop the story in such a way that we get to hear a few speeches (and by the way, they are not long nor boring) and give us background story to understand where the AVATAR comes from, as well as to understand his attitude and emotional struggle.It isn't the best movie of the summer so far, not better than Toy Story 3, yet it is better than IRON MAN 2, Knight and Day, and many other resent summer so called ""blockbusters."" The New York Times said it was difficult to create a franchise movie. It is, and it is more challenging to take a beloved and popular cartoon and turn it into an live-action movie.The movie is good and it does not deserved the many negative reviews is getting, many from people who do not agree with the director's choices on casting, story, direction... but at the end, it does give you a satisfaction and does leave you wanting more.The story is not complete, and people who said that ""God should save us from the sequel,"" should simply NOT go and see the sequel. If you don't like the movie, then don't claim to the heavens to ""spare us from another one."" It's easy, don't go see it and you spare yourself.",The Last Airbender
577,maxaschendell,Disrespects the show,1,24 January 2020,"This movie could've been so good if they followed the show better. Almost every character in the movie was nothing like the original version from the show and poorly written.
Let let me start with Aang, or Ong from the movie, in the show he regrets running away and is very selfless, he rode down on a penguin to fight Zuko in the southern water tribe and the only reason he surrendered was to get the firebenders away from the innocent people of the village. In the movie he seems proud of running away and instead of jumping to defend the water tribe he hides away with the elderly and children.
Next let me talk about Sokka, or So ka in the movie, in the show he was a little goofy but a leader and frequently the one to come up with the strategies of the team. In the movie however, he is simply a serious macho guy who appears to be a completely different character and throuout the movie I forget that he is supposed to be Sokka.
I could go on about most of the rest of the characters that appeared in the movie because they butchered every character in it almost to the point of being unrecognizable. Anyone who watched the show know how much the writers and director disrespected it with this movie. Zukos scar, which was a major part of the character due to this representing his lost honor in his fathers eyes was barely visible and zuko himself didn't seem to care about capturing the avatar nearly as much in the movie than in the show. They intentionally scrapped several parts of different characters backstories and points going into who they were to make this movie. This movie failed the show and should never have happened",The Last Airbender
578,nutt-83429,Great Movie!!!,8,6 June 2020,"I liked this movie a lot. The special effects, colors, backgrounds and sceneries were spectacular. The costumes were nice. The music was perfectly matched with the scenes and all. The sound effects were great too. Maybe for some people who are worshippers of the cartoon series, they were disappointed that the movie wasn't exactly like the cartoon. Maybe for the cartoon series worshippers, they were simply mad that the characters in the movie might have done or said something in the movie that their favorite cartoon character wouldn't have. But, for me, I had never watched the cartoon. So, I was able to judge the movie for the movie itself, without having any biases and strong expectations that the movie was supposed to match up perfectly with the cartoon. I can't relate to the cartoon fans' disappointment, but I can understand it. That being said, judging the movie as if the cartoon never existed, the storyline was nice. The scenes had great emotion, and you could feel the intended happiness, sadness, anger, and fear that each moment possessed. I really wish they followed up this movie with a sequel quickly, because the movie ended on a perfect note for another movie to begin on. Also, keep in mind that this is a ""kid movie!"" So, if you're into Oscar winning movies and performances, then don't expect this movie to match up with your preferences.

I have to blame Nickelodeon for letting this fool write, staff and direct. I knew in my soul, he would destroy the film and I knew it would not live up to the greatness that the creators of this series brought to the mini screen (TV). The writing was so bad, the special affects lackluster, and the picks for the characters even worse. Seriously the pale and annoyingly sensitive Katara they chose was getting on my last nerves. Where was her temper? Where was Aang's silliness? Where was Sokka's weird sense of boomerang humor? Seriously - what was with the pronunciations?

583,tsukas_jun,Just horrible,1,4 January 2021,"Shyamalan failed so hard in this live action adaptation of Avatar: The Last Airbender. Don't know why he even decided to make a live action movie if it wasn't going to live up to the cartoon. Did he even give it a full watch from beginning to end?! If so, did he still think it was good enough for all the fans of the Avatar??? I sure hope he's not proud of this horrible film.Casting director Douglas Aibel does a horrible job for miscasting all the main characters. One of the biggest contradictions is Uncle Iroh. Why is he now tall and skinny? He's no longer cheerful or encouraging or funny; he's now that creepy uncle. Why are Katara and Sokka so light skinned? Why is Zuko and fire nation more dark skinned? Douglas Aibel apparently doesn't understand that a live action adaptation should be as close to the source as possible, not making as many stark changes as possible. He failed at his job as casting director. I hope people shamed him on his failed contribution to this movie.Let's overlook the mispronunciations. Were there no acting coaches at all? The acting was horrible and a lot of the line deliveries were super cringe. Did they film each scene in one take and call it a wrap? I actually said ""so. bad."" to myself many times when watching the movie. They had a budget for the filming locations, costumes, and Appa; the least they could do is spend more time on the acting and the delivery of the lines.

He must have gotten all his notes from that one episode :D I fell asleep 20 minutes into the movie. Seriously, the only two characters I liked in the movie were Momo and Princess Azula... why? They didn't say anything. I even think the actor portraying Azula got it right! Aang was terrible. Zuko and Kitara was somewhat passable. A better director could have gotten those two up several notches better.The funniest scene I thought were the six or so mean looking earth benders marching/bending/stomping with all their heart and might, just to send a rock the size of a plate flying slowly thru the air. hahahah What was wrong with the movie? 1. The bending the actors did were too slow, it did not match the resulting special effects of the element being bent.2. The movie was probably 1 hr long. This movie, if it was done right, could have been as good as the epic lord of the rings at 2.5 hrs.3. The most basic elements of the movie were wrong: Poor acting. Terrible dialogue and script. Poor storytelling.4. Pronunciations were even all wrong: Ung? Soak-ahh? Eee-roh? Did anyone from the production team even watch the original series? No one even protested the atrocities? 5. Total botch-up job on the death of Princess Yue. Someone obviously missed the whole point of her sacrifice and failed to impart the message to the audience.6. The actors playing Firelord Ozai and General Zhao even look like twin brothers... what's up with that? They even both look like Raj Koothrappali from The Big Bang Theory...hahahah. Who would get scared of faces like those? First time I saw Ozai on the animated series, he gave me goosebumps. The animated Ozai looked more Chinese than Indian.7. Casting was just wrong. I could go on...but it's better to just list what should be done next: A. Wait for the movie to come out for free on Hallmark.B. Let only 3-6 year olds watch it.C. Reboot the trilogy with a new director and production team and pleeeease consult the creator, and the fan-base.D. I did like ""The Village"" though, but it is clear M.Knight needs a long vacation, and should watch every episode of Avatar (along with all the chosen actors) before he wrote a script for the movie.This could have been big...instead, good material was wasted to make a quick buck thinking the audience would just eat-up crap.",The Last Airbender

589,harryharry-4,What Was He Thinking???,1,10 July 2010,"The Last Airbender, the movie most likely to win the ""Worst Movie of the Year"". Even if I were not a fan of the original series, this movie would still be an atrocity. Lets start with the casting. Noah Ringer, who was cast as Aang, could not have been a worse choice. Though the boy was skilled in the martial arts aspects of the film, he lacked the spunk and child like characteristics seen in the television show. He showed very little emotion throughout the film. Jackson Rathbone, playing Sokka; Katara's brother, could not have been a worse choice. Weather it was the script, which I suspect it was, or the actor himself, he lack the humorous characteristic that was portrayed in the series. Playing Uncle Iroh was Shaun Toub who did an exceptional job showing the caring side of the character.Now, moving on to the script. The script for this movie, was shameful. Throughout the series there were many moving pieces of dialogue that could stir the hearts of the watchers. The dialogue of this movie was dry, boring, and lacking in luster. The special effect were mediocre and slow. Though there was action, it was SLOW action. Now as a fan, I must make a list, and it is LONG, of what the director/producer/screenwriter, M. Night Shyamalan did wrong.  Katara's mother was supposed to be killed, not kidnapped and killed  When Sokka and Katara find Aang they are supposed to be fishing not hunting seal  Aang's tattoos were not blue  Katara doesn't call her grandmother GramGram  Avatar, Aang, Sokka, Iroh, and Agniki are all mispronounced  Bending martial arts is over-exaggerated  Characters King Bommie, Jet, Haru, and the Kyoshi warriors are all missing  Death of Moon Spirit incorrect  Momo was never named Momo  Zhao's side burns were almost non-existent  Azula is supposed to look pure evil  The is not a Dragon Spiriit in the show  Avatar Roku was not introduced  The emotional attachment that Aang shows for Katara is not shown  Sozin's comet is not mentioned till the end of the movie.  The timing of the comet is 3 years away in the movie, and to the end of the summer in the seriesNow, these are just some of the flaws that I found while watching this move and comparing it to the series. A good friend of mine advised me to focus on what was done right. There is only one problem, very little was done right. The screenwriter of this movie is supposed to be a fan of the series, or at least that is what he claimed on the Nickolodeon special that was done on the movie. Now, the question that presents itself is, how in the world, could a fan of the original series, create such a terrible movie based on it. It reminds me of what was done to the movie adaptation of the book Eragon. If you are a fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, then I suggest that you never see this movie, it will only lead to frustration. Now if you have never seen the cartoon, my recommendation is that you still never see this movie.",The Last Airbender
590,shuaibster,MNS hasn't been criticized enough...Awful movie,1,1 July 2010,"EDIT: I tried to watch it again, and almost threw up. The previous review stands. (2014)Wow! Simply put, WOW! I mean talk about having your mind blown into smithereens. I love horrendous acting as well as any other chap, but M.Night, now THIS guy knows how to make it EPIC! But to be fair it was on the first part of the movie that was atrocious in this aspect, the second half was just sad.So UNGH (no joke A-A-N-G is pronounced UNGH), was frozen in a block of ice and Katara and her barely useful brother find him. As soon as they find him, Prince Zuko comes and using bad dialogue makes him his prisoner. How to get to the Uv-vatar (apparently Avatar is pronounced as such)? Use the flying Bison (probably the BEST actor in the entire movie...because he didn't SAY ANYTHING)!! So zuko has daddy issues, why? Well if you didn't watch the series and tried to figure it out from the movies you'd go ""WTF""!? He wants the Avatar to regain his honour.Anyways, Aang, aside from being a terrible actor, find out everyone he knows is dead and wants to take down the fire lord Ozai. But WAIT! He only knows AIr-bending, FLASH forward to a hastily made trip to the water temple where via NARRATIVES he is now learning water techniques but is afraid of his own power (b/c he has emotional build-up). Enter fire nation, ""Capture the Avatar, he is in the water temple far beyond the fire nation and thus out of our power"". This, folks is excessive dialogue.I honestly think M.Night knows NOTHING about writing OR directing a movie. He is a disgrace and has ruined a movie that had SO MUCH POTENTIAL! The series ended for THIS piece of garbage??? For shame. Makes me want to watch the series more so I can forget about this utter and disgusting pile of manure.Final Words: DO NOT PAY for this movie! Don't pay 3D, don't pay 2D! You will thank us for telling you that.

593,Shameless_in_the_shower,What's got into everyone? This is a good movie!!!!,7,11 December 2010,"All of the early reviews I saw of this film were obviously out to get Shyamalan and consequently I put off seeing it for a long time. I only decided to watch it recently as a last resort.All I can say is that I really enjoyed it and really don't understand what all the fuss is about! Okay some of the acting wasn't great, some bad script lines also but no worse than some of the Harry Potter films or anything else from the same category.On the positive there was also some great acting, excellent emotional themes, great fight choreography, beautiful scenery, awesome effects and some truly inspiring moments. From my other reviews you'll see that I'm normally quite critical but today I'm out to critique the critics! I think there's possibly 3 reasons why the film received such a negative critical reception.1.) The Shyamalan Bandwagon Everyone wants to have a pop and find something wrong with his films, why not just watch the film instead, enjoy the story, forget the fault finding.2.) Not watching a fantasy film as a fantasy film Some films, you just have to open up to and let them take you on a trip. If you analyse too much it becomes very difficult to allow the story to take you on an emotional journey. I suspect there was a lot of people who watched this expecting something else! 3.) Avatar fans upset at the film not doing the anime enough justice This is probably the biggest problem area I think. Upset fans always produce the most venomous reactions. All I can say to original fans is that you are very lucky that it wasn't made by the same people who did the Dragonball film! The last airbender is more down the lines of what the dragonball franchise should have become and I'd have Shyamalan direct my beloved Dragonball Z any day!!!

594,WilliamABW,"A few thrills, but awful dialogue",4,7 November 2010,"To say that The Last Airbender is a bad movie mostly because it was not faithful to the source material that inspired it is like saying that The Wizard of Oz is one of the worst films ever created for the same reason. In fact, one of The Last Airbender's primary problems is that it tried to be TOO faithful to the eight-hour first season of the TV series. The Last Airbender takes place in a world where three tribal nations are at war. Each of the nations, fire, water, and earth, has the power to manipulate, or ""bend"", the element the nation represents. The film starts off with two young members of the water nation, Katara (Nicola Peltz) and Sokka (Jackson Rathbone), running into Aang (Noah Ringer), a young boy from the thought-to-be-obsolete air nation. With him is an inexplicably flying bison. Peltz's performance is expressionless and boring; however, most of the fault here lies with the script. Ringer's is decent, and he is also able to show off pretty impressive martial arts later in the movie. The appearance of the flying bison is very random and seems to be only used as a deus ex machina to conveniently get the characters out of trouble. Through some awkward plot developments, Katara and Sokka realize that Aang must be the Avatar, the master of all four elements, who will be able to hold the world in balance, and that he must be protected from Zuko (Dev Patel), the exiled prince of the fire nation, who wants to capture the Avatar to reclaim his honor. Patel, who had given a critically acclaimed performance in the Academy Award-winning picture Slumdog Millionaire, does a pretty good job in this role. Zuko is really the only interesting character in the entire film, being portrayed as a sympathetic, but still menacing, villain. The whole movie is full of bad dialogue and awkward transitions, but the worst part of The Last Airbender is its third act, which takes place during a huge battle of fire and water. Although the special effects are spectacular (the horrible post-production 3D aside), the whole thing seems very rushed and difficult to understand. There is a horribly clichéd and cheesy romance between Sokka and some random water princess. There's that classic line, ""No! There must be another way!"" repeated word-for-word. The reasons for everything happening during the climax, unless you watched the TV series, are indecipherable. Overall, a few thrills, twists, and memorable visual effects don't make up for The Last Airbender's singularly bad script. Although The Last Airbender may be worth seeing, just be sure not to see it in 3D.",The Last Airbender
595,dinoslayer33-1,Fun for someone who never watched the cartoon,8,22 August 2010,"I have never watched the Avatar cartoon so I was anxious to see how this movie would appear to someone who didn't know anything about the 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' universe. Despite all the negative criticism I heard about the movie, I was pleasantly surprised with the movie. To me, the actors were good and the plot was interesting and I am looking forward to the sequel to this movie.The 3D was disappointing though and wasn't well utilized. But I would recommend this movie to someone who hasn't seen the cartoon. But if you are a fan of the cartoon, from what I have heard, you will be disappointed.",The Last Airbender
596,Prodigious1one,"Many needed improvements, but very well intentioned film",7,6 August 2010,"The Last Airbender can be a lot better considering the source material. I think that the director needed to remind himself of the heart of the TV series to remember why the fans like it.Basically, the tone of the film is a bit too serious and the fans are not able to connect enough with the characters. In the second film the characters must be more interesting and they need to display the characteristics of TV series' characters for the audience to like them.Also there were great moments where the actors could have really ""hooked"" the audience with better lines and because of less words or none, these moments are flat in the film. It's unfortunate, because little tweaks like that could have made the film better.Overall, I find the film a good adaptation from the animated series. I prefer not to sweat the small stuff like the races of the actors, because there are even some Black/African people in the movie. Also the races of the characters in the animated series are very ambiguous. Some characters look rather Caucasian and others seem somewhat East Asian.The guru of season two, Book of Earth is definitely Indian, of which ethnic group, I do not know. The king of Ba Sing Se does look decently East Asian as does Mei.Perhaps the film would have been more ""appropriate"" with an all East Asian cast, but I always felt that race was very dubious while watching the TV show or any East Asian inspired anime.The actors in the film are a bit awkward (except Zuko and Iroh), but I had the impression that their lines were ""choked"" for a reason. Like some lines were intended to be added, but were removed at the final moment.In terms of special effects, the film is really good and on point. The visuals and action are good too. Some extra creative things were added, however one thing was a bit too noticeable like the hairy wig that the Blue Spirit wears. I thought that was funny.In general the main plot was followed to make the film. Many episodes of the TV show are not represented in the film, but that's fine, because those little stories only give more detail on the world of Avatar, but don't mean a lot to Aang's success at realizing himself as the Avatar.My score of 7 out of 10 may be too generous for some, but this is based on my belief that the second film will be a lot better than the first. Also my score is based on my opinion that overall the film is enjoyable to watch, it just has quite a lot of missed opportunities that can be made better.I saw the film the first time with my mother who knew nothing of the TV series and has never seen it. She loved the movie and was really ""carried away"" by it. Maybe that was due to the aesthetics and the ""adorableness"" of Nicola Peltz and the actor who plays Aang.I just hope that all the filmmakers will read and watch what the fans have to say and that they will make improvements according to what fans have to say. I think that filmmakers of other beloved original versions like Harry Potter have done the same, because the fans have had tons to say about the discrepancies of the Harry Potter films to their books.Aaron Brown",The Last Airbender
597,rdkitchens,"No, It's not really that bad",8,24 November 2010,"Before I sat down to watch this movie I did not know that there was a children's show on Nickelodeon that this movie is based on. Before I sat down to watch this movie I did not know that M. Night Shyalmananlamanmanmna was the director. I watched this movie with no preconceptions and I greatly enjoyed it. My opinion of The Last Airbender has not changed now that I do know about a kids show that only lasted three seasons and was canceled two years ago, nor has it changed because of its director. Other than some poor acting, mostly by the main characters who were kids with little or no acting experience, this movie was visually spectacular with a great plot. Probably my greatest pet peeve with user reviews and posts on this site is the rush to judgment based on what people think a movie should be as opposed to judging a movie on its own merits. Watch this movie with an open mind and you may be surprised.",The Last Airbender
598,shondaranson,Killed in editing,3,2 July 2010,"I've read a lot if harsh reviews - many valid - and think that they are probably the best part of this movie. I don't mind the pronunciation of the names because they seem less Americanized and more international. My biggest disappointment was the lack of whimsy. This is a fun series that draws readers and viewers into the world, and I feel there was only a glimpse in the film. Sokka and Ihro, who are usually comic relief were stone serious. My kindest guess is that this movie was killed in editing. Some of the scenes that were kept made no sense while important things were rushed through in voice-overs. Who was the audience? If it was for fans, it disappointed. For non fans of the show, it was annoying and confusing. Don't they test these in front of audiences anymore? And whose idea was it to cast Aasif Mandvi as Zhao? I love him in the Daily Show, but I was just embarrassed for him.Because I made my friends see this and they are mad at me, I now have to go to that angst-ridden Eclipse movie. Thanks a lot :(",The Last Airbender
599,Grodandor,Do yourself a favor and watch the show...,1,15 June 2011,"Never in all my years have I witnessed a film try SO little in making a good product. The main problem I find with this movie is trying to fit 24 episodes of a very plot heavy show, and try to cram all the major plot details in it while disregarding all traces of character and storytelling the original source material was so rich in. For example, the movie starts off, before any real dialogue, with Aang being released from the giant ball of ice. In the original show, it gave ample time for the characters to develop. None of the characters are given any time at all to connect with the audience. They have no motivation except for the fact the script say so, and that's what their character did in the show. But, the difference is that the characters were given adequate motivation as they progressed. The characters are boring because they have no development and are acted horribly by the white actors, with brown make-up, who try to pass themselves off as Asian.The film just throws them into a plot and hopes that the audience is entertained by the 1999-quality CGI. Even the action sequences are boring because they are so slow and and poorly rendered. Everything seems so stiff in this movie that not one scene is remotely believable. All in all, this movie has so many problems with it, simply because of the complexity of the brilliant source material makes it un-adaptable. The show is vastly superior and is better worth your time.",The Last Airbender
600,DarkTheater,"Too Short, but still excited for more",6,3 July 2010,"Given the volumes of story in each of the three books, I was expecting nothing less than two and one half hours for Book One. I find it hard to believe the writers couldn't get more than 100 minutes of material from 7 hours of TV show, so I have to assume Paramount and Nick didn't want to spend the money to make this a true epic ala Lord Of The Rings. The concept certainly can support that scale, and the series was very popular, so I'm not sure why they thought they had to turn this into a short ""here today, gone tomorrow"" niche movie. Odd that they chose to mispronounce names, and change names (gran-gran), for no reason. Also odd is including Momo, but not Suki, even if they needed to keep Sokka's relationships to one. Leaving Suki out was made more odd given the fact that they never fully developed the relationship between Sokka and Yue, even though they made her single by eliminating her arranged marriage story. Oh, and where was Ko, The Face Stealer? I was SO wanting to see him make an appearance. Not sure why you want to kill the fan base that inspired the movie to be made in the first place, but hopefully Books 2 and 3 will be better.",The Last Airbender
601,ahsdanimal,Thanks a lot M. Night Shyamalama-ding-dong,1,12 August 2010,"This movie should be called ""How to Turn a Cool Series into a Hideous Wretch of a Movie"" instead of its original title. This movie is just awful on almost all levels. First, there is nothing in the way of plot. The main characters just seem to be wondering around aimlessly until the lame anti-climatic conclusion. Second, the acting was extremely cheesy. All of the new young actors played their rolls like a bunch of teen drama queens. Even Dev Patel, the star of the Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire, couldn't use his acting chops while playing the Fire Nation prince. I really hope that M. Night Shyamalan will abandon his hopes of continuing this saga since he already screwed this one up.

Although I must admit we have never really watched the TV series, so we had no expectations.This movie may not work for adults, as the script, acting and directing was sub-standard, the bashing it has been receiving from reviews on this website has been abit over the top.

It's one enormous bore. The effects got so overplayed. M. Night is an awful writer, he let narration carry major plot elements. Dialogue was stale. Acting was unnoticed. The character names were changed from their original pronunciation from the show which was extremely irritating. Each and every action scene was in slow motion because apparently we're retards that can't follow regular motion so M. Night slowed it down so we can keep up. What a f--- up of a movie. There was nothing nothing at all I liked. I liked the effects, until I kept seeing that same repetition and eventually the effects lost their charm. It in no way does the show any justice.

605,Zoso_pageIV,The Last Airbender = M. Night's Last Movie,4,2 July 2010,"Acting - 3/10 (Zuko was the only non wooden actor) Special Effects -8/10 Action Sequences - 6/10 Accuracy - 4/10 Music - 6/10 Storyline -5/10 3-D - 0/10First off let me say that I am a Huge fan of the Avatar: The Last Airbender cartoon. I would compare it to being a modern day Dragonball Z cartoon series. maybe even better. I love the story, and I have always been fascinated by the character's complexity and many times have contemplated the possibility of bending elements myself:) That being said, when I heard that Avatar: The Last Airbender was going to be a Live Action movie, I flipped. then, a little later, I heard that the announced director would be M. Night Shymalan. This made me cry. I knew of M. Night's reputation since the Sixth Sense and I was deathly afraid of the out coming of one of my favorite series. It is hard enough for a TV series to become a good movie, let alone leaving it to someone who doesn't know how to make movies in the first place. However, seeing the trailers and the awesome special effects gave me hope and I decided to not listen to the many negative speculations and see the midnight release in 3-D. Walking into the theater, I said a prayer for the movie and nervously walked to my seat and slipped on the 3-D glasses. This is not an exaggeration. The 3-D commercial for Megamind was both better in 3-D and overall than the whole Last Airbender Movie. The 3-D was not 3-D. The only scene that remotely popped out was with a fire nation ship. I was expecting fire bending to burn my face and water to splash my seat. The bending not only did not do that, it didn't even appear right in the movie. In the show, the bending is supposed to move with the bender. the element moves as the person bending waves his/her arms. In this movie, the bending was slow, and there was a lot of unnecessary martial arts thrown into it to make it more (cool?)Second of all, the story was RUSHED! it was only a 90 minute movie that covered an entire in depth Season. If I did not know the series, i would probably have been confused beyond belief. It did not spend more than five minutes at a time explaining anything. It jumped from one thing, and across a canyon to the next while you were trying to realize what had already happened. This movie leaves you lost in Death Valley with a gyrating compass and a backwards rising sun. The special effects were actually quite good however, as the water looked very real being bent and the fire was done quite well too. as well as Appa and Momo. The action sequences were only well done in about two instances. The others seemed rushed and awkward. The acting was so wooden I got splinters. Noah Ringer made his first appearance on the big screen in the movie as Aang ( or Ong which also ticked me off) and hopefully this movie series is his last. his acting is on par with a rushed Musical at a Junior High. Overall good special effects, pretty good (but repetitive) music, decent action sequences, terribly put together, and God Awful acting. Save your money, Don't go see it in 3-D. In fact, don't go see it. At all. 4/10 biggest disappointment of the year.",The Last Airbender
606,mardelplata,I'm surprised they put Zuko's scar on the correct side of his face!,1,1 October 2010,"OK, so i watched this movie because although the movie has so many bad reviews i wanted to judge it for myself. But sadly, i have to agree a hundred percent with them now that i too have seen it. They not only tried to fit almost the complete water book into this film, but they did so very inaccurately and poorly. Removing from the story important events and then adding stupid ones that never took place made some of the dialogue seem senseless, especially if you are new to the Avatar: The last Airbender story. They should've picked the right people to play the characters and at least make them resemble the ones from the original Avatar. Not that it would've helped anyway. Another thing, how hard is it to pronounce a word correctly? Uncle Iroh or General Iroh's name is pronounced as I-roh not E-roh, they couldn't even get that simple thing right, and it wasn't the only mispronounced word through out the movie. I'm surprised they put Zuko's scar on the correct side of his face! But i must critique that too, they should've made it look more realistic, doesn't look to me like he was taught that much of a lesson like the cartoon series tells us his father tried to teach him. The fire lord is a despicable person who has no real feelings for anyone, not even his children, and here we see a not so evident almost faded scar on Zuko's face. I would've loved to see the scar more vivid, shave an eyebrow if needed for the sake of the damn character! And how come when Aang is airbending nothing kinda moves around? Everyone's hair and clothes are still. If the director's aim was to butcher the story and bore and anger us TRUE FANS of the original, then he accomplished his goal. If you still haven't seen this crappy movie, i strongly recommend you not to waste your time. Watch and re-watch the cartoon series instead, you will be completely satisfied, i know i am.",The Last Airbender

I think someone just let the camera roll, showed the actors and actresses the markers and then left. I adore the series. My wife and I, (upon leaving the theater) decided that we would have to watch the DVD's of the series at least once completely through to wash out the bad taste of this movie. Don't waste the extra money on the 3D either the effects are far from eye popping. I would say more like eye closing. I normally don't write such harsh reviews, especially with such a young cast (whom I feel very sorry for). I am sure that it was not their fault that they had a lack of coaching, but you can't help but laugh at some of the scenes that are clearly meant to be serious.

The movie is boring leaving the audience sleeping and wondering why they paid 8 dollars for a ticket. The character's names are slaughtered, the 6 year old kid behind me even knew that the names were wrong telling the whole audience each time ""Aang"" not ""Ung"" as pronounced in the movie.

609,ptodegaard,It's fine as long as you don't expect to see the show in movie form,6,3 July 2010,"Before offering an opinion, I'd like to point out that I have never seen the show upon which this movie is supposedly based. All of the reviews I've seen so far have agreed that this movie was nothing like the show, and that the show was better.Although I can't relate to the dislike of The Last Airbender because of it's dissimilarities with the TV show, I can relate very much to disliking movies that are different from the books they're based upon. The worst one in my opinion, I think, is Eragon. The major difference I see between Eragon and The Last Airbender is that Eragon was awful through and through on every front- the acting, the relation to the original story, the dialogue, the character development, the villain, and generally everything else except the special effects.The Last Airbender, on the other hand, had some wooden acting, but not all of the acting was bad, as some other reviews exaggeratedly claim. The dialogue was sub-par, and so was a good 50% of the acting performance, but the story was fine if not taken by comparison with the story in the show, which would be a little unfair in relation anyway because the movie had to compress a great deal of material into two hours.There could have been more action in this movie, and I wish there were, because what action was in this movie was superb. All of the fight scenes boasted top-notch computer generated effects and choreography.Summary: Not a terrible movie! The Last Airbender might differ from the TV show but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Maybe I'm just prejudiced against anime style (I am) but for what it is, this movie isn't bad. 6/10.",The Last Airbender

The suffering, the horror. Watching this movie can make a galloping horse fall asleep. The acting is horrible, child actors overact worse than Jim Carry, adult actors just don't give a damn about it. The dialogs are so woefully cliché that it makes you sick, the speeches make you somehow feel ashamed for the actors. The occasional effects seem pointless like a golden tooth in the mouth of Russian grandpa.The movie begins with a narration about a bad hunting skills of Sokka, which leads nowhere, the appearance of the avatar reveals immediately the poor choice of Noah Ringer as the lead actor, this dude should do anything but act, I mean anything. You want the avatar dead after the first few lines of dialog. Then the story unfolds in such a way that you want it to fold back again, the tempo of the plot is either extremely fast (boom and he can bend water), or painfully boring, useless dialogs. The love story intertwined for a whopping minute and half just makes you wonder what was the director drinking while he was thinking of it. There is not one little thing that you can say that is decent in this ""movie"". The ending pompously promises a sequel, lets join together in prayer to prevent this disaster.",The Last Airbender
611,matt-710-428307,CONTAINS SPOILERS: 12 Things I Liked About the Crappy Airbender,2,7 July 2010,"I love the Peabody Award winning Nickelodeon cartoon, Avatar: The Last Airbender, created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, with head writer Aaron Ehasz. I hate the movie adaptation The Last Airbender, written, directed, and produced by M. Night Shyamalan. I could give ample reasons for both positions, but many fans and critics have done both ad nauseam.Instead, I'm going to do something a little shocking -- perhaps even to myself: list 12 things I like from Shyamalan's massacre of my favorite show. Odd as it may sound, this is a form of therapy to help me reconcile the intensity of the love/hate warring within me. (What can I say? I'm a middle-aged geek fanboy. I must embrace it, lest it destroy me.)Here goes (caution -- SPOILER ALERT... as if anything could spoil that wretched waste of celluloid):1. The opening scene is obviously filmed on a real glacier, not a CGI set. Looks suitably impressive.2. The Air Temples display an interesting mash-up of architectural influences -- Indian, Cambodian, Tibetan -- with dash of pure fantasy.3. The Training Circle in the Air Temple. A key fight scene takes place in what Aang calls a ""training circle"" surrounded by carved wooden panels that move with airbending. It shows that Aang in his native element. Sadly, like every fight scene in the movie, it suffers from sub-par choreography, but it's still fun to watch.4. The flashbacks of Aang in the Air Temple. They are brief but they work to show that Aang's childhood was a happy one that ended too soon. It's also the one place where Shamaylan's supposed ""colorblind"" casting actually seems to be evident -- with Monk Gyatso as a Polynesian Islander and the airbending students a fair cross-section of global faces. 5. The pendant worn by Monk Gyatso, which identifies his remains in a critical scene, was given to him by Aang. He says so, and we see it in a moment of flashback. A simple touch that adds some honest pathos.6. Appa and Momo look good. They have very little screen time, but when you do see them, they're pretty cool to look at. The quick glimpses leave you wanting more, not bored by them. Good call. Oh, and the Dragon in the Spirit World. A little baffling for non-fans (he's certainly meant to represent Avatar Roku), and he says dumb things, like everyone in the film, but he does look very cool.7. The Fire Nation ships are fantastic. Big, steaming, black iron behemoths that resemble an evil cross-breeding of battleships and luxury yachts. The way they belch polluting smoke that looks exactly like the underwater footage of the Gulf oil gusher is downright eerie.8. While I hate the portrayal -- especially coming from Cliff Curtis, an otherwise fine actor -- the Fire Lord's costume resembles a Roman Centurion's chest piece rather than an East Asian emperor's robes. Even the palace sets and/or locations strike me as more Greco-Roman than Oriental. Comparing the Fire Nation to imperial Rome? Interesting.9. Aang's waterbending combat with soldiers. It's so, so, very almost awesome. The odd miscues in the timing. The fast/slow motion switching that just doesn't click. The effects that miss syncing to the action by just a hair. Ahhggh! Infuriatingly close to a classic movie scene.10. Kitara and Zuko water-fire fight. Again, it just ain't good, but there are a few fleeting moments that really suggest what could have been. It's hard to hate Nicola Peltz. She's cute as button and does nothing except say the dumb lines Shyamalan wrote for her. There's a second where she stares down Zuko with such fear and determination mixed in her face that you realize the kid might actually be able to act if someone gave her half a chance.11. Zhao publicly insults Zuko. Comedian Aasif Mandvi -- who's Daily Show work I like just fine -- is sadly laughable every second he's on screen as the villainous Commander Zhao. At one point, he gives a toast that first flatters then eviscerates Prince Zuko. In Mandvi's hands, it is a lousy scene. But imagine it with a better actor. Imagine it with Jason Isaacs, the best movie villain working today (who, incidentally, does the voice of Zhao in the cartoon). That would rock.12. Last, but not least: Noah Ringer. Yeah, yeah... I know. He's wooden. He's a sourpuss. He says dumb things. He ain't Asian. Screw that. None of that's the kid's fault. He looks the part. Round head, big ears, saucer eyes. He looks anime, which (as Shyamalan correctly pointed out) is a racially ambiguous illustration style. He's got very respectable martial arts moves. When he's permitted to crack a smile he seems, well, likable. Like Aang. Such a crime a director renowned for launching young stars decided to go AWOL on this newcomer. I feel for you, Mr. Ringer. M. Night may have disappointed the fans, but he really done you wrong. I hope you get a much better first experience next time.I can think of one or two other interesting tidbits, but I don't want to dwell too much on the microscopic good in the film. Overall, it was a shameful, amateurish hack-job from a has- been auteur who has lost all ability to think like an audience. I hope The Last Airbender - Book Two: Earth gets made. I hope M. Night Shyamalan has nothing to do with the project.",The Last Airbender

Geez, even with all the criticism, any semi-intelligent sane person would give this at least 3 stars out of 5. This was a fun movie, saw it in 2d, and the people were clapping in the end. That said, it could have been longer, involve more story-telling and character build-up. The screenplay was amazing, and the story-telling was quite superior since so many episodes had to be fit into the mere 90+ minutes. Shyamalan always puts in a good amount of depth in his movies, and so they probably do not appeal to the intellectually-challenged.

I really loved the show but this movie killed my expectations,The Last Airbender when I was in the theater today was a murder of a show I love, it was almost as bad as Dragonball Evolution, which was DragonBall Z's equal in terms of butchering perfect series. The only actor that was the most in character was Dav Patel surprisingly because he was not a bad Prince Zuko which surprised me. But that was not enough to save the movie because it was a fail since I first heard Aang, Sokka and Uncle Iro's names butchered. Just hearing their names pronounced differently was enough for me to know that this adaptation was a failure. So much left out also the characters were out of sync with their characters.

615,betzstump,What a terrible adaptation of a fantastic TV series!!!,1,3 July 2010,"Having been a huge fan of the Avatar series on TV, and having seen all three season and owning all three DVD box sets, I must say this adaptation is terrible.Let's start out by saying that there is 10 hours of original programming in the first season (20 half hour episodes). Yes, you can't make it a 4 hour movie, but still, there was so much done wrong.First of all, the pronunciation of the names was most jarring. It's Aang, as in rhymes with bang and rang and tang. Not Ong, as in rhymes with bong. And it's Sokka, the first syllable is pronounced like ""sock"", not ""soak."" And it's Iroh, pronounced ""eye-row.""Second, there was no levity, no humor. There were a couple points where there was some hint at levity, but otherwise submerged under a sea of ""taking myself too seriously for my own good."" In the TV series, Aang is a bit of a trickster and Uncle Iroh down plays what a master strategist he is by poking fun at himself and hints at his slight hedonistic streak. Gone. It's was all too serious.Third, Sokka, he is the meat and sarcasm guy. Where was the sarcasm??? Where is his fixation on food? Yeah, he showed he's good at strategy, but where was the sarcasm? There was an opportunity to bring it into play when Aang could have introduced Appa, his flying bison, which Sokka quips, ""And this is Katara, my flying sister."" Which leads to the lame introduction to the concept that Appa flies. That was just too painful to watch. I winced.Fourth, Admiral Zhao had no subtlety. He telegraphs to the audience he's going to kill the moon spirit. Uh, who ever wrote it that way, thanks for killing all the suspense. You can't give everything up front. It ruins the surprises later on in the movie or the sequel. But I guess how poorly this one was executed, I'd be surprised if there will be a second one.Fifth, Aang controls his ability to enter the Avatar state. WTH? That cuts out the guru in the next movie. That cuts out the whole chakra scene and all the past baggage Aang has to let go and reflects on.Sixth, the stories flows and stays as much to canon as someone who read the cliff notes and was distracted and not paying attention to major plot points that are later revealed in Book 2: Earth and Book 3: Fire.Seventh, Avatar Aang spares the Fire Nation Navy - which in the TV show he destroys. No, he's not possessed by the Ocean Spirit as in the TV series. Zhao is not killed by the Ocean spirit. He dies, just not like in the TV series. It was the Ocean spirit who killed the man who killed the Moon spirit. That takes away so much of the symbolism and story behind the climax.Eighth, they imprison the Earth benders in a dirt lot. Nope, not in a metal prison in the middle of the ocean like in the series, which makes sense when you want to keep Earth away from Earth Benders. Brilliant. May I please bang my head some more?Ninth, dialog. This goes back to script. The script and dialog paced and plodded along like a 15 year old doing a fanfic rehash of the first season, but wanted to, short of out right plain of word for word plagiarism, just tweaked it a bit. And tweaked it badly.Ten, the action. Yes, let one actor stop fighting in order to watch another actor fight more Fire Nation soldiers. Bad fight choreography, bad, bad, BAD direction. Eleven, there is no camaraderie developed between the character. By the time they reach the Northern Water Tribe, they should have bonded. There was none.Twelfth, the romance between Sokka and Princess Yue. In the TV series, we find out she betrothed and we see Sokka's heart break. Then Sokka loses her at the Sacred Pool. We feel Sokka lose her a second time. In the TV series, I cried. In the movie, all the tension that would keep them apart yet they still yearn for each other is gone, lost! When he loses her in the movie I am not moved. The romance was lacking as there was no tension. Where is the reference that's he's just a Southern Tribe peasant and she's royalty?I think I'll stop with twelve, since I don't think I have the energy to carry on.To boil it down, if you have seen the series, don't see the movie, you will be terribly disappointed.If you have not watched the TV series, you might enjoy it more, but do not think the TV series is this equally mediocre. Instead, go rent/buy season one of the TV series. The TV series is well fleshed out with good character development, covers things like loss, shame, love, courage, bigotry, honesty, and many more themes.And to top it off, my 6 year old daughter this morning said, ""I want to watch Avatar. The real Avatar, not the suckish one. There were a lot of parts of the movie that were missing.""My suggestion? HIRE STEVE KLOVES TO DO THE NEXT SCRIPT. He knows how to take a complex story with lots of details and not ruin it.",The Last Airbender

All three of us are huge fans of the Avatar cartoon series, and even my daughter walked out of the movie disappointed and listing numerous ways M. Night screwed-up the story. I suspect she would have done a better job remaking the animated series into a live film.I'm not sure it would be possible for anyone to mess the story up more, without it being intentional!There was no depth to the characters. The storyline felt like you were watching Cliff Notes (if you haven't seen the cartoons you won't have a clue why they're doing most of what you'll see in the film). All of the humor and charm of the story was sucked right out. He even felt compelled to take ""artistic license"" with the pronunciation of the characters' names! How the hell do you ""interpret"" the names differently, when you're remaking an animated series!?I'd love to see the other books made into movies, but take them out of M. Night's control.

And what happened to the character of Aang? There was no joy in his rendition. Aang was portrayed as dark and humourless. No wanting to ride the backs of giant Koi, or anything that made Aang the way he was.If you have seen the cartoon, don't subject yourself to this brutalization of a wonderful story.If you have not seen the cartoon, skip this movie and watch the cartoon instead.

619,m-spanberg,A whole lot of nothing.,1,9 July 2010,"Okay, so I'm a huge fan of the animated cartoon Avatar: The Last Airbender and as soon as I found out that it was going to be adapted into a live action movie, I sensed that it was going to be bad.I was completely wrong. It was just utterly awful.It lacked feeling and a nice pace. Even though I've watched the cartoon numerous times, I had to think to understand what was happening. It was confusing, boring and I felt absolutely NOTHING for the characters. Speaking of the characters - they were NOTHING like in A:TLA. Bad, stiff acting that just made me cringe, stupid plot and unnecessary changes.The last 20 minutes I was literally just sitting and counting down the minutes. I wanted it to stop, right away. Stop the awful butchering of an awesome series, M. Night Shyamalan! If I had not been a fan, I wouldn't have understood anything. Why are they going there? What is an Earth Kingdom? Why are they flying on a giant furry mat with creepy, slimy legs? WHY IS THIS MOVIE SO RIDICULOUSLY BAD?! They spent no time explaining any of the universe, any of the characters, mentioning anything important. And the plot was changed for the worseX1000000 times. Seriously.Ugh. Sorry for the rant, but as a fan...this is a total disgrace! And I'm not even mentioning the horrible pronunciation (Oong? Soak-ah? Ear-oh?!). Whoops, I think I just did.The only thing that was okay was, well...the effects were decent.^^ If you're a fan; do NOT watch this movie unless you want to see an amazing series get slaughtered to the ground by a lazy director. And if you're not...please do not watch this and get the wrong impression of the lovely animated series!Avatar: The Last Airbender series by Michael Dante Dimartino and Bryan Konietzko = Awesome. The Last Airbender Movie by M. Night Shyamalan = Epic fail.",The Last Airbender
620,s_care,"""WHY?"" is the big question",4,26 July 2010,"""WHY?"" is the big question. Why does Night Shyamalan does this to the movie goers each time. If this was his attempt to win back his estranged audience, he should try harder the next time. Messing up with original ideas is one thing; but, adapting a world famous TV series and THEN messing it up takes a lot of talent! Against the backdrop of a weak storyline, performance was the biggest shocker, closely followed by the direction. The 'human element' in the movie was so expressionless and staid that Shyamalan could have done much better with some computer graphics. Precocious Aang appears more like a naive school kid. Dev Patel looked out of place, so did Jackson Rathbone and Cliff Curtis. In fact, the entire cast looked confused. The settings and special effects failed to reach the epic proportions of the original work and seemed rather grim. I haven't seen the 3D version, but can certainly say it won't do any wonders either. In line with various other reviewers, I would suggest, if you really wanna watch this, wait for the DVDs.For Shyamalan, taking into account the fate of this part, he should seriously consider dropping the sequels.",The Last Airbender
621,kgwithana,"You're kidding me, right?",1,10 August 2010,"I can tell you before watching this, I read some of the reviews posted on here and I was thinking 'why is it so bad?' So then I figured to watch it for myself and it was then I found my answer - everything makes The Last Airbender bad! Everything - the plot, the direction, the acting! This movie was just so aimless!! So yeah I said the storyline was one of the contributing factors so I'll explain on that;;;; there was just no concept! It was just so bland, the plot just aimlessly dragged throughout the movie by without trace of meaning whatsoever. In fact to be honest - the whole film just felt like a delusional mixture of paranormal events just slotted together...The acting was another thing I mentioned... just... let's just call it *horrendous.* You could almost just dose off... it was just the plain he said, she said. And another thing that bugs me was the 'accent of the people'. How the hell can a brother and a sister who lives in the middle of Artic could possibly can an American accent?!! And the boy... just don't get me started on him...Continiung from that is the casting?!! Not trying to be racist but almost 98.9% of the film have Indian actors in it?! Dev Patel? You serious?!! The shy apprehensive boy from Slumdog Millionaire playing a bad guy?? Wow... very realistic! Plus the effects! Pointless!! This film was supposed to be in 3D (I saw it in 2D) but can it be possible to have a film with dreadful effects to have a worthy 3 dimension display??? You just take a look for yourself... No just kidding - DON'T SEE IT IN 3D! YOU'LL JUST BE WEARING SUNGLASSES! In fact, just don't see this film at all! You'll thank me later... ^__^Overall what a train wreck of a movie The Last Airbender was!! I thought Mr Shyamalan could pull it off! I mean after the amazing Sixth Scene I had high hopes but after watching this all I can say is.....What happened Mr Shyamalan? :(",The Last Airbender
622,mc_ar,"No, just no. A million times no!",1,25 August 2010,"While i have to admit, that the special effects were pretty well done, thats about all that was good in this movie.The characters are generic cardboard cutouts. No soul in them, i found myself to even hope someone to die, only so something i didn't expect would happen.The movie follows a random selection of episodes from the series. It was very confusing to watch as someone who knows the series. Every scene is something totally different and is quite a few episodes apart from each other.The entire story was rushed beyond comprehension. Oneliner serve as transition starters. ""Hey, i remembered that (random statement here"" and off they go. Even a 12 year old could figure out a better way.And i really had a hard time to keep myself watching this movie. At times i even covered my eyes, i felt so ashamed of the script, that i couldn't bring myself to watch it.My conclusion: The Series was butchered with a wooden cooking spoon. Avoid at all costs, you will not get those 100 minutes of your live back and trust me, you will wish for them back.",The Last Airbender

I was almost scared because of the bad critics, but then again I was waiting to see the movie, I went with a friend of mine that had only heard of the series and both liked this movie. It not a bad movie. The music is good, the costumes are good; Dave Patel did it great, the landscapes are good, the special effects are good. Remember this is an adaptation; a ""movie-verse"" is you want, a lot of these critic are exaggerating, judge by yourself, enjoy the movie and watch it for fun.It may not be the movie of the year but is not a waste or money nor time, it is an OK movie.

I did not watch the series, and I know how die hard fans of a series can be particular so I do understand why some of them may have been disappointed if the movie was not up to their standards.However I thought the movie was fantastic. The scenery was brilliant, the special effects were on point, and the acting was very believable. I appreciated the fact that they used new actors instead of the same ones we see all the time. I also enjoyed how M Night shot the film which is what I think may have thrown some people off. I can't wait to see the next one, and hope it is sooner than later.

His expression of anger - can't understand whether he is showing anger or just about to crying. Please make the next sequels with different star-cast & DIFFERENT DIRECTOR And the direction is no good nor the location. Those who created this movie really spoil of really good story, and good animation series.For this movie I don't wanna give any point (not possible) for being worst movie.",The Last Airbender

And lo and behold i was right, this movie was one of the worst reenactment's of a anime/cartoon series i have ever seen. the only reason i am giving it 3 stars as oppose to 1 is because the effects where pretty good. My biggest problem with this movie was that they changed things that did not needed to be changed like the way some of the names where pronounced and the fact that Aang had trouble with water bending (which he did not) in fact if i remember correctly there was a episode in the first season that was based around the fact that Aang picked up on water bending faster then Katara did when she first started. I understand that some things need to be changed because of time etc but some of the changes where not necessary and i continue to ask the question WHY? Finally the acting was so bad that i could have done a better job playing some of the characters AND I CANT ACT FOR S**T.",The Last Airbender
627,itjstagame,Awesome movie!,8,16 November 2010,"I haven't seen the series and have been wanting to see the movie, it did not disappoint me at all. I thought it was amazing, the story and effects were astounding.Maybe if I had seen the series and noticed the change in movements to powers and different races, etc then this would be a problem, but how can anyone feel it was confusing? The story basically just develops as we, along with the other characters, learn who Aang really is and how important that is.Yes, I would have loved a bit more back story from Aang or more exposition, instead of him just announcing he's the Avatar and inciting a rebellion I'd like to know more about his inner struggle and where he finally decides he can't stand for this anymore. In the movie it's almost strange where he has no care and is sad about his Air Nomads and then suddenly he's angry and wants a rebellion. And then suddenly we're in the Water Nomads area, somekind of sequence of Aang reuniting and their travels (it would have taken only 2 mins) would have been nice.Otherwise though I feel for anyone just coming in to the series that it is not confusing and the characters are great and effects amazing. I really feel it's a solid 8 and it saddens me how 'in cahoots' the critics are. You know for a fact that Ebert has never seen the animated series and he's talking about flat dialogue and crap, how could Iron Man or even Avatar get such amazing praise and this be crap. The reviewers sounded like they didn't even really know what they were saying but didn't want to get bad reviews themselves for saying what they really felt.Oh well, I thoroughly enjoyed it and it left me really hanging for a sequel.",The Last Airbender
628,i-killed-westley-dodd,um...yeah i got a question...WHAT?!?,2,23 February 2011,"First off i'd like to say that i have watched the TV show since the beginning and i love it. The only reason it has taken me this long to write a review is because i haven't been able to face this sight, simply depressing. But anyway when i found out about this movie coming out a couple years or so prior to release i was ecstatic. I saw the movie at midnight opening day, and from the first mispronounced name to the last poorly done battle scene i felt insulted. M. Night put nothing into this movie, he even said that he planned on releasing one of his own original movies in between each Avatar release. This means that M. Night figured that The Last Airbender would do just fine in theaters based purely on TV show fan base, so he wouldn't have to put much effort into filming the last airbender, WHICH IS EVIDENT! I pray that they will cancel any sequel to this movie, Book 1 was a big enough slap in the face and i don't believe i could handle seeing M. Night ruin something else i love.M Night cut and spliced this film to death, he substituted character development and substance with fighting montage and Katara voice-overs. Just because Avatar is a kids show, doesn't mean that only kids watch it. Avatar is highly evolved with its character, and story development, M Night couldn't keep up with this. Even seeing all 20 book 1 episodes over and over and over again, i felt confused at times in this movie, so i cant imagine how someone new to the show could follow the last airbender. And where was the comedy, if you've seen the TV show you know what i mean. Night made almost no attempt to portray the group as funloving but serious kids, the whole movie made them seem stone faced. Sokka made none of his classic jokes, aang played no pranks, and im left wondering what could've been if Nickelodeon wouldve just picked a different person to take the reigns. I pray that this movie will never be seen by anyone again.The parts Night decided to use and not to use befuddled me. I understand that you cant fit 2o over 2o minute shows into a movie for theaters, but you also don't have to try to fit it into under an hour an a half. Make The last airbender around 3 hours long, make it an epic like LOTR. It seemed like Night tried to touch base on every episode just a little bit (except for Kyoshi) when he really just needed to spend the first half on building characters (only the first few episodes on TV) and then the last half of the movie on the final battle scene (being part 1 and 2 of the northern water tribe).Did you know Night had never even watched the show until being offered to direct? There are so many directors and producers out there, it took skill to find someone that could manage to screw up Avatar. And acting? Seriously, Noah Ringer (Aang) was chosen just for his martial arts, he took acting classes AFTER BEING OFFERED THE PART! And Dante Basco wouldve made a great zuko. I wont even get started on the other terrible role decisions. But after all is said and done it really wasn't the actors fault.Only see this movie to better your understanding of awful cinema. If you actually want to be entertained, please i implore you to watch the TV show, and tune in for their upcoming show KORRA!",The Last Airbender

630,grella713,M. Night Shyamalan must have NEVER seen the series.,1,29 June 2011,"I am a BIG fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, I was excited to watching, and I understood that they're not going to be able to fit everything in one little movie, but this, this movie was an embarrassment. There were so many IMPORTANT parts missing, heck, the Firebenders didn't rely on the sun to do there bending in this movie, which is incorrect, and I don't see how they will be able to make the third one because of this problem, because Firebenders rely on the sun in the original series. Worst of all is that the character's personalities were all missing, in the series I feel in love with the character because of there personalities, but these characters from the movie where nothing like original, I especially missed Sokka's goofy personality, in this movie he was 100% serious and not goofy one bit, it wasn't even Sakka at all, he was pretty much the opposite, and every character's personality was just wrong. And last, so many names were pronounced wrong. Aang was pronounced wrong, and I'm pretty sure Sokka's was too, and just a view others, but Aang's was the most annoying one because of how often it was said. I did not like this movie at all, the only thing I found impressive is the special effect which I can care less about. I do not plan on watching the other ones. I will stick with the cartoon, because that one is 100% full of awesome and probably one of the BEST shows ever made. It is obvious to me that M.

I am disappointed at the critic response to this movie as i don't believe they have truly seen what Shyamalan is trying to do: it is obvious that he is trying to bring the legend of aang to an older audience by giving a more darker feel with less humour that we grew to love in the cartoon series. i think people need to watch this film without always criticising it because of how fantastic the cartoon was. we all knew that a real life version of aang would not be the same so why are we disappointed about it, this film has done all it could in the hour and a half it screened to depict the story of the 20 episodes in season 1 of the cartoon which runs for a total of around 7 hours.in review i think the film deserves an 8 out of 10 because i feel that the darker feel of this film kept me entertained because those are the kind of films i enjoy. i would suggest that anyone who hasn't seen the movie should watch it without the cartoon in mind and pretend you know nothing of aang's story (or maybe you just don't)and watch it more as a fantasy adventure rather than as an adaptation of a TV classic, maybe you'll enjoy it like i did.",The Last Airbender
632,ConfusingCheshireCat,"(SPOILERS) Missed a few marks, hoping sequels will improve.",2,1 July 2010,"I went into this movie hoping the story wouldn't be weighed down by battle. I had hoped that the fun lovable characters from the show would translate spectacularly on the live screen. The Last Airbender, though visually entertaining, could have used some refining.The movie itself seemed choppy. From the very beginning we as an audience are expected to retain every single detail spelled out about what is going on in this world, while trying to get to know the characters. Had I not been so distracted trying to digest the heavy information, I would have been mad at the lack of character development.Prime example, Soka. Oh I had such high hopes for a good Soka. I was so excited at the promise of a fun-loving comic relief. Sadly I was let down. I couldn't count one instance where Soka was allowed to be funny ol' sarcastic Soka. It was so disheartening to have to put up with a stiff Soka, I almost thought my eyes had blurred him into a wannabe Katara.Katara on the other hand was, I felt, an exceptional adaptation. And what about Aang? Well, he was sort of following in the path of stiff-Soka. It's only in his flashbacks where we actually see a kid being a kid. Zuko and Iroh were probably the only characters I was blown away with. I wish the main trio could have gotten the same chance to show such caliber of development as Zuko and Uncle Iroh. This movie could have been so much better had we seen the trio getting to know each other -like normal humans. Not to sound too 'by the book,' but I would have appreciated at least one scene where the kids were just killing some time at camp. This is where we get to know them in the cartoon, and it certainly could have helped the movie. 5 minutes could have done the trick. There are plenty of unnecessary scenes that completely throw a 'wtf?' moment at you, that the editing is borderline annoying.I tried so hard to love it for what is was, but I left the theater a wee-bit let down. As someone who has seen the series, I was totally baffled at how difficult it was to digest where the movie was going. It made me wonder how anyone who hasn't seen the series was supposed to be enthralled by what was going on.Visuals and scenery were fantastic, although I can't speak too highly about the 3d factor -save the extra 3$ to buy popcorn and see it 2d. The score was too epic and melodramatic throughout the entire film. I just wish this movie was handled with more care -doesn't Avatar deserve it? I think maybe M Nite (spelling?) took too many liberties with this one -which is exactly what I was afraid of. The overall product was just begging to be cleaned up.",The Last Airbender
633,travistime22342,"Go watch the series, ignore this.",1,28 June 2012,"Avatar: The Last Airbender was one of the greatest and most well-told stories in the television and animation medium. Naturally, someone saw an opportunity to make a sure-fire success of a movie. Now, whenever an adaptation is made, creative liberties have to be made, but there is a kind of jurisdiction that it must remain in. M. Night took this and ran out side of it, sprinted away in farthest direction and left all respect for the source material at the door. When you slop together a pathetic script, a horridly untalented cast, and forget your fantastic sources, you get one of the worst films ever made. The story is paced as though the productive team wanted to make the audience as uncomfortable as possible. A similar thing is done with the cast. The director seems to think what we want to see is forced, miserable lines that are all monotone and lacking of any sort of spirit. Even in the moments of the want-to-be gut-wrenching finale, the actors all look bored as if they just want to go home. And the bending. Oh god, the bending. In the series, each element is based off of a style of martial arts, and the element and the bender are connected in each movement that's made. In the film ""adaptation"" bending is an overly complex series of dance moves that cause little interaction with the respective element. The most notable is that a firebender must be around fire to use it, which, as any fan of the series knows, is total bullsh-t. This is thoroughly expressed when Iroh creates fire and the soldier flee in disbelief. It will cause any fan to shout out ""that's what fire bending is SUPPOSED to be."" All in all, this is absolutely horrendous. If you haven't seen either the movie or the show, but are interested in the premise avoid this and head straight for the cartoon. You will not be disappointed.",The Last Airbender

Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender. This atrocious piece of crap is based on an awesome,American anime series. I've only watched a few episodes, but they are much better compared to this. The anime had likable characters, the characters in this movie are so one dimensional and the acting in disgraceful, I've seen better acting in a school play. And the dialogue is just laughable. If M. Night Shyamalan was trying to make a comedy, he did a great job. I can't believe he expects us to take it seriously.What was he thinking?! The pacing in this movie is so rushed and nothing makes sense. Another thing I wanna talk about is M. Night Shyamalan's career. What happened to you M. Night Shyamalan? The sixth sense was one of the best films I ever watched, so how did you get so low M. Night? I'm very worried about After Earth now, at least M. Night Shyamalan hasn't got complete control over it this time. M. Night should be ashamed of himself, but I hope after earth will turn out good.",The Last Airbender
635,kooemi375,Terrible Inaccurate - Didn't Follow The Series AT ALL,1,20 July 2012,"I'm giving this movie a 1/10 because it was just so utterly terrible. I, for one, am typically a very open person when it comes to movies, and I can usually like a movie that everyone else hates. I hated this movie, and I did watch all of it and was quite excited to watch it.The thing that I disliked the movie about the most was the way that they changed the characters. Katara is meant to be incredibly stubborn, kind of whiny, and hopeful. Above all else she is supposed to be a strong character. She was a very weak character in this movie. Sokka... he didn't crack a smile, or joke or really anything positive in this. The only thing that probably got him spot on was his commitment to the fight, because he DID want to get to the Northern Water Tribe quickly. But they pronounced his name wrong! That's what made me angry - I mean, if it was a book, and you never got the pronunciation, then I get if you change how you say the name. But when it is a TV series, you have no excuse. And Aang, he was in NO way fun loving or carefree, which is what he represented. And again, they changed his name. I was fine with his actor, visually anyway. Zuko was terribly casted - his actor was terrible, and he is supposed to be extremely pale. Plus he's supposed to have a ponytail. I thought Yue was pretty good. Visually at least.Something that got on my nerves the most was that there was NO connection between Aang, Sokka, and Katara. By the end of the 1st book, they were friends - practically family. I just didn't see that.Another thing that bugged me was the bending - You don't need that many moves just to do a small burst of fire, or water.All in all, it was a dreadful movie, and I wouldn't recommend paying to see it.",The Last Airbender
636,dahurlburt,"Great theme, I feel empowered, similar to the force",9,28 August 2013,"I really liked the movie in all its simplicity.Plot moved right along which to me seemed to keep the focus on it more than the characters, which I believe is a strength in this sort of movie.The editing is where I saw a lot of the movie go right and by that I reference my first comment in saying it moved the story right along and really kept me interested in the power of the elements. I've watched the movie about four times and get a really nice feeling every time, hard to explain but I will add it up to the simplicity of the plot which like water, the focus, I thought the movie flowed well. I'm not one to re watch many movies so I find this one special in that I've been able to enjoy it four times over a three year period. I guess I reference the original Star Wars in the same way. I think it would be hard to say that the characters in any of ""the original"" Star Wars movies are greatly developed. I think if they were it would be harder to put yourself in their shoes. Yes, Star Wars is another rare movie I have no problem watching every few years. One last note, no I have never read nor watched anything on the Avatar, so maybe that helped me accept it all from it's own view. Thanks.",The Last Airbender

WAS THAT THE MOVIE?""!! My ten yr old daughter said she liked the effects but what happened to the story? Even she could see that this movie was not complete. Shame on you M.Knight for messing with a great animated show like Avatar. We found ourselves explaining to people in the movie theater lobby what was missing and just told them to rent the DVDs and they would understand it all better. I know that was the only way we did if we hadn't we be just as lost and confused as they were.

638,RPI_engineer,Unacceptably awful and even unprofessional,1,23 July 2013,"While the film does have its perks -- the dramatic transition music, the cinematic scenery, the ""real"" bending, it does not take long to see that the film is in almost every way flawed. Despite the movie's attempt to bring out clearly explain the plot (that is, exposition at the expense of everything else), the expository plot is still so incoherent that fans are left disappointingly confused and newcomers almost completely lost. Yes, covering the entire first season (~8 hours) content in ~2 hours is a real challenge and its understandable if some details are left out. However, the film crew could have made sure that that the information provided coherently flowed which would allow the the plot to be at least clearly comprehensible. Unfortunately, they didn't even do that. And without a solid plot, what hopes for covering the Eastern philosophies and proper Bending choreography (the icing of the cake if you know what I mean)?Now for the Causasian and Indian casting issue -- its not racism or even wrong but rather the clearest indicator from the entire film of Shyamalan's incompetence and stupidity as a director. Given the popularity and appraisal of Avatar TLA, you think it would have been IN HIS BEST INTEREST to keep characters appearances and ethnicity in close resemblance to those in the TV series. However, he apparently thinks otherwise as he goes even so far to make Gyatso a black loudmouth. People had hoped that white-washing of the characters had at least landed the best actors for the parts or would be reasonably justified by some significant or even impressive twist, but much to our disappointment neither situation was the case. It's thus assumed that Shyamalan just didn't see this advantage or thought that he could save on production costs with lesser known lower quality cast members (from what I read Noah Ringer had never acted before his role as Aang). And its not that those where the only actors who auditioned for the movie (apparently Dante Basco, the guy who voiced the animated Zuko, asked for his character's part only to be denied. I guess Shyamalan just really wanted to show his love for the fire nation by turning it into his own ethnicity, hence Patel as Zuko. No offense intended to anyone who is if Indian or similar descent, but to me that was most upsetting part of the ethnicity issue, considering that Zuko was my favorite character. The TV series made it quite clear that Zuko and his family are not of same race as the Guru and there's no clear benefit to doing it otherwise).With all that said, not only is the Last Airbender movie bad but unacceptably awful and, when compared to the standards of a motion picture, unprofessional. Let's hope Shyamalan never gets his hands on Korra material or the following Avatar TLA seasons. And judging from Paramount's long-term indecision to let Shyamalan continue the his planned Last Airbender ""Trilogy"", this widespread hope will probably become a reality, Thank God.",The Last Airbender

I watched the show and enjoyed it but I also took the movie as a different telling. I am not much of a fan of M. Night but I enjoyed this film. Yes the film felt a bit rushed early on but the story was interesting and tragic at times. I felt the cast was good even if some of the TV characters weren't as developed as I would have liked in this film. Let's face it, how can you put 12-18 episodes of narrative into a two hour movie? You can't. What was there I enjoyed immensely. Was is interesting and I did appreciated is that this film was moody and free from predictable Hollywood characterizations and I felt the film was much stronger for it.

It's as though the director spent little time watching the show or reading the books and just saw how pretty they move and wanted to mess around with some CGI. The casting was god awful, I think the actors where hired based on how they could imitate the characters voice. It was a ghastly performance I wish not for more to spawn from this until they do their research without a hiccup, pronounce the words as they are in the show and finally recast the actors.

The story it self is great and I always said that if the series was acted instead of animated, lots of adults (like me) will love the series as well. That's because of a great indebted story with each character having it's own personality, some of them grow and change. Some have hidden motives and agenda's.Then the movie about book one is released. And it's kinda rushing trough the story not really sticking to it, although the ""red line"", the major part is there. It's understandable parts are skipped because book 1 takes about 7,6 hours to complete. The great disappointment is in the personality's, there shallow and do not really reflect the personality's in the cartoon. For instance, I missed Sokka's clumsy humor and among some other things. . . .So if you know the cartoon then you probably don't like this movie. The other way around?

I didn't expect that.... First let's start with the GOOD things (cause there are a few, yes): Aang's tattoos, Uncle Iroh might not be fat but he's still cool, the bending moves are great (though a bit slow) and the clothing are very similar to the ones in the anime. Some parts were very similar to the anime. And that's about it.That Aang kid can't play for his own sake, Sokka isn't half as funny and dumb (but still endearing) and he should be, Katara isn't half bad-ass as she should be, Zuko is as angry but there's really nothing about him that'd make me feel compassionate, Appa is freaking scary, they reduced the story to the minimum with poor narrative and there's NO MONSTER AT THE END. Where is that freaking huge, cool monster????? But the most shocking thing (at least to me) was that they managed to turn Katara and Sokka into pale ghosts whereas they made all the main characters from the Fire Nation dark as sh*ts. I mean, really? Just because they're the 'bad guys'? I expected Katara to be an ethnic beauty, not a white child.... Anyway, don't waste your time on this, especially if like me, you've got high expectations after watching the anime.",The Last Airbender

I spent around $10 on snacks. Basically M. Night Shyamalan owes me 3 hours of my life and $54.00. In short this was a lousy summary of the first season/book. Since I have to have 10 lines of review let me continue on my rant. He changed name pronunciations. He change the premise of a few of the vignettes.

648,uchechinonso9,The Last Airbender aka Plan 9 From M. Night Shyamalan,2,13 June 2014," In the year 1953, we had Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space.  In 2000, the turn of the century and a new millennium, we had Battlefield Earth, which some have dubbed Plan 9 From Ron Hubbard.  In 2005 we had Alone In The Dark, which I personally dub Plan 9 From Uwe Boll.  Finally in 2010 we were treated to the latest train wreck, The Last Airbender, which I personally nickname Plan 9 From M. Night Shyamalan.All four of the movies above are considered to be the worst movies of all time, with three of them respectively based on a book, a popular series of video games, and an anime series aired on Nickelodeon subject to universal acclaim and with strong fan base.Unfortunately it seems bad movies just keep on coming. Why? Because those fat-head movie executives just wouldn't read the script and study the source material before greenlighting the movie. And believe me when I tell you that Uwe Boll's movie Alone In The Dark, doesn't bother me any more as I have watched the movie repeatedly and am not a fan of the games it was deeply poorly based on. But since I've watched the anime, Avatar: The Last Airbender, a.k.a. Avatar: The Legend of Aang, and am now very much familiar with it, I cannot watch this theatrical abomination without shedding tears and bawling in anguish. It simply destroys all expectations of every fan of the series: if the show was excellent, so must this movie be astounding.I loved the show: the art, the cultures, the special effects, the evolution of the story, the plot, the characters and their development, and above all, humour! I could get it all from this show. But not from this movie! No way, even though it does offer special effects! Watching this movie is the ultimate heart-stopper! You would regret wasting 90 minutes of your life after this torrid experience, and you will get no refund for it.I would be better of watching Walt Disney's Inspector Gadget of 1999, Super Mario Bros.of 1993, Street Fighter of 1994, or even Dragon Ball Evolution of 2009, but not The Last Airbender!

650,sunkist3208,Open Your Mind!,7,6 July 2010,"Yesterday I saw M. Night Shyamalan's live-action adaptation of the Nickelodeon show ""Avatar: The Last Airbender."" I was a big fan of the show when it first came out. Though I haven't watched the entire series, I am a true fan of the cartoon and always have been. So when my sister and I found out about ""The Last Airbender,"" we were both ecstatic (and we both dislike M. Night Shyamalan movies, so that's saying something!). Then my sister read the reviews.The reviews were bad. They said it was boring, that it had no plot, that it was politically incorrect, that they changed a lot of things from the original TV show... I could go on and on with the list of horrible things these reviewers said. My sister said she didn't want to see it anymore, and honestly, I was nervous that it was going to shatter my lovely view of the benders' world. But then I told myself I don't need a movie review to tell me what to think. So I went ahead with my plans and my friends, my sister, and I all went to see it in 3D. And you know what?I absolutely loved it.I will tell you right now the only thing that actually bothered me during the movie-- the name pronunciations. Sokka (SAH-ka) was pronounced SOH-ka. Aang (a as in apple) was pronounced AHng. Even Avatar had an open AH sound at the beginning of the word. But I learned to ignore that. And M. Night Shyamalan explained that these are the more correct Asian pronunciations of the name. Even still, pronunciations are hardly a reason for not seeing a movie.The movie did a great job of, as Dev Patel puts it so eloquently in an interview with MTV, ""capturing the essence of the show."" It doesn't have everything from book one. They moved some events around and completely took out a few episodes and a few characters (for all those Sokka/Suki shippers out there... sorry, no Suki in this movie!). But that's to be expected. They did an admirable job of fitting twenty 20- minute episodes into a 94-minute movie, but a few things had to be cut in order to do so. Also, I had a friend who had never watch the show come with and he was able to follow along with the movie just fine. I've heard similar reports from other friends who were unfamiliar with the show.The comments about this movie being racist are baffling. Comments of how Zuko, the ""villain of the movie"" (he is at most an anti-hero, and sorry to spoil anything for you, but he ends up helping Aang defeat the Fire Lord in book three) is dark-skinned. First of all, Jesse McCartney was originally supposed to play Zuko. If Dev Patel hadn't replace him, the Fire Nation race would be white. The main characters of the Fire Nation and Water Nation determined what the rest of the race would look like. Second of all, some of those ""dark-skinned"" Fire Nation people are actually Italian, meaning they are Caucasian. There are complaints about how Aang isn't played by an Asian boy. He definitely looks as though he has some Asian blood in him, especially when you see pictures of him with hair. He looks the part of Aang to a T. There should be no complaints!To the true Avatar: The Last Airbender fans out there, I will say this: go with an open mind and you will be greatly rewarded. No, not every single character is going to be in the movie. No, not every scene is going to be exactly the same. Not everything is in the same order as the TV show. And no, it's not as silly and light-hearted as the cartoon. It has its fun moments, but it sticks to the action and drama. I thought I wasn't going to like a more serious Aang, but I really enjoyed Noah Ringer's performance. He did a good job of portraying Aang. In fact, I think all of the actors did a good job. None of it is Oscar-worthy, but it's much better than people have been claiming it to be.Was it worth it to see it in 3D? No, probably not. There wasn't much 3D, reach-out-and-touch feel to it. If I saw it again (and I just might), I would see it in 2D instead. This was a very good movie, something I would definitely see again, something I would definitely buy on DVD/Blu-ray, and something I would absolutely see a sequel of. It did the cartoon justice.",The Last Airbender
651,rthewissen,"Not just a bad adaptation, a bad movie on it's own",1,25 August 2015,"OK... So first things first, I have seen all the seasons of Avatar and even it's successor The Legend of CoraSo of course, I'm going to say this was a despicable adaptation which paid no respect to the characters:Ang was an angry and emotionless child (because even when he was angry, he couldn't show it) compared to the joyful kid he is in the series, who still has to grow up and has a hard time taking his role seriously... at first. Katara is weak of spirit and weak as a bender, while in the series she is a formidable opponent with an even stronger will. Sokka was just a grumpy teenager who stood back and barely said a word... as opposed to the real character who cracks jokes and cannot keep his mouth shut!The bending in the series makes sense: every movement has an effect, for example, an earth bender slams his foot on the ground: it makes a rock fly up, he then kicks the rock an it goes out like a projectile... A fire bender can do a kick or a punch to send out fire balls. A water bender keeps on moving to keep the flow of water going, but every movement effects that flow.In the movie they do a combo of movement to did one simple thing!Now... I could keep going on and on and on... there are so many things!BUT... lets put that aside a look at it as if it's a stand alone movie that has nothing to do with a series...It is horrible..The characters have no emotions, the movie is rushed like hell... Yes they tried to resume an entire season in one movie... but the movie is barely over an hour long... why? Why not make it longer so the movie can work without being rushed?The acting is stiff, the characters, unlikable, there is no character developmentThere is barely any dialogue... other then explaining... narration... instead of showing the story! The characters have no interactions, no conversations, only explanations...Not once do you hear the character say how they feel, or have a normal conversation... the acting is stiff, the entire movie was horrible...I saw the movie for free after winning tickets to the premier... and it was not worth my time.",The Last Airbender
652,Your_Neighbor_Totoro,Don't Enable Him,1,1 October 2015,"The Merriam-Webster definition of ""enable"" is in essence ""to provide the means or opportunity"", but there is a deeper psychological meaning that each and every one of us is guilty of at some point in our lives for better or for worse.One of critics and fans favorite things to do when dishing out against a particularly bad flick is to find a scapegoat. Who do we blame? I find fault in many places in The Last Airbender but in this review I'll explain who must wear the dunce cap.Karen Khaleghi Ph.D. offers some ways to answer the question: ""Are You Empowering or Enabling?"" at www.psychologytoday.com. I now ask that same question of all those responsible for The Last Airbender (TLA). To find out, let's ask ourselves some questions.1. Are we ignoring unacceptable behavior? Well, unacceptable is one of the words that came to mind when watching TLA's actors get away with such lackluster performances. Although I don't think they literally gave it their best and their best wasn't good enough. Poor direction and settling for mediocre camera takes is a factor too. The point is at some point during production someone had to have realized how bad this movie was going to be, and ignored it.2. Do we put our own needs and desires aside in order to help someone else? What I need and desire as a movie-goer is to be entertained. I don't think it should be necessary to sacrifice entertainment at the theatre just to help out M. Night Shyamalan's pocketbook.3. Do you have trouble expressing your own emotions? I love this question because every actor in TLA (with he exception of Dev Patel as Zuko) has trouble expressing any emotion at all. When a hint of feeling tries to emerge and reach the audience, it feels unnatural and doesn't make sense in the situation the characters are in. I get that a fantasy world full of hybrid animals and element-bending isn't supposed to feel real, but why can't the human beings act like real human beings?4. Do we assign blame for problems to other people rather than the one who is really responsible? A hard question to answer in the cinema world, because there are so many involved in production and there are so many problems with TLA, but it comes down to money. Despite M. Night Shyamalan's downward trend in quality, Paramount Pictures gave him $150 million for production and spent another $130 million on marketing to hype up the beloved franchise for its eager fans. Not surprisingly, fans went into theatres hoping to be amazed, spending $319,713,881 worldwide and making it the twentieth highest-grossing film of 2010. I'm attributing this to the false hype and movie-goers' faith in the series, ignorance of the truth of the movie's quality, and the curiosity of those who just wanted to see if it was as bad as critics were saying.You can probably see where I'm going with this. Yes, I blame M. Night Shyamalan and others involved in production for creating this insult to film-making/story-telling, Avatar the Last Airbender and basic human intelligence, but movie-goers paid the price (literally and figuratively). We enable this movie and others like it by shoving our money into the box office again and again and expecting them to dish out better movies.What can we do to stop enabling movies like TLA to be made? Confide in friends and critics, spend a short amount of time browsing the web for opinions on movies before choosing which one to see. Wait until the movie comes out on DVD or for rent to see it if you're that determined to see a bad movie. That way it won't do as well in the box office and Shyamalan won't be rewarded for bad behavior.Thanks for hearing me out folks! Here's to hope for an ATLA movie reboot with a different director/cast/script/everything. :)",The Last Airbender
653,basit-basit,Really bad,1,1 April 2016,"I tried to enjoy this. I tried not to compare it to the beautiful show but this movie is disastrous. The actors do not fit their roles. The bending is extremely stupid and unrealistic. Where has the humorous side to Avatar gone? The best part of the show was the hilarious comments made continuously by sokka. Furthermore, i must comment on the lack of acting skill of most of the cast. I despise the the way the names are pronounced. It feels as if the actors and directors have not even bothered to watch the show before making this movie. So much of the show was crammed into the movie that i wasn't even sure what was going on half the time. I think it was a bad idea to make a movie on such a long show. I believe the movie maker were planning a sequel but after this movie, i beg of thee to never ever ever make another movie, or at least not a movie like this. I was really looking forward to watching this movie but i regret every second of it (ok maybe that's a bit harsh but i hated most of it).

657,PhoenixSon7,Not Much To Speak Of,1,30 June 2010,"Whenever an adaptation is mode, it is hard to view said film in any other context than in comparison to the source material. While it is important to take things in context, it is also important to view a film as what it is - that being the film medium. In the case of the critically acclaimed television series Avatar: The Last Airbender it would be impossible to adequately recreate or adapt every single thing in the entire first season in to a movie. M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender is an adaptation of the first season or ""Book 1"" of the television series. I have watched Book 1 of the Nickelodeon series and quite enjoyed it, but for the sake of the medium of film I try to take an objective stance on my review of the film on terms of how it stands by itself, as opposed to how well it adapted the source material.First, however, in terms of the adaptation, let me say that with such brilliant source material as Avatar: The Last Airbender it'd be easy to take the script and scenes word-for-word from the source material and simply plug in actors to say the lines. Unfortunately, Shymalan's The Last Airbender fails at even the simplest of tasks such as this.Before the coming of sound to film, the theater was silent and the pictures told the audience the story. When sound came along, some criticized the addition to film as a bastardization of the art form. The ""talkies"" became quite popular with the masses however, and as history will show us, filmmakers adapted to new techniques and new ways of integrating pictures with sound, and the silent film has almost completely gone the way of the dinosaur except for some notable art-house exceptions.Movies like The Last Airbender almost make me wish that silent film still existed. From the delivery of the first line to the last word spoken, every single line that is delivered is done so with such a forced agony that the film is almost unwatchable. The acting is stale, what characterization there should be is absent, and the whole film becomes more unbearable with every scene. It's almost as if the characters think they are in a radio drama, as the plot is rehashed for us, the audience almost every third minute as the characters catch us up to speed in a quick narration. The script is bloated and filled with all sorts of unnecessary dialogue which is delivered either so lazily that it's hard to care or with such overblown emotion that the lines become laughable. This excess dialogue serves as a catalyst to suck all depth out of who should be well-rounded characters that even a quick-3D conversion process cannot rescue them.There are a few bright moments with the actors, probably the two most notable being Dev Patel as Prince Zuko and Shaun Toub as Uncle Iroh. These two actually have some good moments among all the poorly written lines and end up being the best part about the film script-wise.Watching The Last Airbender makes me wonder if anyone besides the special effects supervisors and the fight choreographers even cared about what they were doing. Shots seem well-composed enough (though not even close to usual Shyamalan standards), the special effects are simply incredible, and the choreography is excellent. However, everything else about the film is just terrible. Even the way the choreography is presented is so over-dramatic that it takes all emotion out of what is happening. Every action scene is put in to slow motion. This highlights the spectacular of the choreography, but makes me wonder what could have been done had at least a few of the fight scenes been left in real-time.Another quick note related to the adaptation, most of the film is dedicated to the last episode of the first season. Over an hour of the movie, in fact. Because of this, the first hour of the film feels rushed, trying to speed us to the ""big battle scene"". I realize that a series adaptation is tough, but to skimp out on important character details makes it near impossible to identify or even care about a single character.The Last Airbender is not only a terrible adaptation, it's a pretty terrible movie on its own right, and may even go down in history as Shyamalan's worst. A shame for the once-great writer/director.",The Last Airbender
658,kayauysal,GREAT PARODY MOVIE,1,8 September 2020,If you like parody comedy movies of other tv series this is great for you. I love the great touch of bad acting skills throughout the movie. It was great. The bending was something else. You need to watch this movie if you really like bad movies. This movie doesnt need to exist in cinema history. I would wipe it off this world if i could.,The Last Airbender
659,Zeiramrei,Absolutely Awful,1,12 April 2011,"After seeing this movie and viewing this page to look up one of the actor's names, I see that this film somehow received a 4.5 / 10. I deeply contemplated this mystery and have came to the conclusion that M. Night himself visits this page frequently and gives this movie a 10 at least 200 times a day.I would write a lengthy review about how M.Night butchered the film. Or about how the actors were something out of a middle school talent show. And maybe mention that all the pronunciations of the names were ""changed"" for the sake of M. Night's ego, but all the other reviews on the page cover that pretty well.",The Last Airbender
660,tidusblue6,Don't let it be the Last Airbender,7,17 July 2010,"After hearing so many negative reviews about the movie, I was somewhat apprehensive to pay for a ticket to see this movie. I had seen a few episodes of the Nickelodeon series so I knew the background of the story somewhat, not going into this totally blind. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the result. I believe that this is a very decent movie that was overwhelmed by the politics of Hollywood, and the overly-sensitive politically correct internet sensationalists that want to see their own star rise (even if it's only 15 minutes of fame). What we should take from this movie is the MESSAGE. This is a story of hope. This is a story of learning to care for one another no matter what your race or background, and this is also a story that even people we see as our enemies are sometimes misrepresented. They too can be pure of heart with the best of intentions in mind. This is in no way a mega blockbuster like Avatar (I think THIS movie deserved that title more so than James Cameron's regurgitation and conglomeration of previous Hollywood movies), however it should get way more credit than the negative press and reviews it has garnered.The Plusses:Amazing special effects Great cinematography well paced well casted adult actors Story was easily digestible for an original Fantasy movieThe Minuses:Child/teen actors were mediocre (but what can we really expect? They need time to improve)I am definitely looking forward to future installments, and I hope M.N.S. will direct those as well. He set the mood and atmosphere very well in the movie. Where some people would seek to supplant story and acting with CG, I think M. Night maintained a good balance. Once this comes out on DVD, I think people will realize that it's actually a decent movie they should have seen in the theater.",The Last Airbender

My 7 year old liked it, 9 year old could not stop pointing out the flaws afterwards, so that should tell you something. We love the series on Nick, this movie just misses the mark on so many levels. It is a shame as M. Night could have proved to us that he still has it, but alas that is not to be. Just as other reviewers noted, the acting is awful except for Uncle Iroh, and each nation has their own race which I found odd. Fire nation/Indian, Water/Caucasian, Air some mix between white and black, Earth/Asian? So many things were left out, and as the movie seemed quite short, there would have been opportunities to put them in, such as let us know about the necklace Katara wears (Gran Gran's), etc. I do not look forward to seeing the next one, even Azula could have been better cast.

Now I finally have seen it, I don't know what to think of it.. At the beginning I thought it was bad acting, but aside from the fire king and his first hand general, the acting got better, up to pretty good even for some characters. So if not the acting then what? The special effects where good, good enough anyway. And the story is interesting for it is based on the animation series, which I haven't followed, but seen enough episodes to like it (not the Dutch DUB! that one is a pain!!) The real problem with this movie, I think, is the lack of impact and tension. The fight scene's are beautiful but they are not exiting. No BOOM, in your face! more like whoosh, float, slomotion. Ah! and I do like slomotions in a fight, IF used right, not like this. In my opinion, if you put a decent sound-effects track on this, it would make a great movie, but there isn't so a six for me, and that is way higher than the average rating on IMDb.",The Last Airbender

666,gamedude98,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,1,28 July 2010,"Normally I'm a pretty lite critic, I know what to expect when going into a family film or any other kind of genre. Going into this movie, I was expecting a typical film to supplement fans of an original TV series, I knew it wasn't going to be a mind-blowing film, but I didn't expect first class garbage.The acting was at its worst, supplying young actor Noah Ringer as Aang, the lead character. This kid can't act to save his life, his voice was just annoying throughout the movie and didn't have the emotion needed to capture the role. The other actors (mainly new, unheard of) weren't much better.The storyline was boring to me, I didn't get sucked into the whole ""4 nations at war"" thing. Clearly M. Night wasn't doing a good job at all to make an appealing movie.The ONLY thing worth the 1 cent that even I wouldn't pay to see this film again if I had the chance, is the special effects. And even they weren't impressive. I had seen fire effects exactly like the ones in this film many times before, as I have with the wind and water effects. The effects used to pick up pieces of rock and earth were pretty good, but far too limited as you get further into the movie.OVERALL, I give this film the 1/10 that it deserves. Easily the worst movie I've seen in years, and one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I would have rather thrown my money into a wishing well than gone to that movie, in fact, just watching some coins fall into a well is more entertaining than this movie.",The Last Airbender
667,Marlisamuda,Disappointing,1,30 June 2010,"To be truly critical, this may contain spoilers. While watching the movie, I listened to the frustration of the audience when reacting to certain elements of the movie. There were so many things that were changed and even left out. The bending was good and bad at some points. Majority of the bending was like 20 seconds of fancy hand movements and after that we saw the element actually moving. A lot of the fire nation soldiers weren't benders, they were just carrying spears. A critical character - Suki - was left out. The mispronunciation of names was very annoying. The fire lord didn't have the big scary presence that he has in the series and it seemed that he actually cared for Zuko, showing a soft side - that brought down the movie. Other little things like leaving out Princess Yue's father (the tribe leader), omitting the face-stealer spirit, the long pauses while bending in the fight scenes and many more. Overall the movie was disappointing, the acting was mediocre and the movie could have been a little longer as to accommodate the missing scenes. On a bright side, congrats to Jackson Rathbone and Dev Patel for portraying their characters the best. A warning to true Avatar fans: You will be disappointed.",The Last Airbender

If it were not for the special effects, I probably would have pressed STOP on the DVD player very early in the movie.The acting was uniformly bad. Was that due to the directing?The story line had potential, but the execution didn't really work.There were a few unanswered questions which really leaves the audience puzzled.The passage of time seems to affect different people at different rates. Is this a hole in the plot or simply a result of poor editing.This movie left me watching from the outside, very rarely enveloping me in the story and characters. I didn't care how it ended.

We saw the movie with a friend who had not seen the series, but who liked the movie and said he was looking forward to the next installment.Ultimately, yes, the movie contained the usual sins of an adaptation: omission of certain characters/details and abbreviated versions of others, rushing over crucial points in the interest of time, etc. However, what we are given was a rich, sweeping Cliff's notes version of the main story and an ending that begs for more.It's sad to see M.

The magical animals were really fun to watch, I'm not for sure they said what the big one was but I thought it was really well done..reminded me of the Neverending Story dragon.

It was fun, Interesting, Visually stunning, and although lacked a certain passion. I would say that this movie is worth the watch. I also believe M Night is back making entertainment minded movies. I have read that this is the worst movie ever. Clearly people need to see more movies.If you saw ""The Happening"", well, there is a troubled movie. A movie that simply was so bad it wasn't even worth laughing at. I felt like my ears were bleeding puss when I saw it. So, It feels to me that the director realized his last movie was insanely absurd and felt he should try harder. I understand that the 'cartoon was better' But this is always the case. I remember people were trouble with ""Lord of The Rings"" because it differed from the books. Never judge a movie based on what inspired it. Movies limit one to a narrow time-line to develop the story. If the Cartoons did not exist, this movie would have been received at a better... I suspect. It's that or there is a smear campaign against the movie. I read someone said ""M Night bent me over a table and raped me'. This comment really led me to believe that I was going to see something shockingly bad. It as above average.So I guess, make up your own mind about this movie.

678,claybot_16,"Has spirit, but poor execution",6,2 July 2010,"I gotta agree that I'm quite biased in that M. Night Shyamalan has entertained me from ""The Sixth Sense"" to ""The Happening"" (yes, I didn't think it was ""that"" bad), but ""The Last Airbender"" just seemed like it was pi** poor execution.The story was good and the spirit was there, but none of the ""elements"" came together much like that in Aang's story.The first ten minutes and the last forty minutes were salvageable and good. The better scenes I felt were those that involved the villains of the piece. Zuko clearly had an arc and Dev Patel does have some chops along with Cliff Curtis, Aasif Mandvi, and Shaun Toub. Particularly those with Mr. Mandvi, Mr. Toub, and Mr. Patel.The mythology is clearly there, and I just wish Shyamalan would give the audience more credit even if he's writing to only children. If you don't know anything about the series it's based upon then maybe you'll find it passable, but if you do know the entire series it'll be like a dentist drill.Which brings me to the three leads. Jackson Rathbone was okay as Soka especially in the beginning as the protective brother, but the chemistry between him and Nicola Peltz just wasn't there. I'd have liked more humor from him, which I hear was cut to make time. Nicola Petlz was okay as Katara, but I could've done with less narration and breaking the moments. Noah Ringer as Aang shined, quite literally, at the end of the film. If you stick through the scene at the end remembering how he rejected being the Avatar/savior and essentially dooming his people to extinction was almost heartbreaking.Which brings back to the beginning, it had the spirit, but had pi** poor execution.M. Night, you're on the ropes.I really believe there is a better cut of ""The Last Airbender"" out there somewhere since all the early reviews were so good. I hope that there is another one to come and that they can, pardon the phrase, get their sh** together because all the pieces are there, but Shyamalan just has to let go of some dialog and let the movie breathe.I don't want the studio to turn away from something that has potential and has spirit.",The Last Airbender

This movie is the worst movie to be ever made. Movies that were intentionally made to be bad are far better than this. This movie makes parody movies look like they deserve Emmy's.
This movie is a huge spit in the face to the masterpiece that is the show.
It lacks everything that made the show great. Absolutely nothing of value is inside this movie.It makes me wonder where the hell the budget to this movie went to....
Actors? NOPE.
Script? NOPE.
Special effects? NOPE.
Wardrobe? Maybe.
For the most part its as though this movie was just a scam to pay big named actors high salaries while making a very poor movie. Its as though the whole movie is just for money laundering and even tax evasion.Don't watch even it if its free; heck, even if you're paid to.

I happened to know Night was going to do the movie one month before it was announced. And I was so excited.I was greatly disappointed. I'm sure if you were totally unfamiliar with the series the movie would have been fine. I on the other hand was left feeling as if I was kicked repeatedly in the gut. There was no set up, so I was not invested in the characters at all. I could not care less what happened to them because the movie never even tried to show you who they were as people. As a movie, this gets a 5/10. As an adaption, it gets a 1/10. The writing was much better on the Nickelodeon Series. Night totally changed the mythology. He couldn't waste 5 seconds to say that ""The Avatar State was the combination of all of Aang's past lives' power and experience."" I feel totally betrayed. From the reviews, I knew it was going to be a mess, but I felt like I had to watch it in theaters. It's kind of like when you go to a funeral and you have to see the body one last time.When it's all said and done, I'm left with the feeling that the Avatar gang MUST have had when they got through seeing The Ember Island Players!

681,maxshelley,Awful. Terrible. Bad. Do not see.,1,15 August 2010,"I rarely review films on IMDb, but this film was so bad I wanted to try and prevent others from wasting their time on it.I had never heard of the cartoon series upon which this film was based and didn't really have any expectations at all. However, there are so many things wrong with this film I think I'll struggle to fit them all in the word limit.The acting is dire. Really dire. Even if the dialogue hadn't been some of the worst I've come across, it was destined to be ruined by this cast anyway. I read in an interview that Dev Patel had waited after making Slumdog Millionaire ""for the right script to come along"". He should have waited A LOT longer and perhaps bothered to read it before signing on (I'm assuming he saw the size of the cheque and just said yes).The 3D is awful. Some of the panning shots are out of focus. I don't mean depth-of-field 3D viewing issues, they are totally out of focus. You can't see a thing clearly. A $150M film is unable to focus the camera? Jesus. Did M. Night Shyamalan even watch this thing before it went out?The plot is ruined by moronic voice-overs which repeatedly spell out basic plot points, while seemingly skipping over some things that would have been really great to see as part of the on-screen action.The special effects veer between being passable for a modern blockbuster, to simply awful. They also seem weirdly 'separate' from the actors in a way I find it hard to describe. They are almost self-conscious.I can't go on listing things, it's too depressing.With the bar being set so high elsewhere for both movies aimed at a younger audience and adaptations of cartoon, comic or fiction series, I wonder how a film this bad made it out. I can only assume it got to a point in production where they worked out that it was more expensive to write it off than just put it out and take the hit. Whoever made that decision should be fired. In fact, worse, they should be forced to watch this film on repeat. They'd NEVER make that mistake again.Do not go and see this film. It isn't one those ""so bad it's good"" movies.

Truth to be told, my expectations were a few points below zero for this movie, even though a very good friend of mine (and also a huge Avatar fan) told me the movie rocked. Well, now that it's over, it exceeded my expectations and was, in fact, pretty good. The effects were really great and the bending was made to look wonderful, the cast was chosen so that it resembles the animated characters (in my opinion) and the story was not completely changed. Of course, it's not all good. Some people complained about the actors sounding like they're reading their lines and I must agree, but I can overlook that. Many complain about the changes in story line, which one can't miss, but let's face it - you can never create an exact replica of something. Think of how many books and games were turned to movies. All in all, it was not the greatest movie of all times and it could have been done better, but it doesn't deserve the title worst movie of 2010.

Fortunately, it wasn't as horrible as the critics made it out to be.Shyamalan should have let someone else write the script; obvious, clichéd dialog. Dev Patel as Zuko does the best acting job and Noah Ringer as Aang isn't too bad. Nicola Peltz as Katara doesn't inspire, but admittedly there isn't much she could've done with MNS's schlock.Pacing was slow, but they did a decent job of condensing 20 chapters into an hour and a half. They could've fleshed it out another half an hour and made it better, but overall, it was understandable. For the most part the battle scenes pass and the world looks realistic.Conclusion: Fans of the original series will not like all the changes, and the film's not likely to gain many new fans. But in the words of Simon Cowell, ""It wasn't horrible""; it's okay at best, mediocre at worst, but definitely not the worst film ever made. It sets up well for the sequels; if MNS swallows his pride and hires someone more capable to write the screenplay, Book Two will be much better than Book One.6/10",The Last Airbender
688,Sora799,Not quite amazing. Not worst movie ever made.. but close!,4,9 July 2010,"Flat performances. Flat dialogue. A really cool idea.The truth would be I would just suggest watching it for free online. http://www.online-TV-episodes.com/ has it for free and I suggest you all do the same.That's what we have. Shyamalan will probably attempt to defend it with the same logic George Lucas uses (it's for the kids). Kids are more forgiving. And they're typically not the ones shelling out the ten bucks. The Last Airbender feels almost exactly like The Golden Compass. It spends way too much time attempting to explain this new world. All we need is the four elements battling it out, and actors who can sell that. They should have spent much more time finding a kid who can act to carry this film. Or simply increase the age of the actor. I just don't think Shyamalan can pull a great performance out of an actor. Haley Joel Osment was an amazing kid actor. Lightning didn't strike twice for Shyamalan. Once you get past the very cool visuals, we're left with a kid who ran away from being an avatar because he couldn't one day have a family. Sounds a lot like the force. But here's the thing, if you're a kid, and you're told you can be the COOLEST person ever, do you run away because you won't be able to change diapers, or have a wife? You don't even know what love is! The firebenders and their metal machines are supposed to be a pale comparison to our current society (I think). That, and the fact that they keep saying avatar (the ""a"" is pronounced like avant-garde, so only slightly different from James Cameron's Avatar) makes this film feel like it just borrowed from other films. It's sad. Unbreakable was supposed to be Shyamalan's trilogy. I loved that film. It only made $100 million, so the studio pulled the plug on more. I imagine a world where he made the Unbreakable trilogy and didn't make all of these other films that failed (The Happening, The Lady in the Water).

They are lashing out at one of the best story tellers of our generation and they are wrong. I have seen one movie of M. Night's that I can honestly say I did not like. I did not like 'The Village' because I had the unfortunate experience in that I guessed the ending 20 minutes into the movie. I also don't think everything has been perfect. I thought both 'Signs' and 'The Happening' were merely decent and though he did not direct 'Devil' I was not wowed by that story either. And though I was part of the initial craze of 'The Sixth Sense' it wasn't mind blowing for me. I think 'Unbreakable' was a bit stronger than the previous movies mentioned and I believe M. Night's wheel-house is fantasy. My personal favorite thus far, has been 'Lady in the Water.' A completely original children's fantasy and a story that every time I watch it with my little girls, I can feel their hearts fill with hope. Ironically, this movie wasn't widely accepted either. I'm not meaning to discuss other movies in a review. I am just tired of hearing the negativity, not for the movie, but for the disdain of the writer/director. Especially this film. I even mentioned 45 minutes into the film that if it ended there abruptly and had absolutely no closure to the film whatsoever, it still would have been better than how it's been received. I have a strong passion for children's fantasy films. When I was a boy, I had no greater hero than Atreyu riding on the back of Falcor, fighting Gmork and The Nothing. I still watch it with my children to this day. We're so lucky that it did not recently come out otherwise it would have never had a chance. 'The Last Airbender' is much more than what it's been given credit for. The only complaint I could possibly have is that it ended too soon. I pray that the moronic media has not discouraged the film maker to complete his story. But this movie was special. I got chills when The Avatar took control of the ocean at the end of the film and then accepted his role as 'Avatar' right after. If you are open minded, enjoy using your imagination, and don't want your opinion to be manipulated by the media and it's puppets around the world, then you'll probably really enjoy this film as I did. For me, I needed no more validation than to see my children's' faces light up with excitement as they watched people do impossible and wonderful things. Once again, M. Night has filled their hearts with hope.",The Last Airbender

691,powerslave06,"The Last Airbender: Not bad, but not the best.",1,1 July 2010,"OK, as some of you know I'm a huge fan of the show Avatar: The Last Airbender, and when I heard there was going to be a movie about it nothing could contain my enthusiasm. Now, two years later, I have seen the film I have been looking forward to that whole time; the live action adaptation of the first season of Avatar: The Last Airbender. So fans, fear not for this is a very faithful adaptation compared to most others out there.But first a quick synopsis. M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender is a action/ fantasy film which revolves around a group of people in an alternate world who can control the elements of earth, air, water, and fire through the ancient art of bending. Now the Fire Nation began a war and wiped out the Air Nomads, and supposedly the Avatar who is the master of all elements and the keeper of peace for the world. The Avatar (named Aang) escaped and is frozen in a block of ice for 100 years. It is then two Water Tribe tribe siblings (Katara and Sokka) discover him in the South Pole. They bring him back to their village and very quickly the banished prince of the Fire Nation, Prince Zuko, is hot on their trails. Aang discovers his people are dead and goes on a quest with Sokka and Katara to the Northern Water tribe to master water and put an end to the war.Given M. Night Shyamalan's recent record of stinkers (Lady in the Water and The Happening) one may think this would suck. But, rest assured, I can honestly say this is his best since Signs. The visual effects were impressive and his style of long takes made them beautiful to say the least. And the bending effects were unique to each character and no two shots were the same.On to the acting. Let's start with the main character Aang (played by newcomer Noah Ringer). I must say I'm impressed. The kid is twelve years old and has a black belt in Tae Kwon Do, and is able to put on a decent performance. But something didn't sit right with me for all the actors. A lot of the lines seem forced and restricted to one or two takes. Which falls under Shyamalan's jurisdiction. I realize for a movie of this size things, such as acting, tend to be scaled down for timing reasons. But it could've been a lot better. For the record I don't blame the actors, just Shyamalan for his laziness.As for the supporting cast and villains lets start with who I think were the best performers. Both Prince Zuko (Dev Patel of Slumdog Millionaire) and his uncle Iroh (Iron Man's Shaun Toub) easily stole the show. Despite lazy writing and directing they demonstrated exceptional acting and represented their characters incredibly well. Expect big things from Patel in the future.Aang's sidekicks Katara (Nicola Peltz) and Sokka (Jackson Rathbone of Twilight fame) were definitely hit or miss. While Peltz seemed to try and emoted better than her on screen brother, their lines made me wish Shyamalan hired a co writer. Petlz at times was too melodramatic and caused me to not take her seriously, and Rathbone just wasn't there for me with the exception of one scene near the end which involved a very touching moment between him and Yue (Seychelle Gabriel). Other than that they were mediocre at best.As for the villains, Fire Lord Ozai (Cliff Curtis) and Commander Zhao (Aasif Mandvi of the Daily Show) they came off as more cardboard cut out villains than anything remotely threatening. Especially Zhao. Mandvi was obviously the wrong guy for the job and could only ham it up. Curtis was better and at least had the charisma of a gruff war lord who walked around in fancy clothes all day.Other than the acting and writing, my only major complaint was the time and pacing. The first season of the show had roughly 10 hours worth of material. Naturally I knew going in that a lot had to be cut to make a decent length feature film. And, yes, a lot was cut. I won't go into specifics without spoiling but there could've been more. However the pacing was really off. It seemed as if all the back story was summed up by a few quick lines of exposition, when it could've easily been filmed. Screen writing 101: show, don't tell. Shyamalan flunked that part up. On top of that the pacing was so fast that you almost have no time to breathe and the plot is ahead of you by miles while you're running to catch up.And there could've been more action. I won't go into any spoilers but 90% of the action scenes are what's in the trailers. This was marketed as an action movie and it barely delivered. But that's more of a creative decision on my part. If I would have made it, the action would've been upped. I digress.As usual James Newton Howard's score was simply breathtaking and if you haven't heard it I would highly recommend you check it out. I hope this man gets an Oscar for this. Easily the best score out of the whole year.All in all this is a decent popcorn flick and worthy of a summer release. The kids will like it, most of the fans will like it, and even some of the parents will like it. It has a good story and a good message which is something rare for kids these days. And it's a nice break from the usual shoot 'em up, CGI porn, and irrational romance movies that offer little more than time killers.Effects/ Sound: A Writing: D Driecting: C Cinematography: B Acting (combined): C Score: ATotal: C (See it only if it looks good to you)",The Last Airbender

694,zoopunk,disappointed...,3,1 July 2010,"Let me start by saying I really wanted to like this movie. If you consider that I was a little ""entertained"" by the end of the movie and if that is the only criteria, then it at least accomplished that. Unfortunately I am not 12 yrs or younger, which is the audience who may enjoy it the most.Granted, this movie is about 105 minutes taken from 13 episodes. It appears that M. Night Shyamalan, both director & writer, is unable to develop a movie that may include a good story plus descent character development. It was very difficult to have any feelings for any of the characters. My humble opinion is that any movie can have a great story or to the contrary, a horrible story, but if the characters are well written and acted well, then the characters can carry the movie (even with a bad story.) There is a good solid story here, even with this condensed version, but so weak on character development. The story moved along quickly, but the pace in the movie from scene to scene seemed quite slow.Unfortunately the acting may be interpreted as poor, but I would instead defer that to what was written plus the directing. There were a few moments that lead you to believe there are more sides to the characters, but they are short lived. In addition it seems nearly every scene, includes dialogue or narration that feels forced to explain everything about the character, their history or current situation.Visual imagery and scenery are positive points.Perhaps if I was 12 or younger, and I did not feel like I was spoon fed every character and move in the plot, then maybe I would have liked it much more.I can only hope that if more is developed in this series, that a better visionary may include better writing and directing.If your expectations are low enough, maybe you will like it more than me.",The Last Airbender

Night butchers every aspect of the series - and this is not even including the race issue. The series was a beautiful and moving piece of work; never have I watched an animated series and been as in love with something as this series. I will give to MNS that he did do a good job on looks: the movie has gorgeous scenery. If you never watched the series... well be prepared for choppy editing, too-dark scenes because of last minute 3D additions and poor acting. I don't want to blame the actors for the acting, its most likely the script. The dialogue is clunky, there is no chemistry; scene cuts do not make sense and the story just isn't there.

I would like to say I'll start with the positives, so I'll say it, realize there weren't any and move straight on to the negatives.From the Director I should have known what was coming, but I had a small shred of hope that a tale of such potential and promise couldn't possibly turn out all bad.boy was I wrong.I feel sorry for the actors; their lines were so bad even the best actor on Earth would have struggled to make them sound anything less than stucco, monotone drivelwhich is basically what they sound like. The story manages to completely obliterate the concept of tension, intrigue and excitement with dazzling effect. Shamalan is instead content to hop back and forward like an amateur with a new web cam leaving the viewer bored, frustrated and at time just plain bewildered at how inept the whole thing is.The FX are OK, just OK, the characters are flatter than a pancake, the film packs the punch of a sleeping gerbil, and throughout you are left with the clear, overt and unmistakable presence of a director who doesn't have a clue what he's doing. You think I'm kidding? Go ahead, watch for yourself and then come back in stunned amazement and wonder how after the utter drivel this director has been serving up of late, he still manages to get something like this into cinemas again.I'm done with M knight film, goodbye, good riddance and I will NEVER and I mean NEVER waste another 120mins of my life watching garbage like this. The averages Steven Siegal C movie is like a masterpiece of cinema when compared with this utterly painful, abysmal attempt at a film.

Now there is a steaming pile of garbage! In closing, go see this movie. Even if you know nothing about the series, you will enjoy it. And then maybe you will want to watch the series.

699,minoc,On the other hand,8,5 July 2010,"Well., I went and saw this movie w/ no knowledge of the animated series. And I turned around and watched it a second time.Things I liked: * I liked most of the key actors; The key kid acts well enough to hold it together. * I like the fast paced story and forgive silly narrative in places where 2 spoken sentences covers massive ground. It feels like watching a Harry Potter movie - without having read the book first. * When I was a kid, I liked Never Ending Story and Star Wars; This felt like a cross between the two - even w/ a pho-Falcor and pho-Force. * The 3D - I like movies made in 3D which do NOT constantly flick stuff at you to show off the 3d. This movie simply uses it to make the world larger. * I like the idea of bending... * I love Ice.Things I did not like: * The ending... If they do not finish the trilogy, I will see if I can change this to a 1. It ends on a somewhat contrived cliff hanger. * Most of the fight scenes seemed contrived. It feels like the movie wants epic fight scenes... but implements them with few actors poorly placed. In this, it as maybe 1 (small) notch above Eragan or Battlefield Earth - the two worst fight scene movies I can think of. I suggest doubling the number of stunt guys and actors, and halving the special effects...That being said., It is in the top three movies I have seen this year (Train Dragon and Avatar being the other two)",The Last Airbender
700,stevott,This Movie is Terrible,1,4 December 2010,"Before I came to see what the rating for the movie was on this site, I figured I wouldn't need to vote because it couldn't possibly have more than 1 star. There can't possibly be a single person who thought this movie was good in any way. I was apparently wrong.I will tell you right now I downloaded a ripped version of this movie. It cost me nothing but my time to watch it. Having said this, I want you to know that I am the one who feels robbed. I feel robbed of the time it took me to watch this amazingly terrible film. It took me three sittings to watch the entire thing, because after watching about a half hour of it each time I would get so upset that I had to turn it off and do something else until I got the courage to turn it back on and see how bad M Night Shamalama screwed the next part up.I understand that this version was his interpretation of the series. I understand there will be differences between the two versions when something like this is created. I do not understand how you can change the pronunciation of main characters names. This movie deserves to be wiped out of everyone's memories, and never be allowed to see the light of day. This movie makes Dragonball Evolution look like the f*****g Dark Knight.If you ever watched a second of the Avatar series, even on accident, flipping through the channels, do not watch this. If you ever felt like this movie might have good special effects and you don't care how bad the acting or story is, do not watch this. If you love bad movies and want to watch one with your friends and have some beers and make fun of it, do not watch this. This movie serves no purpose. There is not a person in the world who would enjoy it. M Night Shamalama himself looked at it and went, ""F*ck it I don't care anymore."" The fact that a second one got green lighted makes me want to never go to the movie theater again. This movie has dealt a blow to my confidence in Hollywood that might never be healed. Reviews like this fuel the urge for people like me, (who like bad movies), to watch movies like it. For those of you who I have convinced further to watch it, I can only say I feel bad for you and tried to warn you.Also. For anyone who has not seen the original series and has seen this movie. Do yourself a favor and watch one episode. One episode. F*ck it, 5 minutes of an episode, so that you may see what Shamalama ruined.

702,peacembw,Worst Movie of the Year,1,3 July 2010,"Let me begin by typing that our whole family loves the cartoon series. We have all of the three books on DVD, and we've watched them hundreds of times. I mean, literally, hundreds of times. That being said, we knew coming in the movie theater that the story would need streamlining in order to make it a cohesive movie, running under at least 3 hours. We understood that. When the flap was first made over Cameron's ""Avatar"" and how this movie couldn't be named that, we were so angry. We almost started our own write-in campaign...that's how passionate we are about this series.Our whole family...husband, wife, two kids...went to the theater yesterday to see this movie. And it was bad. Not just bad. It was easily the worst movie of the year.The whole series centers around three main characters: Aang, Katara, and Sokka. I've seen better acting from cardboard boxes. The pronunciation of Aang's name, the word ""Avatar"" and other characters' names was way off. I recall watching the DVD extra with a mixture of hope and dread where M. Night explained he actually APPROACHED THE WRITERS OF AVATAR to direct this movie. His movies aren't exactly blowing it out of the ballpark lately. But, I figured, let's give him a chance to direct this thing. After all, he approached them, and he said how much he loved the series. I had hoped this series would be in good hands.How wrong I was.The reason I'm giving it a one out of 10 is for Shaun Toub, who plays Uncle Iroh. He truly is a good actor in the midst of a stinking cesspool of cardboard performances. He brought the essence of Iroh, a Spiritual man with a conscience.My only shred of hope is that in 10 years, a real, honest to goodness director will ""rediscover"" the true genius of this series and remake the movies the way someone passionate about them should have made them in the first place.Until then, we have only the razzies to look forward to at the end of the season.

That would be impossible. Was the story rushed? Yes, but the whole first book had to be told in the length of a kids movie, so it couldn't be a 3 hour movie. The special effects were awesome. Someone mentioned how there was no silliness in the movie. I'm very pleased with that. You expect that in a cartoon, but not in a serious movie. Real people would react more like the movie in a time of war than in the cartoon.Having the four nations look different made sense to me.

704,markina-93,I never thought that this movie could change my life...,10,9 March 2011,"Well, I just want to say at the beginning that I love the Show Avatar:The Legend Of Aang. Truly. This is my favorite show forever. But need to say also, I'll never understand people who talking that the movie is the worst movie in a whole world! So I want to some of them listen to me, understanding me. I would like to say a few words about him, about the actors, directing ... I can not say that this film is a masterpiece of cinematography and the best of the bests. But then, as the movie was cursed by some show's fans and race benders - it's not deserved. The main plus of the film - is the actors of course. The actors who who raised the movie on a high level, I hope, not only for me. Noah Ringer played naturally, as an avid actor, just can say that - I never saw him before. He's just a boy, a boy who does not want to be the Avatar, but when I realized how important it was, he accepted his fate, and changed the fate of many. His character is much more interesting and serious than the Aang of the cartoon. He didn't overacted - he is just a young actor, he knew his role, and became great Aang.Dev Patel - he was THE BEST, and he was as a winner for me, he won my heart more than anyone else! He have a incredible energy, crazy emotions, but he simply dazzling! I've never doubted for a second at him. He created a amazing young Prince Zuko, who is eager to return home, who was punished by his father, and heart of a guy just broke into pieces. He wanted only to find and capture the Avatar. And when he found him, this one chance in a million - he tends to his goal, and many sacrifices for the sake of victory. And he does not understand what makes it over himself. We can see it in Dev's eyes. Dev is so gorgeous and great. Shaun Toub just saved Uncle Iroh role in the movie. He focused spirituality, he is very wise and clever, and he loves his nephew more than life. It is very touching and beautiful. How can't you see it guys?Other actors have played as they could play, I did not notice so much zeal of they, but Nicola Peltz actually saved the role of Katara, she became so beautiful, gorgeous and cute girl, and Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) has become very bold and serious warrior, though he didn't lost his comicality. Their acts wasn't really great but they're were cool.I have not noticed special rapidity of development of the plot. Cuz I know I've seen the story flowed all the fulfillment of both, as required by the movie. And I know the reason why the director decided to cut some scenes (which, incidentally, keep in mind when watching the movie!). M. Night did it not to clutter the movie. He didn't want to cheat too many scenes. Just understand guys no one can not copy the whole cartoon! I just hope to see these scenes in ""The Last Airbender 2"" which will win any heart. The graphics and effects in TLA were beautiful, nature, and temples, ships, and villages - all at the highest level. Bravo! Bunch of funny moments, and no matter what they are blunt sometimes. How couldn't some people to see so funny Sokka, Appa and Momo? Isn't that enough? All the same, the movie is really serious because... Hey!! Hello! This is a war, guys! Wake up!The music/soundtrack of the movie is so spiritual, mystical and created epic atmosphere. I thought that a God created this, well, James is a genius! But the cons ... Well, sure every movie have minuses, I know. Some cues, the phrases like a ""we must go"", or ""I have something to tell you"" were such like annoying. Actually, I know some fans says: The names were so worst and sounded really awful. Guys, this is the movie not the show, you need understand this fact - please don't combine too much, the sounds of names are not so important. In a general, I personally did not upset because of the movie, I've been waiting for 1.5 years, every time I'm watching this and love this movie more and more... I advise anyone who is going to watch the movie to think with your head, listen to no one, and feel by your heart of what is happening on the screen. Hope some people will understand me, the movie changed my life, I feel better now because I love the way of showing so much spiritually and powerful benders as Katara, Zuko and Aang.I said all of this not as a fan, but as a reasonable girl.

705,teh_kng,Surprised at how close it is to the story. Only a few flaws. I shall tell you what to expect.,10,1 July 2010,"The movie was indeed passing expectations to me in my opinion. I have seen countless adaptations that were just terrible. Percy Jackson. Dragonball Evolution. I am sure you could name a few others. But this stayed very close to the show and kept every essential part to the series in it. But do not expect it to capture the magic of the series.A couple of the names of characters were mispronounced. The reasoning for this is that in Asian culture, a long A sounds like AH. I sounds like a long E. Every vowel sounds different in their culture from ours. I was not too mad about this. At the siege of the North Pole, the violence had to be toned down, for this movie was made for children. My only problem with this movie is it has too much action and little filler space. Aang, Sokka and Katara exchanged little dialog throughout the movie and didn't even goof around at all, like they did through half of the entire series. You can't really capture the characters' personalities in this movie the way you did in the show. Sokka and Katara didn't really do anything, they just took up space.Katara's actor had an extremely young expression all of the time she was on screen. She seemed younger than Aang. But I expected this. When I first saw a picture of Nicola Pelts portraying Katara a year and a half ago on a fan site, I knew from one glance at her that she seemed like a little girl.The movie was a little longer than an hour and a half so the creators could have added 15--heck, I would settle for ten--minutes of the characters goofing around and other nonsense so you could capture their personalities as kids in this movie. It is so difficult to catch someones personality in this movie, even Zuko seemed pleasant.So in conclusion: very good, stayed close to the series and covers everything important to the plot. Cons: Too much action, not enough dialog for you to get a sense of everyones personalities.So if you have read this review before seeing the movie, you will know what to expect and not be one of the people that were deeply dissatisfied with the movie.

Usually the M Sham movies are just too odd for me to grasp, so I had little hope from the onset but they managed to pull it off rather nicely. I do hope they release the second part soon! :) now the negs were that in places it was a bit disjointed,some of the names were too odd to really get (I ended up naming them in my head) the special effects were cool however, a few of the actors were tepid, well most of them really. However Dev, rocked in his role! over all it could have been better but it was not a total waste of time, however if I had paid 20$ at the movies to see it I might feel differently, we rented it from the redbox, so for a 1.50$ I was not too upset.",The Last Airbender

The movie was so awful that I saw half the audience leaving the theater within an hour. I stayed on till the end because I am a huge fan of the popular cartoon series on Nick. The direction, screenplay, dialog and acting was just downright pedestrian. Whoever picked the cast probably didn't care much about the movie or its original fans. The movie was so slow that my friend actually fell asleep half hour into the movie. Don't even bother watching it even on a DVD. Lets not support and lead Paramount into making a sequel to this abomination. I had very low expectations for this movie before I went. I already knew it wasn't running well. But I became a sucker to the avatar fan in me. The movie managed to beat even the lowest bar I could set. Now I thought some outsiders (to the original story) might actually like it. Of course not... No one is immune to that awful acting. I actually inquired some of my innocent colleagues. They didn't have a clue as to what was going on. Here's my advice to the directors who want to make movies out of popular books, cartoons or comics. Its OK to copy the story as it is. It was already a hit in the first place. Pay the extra royalties instead of acquiring a loss out of the movie. Also if you want to show originality, make it an action packed or fast paced. Nobody wants to see such monotony.

They never said momo, and only said appa once, and they were in it for about 10 minutes total.Shyamalan changed the pronunciation of a lot of names, he did it to make it more Asian... but guess what. its an American TV show!!! Yes it has Asian background, but it is made by Americans and the cartoon was made for American viewers.If it had a different director, and if the director didn't touch the storyline, it would have been an amazing movie. I kinda see why he made some of the changes he did, but thats only if he's crazy. which he probably is. I hated James Cameron for copy writing the title ""Avatar"" and now i hate M. Night Shyamalan even more for taking an amazing TV show and making it into one of the worst movie adaptations ever.But its worth the watch, and i will probably see the second, and maybe the third... if they change directors... if not who knows",The Last Airbender

All I can say is M Night absolutely destroyed arguably the greatest Epic of all time. If you are a fan i would recommend not seeing the movie as it will most likely be extremely nauseating to you. that is all i can say the other reviews say it all. I can't believe what he did. I understand it is hard to condense 8hours into a two hour movie but the parts that were omitted were extremely important to the development of the story. No Kiyoshi warriors, no Avatar Roku, no rush to the temple on winter solstice. These are all important parts in the show that were changed. I don't know if I will even watch the last two movies, someone might have to hold a gun to my head to see them and even then i may rather die than go thru that again.

I felt pulled into an adventure filled with legends that were revealed as the story progressed. Some movies you watch and you are done when it is over. I could watch this one several times.The colors, scenery, people and critters were amazing. I've never seen anything relating to other stories related to this one, so I had no preconceptions. I look for a movie that will make me forget about the real world for a bit. There could have been a little more development of both story and character. Transitions could have also been better, but, overall, this movie was enjoyable and different. I'll buy the Blue-Ray if I can get it for less than $15.",The Last Airbender

Now don't get me wrong this movie is not Academy Award material either, but I don't think it really deserves all the negative reviews it seems to be gathering.In what the movie succeeds in is Gorgeous Enviornments, Specal effects, and cool Action (which is the very definition of a Summer Blockbuster is it not)there all really well done, with a large variety locations powers that are very Stylish within the right of there own element. The action itself is also well done with very cool Cinematography and Choreography in the battle scenes But Not all is perfect the Dialoge itself is very poorly written and the story does seem to be a bit Wonky at times. Also the actors themselves couldn't really be pull off the similarities between there characters and there ""Cartoon"" counterparts So long story short if you expect this to be a perfect adaptation of the T.V show or expecting an Academy award Nominee for best picture your going to be disappointed.

This series had the potential to be a blockbuster hit among kids and adults alike but it falls way short. There is nothing I can say that hasn't been said before but I will say that I agree with all the disappointment. Aang is supposed to be a carefree, happy go lucky kid who cannot even fathom carrying the burden of the world on his shoulders. Instead, M.knight creates a kid who is so submerged in this task that he cannot even function. Also the dialogue feels very M.knight. These spoken lines of this movie do not flow right as a conversation in the fictional world of film or reality. It sounds so choppy and hesistant. Everyone always look like they are a moment away from crying. Katara has so much spunk and courage in the series but she just sounds whiny and emotional in this film. The quality of the sfx were excellent but it was deafened by the ill suited music. The trailer depicted a very action packed fast past movie but instead we got a very slow paced, overbudget recap of the series.

Some have complained about the pronunciation of names and dance bending. But I am sure that if a group or nation of people are trained to use their powers they must of at one time learned and practice the same moves together.

The kids adored it and my little 4 year old boy was copying Aang's bending actions throughout and afterwards. It didn't go on too long either.The plot hurtled past missing out large chunks and with little time for character development (we knew the basic trajectory of it but not the minutiae so this was OK by us). The effects looked great. Music was good and both my wife and I though the 3D worked in quite a good 'field of depth' way throughout.The dialogue was 'meh' (think the newer Star Wars movies) and Aasif Mandi as the baddie general was a bit off-putting (as he's best known for being a sidekick of Jon Stewart on the Daily Show) but I don't really go to see a kids fantasy film for brilliant dialogue.We all came out having enjoyed it and looking forward to Book 2.Whilst it might be a bit fast/shallow/confusing if you've no idea of the milieu and could be really irritating if you are a geeky fan of the animated series, as a holiday kids movie (with popcorn) it ticked all the required boxes.The film did much better box office than its reviews would suggest so perhaps Book 2 will get made at some point.",The Last Airbender

After this beautiful thing is born, M. Night shows us the afterbirth. Ultimately this film leaves its audience like M. Nights newly named characters: stoic. I am done praying that M. Night comes back to us as he was during his glory days. I now realize that those films were flukes and he is actually really terrible at what he does.

They kept all of the key essential parts and did a great job at combining them to make sure that the story still got through to the audience.I don't understand all the haters. Did they expect to make an eight hour movie for book one just so they could include everything just as it happened in the anime? The ONLY key point that they left out which I believe is very important is his teacher in the northern water tribe which led to the back story of the last water bender of the southern tribe.Overall, I think it was very well portrayed and the choice of actors to play the roles was good. The only person in the whole movie who looked entirely out of place was one of the extras... The fat guy in the watertribe on top of the wall just before the battle. They started the shot by panning from his dumbfounded expression through the rest of the troops on the wall.

I enjoyed this film for what it was and not what it was not.It seems there is a movement to discredit this great film maker's works. Time after time I read how horrible his movies are (except for ""Sixth Sense) and time after time I see them for myself and always think they are very good or great (the only one I didn't like was ""Signs"" and that was because of the ending).For anyone who is not obsessed with the animated version and this being an accurate depiction of that medium, see the film and judge it on it's own merits. I have to think of ""The Shining"" by Stanley Kubrick. If you read the book, you realize there is SO MUCH detail left out in the film. Guess what? Read the book.Stephen King decided to make the Shining just like the book and I'm sure most people would agree it paled in comparison. Why? All the DETAIL was there, but it was too much and got tedious. I have a feeling this could have been the same situation, but regardless...I really enjoyed this film for what it had, and was not disappointed by what it was missing. Obviously a 6 year old is not going to ""get"" this...I think The Last Airbender probably captures the essence of the animated version.I would recommend anyone considering seeing it NOT to see the animated version, and not to listen to all this negativity and just enjoy this story, the acting, scenery and action for what it is here, which I feel is great!",The Last Airbender
720,thecurse005,M. Night Shyamalan needs to retire.,3,5 October 2010,"I found this movie to be a complete waste of time. After following the show I was happy to hear a movie was in production. Later I learned M. Night Shymalan would be writing and directing, I quickly became skeptical about his ability to deliver a straight forward movie let alone sum up 440+ minutes of storyline into 103 minutes.My assumptions were justified when the introduction began, as soon as I heard Katara's voice say ""AWvatar"" I cringed and regretted ever having any hope. Somehow they pronounced over half over the names wrong... including the main character. I hope M. Night Shymalan realizes it's ""AYng"" not ""AWng"", ""SAWka"" not ""SOAKa"" and ""EYEroh"" not ""EEroh"".As if getting names wrong wasn't bad enough, he drastically changed the storyline. They changed: how Katara got the water scroll, why and how Zuko's ship was attacked and where Iroh was when it happened. He even made the ending almost anticlimactic... WHAT A TWIST!The fighting and CGI were probably the best parts of this abortion Mr. Shymalan calls a movie and even those had flaws. Such as: Fire benders needing a source of fire, all benders required about 200% more martial arts like movements to bend anything, and in the end Aang is supposed to go in avatar state as a giant water monster... and let's just say... he didn't.In summation, M.

Worse than Superbabies, Disaster Movie, and Manos: The Hands Of Fate",1,22 August 2010,"I am the biggest fan in the world of the animated series that this ""movie"" was based on. (And I can't put enough quotes around the word movie.) Back 5 years ago when I was a teenager in high school, I managed to come across this TV show while simply flipping through channels. I had already seen previews for it, and I was a little interested. But I became an instant fan after watching the first 3 episodes. After that, I stuck around every week to watch a new episode. The finale episode of Season 1 is probably one of the most heartbreaking yet uplifting stories I have ever seen in my life. So the show, I give it 20 stars out of 10. Seasons 2 and 3 are even better. When I heard back in 2007 that an Avatar: The Last Airbender movie was in production, I was about to cry. I was more excited than anybody I knew. I thought to myself, ""This will be perfect for the show, it'll widen the audience, and it will be the biggest summer blockbuster in years."" For the next 3, count them, 3 YEARS, I followed every bit of production on the movie I could find, who the actors were, who was scoring the music, where they were filming it, what would be in it, and tons of other stuff. Some people doubted the film, but I followed it to the very end. When I saw the trailers, I WAS FLABBERGASTED. I went and saw the movie finally with high hopes, and came out practically in tears. M. Night Shyamalan has been notorious for having each of his films get progressively worse. The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs were good. The Village is alright. But Lady In The Water and The Happening are really bad. The Last Airbender is so bad that it has punched a permanent hole in my heart that will remain there for the rest of my life. A hole full of disappointment and hopelessness. This movie sucked all of the life out of the TV series and left it dry and tasteless. The acting was bad, the effects were laughable, the pacing was just horrible, the way the story was told was embarrassing, and the converted 3D was some of the worst I've ever seen. There was no comedy, there was no emotion, and there was no point. The movie was a carbon copy of The Phantom Menace and Dragonball Evolution: a franchise destroyer. Instead of widening the shows audience, it has narrowed it. People now will think that the show is as stupid as this movie. M. Night Shyamalan should be ashamed! He claims to love the show, but obviously not enough to not destroy it. M. Night Shyamalan, you should be proud, not only have you made the worst movie of all time, but you have officially destroyed a delicate part of my childhood, gangraped it, and left it for dead. After watching that movie I feel like a bitter old man. Please, for the love of everything still nice in the world, DO NOT make the next two movies of your trilogy. DO NOT ruin the two other good seasons of Avatar. Save yourself the embarrassment. I bet your next movie, Devil, is going to be even worse, but I don't think I can take anything worse.

Sure there was crummy acting but not to the degree that some people believe. As a fan to the series and someone who has seen first hand what a director can do to a movie i can say this is one of the best Cartoon/Anime live action movies i've ever seen, clearly this means there are no really good ones (I am not including super hero movies). What this movie has is the potential to create better sequels. I do believe that the directer does have the best interest of the viewers in mind. Some people need to understand that the director never does this type of movie and he could have MASSACRED this movie far worse. In fact there were moments in the movie that made me genuinely good inside. What the movie lacked in acting it made up for in some really well done atmosphere. In some cases this movie may have been more intact with the true nature of some of the characters than the show. This movie really show that Aang wishes to be a pacifist and that he does not like violence which the show doesn't delve into much until the third book.

Any time you're going to see a movie that has been adapted from a different source (like a book, or in this case, a TV series), you've got to expect that some changes will be made. They left all the most important story lines in, and most of the scenes happened exactly like what happened in the TV series. They left a lot out of the middle of the story, but people have to understand that that wouldn't be good for a movie. If they left every single little adventure in the movie, it would be like 8 hours long. They put the most essential plot lines in the movie. I really liked it. And my mom, who does not watch the TV series, really enjoyed it as well. She talked about it all night long and even decided to start watching the TV series because she liked the movie so much. One thing I must say I didn't like about the movie was that they pronounce a few names differently than they do in the series, like Aang and Sokka. I'm sure they had a reason for doing this, but it still irked me. They also left out a couple of my favorite characters from the TV series, Suki and Bumi.

729,ivan_540,The Last Airbender,5,2 July 2010,"This is a review for The Last Airbender. Now, I have not seen the animated series so I am clueless to the story and its characters but I did enjoy the movie. Of course the film does contain minor flaws but not to a point where the audience has to hate the film.These are the minor flaws: ACTING: I had trouble connecting with the characters. Only Zuko and his uncle were the two characters that I saw had some acting in them but the rest of the crew were lagging it. I was expecting a much more brighter and happier Aang but not on this film. He was completely the opposite of what I pictured in my mind. That is that.STORY: Straight to the point, the film was short. It would have been more interesting if the story was longer giving it a chance to develop more on the characters. It also seemed to go by rapidly.Now, the good parts in the film and what kept me in my seat are the effects. I truly enjoyed the effects of this film especially during the fight scenes although I have to admit, I found it humorous how the benders move before they reach into their powers but other than that I enjoyed it.I recommend the movie to all audience of all ages.",The Last Airbender
730,nabeel_ntg,Not so bad,5,3 July 2010,Let me start of by saying that I am not a crazy fan of Air Bender. I have only seen it few times when my nephew was watching it. I read some reviews before going to the movies. Everyone said that this movie sucks like anything.... Well thats totally wrong... the movie was not as bad as some crazy fans say it is.... When people say bad adaptation... I think of Dragonball Z movie (which probably was the worst movie ever)... Anyway yes the movie was a little rushed.. just cause they had to get on with the movie... they just cant sit and try to tell everything...Bottom line... The movie had good graphics... most of the things were just like how the cartoon was.... but remember this is a based on a cartoon.. so don't go to watch the movie as if its going to be as good as shawshank redemption... its only a kids movie.. so just relax... leave ur brain behind and enjoy the movie... :),The Last Airbender
731,Eronimus_Platts,Boy! That was rushed.,1,3 July 2010,"First off, if you do decide to see this movie (which I do not recommend), remember not to blink other wise you might be watching the credits. After the beginning where the main character (Aang, Katara, and Sokka) are in the Southern Water Tribe, they quickly end up in the Northern Water Tribe. With only 30 minutes left in the movie, it somewhat slows down. The movie went so fast through our heroes' journey, that there was no time for character development or background. You barely get to know the character at all in this movie. If I had not already seen the cartoon series, then I probably wouldn't have known the characters names or why Aang was so mad when he found Gyatso (meaning they didn't fully explain the relationship they had). Speaking of character names, for the life of me I can't think of a single reason as to why they change the character names, like Avatar, Sokka, Aang, Iroh, and even the term Agni Kai, pronunciations were changed. What was wrong with the way they said the names in the show?Now call me a purist, but because this movie was so rushed, it left out many crucial facts needed to develop a full story and character personalities as stated before. Most of the time the story decide to take an alternate path to interpret the story then that of the show. Like when Zuko and Iroh are in the fire nation colony discussing Zuko's past (which is the only time this happens) and a little kid explains it. Now how hard is it to use the story already provided, especially if the movie claims it's an adaptation of the show (which it is far from an adaptation)?The bending in my opinion was terrible, bender spent 5 minutes (exaggeration, but you get the point) waving their arms, stomping their feet, and spinning around like tops, before they can actually bend anything. I notice most of the time it was Aang and Katara that spent most of their time dancing and not bending. On that note when our heroes make their way to an earth-bending prison and cause a riot, there is scene where the camera shows 10 or so earth-benders stomping and waving their arms, before they send a rock the size of a fat cat slowly whizzing by. Now I was very disappointed to see fire-benders be degraded from the shows standards to the movie standards. If there is any justification for changing names on this movie, I would say change fire-benders to fire-manipulators. The inability for fire-benders to make their own fire (except for Iroh), made me question if they actually stood a chance at war, yet alone win.Minor things kept popping up through-out the entire movie that just added to my frustration. Such things like the abrupt introduction of the fire-lord. Again call me a purist, but I think it would have been better to do as the show and only show a shadowy silhouette, behind a wall of flames. Only to reveal his identity in the third movie (if there is even a possibility there will be a trilogy, lets just hope not). This would use the Darth Vader complex to a degree, never seeing the face of evil until the end. But while I'm talking about the fire-lord I have to say I liked this guy's voice, it really sounded like what an evil-villain's voice should sound like. Another frustrating part was at the end when Aang makes a wall of water contrary to the giant water monster from the show. Was there anything wrong with the original story of the Northern Water Tribe siege? I am not good at spotting good acting from bad; however I was under the impression that all of the actors/actresses were reading a teleprompter the whole time and that they all sounded like robots while they were reading. Katara really annoyed me; most of the times she looked like she had just gotten done crying and in no way did she properly represent the character Katara from the show. To me when I watch the show I get the impression that Katara is a feminist with the attitude that women can do whatever men can do and do it better. But the depth of Katara's character on the movie is practically transparent, the same going for all of the character, but her is just plain pathetic.Now I know it's impossible to cram everything into one movie. That why I now think (since watching the movie), that there should have been a two parter, because everyone of the 20 episodes of book one, are so full of detail and explain so much, that adds to the overall story, that it's impossible to cram it into an hour and 45 minutes. That's if people insist on a movie of the show, I myself believe there is just too much content in the show, that there is no way to make this show into a good movie. No matter how many times you make it. It will always be lacking enough detail to complete the story, unless of course you made 6 hour movie, but no one would want to see that.As for the 3D, I recommend watching it in 2D it's the same thing. Unfortunately the theater I went to had no 2D option so I spent extra on 3D. In the end I spent my time watching the movie without my 3D glasses and noticed no difference in picture quality. What I mean is that it wasn't blurry like the usual 3D movie when you take off you special glasses. In any case I was rip off spending extra money on the 3D in the first place.",The Last Airbender
732,timgneher,"Yes, it really is that bad",1,1 July 2010,"I walked into this movie with pretty low expectations. I didn't expect something as good as the cartoon, I didn't expect a perfect adaptation. I expected some glitzy action sequences, cheap emotional ploys, just some fun summer fair.What did I get? A movie so indescribably horrible I can only shake my head in bewilderment. Believe the critics. The writing sucks, the acting is stiff, the pacing clumsy, the 3-D beyond bad, the overall tone way too dark and brooding. Not much here is salvageable.Obviously Shyamalan got completely caught up in the mythology of the world and missed the fact that what made the original cartoon so great were the CHARACTERS. Of which there are none in this film.But really, even just a competently produced film would have been nice. And it almost was. The music was great. The special effects looked amazing, I don't care what anyone says. The fighting was cool. The sets were adequately spectacular. Indeed, it appears the only one who didn't show up for work was Shyamalan. While the adult actors manage to find their way somewhat on their own, the poor kids are obviously lost without someone competently leading them, they spend most of the film in a bewildered daze. Even some of the background extras acted awkwardly. But of course, there are no real survivors of Shyamalan's CLUNKER of a script. I can't believe someone didn't stop this guy. There were maybe two scenes that didn't sound awkward, and they had no dialog. I don't think any film has ever been such a disaster due to one man's gross ineptitude.Such a shame. It could have been so good.",The Last Airbender
733,belljar09,Pretty bad...,1,7 July 2010,"Just as everyone has said before... Shyamalan really did butcher this film. Several mispronunciations of important characters. The acting is terrible. The characters are not the same characters, their dialogue is way off and they over dramatize everything. The characters also do not look the same as mentioned by others. Uncle Iroh is suppose to be a fat, old, happy go lucky guy full of wisdom... not a tall skinny man with dreads. Sokka's hair is much too long and costuming all together wasn't that great. Not to mention most of the characters were Indian... not surprising considering Shyamalan is as well, but the characters are not Indian most are Asian like with some being a little less so like Sokka and Katara, who's characters looked the best to me in the movie. I work in a movie theater and I have never heard so many people complain about a movie expected to be so big. The movie hardly followed the important things that happened and added stuff that was stupid and had very little correlation to what was happening. With characters already set in place, I hope for the other books they can at least improve character personalities and dialogue.",The Last Airbender
734,ofvanityandwax,$150 million dollar disappointment,1,2 July 2010,"I went into the movie knowing it would not be even a fraction as good as the real show. However, I didn't know that would make me literally want to leave the theater in the middle of the very movie. How someone could do such damage in approximately an hour and forty minutes is entirely beyond me. It was ridiculous, the only way to describe it is a $150 million dollar failure. I could understand if the effects were not up to par but the biggest disappointment was the acting. It was so stiff and it never once felt like the actors meant a word they were saying. I caught a glimpse of an interview with Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone on TV and even their approach to that felt so wrong. It felt kind of disgusting to see as I've lately been watching Avatar: The Last Airbender (with extras) almost religiously for the past month.The script in itself should have been tossed into the garbage and burnt and it's remains locked away so that no one would ever have to suffer looking at such garbage. That's why I'm not really sure if it's the actors or the script that's really to blame for the atrocious ""movie"" that's resulted. The long and, I'm assuming this what they were going for, ""inspirational"" speeches merely consisted of crudely strung together clichés and the language left much to be desired. I found myself almost twitching at the phrase (something along the lines) ""You guys are AWESOME people!""...What I find the be so incredibly amazing is how someone could honestly fail to such a proportion when they literally have a blue print already created. The fans know how the characters look and sound and while I understand that no one fits the package perfectly one out of two would be better than nothing. As well, suddenly deciding to change the pronunciation of the characters name is definitely not the best idea, while I do understand that he wanted the names to sound like their Asian origin, it didn't go over well and the whole time I was just cringing at the mere mention of Aang and Sokka's names.This movie does not hold a candle to the original show. Heck, it should be retitled as it is hardly resembles the original in any way shape or form. While I do realize that not all episodes can be featured, the sequence of events just left you feeling awkward and confused. I, also, loathed the way they worked the bending in like it took five minutes of moving ones hands around awkwardly before any actual bending occurred. Most of the fighting was like fifteen minutes of martial arts with like the occasional bit of air bending and a little water being splashed around.There was nothing to love in this movie not even the most adorable of characters such as Momo. Momo had literally what three minutes in the entire movie which I found extremely depressing as Momo was always one of the characters I just wanted to cuddle because of his adorable mannerisms but in the movie I had no love for the digitized Momo. Not even Appa was interesting.This movie leaves me hoping and praying that M. Night Shyamalan goes broke and is black listed so that he can't ruin the series even more so. This is definitely something you will spend some time just trying to forget.",The Last Airbender
735,ztj1996,Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,1,12 September 2010,"In all my years of watching movies I've never hated movie in my life, and I've seen some pretty badly criticized films. However The Last Airbender was the first movie I've ever seen that I hated. First off, they pronounced half the characters names wrong just to ""respect the Asian pronunciation."" On top of that they took out the best scene from my favorite Television series Avatar: The Last Airbender such as the famous penguin sledding scene from Book One Chapter One. And if that wasn't enough they had to go out and choose actors who looked nothing like the characters from the series. In my opinion this film was made specifically to get all the fans of the series excited to see it as a Major Motion Picture only to be disappointed in the film. I remember my cousin talking to his mom about The Last Airbender saying ""Mom we have to see that because it looks awesome and it's my favorite show,"" I agreed with him, it did look good from the previews and the show was the best. Most of my friends where excited to see it too and we ended up going to the midnight premiere (though not in the same theater). From that point on it was all downhill for The Last AirbenderMy cousin and I spent about five minutes looking for seats only to have to sit in the worst possible seats ever, the front row. We had to look up to see the screen which was very uncomfortable for our necks. Luckily though the movie was so awful that I readjust my neck without caring if I missed anything. So to conclude these are the only ways you can see the movie and like it.1. You've never seen or heard of the series. 2. You don't mind low quality acting and okay effects 3. It's impossible for you to hate a movie.",The Last Airbender
736,White_Gateau,Avatar: The Movie that could have been good,1,5 July 2010,"A lot of people are saying Yeah, Avatar is a terrible terrible movie, or ""No! Avatar is a good movie! 10/10!"" And those 10 / 10 people are rating it because the 1/10 people, but they should stop and think for themselves, is this movie really worth 10/10? Is it better than Shawshank redemption? Better than the Godfather? Better than the office? Better than one flight over the cuckoo's nest? No! The reason people rated it 1/10 is because they TRULY feel like it deserves 1/10, at least giving -1 star per reason.I ASK YOU ONE THING, Just One thing!! If people think this movie is good, Why hasn't the original Creators, Michael Dante DiMartino, or Bryan Konietzko comment on this movie yet? You think if they approved of what M. Night did with it, they would have said anything, but to prevent tarnishing the movie yet, Hollywood has not released their reactions, I say we petition to get their input because if they are not allowed to say how terrible the movie is ( Most likely because their funding could be relying on it now ) then they're probably bottled up and about to explode.But I digress, All the reasons have been listed on why it is a bad movie, I have not personally seen the movie yet, but I can already tell you from all the trailers that it was a terrible movie. I was so excited to see a movie until the words M. Night Shyamalan appeared, and my fears were confirmed. The casting choice was terrible ( I don't mind if people were white, but why are all the fire-benders Indian? Was the Firenation based off of the over-populated and cow loving people of the Indian nation? No wait, they were based off of the Technologically advanced and power-hungry aggressive Japan, sure call me racist, but I just found it weird - almost like M. Night, who is Indian, wanted to give all his Indian friends a job so they could benefit off of this terrible movie. ) The inaccuracies was the #1 problem, and everyone must agree except for people coming into this movie and having no idea what it's about. Iroh was a skinny man with dreads, Zuko had a huge mullet ( which his topknot was missing! That was a large deal as well as the Jolly overweight Iroh ).They didn't even have the courtesy to say the character's name right for god sakes.I mean if this was any other movie I would have given it a 3/10 just for blatant rip off of avatar, but seeming how it is suppose to be avatar I give it a 1/10 because it was just SO inaccurate. The character development was bad and so were the scene transitions.People expected certain things from this movie, and M. Night couldn't deliver, he only knew about Avatar because his daughter watched it, he probably didn't even really care - hence why some of the scenes are soooo poorly done, and M. night taking his own ""twist"" on things which profound me- for example: If this is a show ""intended for kids"" Why did M. Night suck ALL personality and humor and funniness from the characters / script / story? He tried to make it dark and gloomy which is definitely not what the original authors of Avatar intended.I really really wanted to see this movie, but my friends have completely banned me from seeing it because they said it was so bad. I really want the next movies to come out, but not before they Remake this movie without using M. Night as the director!",The Last Airbender
737,frasertest87,A Warning...Spare Yourself,1,1 July 2010,"I have been a fan of the cartoon series since it began, yet I walked into this theater expecting the movie to be terrible. You see I did this to try and take the edge off the movie. In my mind, it was simple, if it's terrible I'm right and I feel sort of OK with the world, if it's good well then it's good. This usually works for me, I live around a cheap theater so I'm always walking into allot of terrible films.It didn't work.I'm going to review this film for those of you who are fans of the cartoon and for those of you who don't know anything about this film, because the film somehow fails on both fronts. To begin, I would like everyone to remember the recent live action rendition of Dragon Balls... Do you remember watching that and feeling a little sick. Sick that they not only they trashed the storyline, the characters, and general film-making practices. Remember how you thought, well it can't get worse than this. Enjoy ☺For those who didn't follow the cartoonShyamalan tried to squeeze a full season of a cartoon series into 2 hours, and in doing so focused only on the important plot points of a single character, Zhao, who is a minor character as the series goes. In doing so, he COMPLETELY misses any character development and all the other characters are simply are left with confusing monologues trying to explain (failing) the complicated world/storyline of the Airbender series. As such the world comes off 2D (HA!) and in a way where you never want to hear of spirits again. There is a saying in writing ""Show me, don't tell me"",the audience is told what to think, were not shown anything and it honestly comes off as if he thinks the audience isn't worth the effort. Looks like Shyamalan needs to go back to school, focused to much on pretentious symbolism I guess. I think Shyamalan did this in a basement. Remember the rumor he tried to spread a few years ago that he never left Philly. Well the only scene that seemed real, looked like the PA backwoods. Everything else was terrible and lacked perspective. Shyamalan likes close ups and dark corners, and the Airbender series required large scenes of light and deep horizons, it instills the feeling of a endless universe which helps sell spirits and another fantasy world. But Shyamalan's work is meant to be introspective, kind of lame-duck art student project where you see a chicken getting it's head cut off and your meant to see how it's a symbol for industrialism. Needless to say they couldn't have picked a worse director. He didn't have clue what he was doing. For the characters, writing, or scenery. As I think about it, the only REALLY dark character in the first season was Zhao. This character is small, maybe 5 episodes out of 20. I think he has the most lines in the movie hell he might even have most screen time of the characters. It's the only character Shyamalan felt any understanding of, kindred spirit I guess (which is funny cause he tries to kill all spirits). OH funny spoiler death was never something in the movie or series.. The ONLY observed death in the movie is Zhao who is suffocated to death on the screen, no cut aways. He wanted us to see this. I mean it's still a kids film! At least in the series he was dragged under water, this time, up in the air, in front of the screen panic stricken as he's suffocated to death. The action scenes are terrible. The martial arts are all show, this was intentional, so the actors were taught the bare minimum. As a consequence, they have no feeling in their movement, and despite the fact its not meant to touch their foes, it comes off as kindergarten secession at tiger Schulmann's karate. There was nothing rewarding about this film. The audience was half packed, and by the end, half had walked out. The remaining people booed. I have never seen this feeling so widely felt. Don't go, just forget about it, spare yourself.For those who followed the cartoonGuys they killed everything we ever loved about these characters. And we can't even blame the actors. I'm sure I would have been a little happier with some Disney larva instead of the standard nickelodeon rug rat, but it honestly wouldn't have made a difference. Shyamalan somehow wrote/approved a script without ANY hint of emotional depth whatsoever and picked kids that you could tell were just being herded in and out of plastic ice doorways to say meaningless one liners. Aang the Avatar, which somehow everyone in the movie pronounces differently then the cartoon?, is this hollow little kid. Remember how Aang was a happy kid, well this kid ain't got anything in him. Remember how Katara was strong willed and hopeful, now she just comes off as helpless and pathetic. Remember how Sokka was funny, well now it reminds me Jake Gyllenhaal in jar head, some war torn kid. Remember how Iroh was fat and happy with bits of wisdom? Well now he's just some dude. Hell the fire lord comes off as a Roman Emperor (likely intentionally) without any emotion which sort of conflicts with the whole fire thing. Zhao has the most character development out of everyone somehow. Enough with characters, it gets worse. Shyamalan has a cave with a dragon for the spirit world. You would think that Shyamalan a deadbeat director after as many ghost/spirit/alien films would have a sense of the other realm, well he missed it guys. I can't write this anymore. Yeah I'm done. Don't go guys. Spare yourself having to go through the process of getting your money back.",The Last Airbender
738,scady-780-886548,"I'm probably the only one saying this, but...",9,2 July 2010,"I personally thought this was a well done movie, it is the best M. Night has accomplished since ""The Sixth Sense""! The Last Airbender has a unique story line similar to the cartoon series, of course though, not exact, and this is where you must keep an open mind. The cartoon series will always be better, there's no doubt about that. But M. Night has made this wonderful fictional story into a film that just sucks you in immediately. The effects were amazing. He has used the best CGI effects I think I've ever seen. The acting is a little ""meh"" on some parts, but they can easily be fixable and improved if we get the next two movies following this one. There were a few cheesy parts, but to me, they had an adorable side to them. The story line was a bit rushed, but if you are paying attention, it won't seem as bad and even people who have not seen the cartoon series will find it decent to follow. M. Night clearly had a lot of fun with this film, and he put as much effort into it as possible. Whether you like the movie or not, you at least gotta give the guy credit. He put his heart and soul into this movie, and that is easily noticeable throughout the entire film. I say 9/10!",The Last Airbender
739,wonderwomyn2-780-296898,The Last Airbender: Okay....,10,2 July 2010,"Being a new fan to the cartoon version of the 'Avatar: The Last Airbender,' I had greatly anticipated seeing the movie. After seeing the film, I have had mixed emotions.The film is definitely not M.Night's best film. To be honest, it may be his worst film ever. However, with that being said, I did enjoy the movie for several reasons. Therefore, I am going to focus on what I DID like, and a little on what I didn't.First of all, the film captured the overall look of the and somewhat feel of the characters. I loved the actor playing 'Ang,' Noah Ringer. I found him to be very refreshing, in comparison to some of the child actors cycled through Hollywood by Disney and other industries. I also liked the adaptation of Ang's animal friend Momo and his animal guide 'Apa.' I loved seeing them both on the big screen, and wanted to see more of them as the film progressed. The actor playing Uncle Iroh was wonderful. I regret that the film did not capture the humor or innocence of some of the characters that had made them likable in the cartoon version.With regards to adapting the cartoon to film, it was not the best I've ever seen. I did feel as if important transitional scenes had been cut from the film. There were some slight changes, when comparing the film to the cartoon. If anything I hope an uncut version of the film is released on DVD. However, I didn't think M.Night did a bad job of compressing the 20 episodes of Book 1 into the film version.Lastly, if the film falls short, it is due to the pacing of the movie. Although I did not realize that two hours had passed, I did notice a lot of pauses and awkward transitions from once scene to the next. The action scenes in the film were not fabulous, but the scenes were not bad either. The scenes demonstrating the various benders of the elements were nice to watch. Again, I wanted to see more of the fight scenes with the bending the elements, rather than large epic battles.Still, I enjoyed the movie, and I think kids will enjoy this movie too. I will more than likely own this movie, and I hope Hollywood follows through with making Book 2 & 3. The only suggestion I have is for Hollywood to think of replacing the director, who should be blamed for the poor reviews of this film.",The Last Airbender
740,robjrob2,One Question: Did Shaymalan Even Watch the Damn Series?!,1,2 July 2010,"How should I put this?! This is one of the WORST movies I have ever seen and I really want my $ back. M. Night should be put in front of a firing squad for releasing this piece of unimaginative, choppy, GARBAGE. I used to defend Shyamalan because I enjoyed his earlier work, Sixth Sense and Signs in particular. But that ends NOW!! This movie was appalling. I knew as soon as the narration began that it was not going to be very good. First off the ACTING was absolutely GOD awful. Every single actor came up small and was simply awkward. A LARGE part of that is due to Shyamalan. One of the many EPIC FAILS that arouse from the atrocity that was this movie was the complete Miscast of EVERY SINGLE ACTOR. I am not kidding when I say this; I seriously think Shyamalan picked random actors. The whole notion of casting one of the four kingdoms as one race is ridiculous. WHy in the hell is the Fire Nation Indian? In what part of the series did this idiot Shymalan get the impression that they were Indian? I watched every single episode of the series and I promise you not one character was made to be Indian. It is insulting for him to place his own views of what Avatar SHOULD be into a picture. Commander Zhou, who was a huge part of Book 1 as the main antagonist was played by a damn COMEDIAN. Thats right Aasif from The Daily Show played a character who was supposed to be a ruthless, cold-blooded, killer. Its not surprising then that it was a complete flop. Firelord Ozai, who was also played by an actor of Indian descent, played a major part of this movie when in actuality he was only seen as essentially a shadow in the FIRST book of the series. Some of my favorite characters, Sokka, and Iroh who were hilarious and entertaining characters in the duration of the series, were empty shells who made no attempt at comedic relief. HOW in the world did Shyamalan ignore this part of the series?! Again the question of whether or not he even bothered to watch the series should be raised. Also another complete show of disrespect to the series was the FIREBENDING element. The fact that none of the firebenders, save Uncle Iroh, were unable to bend without a fire source when throughout the entire series they were the source of their own fire is infuriating. Why the hell would you ignore this fact?! And if you were to make a complete change like that at least make it entertaining. Watching the benders use fire sources, like when Zuko attacked Katara and Aang in a North Pole scene with a damn torch as his source and then lying it on the ground to start a fire was PATHETIC. WHY SHAYMALAN WHY?! And the bending in general was made to look overdone and awkward. In the climactic scene why did Aang's waterbending scene to finish off the FIre Nation's invasion preceded by a damn cut from DANCING WITH THE STARS?! Um, I'm sorry but when I watched the series the bending movements were reflected by the movement of the actual elements. In ShyAmalan's farce he calls a movie the firebending was preceded by a cordial dance which was followed by a random fire ball or something like it. The only GOOD thing about this movie was the special effects that consisted of the bending and the CGI that created Appa. Which isn't saying a lot because they had a $150 Million budget. Finally, in reference to the accuracy of reflection from he series to the movie what was easily the WORST thing for me was the pronunciation of the names. I'm sorry Shyamalan but if you had bothered to even watch ONE episode of the series you would clearly hear all the names pronounced correctly yet somehow SOKKA became SUKAH, Aang, became AHNG and IROH became EROH. Really?! This is such a blatant spit in the face of the original fans that it is hard to put into words. Every time I heard Sokkah's name called I LITERALLY cringed a little each time. It was painful to listen to.Now about the actual ""film"" itself, and I use the word rather loosely. In fact to correct myself this piece of garbage was a collection of really bad scenes lumped together into a 2 hour long anal probe. Everything about the plot, I also use that term loosely, was rushed and completely unengaging. The whole series of Earth Kingdom scenes was appalling. In fact when that whole series began I LOL, although it was not for a good reason. The terrible acting that passed as Sokka asked Aang if he though it would be a good idea to help out random Earth cities. He of course awkwardly responded ""Yeah"" in a weird boyish like attempt to reflect Aangs character and of course that was awfully done. And when they first arrived to the North Pole and the terrible narration from Katara said that ""Sokka and Yue fast became friends"" was laughably bad. OH REALLY?! Thanks for that little tid bit of information to fill the endless plot holes that ruined this vomit inducing film. The whole idea of her random narration used to cover up plot holes was just ludicrous. In a painful CONCLUSION I would like to request that Shyamalan take what ever is left of his now pathetic career and FIREBEND that beast into OBLIVION. In his best work there is that famous line ""I see dead people"", well I see a dead career and I will give you a hint as to who it is....as the CREDITS made sure to remind us of he WROTE, PRODUCED AND DIRECTED this garbage!!",The Last Airbender
741,kittylovepocky,A storyline with so much promise left abit underdeveloped,7,2 July 2010,"~* I admit I love the avatar the animated series on nick :). My sisters and myself watch the TV show religiously whenever we can. We literally grab snacks from the kitchen and watch the ""Avatar"" marathons on nick with kool aid smiles on our faces.M. Night Shyamalan in my opinion did a decent job fitting the whole ""1st"" season of avatar into his film. I mean you could only fit so much into a movie, he tried his best and captured the main points of the 1st season.It is obvious that ""The Last Airbender"" is Hollywood-ified like any other beloved storyline. And as we all know all story lines are manipulated and changed. It is inevitable.I mean an 1hr and 43 minutes. For a whole 1st season. He did a great job. I greatly enjoyed the film. The CGI & special effects where just amazing!The Main characters ""Aang, Katara,Sokka,Princess Yue,Appa and Momo "" looked just like their counterpoints & their worldly environments where just ""head on"".It was a nice twist that M.Night chose the slum dog millionaires star ""Dev Patel"" as Prince Zuko. I thought that was an interesting twist that brings more promise to the film. Also can't forget the Sokka's actor ""Jackson Rathbone"" also known as ""Jasper"" from the Twilight Saga. A Saga that seems to be the brain juice for more than half of today's modern society.I understand the in's and out's of the ""Last Airbender Series"" So I can say that I understood it fully and enjoyed it.I can also understand why there are so many mixed reviews. The characters in the film are developed and paced quickly from one task to the next.Therefore the general audience with no idea what the ""last airbender"" is about, won't develop any sort attachment or understanding of the characters.I'm pretty sure M.Night will redeem for his flaw to the general audience in his second film. With a deeper character development, because in actuality there was nothing wrong about the film. Did I mention the special effects where awesome? haha(that is if after this there is a second film..)As a fan I do hope there will be. I do recommend getting an understanding of the ""the last Airbender series"" first to truly bond with the characters. The Original Animated series is so epically written and portrayed I know why so many fans where disappointed.But what did they expect?Book 1: Water in its entirety can't fit or be snipped down anymore than was this film.

The casting felt like they had seventeen Hollywood executives in the room who never saw the series and picked people according to their IMDb rating (no offense IMDb) All and all it just felt stale and forced. they tried to cram everything into this movie and never let you take in the story or give it a real chance to suck you into the Avatar's world.

The right-holders for the series had the best opportunities to make a blockbuster with the movie.the decision to involve M.Night Shyamalan was the worst they might could have chosen. all the people attending the movie are driven there because, even if the reviews are such bad, there might still be 1% hope left that the producers did catch at least 1% of the quality from the series - i have to sadly deny this. There is not one scene worth to remember.M.Night Shyamalan has killed the soul, all the excitement, its just a complete ruin. i cant believe that the right-holders of the series were such ignorant in choosing this producer, economically they could have created a waterfall of money by choosing a capable producer.M.Night Shyamalan certainly does not have the quality for big movies, i do hope this was the last one that i see airing on cinema in the US.",The Last Airbender
744,seanwilliams78,Don't listen to the Sheeple...,7,8 July 2010,"This movie ended up being a pleasant surprise. If you're expecting it to hold true to the original cartoon (which I've never seen), it sounds like that's the recipe for disappointment. I've never seen the original cartoon, so I didn't have any predispositions about the movie.I'm also not a big fan of M. Night Shamalamadingdong (or as I also like to call him, M. Night Over-rated). I was dragged to this movie last night by friends, and they even had to buy my ticket because I wasn't interested in seeing this movie from just the commercials I'd seen.I only registered on IMDb to post this more positive review, after just seeing this morning that people are needlessly bashing a very entertaining, fun, family friendly movie, largely because it didn't live up to their predispositions.I ended up being very glad that I went - it was very entertaining, the effects were quite good (I'm also not a fan of most CGI), and the acting was at least on par with your typical Nic Cage, Keanu Reeves, or Tom Cruise flick (they're all marginal at best, FYI) - the difference here being that most of the leads are not only relatively new/inexperienced actors, but also child actors, which apparently people don't seem to realize or take into consideration. All 3 leads are played by children. I enjoyed seeing the faces of some unknowns, personally.Moviegoers these days don't seem to have much of an imagination, and it's a shame. If a film doesn't live up to their predispositions, it's a ""bad film."" I guess that's what we get get for letting Hollywood dummy down the movie industry for so long, catering to the lowest common denominator. If your imagination fills in the blanks, movies like this have you leaving the theatre waiting for the next installment. I'm looking forward to ""Book 2"" of this series, as long as reviews from simpletons and sheeple don't kill the funding!",The Last Airbender
745,MsKitty77,C'mon people...really??,8,9 December 2010,"I can't believe the hate this film has received since it opened. Talk about the media influencing the collective opinion of the American movie-goer! My 3 children (ages 12, 8, and 6) and I are huge fans and avid viewers of the television series that this film is based on, and we as a family, as well as individuals, LOVED this movie. Sure they made some changes and left some things out, but what movie adapted from another source material doesn't do that?? The name thing was probably the most glaring change, but it really didn't bother any of us. My children did ask me why they said the names different and I explained that the director felt it necessary in his vision to correct the pronunciations. They accepted this as fact and continued enjoying the movie. We all knew what was going on, and I'm guessing being watchers of the TV series helped with that. My 6 year old would even point out the parts of the film that were different from the series, giving the rest of us a sort of ""oh yeah"" moment. We enjoyed the actors they chose to play the parts, and none of my children complained about anyone's race differing from that of the characters in the series...they didn't even notice. I thought the fight scenes were beautiful to watch and were visually pleasing. I do feel that they could have made the movie a bit longer, as it seemed rushed at times. We purchased the DVD via pre-order and cannot wait for the next installments to come out. I should also point out that my sister and my coworkers, who had never seen the series, watched this film and loved it as well. My sister had to run out and buy all of the seasons of the TV series after seeing this movie. So again I have to ask, did this movie really deserve all the negativity it has received? I really don't think so. Obviously some sort of witch hunt in my opinion. So to those who have not seen this simply because they ""heard it was bad"", please watch it and form your own opinions.

746,finalaxy147,Not as bad as people think.,5,8 July 2010,"I didn't expected anything when I saw this movie. In fact, I had really little knowledge of the Cartoon, but I thought it didn't look THAT bad.Granted it is not a good movie, it's far from terrible. The problem with the movie is that they tried to put ALL the animated season in the movie. Characters and story development would have benefit from a lighter amount of plot lines. Dialogue really was BAD, and the exposition was quite arkword, however, the story itself is okay. The two main character are developed enough to explain the necessary plot lines, and overall, it only suffers from trying to do too much.Whatever people said, the visual aspect saves this movie from failure. It's been a long time since I saw well done action scenes, without shaky camera and thousand of shot a second. The shots gives a clear view of the overall battle so you can clearly see what's going on. The fighting choregraphies were stylish and refreshing, and demonstrates beautiful CG effects, even tough the 3-D is completely useless. You have to admit, this is a really cool looking movie. The music is nice, but not very memorable. Let just say it compliments the story.Overall, the movie wasn't good, and wasn't terrible. It could have been better with less plot points and better casting (I think the avatar and the prince really sat well in their respective role, but the rest of the cast doesn't). It was entertaining, but it's all. It's not a movie you watch times and times again. It simply suffers from being between the expectations of kids who loved the cartoon and the serious audience for whom it gives itself its mature tone. Most of time, you just can't please both.",The Last Airbender

748,princekelso,"Good special effects, everything else is bad.",1,9 July 2010,"SPOILER WARNING Lets start off with a positive side of the movie. It follows the series very well, and the special effects are very good.That is about the only good thing I can say about this movie.The actors were terrible in this movie. Not only could they not act, they also didn't portray the characters from the series very well, Prince Zuko being a prime example. The thing that really annoyed me was the relationship between Sokka and Princess Yue. It was so unrealistic and unbearable to watch. SPOILER: For example, at the end of the movie when Princess Yue is sacrificing herself for the moon spirit, it is meant to be sad. It isn't. Not even at the slightest bit. I honestly think that M. Night Shyamalan purposely made it this bad for the kiddos, because the 8 year old girl that I went with really liked it.Lets end this review on a positive note. Uncle Iroh (Shaun Toub) was the star of this film. He had great acting and played his part perfect.3/10",The Last Airbender

The fact that they changed the name of the main character has upset A LOT of people. Aang to Oong doesn't seem like a big jump but boy was it, other name mistakes were made besides this, but this was the most outrageous. The plot felt very rushed as opposed to the cartoon, so a lot of the down time with the children just hanging out or practicing bending was lost. The brother would always make jokes in the show and he didn't at all in the movie. At first the water bending teacher refuses to teach girls in the show until he finds a surprising connection, which ALSO was not featured in the movie! I guess what I'm saying is, they sacrificed accuracy for excitement. I can see wanting it to be an intense movie because there's a lot of potential for it to be a very cool action movie,but don't change too much or you'll have furious fans on your hands.",The Last Airbender

751,mkhoury80,"Great movie overall, very few flaws, don't believe the anti-hype.",8,18 July 2010,"Before going to see this movie, I was advised not to by my roommate who has seen the entire Avatar series and who has never seen the movie, and refuses to based on what he's heard, things like that the character names aren't pronounced ""correctly"", the main character is a martial arts expert not a 'real' actor, and that the plot doesn't follow the original series.Well, I went to see the movie with my girlfriend knowing all this well in advance, expecting the worst, thinking 'the acting is going to be horrible', 'the plot is going to be nothing like the series', 'the names are going to sound funny' and so on.For starters, I found the acting of the main character to actually be quite impressive by a child actor who has –zero- previous experience acting on screen. Admittedly he did seem somewhat 'stiff' at times with little emotion, but I think this was actually a good thing considering the serious plot which involves death, loss, war, tragedy, politics and so on, I feel it helped emphasize the main character as being human who has just been through a lot, not just some little kid without a care in the world, and there was at least one part where he did act more like a kid full of glee and acting silly, but it was in a more appropriate setting. I would say that all in all, the character acted very ""realistically"".As far as the names not being correct, this is a tough call; the names -are- correctly pronounced if you are pronouncing them in Japanese. What adds irony to this though is that the names -are- Japanese, but the series was made in America, with characters with Japanese names, and in which the names (in the original series) are all pronounced totally wrong, based on their spelling and origin.Something which added an even more awkward ""am I watching something that came from America or something that came from Japan?"" moment was that there are depictions of writing in the movie (and intro) using -Japanese- letters, but most of the characters are Caucasian, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but in this regard, the movie perfectly reproduces how I felt watching a TV series episode: I'm watching something that's Americanese or Japerican, it can't make up its mind about what nationality it's from, so it's awkward, but it's a match.And as far as the plot goes, I bantered with my roommate with some Q&A and from watching some of the beginning of the series myself, the plot does match the series pretty much pound for pound with very little deviation; whatever nuances or differences there may be, they're not really serious, they're tiny minuscule details that only the most hardcore fanatics would notice. As a person going to see the movie not having seen the series, it all fit, there were no obvious holes, and it made sense.Overall, I think it's a great movie plot, had top-notch effects work, excellent choreography, and the overall feel of the movie and the characters fit with a serious storyline and atmosphere that all blended together very well. The acting could have been a little less stiff at times but overall it worked well and I anticipate it to only get better as the actors gain experience in time. I enjoyed it, my girlfriend enjoyed it, and it seems to have received a lot more flak than it deserves, definitely worth seeing.",The Last Airbender
752,badger-of-doom,Should have been a good film.,3,7 October 2010,"I will start this with an admission, I have never seen anything about Avatar before this film, I imagine like most people who may be unfortunate to see it.The Idea is a good one, 4 Nations each have ""benders"" of a single element representing there own nation.Air, Water, Earth and Fire.One person the ""Avatar"" can bend all 4 elements and contact the spirit world and keeps the 4 kingdoms in balance.Which should give you a film that has plot holes but is forgiven due to an amazing spectacle.This leads to my issue's with the film, the Scenery seemed fake and much less than the epic landscapes required for this kind of film.The Characters were as 2 dimensional as the scenery, we were offered zero motivation for the main protagonists, we still had plot holes too.The main problem (the if done correctly the thing that could have redeemed all above) was the actual bending itself, it was poor.Zero spectacle, to begin I was hoping it was because the ""benders"" were learning the arts and so it would ""ramp up"" as the film went on, however even the show stopping wall of water that scared away the fire nation left me thinking, not as as good as the big wave in that surfing film with Swazey in it.In an age of remakes, re-imagining and OTT effects I hope this gets redone, it could and should have been jaw dropping in the cinema, the kind of film people love but the critics sneer at.instead it just leaves everyone feeling more than a little short changed.",The Last Airbender

Non were mentioned in the movie!!! it is when the master refuses to teach Katara that she gains her healing skill which she will use at many dramatic times in the rest of the story, (including saving the Avatar's life!!) yet, Katara in the movie doesn't have a clue about healing!! who says the Avatar doesn't kill? its only Aang who doesn't want to kill as he is just a kid, yet in his Avatar form he kills a lot. and that water bending in the final scene, its completely wrong, he had to unite with the ocean and the moon in that small lake instead of looking at the scenery from the hill and saying 'lets move some water here, shall we??'and what on earth is the aim of raising that water if you wont hit? scare the fire nation away? give me a break, I thought they would turn back and attack again!. 'when you point to something in the scene, you need to use it', Shyamalan, directing 101!! and FYI these are not personal interpretations which are quite natural in adaptations, there are clearly mistakes!!!I literally wanted to cry at the end of the movie! could it be done any worse? please don't let him ruin the second and the third one, and if you haven't seen the movie, yet, don't! watch the cartoon over and over. that's what I had to do when I came back home from the theater to get rid of the bad effect of the movie",The Last Airbender
754,marc-broehmer,What was he thinking?,1,24 August 2010,"OK, think I don't have to add things to what the other said about the movie; but what the hell did Shyamalan think by doing this movie?

Thank god I didn't pay any money for this movie. Btw. If you really consider to go to the cinema; please buy another ticket; just in case.... OK; and because I have to write 10 lines I have to say sth 'bout the characters... In my opinion the only one who really tries (but wouldn't totally let to) to adopt the character of the series is Sokka.. Even if they can't spell his name right in the movie..

The plot well it was OK. 3D don't waste your money with please for the love of god do not waste your money on the 3D version of this film. OK I have really mixed fellings about m.night after watching this movie. Every movie I see of his even the happening and the lady in the water. I enjoy I just like those movies I enjoyed the last airbender when I just ignored the actors. M.Night its not his fault he is making bad movies I just honestly think its not his fault. I think its the audience. After the sixth sense people we're like oh yes bring on more suspense and creepy stuff. I mean he was on the suspense genre for like ten years people because the audience wanted more suspense and a huge twist in the end. The last airbender was his first time out of the suspense genre and you know what he wasn't used to it yet because people wanted more scares. Oh and please do not skip the movie devil which comes out this fall just because his name came up on the trailer he is just producing the film not directing it. Anyways I am more ranting then reviewing. The last airbender in my opinion was an OK movie I liked the story hated the acting and the special effects you know what were all right.

756,euanbuddie,Alright,8,11 August 2010,"I've got to say there are some pretty harsh reviews on here about Last Airbender. And although I agree with a lot of points, I must also disagree. Some have said that it was dismal, Boring etc. But through my eyes (A 14 year old who loves the series) the film wasn't all to bad. I will address several issues with the film, that I agree with and don't agree with.1)The pronunciation of names - When I first heard that the pronunciation of the names for some of the characters had changed I was Disgusted, that was until I watched the film. The exaggerated claims of he way the names were spoken soon left my thoughts and it got me thinking. Perhaps the way the names in the SERIES is wrong. It sounded much more natural when they spoke to each other in the film. It takes a little getting used to, but it doesn't affect the film in any way.2) Momo and Appa - I would just like to say that these characters in the film WERE a fail. They looked like they had been scraped together in about an hour. And what's up with the voices? Why does Appa sound completely different to the series? Luckily this is something that can easily be fixed if there was to be a next film.3)Themes - Now I know a lot of people have complained that the themes behind the story were just not there. This I partly agree with. But give Night some credit. He had to fit 12 hours of content into an hour and 40 minuets. Even so I think that he managed to get a feel for the series by showing a theme of self-belief. I think this was the main focus of the film. But I think more heart could have been put in with a bit more Love, Regret etc.4)Narration - OMG, What a drag. Look Night if your reading this then listen up. No more boring Narration. Try livening it up a bit, or adding scenes that relate the narration. e.g. When they reach the Northern Water Tribe, when Katara narrates them introducing themselves, have a muted scene of Aang speaking in the background and the people shocked. Also, when katara narrates about Sokka and Yue, then have them talking while walking down next to the river or something (muted of course). A few of the quick cut scenes would add more of a understanding to the narration.5)Graphics - Wow! No matter what anyone says, those graphics were incredible. The bending was beautiful and The scenery was gorgeous. I loved the tattoos on Aang. Just wonderful, really.6)Storyline - I was a bit disappointed by this. Most of the loved characters were not in. But I completely understand why. Time was not in the bags. But please, Night, Be careful with what you keep and don't keep. The Kyoshi warriors by the way. They are a very important part of the series. If it were not for them then Azula would not of captured Ba Sing Sai. If you make another movie (in retro-spect, i do) then you will need to think of a clever way of overcoming these failures.7)The Beginning - This was dismal! I wanted to cry when I didn't hear Katara's original Episode starter. I was very upset. Me and my mate were growling from the start. But off the bad note, I did love the fact that there was a 'Book One:Water' And the element showing at the beginning of one of the shows was on there. I do believe this is what drove people to think badly. Always make sue you have a good beginning.8)Acting - This is a problem that people have been moaning about. They said that it was horrific, no heart'. But I, however, do not. Of course it wasn't all good. There were some dire parts of it. But not as bad as everyone makes out. I would especially like to congratulate Noah Ringer for a surprisingly brilliant performance. Everyone on the cast did well actually, but little Noah, who had never done a movie before, got my attention and he was great. I also liked Dev as well. He gave a believable performance.",The Last Airbender
757,rafaelrodriguesmendes,"The film tells the adventure of Aang, a successor of an order called Avatar that can master magical powers related to the four natural elements: fire, earth, water and air.",1,8 September 2010,"Not always aerial shoot or shoot against the light of a sunset outlining the silhouette of the protagonist and a booming soundtrack is enough to turn the film into an epic. Many try, but the feat is almost impossible. Since in addition to please film critics, the director has to appeal especially those who do turn the wheel of fortune of the film industry: the spectators.Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan, Indian-born U.S. citizen, better known as M. Night Shyamalan, he began his directing career in 1992, but was in 1999 that got world attention with Sixth Sense, the movie that cost 40 million and grossed $ 600 million worldwide. Under the spotlight and watchful eyes of critics and deserved fans, Shyamalan - like any other in his place - began to arouse anxiety in those who liked his style of storytelling. But it seems that the career of this renowned director has been on the tracks of a roller coaster and so far only tends to go down. After being accused of plagiarism and his films are the target of negative criticism, deservedly earned the label of ""one-trick pony"" because he has religiously followed the same route structure in his movies. Asked about criticism he responded saying: ""All my movies Have twist endings, or that they're all scary. All my movies are spiritual and all have an emotional perspective. Witty, no doubt. But wise? Maybe not.Fans of Shyamalan, like any fan, continues to support the movies, crowding the cinemas waiting for a movie so great and surprising as some which fulfill his curriculum. But it seems the wait will continue. This week I watched The Last Airbender (The last Master of the Air in Portuguese). I did not know that the story was based on a successful Nickelodeon's cartoon. And I went to a cinema expecting nothing and left the cinema without taking anything.The film tells the adventure of Aang, a successor of an order called Avatar that can master magical powers related to the four natural elements: fire, earth, water and air. The film tries to be great all the time, but it also loses itself all the time with a script extremely truncated, full of clues that are not resolved. The film tries, but fails to please. Neither the 3D effect holds the viewers attention as it seems to have been done quickly and did not cause any effect on the audience. It's an extremely complex story, full of unresolved subplots and dramas that are hidden until they are clearly resolved in future sequels. In short, the problem is the screenplay written by the director himself. But would the studio produce a sequel? Or ""Failed"" Shyamalan epic shall follow the trail of failures like Eragon and The Golden Compass? Promises that were planned with great productions to be (maybe) trilogies, but not carried a sequel?If you like to see surreal sceneries, impossible fights, special effects, and if you are an inveterate fan of Mr. Shyamalan (and do not care about the quality of the movies he makes) sure you will like. Shyamalan is the kind of director who seems to do the movie for himself and do not really care about what others will think about his movies. Even when the studios will finance his failures only time will tell.",The Last Airbender
758,patnjer13,Better than most of these reviews make it out to be...,8,21 January 2012,"I came into this film without any notion of the anime version. I was simply looking for an action film that would be safe for my 4 year old. While the film isn't *really* worth 9/10 - maybe more like 6 or 7 - I feel that something needs to balance the overly sensitive reviews that make up IMDb for this film.After watching the movie I was interested enough to find out when part 2 came out. In doing so I found that the movie had been adapted from a cartoon. I've *never* liked any anime. My best friend growing up was a dragon ball z fan boy, and it drove me crazy... But, I decided to give the cartoon a try regardless.The changes seem reasonable. The cartoon takes a very long time from beginning to water bending, and the film would have been pointless if it had not gotten to that point. So how to fit 6+ hours of story in a <2 hour movie? (considering that it was made for kids I doubt anything longer would have held their attention) Considering this thought process, I feel that the reworking did very well at hitting all of the major points, but getting to the point. Character development could have been better, but again - that was a LOT of material to fit into a small window.Further, IMO the way the discovery of the avatar was handled better - having them clueless until the air temple when Aang found out about his friends - was vastly more emotionally compelling this way. Same with Iroh helping to save the moon spirit.To be brief, the basic point of my post is that the movie was good *enough* to make me want more. Regardless of any other points that could be made, that is a solid indication to me that it was definitely NOT the one-star movie all of these others make it out to be.",The Last Airbender
759,leggzzzz929,Not so much...,2,27 February 2011,I'm giving this a 2 b/c it has potential. Two of the main characters were mis-cast... that being Katara and Sokka.. these two actors do not live up to their parts.. if anything there should have been a Asian/Hawaiian/Eskimoan with blue eyes playing Kataras part (even if it meant bringing in a no-namer).. and Sokka's character just had no chemistry... I love the actor Jackson for the Twilight series.. just not for the Last AirBender. -The narration by Katara put full focus on her.. and you just noticed that she just was NOT THAT ONE! Aang and Zuko were cast perfectly. If they don't get the casting right perfectly next movie (change Katara and Sokka ASAP) the next movie will BOMB!..

760,jehesselberg,The Last Airbender is a great movie,8,1 October 2010,"On the whole, The Last Airbender is a great movie. The visuals are beautifully done and the tone is dark, as it should be. Most of the complaints I've heard from others are really trivial: people have complained that they don't like how the names are pronounced, well too bad. M Night stated that he wanted them to be pronounced correctly according to Asian pronunciation rather than the Americanized pronunciation used in the Nicktoon. Some argue that it moves too fast, but these people need to remember that this movie is intended for children and that children have much shorter attention spans than adults; therefore the pace needs to be quicker. And there are others who believe that the source material (show) was an anime. That too is false, Avatar: The Last Airbender is a Nicktoon made by Americans in a pseudo-anime style that has become popular in America over the last five years. M Night had a task of taking the first season of the Nicktoon which had twenty-something episodes and fitting the overall plot into an hour-and-a-half long movie. And I think it was done pretty well. It touches on most every main plot point in the first season; although I think that it would have been better as a two-hour movie, with a little more time to flesh certain things out. The acting is amazing, and apart from a couple scenes the cinematography is great. I hope that he continues and makes the sequels. And to those who constantly complain about this movie, please keep in mind who is the intended audience.

761,vhunterd1337,"Awful, just pure crap!",1,7 October 2010,"You know, I gave M Night the benefit of doubt by going to see this, but I just wasted almost 2 hours of my time. I don't understand how this film got passed the screening. The acting, laughable Dialogue, and cheesy editing made the film look like it was done by an amateur who can't read, write, or direct a popular franchise that was supposed to be a big epic trilogy. The movie felt like it was some random events with bad actors (though not their fault) that seemed to leave out character development. The special effects looked cool but they look too artificial and wasn't convincing at all (except for background landscapes). 3D viewing was pointless. I can't believe millions of dollars were spent on the 3D conversion, and they can't even get that right. Besides the poor filmmaking, why in the world did Shyamalan go out of his way to cast non Asian and native American actors for the leads when the animated story was about those cultures? Pretty lame Mr. Shyamalan!",The Last Airbender
762,Robin-Intorcia,"Hopefully this movie truly is the ""Last"" air bender.",1,18 November 2010,Where can I begin to review a movie with so many problems? Take the actors and the script out of the picture but leave the scenes and the action in place. Replace the actors with people who actually know how to act and immerse themselves into there role. As well as burning the original script and getting someone who actually knows how to write a script and how people would act in situations and this movie would of been 10xs better. The acting was horrendous and that is what I keep coming back to At the very start of the movie Katara the young water bender splashes her brother sokka and he is supposed to be angry at her He gets up and stomps over to her his facial expression was completely flat and his lines were delivered in and almost bored or struggling manner and the remaining actors fair no better. You may wish to blame the script but there is no excuse for the horrible acting they delivered they did not even try.Now the script is where it really falls apart at one point Prince Zuko the man who has been chasing them all around the world arrives to capture aang during the raid on the northern water temple so What does Katara say? Oh no its the fire lords son prince zuko! Is that the first thing that comes to mind? She could of said you again? or why cant you just leave us alone? and zuko could respond The avatar is the only way I can restore my honor and you will not stand in my way ARRAG fire blast! That right there is ten times better.And at the ending of the movie we are introduced to princess Azula she was my favorite character in the animated series and I can tell you right now from the 10 seconds of screen time she delivered I was not impressed. She has none of the evil or sinister feeling that Azula provided. Her voice sounds more like a whiny teenage girl where as Azula had more of a deep and sadistic voice and then she *attempted* to put on and evil smile which failed utterly. It looked like she had just got done having relations with one of the guards. This movie was horrible and if they insist on making another they better throw the idea of a sequel out and remake this pile of garbage and do it right.Now lets get into the visual and graphical effects of the movie which were decent but failed to deliver. one of the most beautiful and awe inspiring aspects of the animated series was never the fighting IMHO. it was interesting and cool ill give it that but what made viewers tic was the land and the journey. while I admit some of the areas did look rather amazing I was left with a void and unfulfilled feeling. Apa and momo I believe are seen twice throughout the movie in full detail and they look like a complete disaster. The action scenes are also not that not very well done. in the series every movement meant something. in this movie the actors flail around as if having a convulsion only to shoot a single slow moving rock or ball of fire when they get to earth bending you will laugh trust me. Your eighty year old grandmother could effectively dodge there bending. The 3d is also a wasted feature that only serves to give you a massive headache but regardless thats probably unavoidable. I could go on and on but Id just be repeating what hundreds of others have said overall this movie is a complete disaster avoid it like the plague and spend your money on more important things like a hair cut and some cheese.Now I realize they cant cram in 8 hours of a movie into a 2 hour film but there was not even and attempt at grasping the concept of the avatar and his friends adventure or any of the magic at all it was as if they teleported from place to place and many of scenes made little sense. and only served to confuse fans of the series and make new comers become completely lost. They also made changes to the names of the characters and every time you hear katara say Ah-ng you will cringe have they never heard the expression don't mess with success? I suppose that should of applied to this entire movie.,The Last Airbender

Everything he has done since the Village has suffered by writing mostly. I may never see another of his films after this, including another Avatar. The two key things that ruined this movie were writing and casting. The numerous story/plot changes were not needed to save time for the most part and the fire nation casting especially is the worst adaptation to screen that has ever been produced. Did anyone on this crew ever see what Zuko OR Iroh looked, sounded, or acted like in the series? Not apparently. Even the tiny changes like how the moon spirit was killed and how Yue became the moon spirit. Why change that? For 3.5 seconds better editing?

765,andrew-j-curran,"Why Do People Think It Is ""SOOO"" Bad??",8,23 November 2010,"I honestly don't know why people are making such a fuss over this movie!? I absolutely love the cartoon and have watched every episode over a bunch of times. This movie is absolutely, definitely not the best. The movie however, is very rather enjoyable...instead of thinking ""Howcome he changed this? How come he changed that?"" Think about the movie itself as a separate entity. Sure I at first thought the name changes were kinda going too far, but its really no big deal whether I call Aang ""AAAAAng"" or ""OOOOONG"" seriously does it matter that much?? No of course not. Secondly why is everyone saying the acting was bad? The acting was completely fine... aside from ""Bad acting(which isn't true) and the name changes this movie was truthfully really good! If you look around the world you will find that America has ragged on this movie more than any other Country... and apparently Austrailia LOVED it.. So why are those in the U.S trying so hard to find the bad in this movie...When you watch the movie..watch it to have fun..don't sit there with a clip board, pen, and paper trying to find this so called ""bad acting, name changes, and so on and so forth"" Watch the movie to enjoy. Thats what I did and I loved it. I can't wait for a sequel. I'm just hoping all of this negative, unnecissary feedback doesn't keep that from happening!! The only thing I have to DISAGREE with M. Night Shamylan is the fire benders not being able to Freely firebend without fire already existing. He said he wanted all benders to be ""equal"" and if every other bending race needed their element present then fire benders should too. This is completely untrue.. water benders can simply pull water out of the air, or in trees and plants. Air benders have air all around them, and Earth benders can use dust clouds. Each bending race can find their element in almost anything anywhere... The cartoon had fire benders have the ability to make fire for the exact opposite reason why he says they shouldn't have it. They have that ability because if they could not generate their own fire then they themselves would be less powerful and the other nations would have greater power over them...They would always need fire with them at all times where-as water benders can rip out water from anything, air is always around for air benders, and earth covers A LOT of the planet....I think M. Night made the fire benders weaker doing this...when they should be stronger. After all they are becoming the dominant race for crying out loud!!!...Anyway though. This movie is great can't wait to see the Kyoshi warriors!!!!!",The Last Airbender
766,reikisa,Perfect!,10,24 November 2010,"I'm not sure why this is getting such crappy reviews from others but I assume it is because they do not truly honor this amazing LEGEND! Seriously, I would be willing to bet that most of the people who left reviews didn't see a single episode of the cartoon ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"", which in itself was a PHENOM. It blended the best of western animation and Japanime. It was also very cute, fun for all ages, funny, enlightening, and the martial arts were AWESOME. They were actually developed and choreographed by a martial artist. I was able to see this dude, on some of the special features, and he was an expert! They put A LOT into this cartoon and I have MAD respect for it. It's my favorite cartoon series! And I'm 29 years old so I've seen a lot of cartoons. = ) So, if any of the critics haven't seen the series... or they have and they didn't like it... then do not listen to them. They do not honor a great piece of art and are not worthy of writing a review about the movie.Saying that... you should definitely check out the cartoon series before you go and watch the movie. Try and watch every single episode so that you can learn the ins and outs of the Bender World! It's so cool and the cartoon has actually taught me a lot... physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually! I wasn't kidding when I called it a PHENOM.Once you see the cartoon series... you're ready for the movie.M. Night Shyamalan did a GREAT job! I love his work. If you cannot appreciate his style... then you're not going to like anything that he does! So do not even bother reading anyone's review if they do not appreciate his style. Personally I love it. He's got so much emotion and heart in all of his movies. I also really dig how he creates suspense and prolongs moments! Now... on to the movie. WOW. M. Night could not have done a better job! I mean... even just to take on the task of directing a live action Avatar: The Last Airbender is EMENSE! There is so much supernatural power that, to me, would be impossible to recreate. He did it flawlessly! Very little CGI was used for the stunts and that is IMPRESSIVE. There was a lot of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon moves going on but they didn't look nearly as contrived! Sooo fluid and beautiful.Now the martial art styles! I watch the movie over and over just to study them! Can you believe that the kid who played Ang was only like 12 when he played the part?! That's crazy! Not only is he clearly AWESOME in his art form... but he was also a GREAT ACTOR! It was his first major role and he's already better than any B actor I've seen. The other actors were awesome, as well. Very emotional... showed their heart completely on screen. A bunch of new faces as well that were very enjoyable to watch.The special effects... flawless. I don't know what others are even talking about! They were so cool! The way they made the elements look and morph and swirl and all that was pure EYE CANDY. Then to have the martial arts go along with them in a flawless fashion just made it so perfect!The story was beautiful. It spoke to me on all sorts of levels just as the cartoon did. If you do not have an innocent, open, and welcoming spirit... then you may not dig this film.I absolutely LOVE this movie and everything about it. I do hope that you give it a shot and trust that it will blow your mind. Thank you M. Night Shyamalan for putting your all into this movie. You captured the spirit of Avatar: The Last Airbender for sure! Don't worry about all the haters, guys... they just aren't evolved enough to see perfection when it's right in front of them.",The Last Airbender
767,bobo-the-monkey-917-851735,Razzie winner for sure.,2,7 February 2011,"While young children (7-10) might see past the poor acting and horrific scrip of The Last Airbender, it is unlikely that anyone older will be so gracious. Although similar to the original series in some ways, this film lacks the depth that is needed to make us care about its characters and their problems.The script was choppy, confusing, and most of the time it was downright lame. Timing was horrible.The plot was predictable and silly. It was also crammed together and poorly paced. It didn't give me enough time to think about it before it rushed off on another adventure.This film is a blob of cinematic mess; there are few bright spots. These lie mainly in the special effects, and fight choreography. It was indeed impressive to see some of the CG effects that were contrived for this film; that said, effects don't, and never should, make the movie. If the strength of the film lies solely in its visual effects, then the film is weak at best.I'm sad to say that what many of the original series' fans were looking forward to, will be a waste of time for most. As I said, this movie could be fine for young kids, but rather a disappointment for the older crowd.",The Last Airbender

I did NOT want to watch this, but someone I am close to insisted that we watch it because she said that the cartoon was great, so how bad could the movie be? It was so bad that WE had to walk out of the movie and request my money back. In no way shape or form could I ever, ever, EVER allow any of my money to support this crap movie. This is the worst movie I have ever seen, there was better kung fu in The Karate Kid. I honestly feel sorry for Nickelodeon and the Avatar: the last Airbender team. They worked really hard making something that was deep and philosophical for kids and adults, and then here comes Mr. Movie and brings along Mr. M. Night Douche-bag to crap on a movie that they don't even comprehend. I feel like Avatar deserves better than this, and that there should be NO work for M. Night Doucher; please, for the love of good storytelling, don't make a sequel to this travesty. This movie needs a remake badly not another cluster f. All that can be done now is to wait for Avatar: Legend of Korra.

At first i thought it might be worth the money... until i saw who the director was.I started to have mixed feelings about going to see this movie,but i couldn't say no to my little cousin.so we sat through that piece of bad movie for 2 minutes and i was already mad.now the thing is this movie actually did one thing right it had Katara Telling the story of the avatar,and for a moment, i actually thought it was going to be good.until the avatar appeared now first off i know M night was trying to make the story authentic by using the Asian Pronunciation.but it just gets annoying after a while.

771,cjhaney,A good story told well,8,7 July 2010,"Prior to seeing this film I read the IMDb reviews and looked at the IMDb composite rating. In the past, I have for the most part agreed with this information. Because of the poor reviews and low IMDb rating I really didn't want to see this movie. I am a huge fan of M. Night. I was aware of the TV show and books but had never seen or read them. I think M. Night has been a breath of fresh air in the art of film making and feel a pang of hurt every time a new M. Night film comes out and the public/critics say M. Night is getting worse all the time. I loved Lady in the Water, The Village was great, Unbreakable was amazing – a one act feature length film. Signs I think to date has been his weakest production. Anyway – people were just tearing this film apart, and I thought oh great like Terry Gilliam M. Night will never be able to make a film in America again, and there goes any chance of a large M. Night production budget.The Last Airbender was great. It had some bad acting in it and some very weak dialogue, but so do all of the Starwars films. This was primarily a kids movie (like Starwars) and a couple instances of bad dialogue or bad acting is not even seen by a child and may even be necessary for children to get it. So this film had the complexity of a children's film but it also had the heavy emotional content of all M. Night films and that is what in my mind made this far better then the last three Starwars instalments. I did not enjoy the 3D conversion, and I think as 3D works its way into cinema these are the growing pains that we will endure. I am excited about this film being released for the home in 2D. The action and special fx were superior to the last three Starwars flicks. The tai chi like choreography was weak, but that is only nit picking. I really hope that the remainder of this series gets filmed by M. Night. Bring a five to ten year old child to this film and watch it – don't go looking to watch the Sixth Sense go to see a good story told well – which is what a good film is.",The Last Airbender

I am a fan of the series. I really enjoy it. And when i heard about this movie naturally i got hyped as every one else.So when the movie was released i was one of the first to buy a ticket and the i walked in to the theater and holy s**t i regret i ever saw it. I REALLY HATE THIS MOVIE. It was boring. Really boring. And none of the characters are developed at all. And there is no humanity to any one of them. And their names(I know many people has talked about this. But it really is a problem) is mispronounced. I was expecting to be chancing.

774,mc-robby,A big disappointment,2,15 July 2012,"Most of the main problems about this movie can be found in all the other reviews, but let me just add what I didn't read that much and let me give some good points(in context of course because it was a big bummer).I hated it that fire-benders needed a fire source. The story was good how it was. To bad he had to change that into this unbearable bummer.The bending movements where just random movements resulting into changes of the elements that didn't hold any relationship with each other whats however. I hoped that they would be dancing resulting into slow movements. I wanted every punch to have an action just like in the series. What i do hope is that they will make a second one. Not because it was good enough but because i believe that if they take a better cast+director they still can wash of the bad image. The second book has a lot of potential to be a good movie. The special effects where there already so if they make a movie that is a lot longer like Lord of The Rings, they could tell the story better. I would watch it and give it a shot. There where some scenes that where good so if someone has got the balls to do it, please make the next one. I would be dying to see what a better director could do with it.",The Last Airbender
775,Max-Wri,"Fans Awaited a Live-Action Epic, and M. Night Delivered an Epic Letdown",1,8 June 2011,"Let me begin by saying that as an avid fan of the animated series I'm of course going to critique the movie harshly. That being said, M. Night Shyamalan attempted to fit the entire first season of the series, 20 episodes, over 450 minutes of animation, into barely 100 minutes. I don't want to nitpick (let's face it, I actually do) but he could have at least let that go up to 120 minutes. That would've been 20 entire minutes that could've easily been put towards character development or, as I can surmise from this film, towards more badly written explanations by characters to explain something instead of using a flashback or other/better means. But, because an adaptation is meant to cater to the fans, the movie should've actually been at least 140 minutes, at least in my opinion.However, given that M. Night Shyamalan apparently didn't want to please the fans at all, I can now point out all the faults, and might I add that there are many. As another fan has mentioned,the simplest way to adapt the film would've been to make a carbon copy, copying the source material word for word and scene for scene. But the movie wasn't made like that. The storyline was contorted and twisted in order to move it along fast. In doing so, all good character development was seemingly scrapped in favor of, as mentioned above, badly written explanations and voice overs.However, also scrapped were the correct pronunciations of everyone's names. It seems like that would have been an easy thing to get right, after all... it was being adapted from a TV show, where all the names are being said, as opposed to, say, a book. But that's just the beginning. The film also features a painfully apparent lack of East Asian cast members for a story based almost entirely on and populated by East Asians.That being said, I could actually appreciate the replacement of East Asians by Indian characters for the Fire Nation, those characters were, in many cases, played by quite reputable actors. But its too bad they couldn't do anything to help the terrible writing and poor dialogue; it wasn't limited just to them, though. The entirety of the movie is plagued by poor acting, out of sync with the characters from the original series, in many cases changing the characteristics of the characters. Furthermore, the 'bending' and choreography is the same as the presentation of every line: either stale, dry, and emotionless, or far too over- emphasized and overacted.As is the case with adaptations, the cutting out of material is always a cause for concern, and certainly for the incredible writing of the original series. However, there was a lot of information and character development that was left out. In this case, the first flashback lasted all of 10 seconds to explain Zuko's past, and the second and final flashback doesn't happen until almost 90 minutes into the movie to give some background to Aang. Finally, with this cutting of material, the characters of Oppa and Momo were cut almost entirely, leaving screen time totaling very likely less than 5 minutes.And all of this horrid adaptation leads up to the most anticlimactic climax I've encountered in a movie: the waterbending of an enormous, towering, fear-inducing tidal wave by Aang, while in the Avatar State, which shadows the widespread fleet of Fire Nation ships, which then does absolutely nothing but die down and slide back into the ocean.So I guess you could say that I'm disappointed and let down, because to express my accurate reaction would be to border on the overly gruesome and aggressively profane, which should have no place in a decent, respectable film review.",The Last Airbender
776,Dragonaut,Save your money on this one!,5,6 July 2010,I saw this movie last week with my 10 yr old. I'm not sure what the director was doing but he sure didn't understand the material. I felt like i was watching a joke not a movie. The actors were so far from there cartoon likeness if they didn't have the same name I'd of never known. Also he threw race out of the window with a girl as the main star and native Americans were people whiter then myself. The picture its self was OK but the story was WAY too rushed and hard to follow without prior knowing of the show. Even my 10 yr old had asked if we could leave more then once during the movie. There are not many good things I can really say about this movie other then the fact the special effects were nice and the explosions made for nice eye candy.

I had never watched the series so when I read the plot synopsis on this it seemed like a nice fantasy idea. Don't get me wrong, the basis behind the series/movie is quite intriguing. Unfortunately, that's where all the good stops. The script is painfully obvious and cliché'd. I seriously think that M. Night Shamalayn (or however its spelled) gave a pen and paper to a 12 year old and told him to write something. Aside from the terrible script the delivery of the lines (aka acting) was actually worse! The camera work, which falls on the director mostly, surely wasn't going to help these actors out. Very, very lazy camera work. You will literally be stuck on a close up of someones face as their are saying their terrible lines for 10-30 seconds. Most movie scenes that include long drawn out dialog's will please you visually with either cool scenic views or a zoomed out shot with the actor's conveying emotions and body movement. GIVE ME SOMETHING! I'm sure if I cared to watch the last hour of the movie I could the number of pores on each characters face because of the length of time.

779,IggyMcSnurd,My daughter and I didn't even bother past 30 minutes...,1,3 December 2011,"My daughter and I have watched the cartoon series since she was five years old and enjoyed the wonderful storytelling, the well developed world, the bending techniques based on real world martial arts and their philosophies, and most of all the well developed characters.That being said, I would have to say that this movie was an utter disappointment of such profound levels that I sincerely believe that M. Night Shyamalan should never attempt to make another movie even remotely related as he obviously did not watch the series but instead simply had scenes and characters described to him. Either that, or he utterly failed to get the point of the show by a country mile.Even in the first thirty minutes, my daughter and I gave up, having become utterly disgusted with the following: - That M. Night Shyamalan attempted to take a story which took 4 years to tell and compress it into a movie of under even 2 hours.The acting was so bad and flat that we felt absolutely no connection to the characters in the movie as we did in the animated series.They didn't even bother to use the pronunciations of character's names from the show itself... instead deciding to mangle half of them in a way that made both of us just grind our teeth to hear them spoken over and over.They made Katara a completely inept water bender in the start. While she was not an expert in the beginning of the series, she was not an incompetent either.The Firebenders in the movie, unlike in the original series, needed a fire to already be there in order to use their abilities. In the series, they created their own fire from their Chi and their bending. This made one of the most potent tribes actually the weakest and the most inherently reliant on technology. (After all, how powerful will the Firebender be when you blow out his candle... or as an earth or water bender smother the fire they use?) And here was the clincher that made my daughter and I give up on having any hope for the movie at all: Just on a whim I checked the cast list partway through the movie in order to see if I was correct that M. Night Shyamalan had inserted himself into another one of his movies. And while it appears he declined to do that, I also noticed that he omitted not only one of the most fun characters, King Bulmi... But he entirely wrote out one of the best characters of the series, Toph. The latter of which was the Master who taught Aang his earth bending in the first place.And that's only the beginning of how poorly made this movie is. I can't tell you about the rest of it, of course... since, as I said, my daughter and I didn't bother watching more than 30 minutes.Which has made me absolutely lose the last remaining shreds of respect I had for any of M. Night Shyamalan's abilities as a director, writer, and storyteller. (Not to say that my daughter likely doesn't have any for him to start with as this is her first movie of his she's seen any of.)",The Last Airbender

I read all the reviews, I read about how this one and that were about to walk out halfway through, I watched the lead's eyes to see him ""counting"" for his queues as I had read on a specific website. But it just never came. The movie wasn't awful. Not one single person walked out in a full theater. At no point did I notice any counting with the lead's eyes. At the end of the film, nobody boo'ed or hissed or dissed.The second thing I was waiting for was Shyamalan to put into the film what I've always known his movies for - character and atmosphere. ""The Last Airbender"" felt so rushed that important things like character and atmosphere were grazed over. What I got was another typical summer popcorn movie - one action scene after another with a plot very loosely tied onto it. Very disappointing from a Shyamalan film.There was no charm, no feeling, nothing to sink my teeth into, nothing to think about later after it was over. This will be the second Shyamalan film that has left me feeling a bit disappointed.Nothing bad, nothing great - just sort've ho-hum.",The Last Airbender
781,jonellefaulkner29,Effects and scenery were excellent. We enjoyed the film,10,11 August 2010,I enjoyed this film. My autistic son who is an Avatar fan also enjoyed the film too. I have no idea why there is so much negativity about the movie except to say that these people must have gone to watch the film with their own high (almost unreachable) expectations of what it would contain. I am a fan of the TV series so when we went I already knew the story line and to be quite honest I was not disappointed.What the haters of this film have to realise is that this film was the directors adaptation of the TV series. You have to take the film as an adaptation and try not to compare because this is impossible to do. Its impossible to get all of the information from a whole series on TV into one film so the film will be lacking if you compare it to the series. I think they captured what needed to be captured and made the characters both believable and yet at the same time they had the emotion which would be expected if you had all the pressures that the characters have.My son did comment and say that Aang acts more like a child on the TV series and on the film he always looks angry. I had to try to explain that he was not angry on the film but upset and troubled by all that had happened and he was learning to come to terms with it. I also told him that it was very hard for the people who make the films to put 10 hours worth of cartoon Aang into an hour and half film. He was happy with this. Yes the American accents do kinda spoil the names and they are not pronounced properly but hey get over it its a minor detail. I hope they make the next 2 in the series and like most fans of films which are always either compared to the books or TV series's isn't scrapped just because some people do not understand how hard it is to make an adaptation and put hours worth of a story line into a standard film length.The effects were amazing and the scenery was stunning too. This film is very good in my opinion and cant wait to buy it when it comes out on DVD.,The Last Airbender

None of the scenes in this movie are for 3D, so why add it in. simple, to make more f*cking money! Second, the acting is TERRIBLE, the dialogue makes me want to HANG myself! There was not ONE character that I liked, hell, I found the extra's more interesting! The trailer to this film was awesome, I was hyped, and guess what, NONE OF THAT IS IN THE FILM! And, for some reason, the actors sometimes kept talking about what happened on Screen, five minutes ago! WHY!? We just watched it! It's also missing the Humour that was in the cartoon, and even if M.Night Shagalong (Shyamalan) was trying to go for a more serious tone, 1, Why? And 2, it failed, seeming that I was cracking up every time one of the actors opened their MOUTHS! This movie is terrible, unlike Batman and Robin, or Birdemic: Shock and Terror, you won't enjoy it for it's awfulness. Don't go see this for a laugh, or buy it to do the same, as M. Night Shyamalan does not deserve your money after this. Overall, I give this a 1 out of 10.",The Last Airbender

I knew he would butcher the story and the movie overall, but we went to see it anyway. I can't believe i was willing to pay money to watch M. Night Shamalan take a giant dump all over a much loved show. My kids wanted to see it so we did. My kids and I were very disappointed, to say the least. It was all around just bad, but the thing that sticks out the most is how fast he went through the story. I don't know how anyone who has never seen the show could have followed what was going on. It made my head spin. There had to be a better way of doing this movie. If several have to be made (which is to be expected considering how long the series is) or non-essential parts of the story line are left out, then it would have a good potential of being at least somewhat good. But, even if that had been done, we are still left with M. Night Shamalan. So, it doesn't even matter. What was Nickelodeon thinking when they allowed him to make the movie? Did they not see any of his films before?",The Last Airbender
790,svipdag,"If you didn't watch the series, it's o.k.",6,27 January 2021,"So, I heard much about how bad this movie was. But I also noticed that most of the negative feedback was about how different from the series it was. So I thought I'd give this movie a try. Please keep in mind that I'm reviewing the movie as such, from the perspective of someone who didn't watch the series.In the first five to ten minutes of the movie, I tended to agree with the scathing reviews, although much of my disapproval was due to the (at least at the beginning) partially horrible German sync. Then I started to like the movie better. It's actually built on the base of an interesting story, although some parts of the interior might be a little shabby.The characters contain the entire spectrum from great to bad. The best character, in my eyes, is prince Zuko. You can really see how tormented he is, torn apart between the wish to just live a normal, peaceful life on one side, and on the other side the need to redeem himself, to please his father, to avoid a life as the laughing stick of an entire nation. Katara and, for the most time, Aang are alright. Zhao? Meh. Not very impressive as a villain. Sokka was painfully boring. He could have been left out of the movie, and it would have changed nothing. That's okay with minor character, but not with alleged main characters. Only thing he does is berating his sister and courting princess Daenerys... sorry: Yue, which both does not affect the story in any way.""The Last Airbender"" is in no way a masterpiece; several side aspects are quite flawed. The bending movements are absolutely over the top and not very well choreographed. Spirits living in the water without any protection, so basically everyone can just come over and kill them? Come on. But the worst thing of the entire movie, in my opinion, is Katara's water bending skill going from zero to hero in one moment; she just wasn't able yet to perform even small tricks, and as soon as the battle begins, she easily blocks fireballs and quick-freezes Zuko?
But apart from those flaws, it's a nice heartwarming story about friendship, teamwork and finding your path in life. Yes, if the story really doesn't catch the spirit of the series, I understand everyone who dislikes the movie because of that. But it's absolutely possible to like it if you have nothing to compare it with for the entire time...",The Last Airbender
791,raindrops62,Airbender without Air,1,25 January 2016,"This movie was an abomination. The special effects budget was blown up in a failed attempt at creating Appa and then they saved it to the end of the movie for a big finale. The story line felt rushed and confusing to those who hadn't seen the TV show to truly understand what was happening. And to those that did- well I think ""gigantic pile of horse sh#t"" is being polite."" And yet despite the atrocious attempt at making something that pandered to the family loving ottaku's it was still a 103 torturing minutes of watching a group of sour, angsty, teens run around and dance for 5 minutes before any type of cheesy effected, and disappointing, ""bending"" actually occurred. Shayascreweditup-aman had a beautiful opportunity to captivate an already dedicated audience with his version of the series, and in short he failed miserably because he was trying too hard to change it completely. It was Harry Potter without magic, it was Fight Club without crazy, it was Pulp Fiction without violence, it was awful. Maybe if he hadn't spent so much effort trying to steal a culture and jam it into the show, then he could have spent it learning why people loved the series. This wasn't supposed to be a move about a gloomy monk kid with magic powers, this was supposed to be about a kid who despite his faults, his failures, and the destiny that lay before him, he was still capable of being a cheery, laughing, lovable kid who thought nothing to stop and help the people around him and make the world a little better while he worked to save it.",The Last Airbender
792,zabelb,I literally feel betrayed,1,4 May 2014,"I would just like to start this off by saying this is the only movie I truly felt like I deserved my money back for. After dedicating years of my life watching Avatar TLA, and continuing to be a fan, I felt like M. Night Shyamalan robbed me of my money and a decent Avatar movie. I will list off a few complaints I have with this movie.1) M. Night Shyamalan lied to us about his experiences with Avatar. I remember seeing interviews where he talks about how he ""fell in love with Avatar."" After seeing this movie, there is no way he actually watched the series. The movie, in a nutshell, is just the Wikipedia plot synopsis of each episode with so much cut out. All this movie is is plot. There is no character development. Why would anyone care about these characters on the screen?2) Where is half of the characters introduced in the first season? Where was Jet? Oh, that's right, he wasn't in the movie. If M. Night would have watched the show, he would have remembered how important Jet is to the series. And Suki and the Kyoshi Warriors? Apparently, they weren't important enough to make the cut either. SOKKA'S LOVE INTEREST DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT. Who is he going to cut next? Iroh? The Firelord? Again, if M. Night actually watched the series, these characters would have been prominent in the movie. Even the characters that are in the movie are represented poorly. The only actor that actually looks like their character is Aang, and his acting is on par with a five year old in a Christmas play.3) Why is this movie 1 hour and 43 minutes including credits? In today's society, it's common for movie adaptations to be over 2 1/2 hours, if not over 3 hours. (I'm talking to you, LOTR) How come a movie based on 20 episodes is only an hour and a half? This movie more than doubled their budget in sales. People were going to pay to see this movie no matter what. Could they not spend more money to make it a three hour movie? Maybe they could have included some character development, or God forbid, more characters.4) Bending, the one thing they could have done right, is laughable. Did anyone see the scene where six earth benders threw a pebble 5 mph? That's a complete joke. And why did they make it so the fire benders needed a source of fire to bend from? All the water benders need to do is put out their bonfires, and POOF, war over! If all $150 million you're spending is going to the special effects, do it right.5) Where was any smiling or emotion? Did someone forget that this show is extremely happy and funny? One of the best messages in this story is how they are able to find happiness during war. There was none of that in TLA. It was just all explaining and plot. The worst offender in this movie is Sokka. He is the one with all the jokes! There was zero smiling in this movie.So in conclusion of my rant, HOW DID ANYONE LET THIS MOVIE GET RELEASED?! Did no one object to this garbage? I feel like I've been robbed of a movie I deserve. I hope if they decide to make another Avatar movie, they'll just make an animated film continuing the story. Stay away from the live action, and stay away from Shyamalan.",The Last Airbender
793,CHernobog123,"The last Airbender, a movie hated for wrong reasons",6,9 July 2010,"So by now everybody who read a bit about this movie has learned that the general consensus is that the movie sucks. Well heads up, the movie isn't very good, but is it a very bad movie? no. The biggest problem with the film is the source material. The TV show has a huge following for a good reason, it is the best TV show ever made for ages 10 to 18. It had a huge epic scope with great action and everything worked. The characters all had terrific back stories, the pacing was perfect and the series was filled with enough filler episodes to make it all worth while and let's the characters breath while increasing the size of the world and the story.Now the movie, it is short, bland and horrible paced. This is because it wants too much of all the things the show had. There are tons of small references to the back stories which don't do anything because the characters don't breath or feel very naturally. It basically skips around the stories with about 10 episodes worth in 15 minutes and the other 10 over the remaining 70 minutes. But the basic plot of the first season is there.The acting is what I expected after seeing the previews. The best parts are Zuko and Iroh, with especially Iroh being the best actor in the movie. Aang, Katara and Sokka all just don't have enough gravitas too make it work in the short amount of time. The other part which sucks, besides missing Suki, is the amount of story lines crammed next to each other. First Katara and Sokka, Then Aang joins them. So they all become 1 story. Then Zuko and Iroh. Then Admiral Zhao, then the fire lord and then princess Yuu, who splits off with Sokka, so as you understand way too many story lines for 90 minutes.Now the reason I'm complaining about Suki is the fact that she was an anchor to the story. It showed other characters trying to make it in the world and made the entire war feel more personal. Plus she gave rise to character development which is missing in the movie. so all the development ends up being narrated to us by Katara instead of being seen and that just doesn't work The action of the movie is reasonable but it's not enough for what it should have had. While the effects are good characters like Appa and Momo are not really in the movie, there just the five shots and that's it. Which is the biggest problem of the entire flick, they want to show everything of the show but it just doesn't fit in movie format and that's why everything we see is slightly out of place.While all this is said I have to say the design is excellent and the music is great. So the thing needed to make the movie work is change the story. Make it more like a movie and less like a show. Make it a lot longer with slightly better acting and the movie will fall in place a whole lot more.",The Last Airbender
794,TaxiGodfather,Wait this is supposed to be related to that awesome show!?,1,6 February 2014,"As the summary suggests i really like the show, it is defiantly something i would watch again. Unlike many i found out about the show through the movie so i decided to watch the show on Netflix and i loved it. I was impressed by the Character Development, the voice acting, the themes, the story, the excellent writing and the action (not the main reason OK). Naturally because i had heard about the movie first i didn't have particularly high hopes for this film when i sat down and watched it on Netflix. The Movie is a complete inversion of the show. I hated the bottomless pits that are supposed to be our favorite show characters, the pathetic attempt at acting, the racist casting, the terrible special fx, the fact that it had no plot, the lazy writing and all the battles lacking life, tension and thrillsYou may have noticed that i haven't rated the film and i will tell you why, i can't rate it, i will hurt someone if i try to rate it, the word doesn't exist for how bad this movie is. But i can say that this is without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen.But the thing is that even though the movie fails at being an adaption there is only one Avatar (no not those blue people). The show, it was a brilliant piece of fiction that i still love, it was a rare anomaly that chances are may never happen again. Maybe one day we will get a good film about this show.

795,adysonmerchant,Not a very good remake,4,3 June 2018,"Don't get me wrong- the movie is a pretty bad remake. But the effects that go into the movie give it a real feeling of ATLA. If you were to have never seen ATLA and watch this movie then you might actually like it. But for extreme fans like most of us it was disheartening to watch this properly make fun of our beloved ATLA series. I do give them props though for casting a mostly Asian, middle eastern, and people of color cast with a few white people. I did not like though that Aang, sokka, and Irohs names were mispronounced. I get that that is the correct way to pronounce them but in the original series it pronounced them a different way and that was what we were used to. Give the movie a chance if you haven't. At least to see what bending looks like in live action ( not bad at all). But the $150 million spent on this movie should have been spent on casting actual talented actors and writers who did their research. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen but it comes pretty close. This movie series could have been amazing and could have lead to a sequel and a trequel. But it's too rushed and is just missing a lot of imortant moments. Plus a lot of other bad mistakes in this film. I give it a four because they tried and the effects were the only thing good about this movie.

796,Scarlet_Onyx,"Oh, what hast thou wrought, Shamalamadingdong?",3,3 July 2010,"I've seen enough episodes of the cartoon to know that the folks who made the series did a good job on it. I figured that the movie wasn't going to be true to the source material but hopefully would be entertaining enough on its own (like Howl's Moving Castle, for example). Five minutes into the movie, I realized this would not be the case.I needn't go into the awkward script, the wooden acting, the mispronunciation of names, the rushed pace, the lack of character development, the random choppy mish-mash of scenes, the strenuous act of bending - others before me have already done so.I honestly do not think the movie is strong enough to stand on its own. I can't imagine two more put together like this. At least the creators of Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter managed to condense the material in a way that it flowed fairly smoothly. The Last Airbender should have been handed to someone like Peter Jackson.I would like to know why Firelord Ozai's sideburns were on backwards though. Were they trying to escape? Iroh's hairstyle made no sense as all the other Fire Nation men seemed to be sporting short hair. Maybe he's being a rebel and sticking it to the Man? The amount of time lavished on the drowning and subsequent bone-crunching fall of Zhao was mildly disturbing. Also, Earth Nation Village 15. Really? Is that like Stalag 17 or did you just run out of ideas for names? And let us not even mention why none of the other benders thought to extinguish any fires in the area to limit the firebenders' ammunition.Anyway, with so many things wrong, let's talk about what I did like:Iroh: he actually came out fairly wise and compassionate, drank tea and got a foot massage. Since he's the one of the few firebenders who can conjure fire from within himself, that automatically makes him the coolest character in the movie.Zuko: despite the fact he looks like he was clawed in the face by a week-old kitten, Dev Patel actually tried, God bless him. His acting was a bit hit or miss but I did like the scene where he stepped out of the smoke to confront Zhao on the bridge (though they never fought - a shame). Oh, and the scene where, as the Blue Spirit, you see him blocking the fire attack by crossing his swords in front of Aang. While the slow-mo fight scenes are old and overused, I did like that they slowed it down so you could see it happening.Fire Nation warships: the polluting monstrosities were actually intimidating to look upon. And the special effects were pretty good in general. I had no real complaints there.I consider myself to be a tolerant movie-watcher. A movie can be a success if I'm, at the very least, entertained by it. If I spend most of the movie giggling hysterically and squirming uncomfortably in my seat, it is not a success. I had previously considered Clash of the Titans to be the biggest waste of money until now.After we finished watching the movie, my friend and I hit up the nearest Best Buy to purchase the cartoon series. I predict brisk sales of the cartoon DVDs as the curious see what this is all about and fans purge the bad memories of the movie from their minds. So maybe some good will come of this after all.",The Last Airbender

801,tmptsh,Terrible movie,5,23 September 2014,I enjoyed this film. My autistic son who is an Avatar fan also enjoyed the film too. I have no idea why there is so much negativity about the movie except to say that these people must have gone to watch the film with their own high (almost unreachable) expectations of what it would contain. I am a fan of the TV series so when we went I already knew the story line and to be quite honest I was not disappointed.What the haters of this film have to realize is that this film was the directors adaptation of the TV series. You have to take the film as an adaptation and try not to compare because this is impossible to do. Its impossible to get all of the information from a whole series on TV into one film so the film will be lacking if you compare it to the series. I think they captured what needed to be captured and made the characters both believable and yet at the same time they had the emotion which would be expected if you had all the pressures that the characters have.My son did comment and say that Aang acts more like a child on the TV series and on the film he always looks angry. I had to try to explain that he was not angry on the film but upset and troubled by all that had happened and he was learning to come to terms with it. I also told him that it was very hard for the people who make the films to put 10 hours worth of cartoon Aang into an hour and half film. He was happy with this. Yes the American accents do kinda spoil the names and they are not pronounced properly but hey get over it its a minor detail. I hope they make the next 2 in the series and like most fans of films which are always either compared to the books or TV series's isn't scrapped just because some people do not understand how hard it is to make an adaptation and put hours worth of a story line into a standard film length.The effects were amazing and the scenery was stunning too.

So now that we have some sketchy casting lets move on the acting, the child actors are good considering they are children. but there is room for improvement. which makes you think why they were cast for the film in the first place.

Most people just pan it without any kind of constructive criticism. ...which is a shame because I would have like to have a sequel. I'm going to remedy lack of fixing suggestion here.The movie wasn't cast poorly even though some say there were problems, the cast was really OK. Yes, there were some changes in basic looks most people could have probably forgiven those changes.Some people didn't like the way the story rushed past key story lines they wanted to see explored. I believe even this might have been forgiven. We all know that there is a lot of material to try to condense into a movie.So what was it that killed the enthusiasm so rapidly? After all many people were looking forward to this movie. It happened to me in the first few minutes. It was the literal Asian pronunciation that differed so much from the long running cartoon pronunciation that it could not be overcome in my mind.Every time we heard someone say a name it grated against what we had become so familiar with for years. At first people did not recognize the names then they grew angry when they didn't match the cartoon. Case in point, Saak-a became Soak-a.. Yes, I know the way the creators spelled the name but if you are going to make a movie based on a long running popular cartoon you have to - absolutely have to - take the pronunciation people are used to into consideration. Aang was pronounced Eing in the cartoon. Some of the actors even seemed to have problems pronouncing ""Avatar"" which became ""Uvatar"" for half the cast.My feeling is if the names had been the ones we were used to and expecting it would have been easier to relate to the cast member as the characters they portrayed. Lizards walking up the wall, No hair loopies for Katara and her change of hair color, Uncle Iroh with hair, a somewhat less funny Sokka, even the rush through important character development I believe all would have been fine but for the inconsistent pronunciations.",The Last Airbender

These people were mad when they first found out casting no way will they be swayed by the movie, they are the worst right now.""Mispronunciations"" Yes, words are said incorrectly, but as with anything there is room for interpretation I can see why they pronounce it that way opposed to the original show's pronunciation. ""M. Night Shymalan fails again."" when the review purposefully bashes the director there is some deep-seeded hate for his previous works, thus making the review biased against all his works. (I.E. I spoke negatively of James Cameron above thus proving my bias against his films proceeding Avatar). Anyway, the movie is good. If you liked the cartoon and are willing to just watch the story retold in a different fashion you'll love this movie, if not I can understand the dislike for it. As well, if you are not acquainted with Avatar than watch the movie and then the cartoon, it will make you appreciate the cartoon that much more.",The Last Airbender

811,rosaandre,It Was Not Terrible,3,2 January 2017,"This is just a quick review of the film, which I saw for the first time just hours ago. Let's get one thing straight, the movie is a bad film, as you can tell by my rating of it. That being said, there are some good things about it. Some of the special effects are pretty good, and the fighting scenes, when not chopped up in the editing room, were fun to watch. The score is also pretty decent for the most part throughout the film. That being said, near all the performances were awful, say for Dev Patel, who was legitimately trying to make this material work.T The direction and writing from M. Night is nothing sort of pitiful. Half of the film is exposition, and when it's not, the lines are delivered so poorly that you can't get anything from them. Also, having seen quite a bit of the show, let's just say it didn't try too hard to do a truthful adaptation. Anyways, see it if you want, I don't care. 4 out of 10.",The Last Airbender
812,animationguy-21701,An Absolute Abomination To Cinema,1,11 March 2016,"It really says a lot about a movie based on a critically acclaimed animated series when I waited until 2012 to finally watch The Last Airbender. After hearing the universally negative reviews it got, I put off watching it for a while. Then at a time when rental stores weren't going out of business, my parents rented the film and I decided to a chance.Little did I know, I was in for a time I will never get back. This is honestly not just one of the worst films but also one of the worst adaptations I have ever seen. Not every film needs to follow the source material exactly. Change need to be made in order to fit the film format and this films fails to even do that. Even just as a movie, it fails.The camera work is one of my biggest problems with the film. The camera is either too close to faces, wide shots are used for fights and it often feels amateur. The acting is awful. Nobody talks like a normal person. They either sound too serious or too dull. The CGI creatures that in the original 2D show have an important part in the show and are interesting characters have nothing to do and look rather bizarre in the movie.There are so many plot-holes in the movie. For example, there's a scene involving fire nation soldiers imprisoning earth-benders on earth (WHAT?!) while in the show, the earth-benders were imprisoned on an giant metal ship in the middle of the ocean and while it's later established one of the main characters who's an earth-bender found a way to metal-bend, they'd probably drown or get killed by giant fish that were established even if they tried to escape anyway.The film never likes to show things that are important. It's filled with exposition-laden dialogue that tells you all this cool stuff with zero emotion. The movie is too serious for kids and too boring for adults. It is so clear that the director/producer/writer, M. Night Shyamalan is an arrogant and pretentious filmmaker. It's been proved he's seen the show but wanted to shape it in his ""vision"". He thinks people don't ""get him"" and he honestly should be ashamed of himself.The show when it aired I knew of and I liked the first season but years after not having seen the show, Doug Walker made v-logs about the episodes to prepare for the review and I decided to marathon the show. I had missed out on so much, it's insane. The multi-dimensional characters, the thought put into the abilities and the world, the thought-provoking stories and morals and the endless amount of awesome, touching, terrifying and hilarious moments the show had are nowhere to be found in the movie.I hate this movie as I feel it is everything wrong with cinema. It's a cynical and insulting mess of a movie that put me off the show for a while. It somehow made it's money back at the box office and I will never know why. Please don't watch this fun-destroying mess of a movie. If there was anything I would recommend instead, it would have to be The Legend of Korra. It has it's problems but it knows how to be joyful, fun and serious when needed, is even beautifully animated and has a cast of interesting characters with thought put into the world and it's mythology. Please watch that and Avatar: The Last Airbender. They will surely be better than this awful movie.",The Last Airbender

814,Boxus_Winus,Good if you want to have 2 hours of no nonsense fun.,8,24 September 2010,"I see so many bad reviews of this movie here with people flaming it and saying its terrible.... honestly this movie is based on a kids cartoon, did you really expect it to change your lives?? or have some amazingly intricate story with interwoven characters the likes of a da vinci masterpiece? or a hitchcockian sense of awe at the end as the final twist sends you spiraling into questioning the parts of the movie such as you did with the sixth sense?? IT IS BASED ON A Children's CARTOON! Yes you might love this cartoon, but to believe it could be turned into anything but a live version of a children's story is just pathetic. It had a $150 million budget, and it has made back $300 million, so its a success for the industry already. I watched it with no expectations and got exactly what I thought it would be, a children's story turned into a film that was entertaining for what it was. If you want to kill 2 hours and just sit back and enjoy the movie when there's nothing better on at the cinema to choose from then go and see this one. Its entertaining with no real in depth story or meanings. All the fools on here talking about how they watch the cartoon and hated it (how old are you all by the way? id never heard of it before now) so much they had to rant about seeming metaphors in the movie that were not there, you are reading too deep and I guess the adaption was different to the cartoon that you kids like to watch on the nickelodeon channel.

818,goin_ta_dust_ya,3 of the Elements the Last Airbender didn't master...,4,2 July 2010,"I will tell you straight up who I am. I'm an avid fan of the television series, in my mid twenties, and a bit keen on film analysis while not being a outright critic. I feel it's important to know this as there are going to be quite a number of people stemming from this train of thought that will be convinced to see the movie.Prepare yourself to be royally disappointed. And I'm not talking about booing; I'm talking about near walking out the theater before the film ends while feeling miserable to the same extent as to those that actually finished the movie.What makes this movie bad? Book One: The Element of Character Development. Suppose Steve Erkle were in a movie and all he did was try to get Laura Winslow to marry him. He didn't have any funny lines nor did anything ridiculous happen on his journey to her heart. Eventually after much rejection Laura marries him. What you have here isn't a story of Steve Erkle, you have a love story with ambiguous characters that have names but could have really been anyone. What makes Steve the Erkel isn't just in what he does, it's how he's portrayed along with his relationship with others. Avatar: The Last Airbender (ALA) succeeds at poor character development. Examples...the movie is abound with them. I will just stress the key ones for ATA fans. -Sokka's importance is nil. You don't see a hint at why he's traveling with the group outside him from him wanting to protect his sister. Other than that, he stands like this O.O throughout the entire movie. -Katara: You really don't learn much about her except that she's the last water bender in the Southern tribe.... yup....that's it. -Appa/Momo: They are animals... no personality....zero importance and no scene that distinguishes them from a light post.I will say that Aang, Zuko, and Iroh were at least passable. Shallamalla succeeds with these characters.Element 2: Too much for the Avatar. Let's admit that a movie summing up the water book is an outstanding task. Shyamalan tried. He successfully put the gist of the story in a movie. He chose to leave out or twist elements of the show that fleshed out the personalities of our beloved characters. This was a bad move. Sokka wasn't funny and had no funny parts in the entire movie as he was portrayed as serious. Event leading up to the end were always shown in short scenes, some of which make little to no sense. Many times when observing the dialog you find yourself asking ""What did that mean?"" or ""Why was this said there?"". I feel that had Shyamalan added small, character developing dialog to some of these short scenes and the slow moments, the movie would have been outstandingly...better.This movie lacked the personalities of characters whom weren't built in 2 hours. Without strong character personalities, the audience is left watches faces move from one place to another...very quickly. Next time Shyamalan, one some of the slower scenes, make them meaningful, because viewers don't want to see bending stances and nothing really happening...Element 3: 3D? 3D isn't not used to it's fullest if at all. If ATA was a pop up book that didn't do the pop up, but did the background/foreground thing, this would be the 3D in theaters. Too many parts were blurry and completely wasted better visual display.The Avatar did start off as a master of airbending, which means this movie had to do something right. All I can say is that if you want to watch ATA with real people and all the funny and integral side moments that flesh out main players sucked out of it, this does it right. The story is told, but did the series not have a more useful Appa, a more useless boomerang, a more brave Katara, a more bald Zuko? Fat Iroh? Darker Water tribe? Less O.O. Better lines? Better fight sequences? Less mature Aang and Sokka? Less meaningless scenes?To whom was this marketed to...the fans? If it was for the fans, then forget the ""I'm going to make it culturally phonetic"" bull and keep the English sound. Trust me, after 10 minutes of ""Ahng"", ""Earow"", and ""Soaka"" you will have torn your ears of the ""Soakets"". The fans will hate this movie.What about the people that haven't seen ATA the series? Well, if they want the story shown to them real quickly, then here it is. But they aren't going to know the magic each character brings and will be left laughing at the same non-nonsensical acting and scripting as anyone else. At least they have comfort in knowing that the TV series is much better.What about kids? Seeing as it's a Nickelodeon TV show surely they can love it. I'm inclined to agree. Kids know nothing of character building, foreshadowing, bad acting, poor 3d visuals, insignificant scenes, racial type-casting, and film pacing to know of all that ATA fails in. If you're a kid that hasn't even seen ATA before and want to catch up to speed, by all means, get see the movie. Watch it in normal D and quickly leave the theater before you get bombarded by the fans that will complain about the movie.Ending Verdict: A waste of box office space and 3d visuals. It has made me want to watch the series again. But not mastering the important elements in making a good movie only hurts the fans and the audience. Shame on you Shyamalan. I do believe I went Avatar State and erased the last 3 days of my memory.",The Last Airbender
819,coatic,A Beautiful Series Defiled by a Narcissist,2,21 November 2014,"Plain and simple, this filth has the lowest rating I've ever given anything. In expressing my dismay, I hope to warn others (fans and non-fans alike) about how M. Night, in my opinion, has ravished what is possibly one of the most well-loved and enchanting pieces of animated art ever to be produced.Unlike most Avatar fans, I came into the movie without ever watching a single episode. My older brother has tried convincing me for years to give the animated series some attention (we are both adults, and in my humble opinion, I think we have at least decent, if not sensible, taste). Although I greatly respect his opinion, I was reluctant to oblige, never getting past the child/tween-oriented marketing and Nickelodeon stamp over the material.I watched the movie thinking it would be a convenient first foray into the world of Avatar – only to be severely appalled by the product. It bore no iota of grace, and as its own vehicle, it just looked and felt like a complete disaster. The pace oscillated between ""too dull to make me care"" and ""too quick to comprehend,"" the cinematography felt all over the place in more than just a few scenes, the characters felt lifeless, even the martial arts looked cheap and silly (the Karate Kid, surprisingly, had far better choreography even without the fancy elemental effects). I'm pretty capable of suspending my disbelief and when I have to, I can keep an open mind to children's flicks, but I don't think this movie failed me because I wasn't the target demographic. I think it failed because it flat-out did – on all counts of what makes good cinema.Confused, I decided to watch the series in order to delve into what my brother found appealing. I was immediately so gripped with the show that I finished all three seasons within a week. It was a magical experience that appealed to my more mature sensibilities while still allowing me a glimpse of the innocence, imagination, and idealism that I've missed since childhood. I can unequivocally say that it's one of the best works of art, in whatever canvas, that I've ever had the pleasure of viewing. I've fallen in love with the characters, the breathtaking backdrops, the precise animation, the heartfelt score, the cultural depictions, the growth and the journey – the entire world of Avatar, really. It's not easy for any medium to touch me on both the intellectual and visceral depth that Avatar has.I recently read an M. Night Shyamalan interview where he went into a tirade about his unshakable ""integrity"" and how he approached this project with such a mindset. For example, he talked at length about altering the way Firebenders controlled their element, even though members of his own effects staff were protective of the source material. He was adamant about not allowing them to produce their own fire, seeing the original creators as illogical in this regard. In the series, it is clearly explained that fire is produced via ""chi,"" and is henceforth a physical manifestation and extension of a Firebender's life energy. Being heavily immersed in Asian culture, I made sense of it and thought it was a beautiful translation of Chinese beliefs.This might be the minutest of details, perhaps even just a pet peeve on my part, but I believe it offers us a glimpse of how M. Night incontrovertibly lacked the requisite appreciation, reverence, or even just comprehension of the source material – even when members of his own production crew were calling him out on it. This disaster of an adaptation would have been totally preventable if he was just willing to listen, which makes the whole travesty even more of a shame.But what can you expect from a man who frequently makes movie titles an afterthought to his own name? (It again peeves me that he styled this as ""M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender"" when he does not even deserve the slightest credit for any modicum of grace still associated with the material – though I guess it at least helps us distinguish this as ""his own version"" and dismiss it as simply that). This is the same egomaniac who cast himself as a messiah in ""The Lady in the Water,"" the same narcissist who insists on having creative control (writing, directing, producing) over everything he touches, thus sealing himself in his own self-important world. Unfortunately for him, when you occupy all these spots yourself, then who is left to blame for such a shoddy product?I agree that directors have to carry their own visions when creating adaptations, but they should also retain a balance of fidelity to what has made their source materials so endearing (or even just fundamentally coherent) to begin with. A slight amount of respect for the original's success would've gone a long way in imbibing this movie with its own success.The truly amazing adaptations are made by true fans, ala Peter Jackson with ""The Lord of the Rings,"" who not only understand but also revere their source material – hence they are wise about what they choose to alter. Peter Jackson could erase minor characters, add and skip entire chapters for better storytelling effect, but imagine him making the Ring not function similarly, or turn Aragorn into a wimp, or the Hobbits humorless? This is exactly how M. Night has hijacked this universe and its characters.I'm beginning to think that for M. Night, ""integrity"" is just another synonym for ""narcissism,"" and as an unfortunate effect, nowhere else have I seen such an extreme disparity in both class and quality between two versions of the same material.",The Last Airbender

That should be enough to persuade you not to watch this film but if you still are not conviced there are a lot more that is wrong with this movie. Firstly, this movie is cut in a way that constantly leaves you wondering what just happened. Shots begin either too early or too late and on top of the obnoxious cutting, the film has the wort pacing I have ever experienced. The parts that add to the characters or even the parts establishing the characters are almost entirely left out. On top of this the action scenes are the most boring scenes, not only in this movie, but in any movie. The action scenes consist of a bunch of people waiting to take their turn at attacking someone.

I LIKED it!",9,5 July 2010,"okay okay, so I didn't walk out of the theater with my mind blown, contemplating the true meaning of ""life"" or anything, but I DID walk out of there excited for the next installment. It wasn't as horrible as it's being made out to be! In fact, I really enjoyed it! And my kids LOVED it. I'm 27, my kids are 6 and 4.Even after being super SUPER disappointed with everyone crapping on this movie like it was the second coming of ""Waterworld"", we decided to take our 2 young kids to see it anyway, figuring at least they'd get a kick out of some special effect wizardry. We've seen almost every episode of the nickelodeon cartoon and became quite addicted to it's action packed, battle of good and evil driven, martial arts laden, chuckle worthy silly yet serious complexity.In my opinion, you have to walk in there knowing this movie is VERY truncated, and it's an adaptation of a cartoon. A CARTOON, PEOPLE!! It's not Lord of the Rings! It's not James Cameron's Avatar! Stop looking for something you've never seen before. It's a KIDS MOVIE!!! Appreciate it for what it is. If you can do that, you'll really enjoy this movie. Ohh, and see it in 2D. Apparently the 3D conversion is totally not worth it, and you get a real good sense of colors, backgrounds and the visual landscape of the film much better in 2D. I thought it looked gorgeous.Are the pronunciations a bit annoying? Sure. But, whatevah. My husband's name is Noel. Some people say No-Ehl, and some say No-Uhl. WHO CARES! And I am totally opposed to the notion that the director was racist in his cast choices. I'm pretty sure i saw every single race covered in this movie, so that theory can be chucked out the window.I read somewhere that there is little to no bending in this movie. THE WHOLE THING IS BENDING! I loved it! It was amazing!! The boy playing Aang was just about as perfect of a fit for Aang as you could get. It was like he was born to play this role. He is straight up the animated Aang in real life, like right off the page. His martial arts skills are the SHIZ. Prince Zuko does in fact have the burn/scarring on his left eye. Seeing Appa and Momo ""come to life"" made me smile like it was my job! My kids literally screamed with delight.Bottom line is anyone who has their panties in a bunch over this movie is CLEARLY missing the point. IT'S A KID'S MOVIE. it's supposed to be simple and eye pleasing. AND it's only supposed to serve as an introduction. Please watch book one on netflix or the web first if you go see this and you'll understand. I hate it when these anime nerds trash on movies that are made by humans, for humans, not COMICS OR CARTOONS.Could it have been better? Yeah. But it's not a crap fest. Not by far. And there's always room for improvement in the sequels.It's a great movie to sit back and have a good intro to the saga. Watch, my bet is that the next ones are gonna be AMAZEBALLS.GOOD JOB, M.

827,asiao92,"Irresponsible, Insulting, and Poorly Executed",1,13 July 2014,"Calling this movie ""awful"" is putting things too mildly. I harbor nothing but loathing for this movie, not just as an adaptation but as a film in general. My first complaint is slightly inconsequential, but it ties into the bigger issue. I have serious problems about the idiotic decision to change the pronunciation of the names to ""honor the source material and use traditional Asian pronunciation."" Let me reiterate the key phrase here: HONOR. THE. SOURCE. MATERIAL. Do you know what the source material is? The original script from the Nickelodeon show that we all fell in love with and compelled us to waste two hours of our lives on this film buffoonery, hoping against hope itself that it'd do the show justice. Homie, don't talk to me about source material and using traditional Asian pronunciation when you don't even hire from the bountiful pool of Asian actors. What's worse was that he couldn't even get good white actors. Instead, we're presented with bland actors like Noah Ringer, Nicola Peltz, and Jackson Rathbone instead. Wow. I haven't seen such a spectacular and magnificent fail. Good idea using Indian actors for the Fire Nation, yes. Props. That's basically all you've got going for you. The fact of the matter is that I don't care how good Noah Ringer was at martial arts; what I care about was how well this kid managed to capture the essence of Aang, the twelve-year-old who woke up from a hundred-year sleep with the bloated burden of being the Avatar. The show managed to illustrate a fun-loving child who struggled with the weight of the world, but the movie only showed an eighty-year-old in a little boy's body--and not in a good way either. Sokka's over-the-top personality was lackluster; Katara didn't even have her signature hair-loopies. I can't even... The painful dialogue, the too- long martial arts combinations just to lift a rock, the poor rationale for why firebenders can't create their own fire and must therefore bring their own flames to manipulate...I rolled my eyes so much during this movie that they really should've rolled straight out of my head and spared me the mental anguish of watching the rest of it.The biggest mistake, one that made this movie take a grand nosedive into the garbage, was the same one that Chris Carter made with the second X-Files movie. He didn't take into account the fans of the show. There is a difference between fan service and doing right by the fans. The majority of the people who watched the show would naturally flock to the movie, and Shyamalan (and Carter) disappointed these very people. The best thing about this movie is that it's perfect for drinking games. No matter what the rules are, you're surely going to be hammered by the end of it.",The Last Airbender

830,zero272700,Realistic adaptation of the anime in a good way,8,8 July 2010,"So I saw the movie (having never seen or read anything of the original anime), I was pleased with the movie in many ways. Great graphics, the acting wasn't horrible like other reviews say, lots of new actors despite a few familiar faces. The fluidity of the martial arts that Ong displays was amazing. The special effects were great and were used in all the right scenes. The movie was about 1hr 45min long which was a good idea cuz then it wouldn't drag. Now after seeing the movie and actually liking it (despite all the bad reviews) it made me want to start watching the series. Now I'm about half way through the first book and I think that the movie has made a realistic attempt on the anime. The anime is geared towards children 100% so it would be ridiculous to recreate the anime to the ""T"" because it would look very stupid, the anime story line is strictly meant to stay in the nickelodeon series. The movie took all the main ideas of the first book and incorporated realism to the story as if the Avatar was to exist in the real world. The boy who played Ong looked exactly like the anime Ong, also the idea to replace the blue arrow on his head with tribal tattoos was a really good idea, it looks so kool on him. The movie ends perfectly with a tie in into the next book. I have nothing against M. Knight Shamalan or his movies, I personally liked all his movies besides ""The Happening"", he did a great job reinventing the anime series while still keeping the main points to the storyline and making it enjoyable to both kids and adults. I would recommended seeing this movie despite all the bad reviews, I believe that people have a personal vendetta against the director for whatever reason and if the same exact movie had a different director behind it people would review it differently.",The Last Airbender

Having read other reviews I prepped my children to not expect the movie to follow the series.The movie indeed diverges from the original in many aspects, but if one does not think of the movie as related too closely to the original series, one can enjoy it for what it is worth.The movie itself: The acting and story are adequate if little bit stilted, the effects and action scenes are good and all in all my children and I enjoyed the movie. The 3D was insignificant. To sum up: Not great or as good as it could have been, but worth the price of admission and a good night out for the family.",The Last Airbender

The special effects, the score and the plot were compelling for a kids movie.I watched the entire series next.I liked the series except the finale where the avatar kills some firebenders.

First of all, how dare shoot a 100min movie for a season!? It should last about 180min at least so he wouldn't have to rush! Then he couldn't convey the true meaning of Avatar nor the his love to Katara or anything, it was just blah blah blah! I was really so angry at the end with the extra light version of the final of the movie! And what about the actor portraying Uncle Iroh! He acts nice but he doesn't resemble the character in the series! Oh man what else I can say! It was total disappointment for me and I'm so angry that he messed up all the fans' expectations so I still hate him and his crappy other movies like signs and other blahs!

836,datadog,How could anyone mess this up?,3,2 July 2010,"I liked the Sixth Sense. I liked Unbreakable. I liked Signs, The Village, Lady in the Water, and even The Happening. Ever since 1999, I have been defending the directing chops of M. Night Shyamalan, convinced that he could someday handle a big budget blockbuster.But I'm done now. Sorry, M. Night. I can't defend you after today.All right - I'll be quick to acknowledge what was done right: the art direction was flawless and the source material was followed. If all the filler is taken out of the show's first season, then this is the same basic story we're left with. So well done on that.The problem? The basic story we're left with is bare bones. Everything that makes ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" special is missing in this movie. The humour, the charm, the tender moments, the parts that make us smile - all the meat is gone and we're left with bones to chew on. Characters show up, exposition is narrated, and they leave. Even the fight scenes are lacking in the same creative imagination that drove the series. Everything that can make a person want to stand up and cheer has been deliberately excluded from one of this generation's most beloved stories.In short, the movie plays out like it's based on a rough outline than a finished script. What calls for 2 hours is burned through in 90 minutes. Some scenes are even cut short, forcing the narrator to step in and explain what just happened. Who does that? M. Night calls it his art; I call it a rush-job.This is a franchise that truly deserved more. It had all the potential of ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Harry Potter,"" but such an empty and heartless movie may have killed any future sequels. In the miracle that the next two movies move ahead, M. Night may not be welcome as a writer and director anymore. I'd rather he stick to his horror films and let someone else take Appa's reigns.",The Last Airbender
837,JAMagluyan,The Last Bend-Over,1,3 July 2010,There's nothing else to say. It was already a waste of 2 hours of my life + the 60 seconds it took to write this. What an insult. I'm beginning to think M. Night didn't really have anything to do with The Sixth Sense and the other great ones. He probably tried this one on his own and just showed everyone what he is not capable of - making tolerable movies. I'd rather watch a Jar Jar Binks marathon! If you want to get angry go see this. If you're having a great week and want to ruin it go see this. Terrible!!!!!! I watch a lot of movies and have never seen anything this horrible. I remember a long time ago when my wife and I saw a move called Cyborg in 1989 we hated it and to this day it was the worst movie ever for us. Now today I want to get a copy of it and watch Cyborg again just to get happy and erase the memory of this Night film from my thoughts.,The Last Airbender

I suppose you already saw the reviews and know that but still dont watch it. When I first watch this movie in 2010 I was filled with hopes. This movie had potential. The original show already had a great story and a great world. They didnt need to build anything from scratch when making this abomination, they just needed to transfer the story into live action. They just ruined it. If they could be more clever about the decisions this movie would be a blast. They already had a HUGE fanbase waiting for it. They decidedto not use the great story. This show does not resemble the original show in any way expect the character names. It is garbage, literally. The acting, CGI, dialogues. It is bad all ways. Just don't watch it.",The Last Airbender
840,incubus421,I've never been so disappointed.,1,1 July 2010,"WARNING: MANY SPOILERS!! I just returned from a midnight showing of The Last Airbender, and it was by far the worst movie I've seen in some time. I'm a HUGE fan of the cartoon, and even after reading poor reviews from other users, decided to see it anyway. There are very few films that I can't stand, and I thought that since I was a fan, I would enjoy seeing it even though I was prepared to be disappointed. In short, this film contains nothing that made the show great. There's no chemistry between Kitara, Sokka and Aang. Appa and Momo had exactly no personality. The entire story seemed to be presented far too quickly, and with no emphasis on any one particular aspect. It essentially goes from Aang being rescued from Zuko's ship to the Northern Water Tribe with a montage in between after Sokka suggests they hit a bunch of small towns and create rebellions against the Fire Nation. They briefly go into the concepts of bending. They briefly mention the spirit world. They don't mention the Avatar state, although Aang uses it at the end. The characters are never developed. You never get the feeling of any bonds of friendship. Aang isn't lovable and playful. Sokka isn't funny. Kitara isn't motherly and caring. The bending is dumbed down. Only a few great firebenders can create their own fire. The rest of the bending seems like far too much work for hardly any payoff. For example, at one point it takes 5+ earthbenders about 7 seconds to throw one rock about the size of a dinner plate. I guess the best way to put it is that it looks as if the benders are dancing while the elements almost move themselves. It doesn't feel tight and/or coordinated and all the elements move far too slow. The only characters that even remotely look like their cartoon counterparts are Aang, Sokka, Kitara and Yue. Zuko, Ozai, Zhao, Ihro, and Pakku look completely different. The dialogue made me cringe the entire time. Also, many of the names are pronounced differently. Ihro is pronounced Eeroh, Sokka is Soka (like the word ""so""), Aang is more like Ung, and the word Avatar is pronounced like Ah-vatar. Many great characters are just not there, like Bumi, Jet, Roku, Kyoshi or any of the Kyoshi warriors. Not even the cabbage merchant. I don't understand how a film like this could be green-lighted. To conclude, if you like the show, you won't find anything you liked about it in this film other than a watered-down version of the main plot of Book 1 and some weak bending. If you didn't like or didn't see the show, then you will most likely be confused and bored and possibly even angry you wasted your money. Or amused at how ridiculous this movie is. True fans will see this anyway and they can't be blamed, but if you haven't been looking forward to this movie for awhile, don't waste your time.",The Last Airbender
841,Origami Paper Cuts,Movie wasn't made for 8 year olds,10,1 January 2020,"This movie was made for a wider general audience, both adults and kids, which is a good thing.After reading all the negative reviews I went and watched the entire three seasons of the cartoon just to see what all the fuss was about, and after seeing the cartoon I still don't understand what all the negative reviews are going on about.OMG the movie wasn't supposed to be a clone of the TV series, just like every DC or MCU movie is not a clone of the comic books they are derived from, that's called artistic license.The movie had a much serious tone than the cartoon, again it wasn't written for an 8 year old, so there was on screen deaths portrayed and sorry no penguin sledding.From my adult point of view, I found the movie more realistic than the cartoon, albeit a bit rushed so they could fit in all the story line into a movie that was edited too short at 103 minutes, which was most likely the studios preference rather than the director's choice.",The Last Airbender
842,mcfly-72945,A money grab of the fans of the original series.,1,14 September 2019,"This steaming pile of refuse is something I can't stomach to leave alone, so much that I had to make an account just to post how awful this movie is. I should start off by saying this doesn't hold a candle to the original show given it's pacing and showing its incredible portrayal that realistically can only be achieved through animation.The CGI and special effects looks like they came straight from stock sites and placed on screen from editors who seem to be new to editing. What was presented through the CGI showed much less gravitas and power of what should have really been. The concept is people are able to move the 4 base Elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Air) to their whims and desires. What should be an rock-slide of boulders became the flinging of gravel, and what should be torrents of water flowing through the air and slamming into enemies became more akin to a water pistol...The plot of this movie is based off of book 1: water. The first season is roughly 300 mins long, filled with character establishing and building, world building, adventures, lessons on morals, and (to my chagrin) filler episodes. This movie is about 100 mins long, mushed together with no real understanding of characters or the world, Bollywood dancing, and once more filler episodes. It's like a jig saw puzzle in which a third of the pieces are forced into one another, without regard of how it should look but with the minimal concept that the pieces should be there somewhere... oh and then someone threw a jenga piece on top and called it a day.The actor choice for... well anyone was as abysmal as their acting. People who belonged to certain cultures certainly didn't hail from their respected cultures. Whilst racial equality should always be respected, it does not seem right for actors of foreign (to the cultural setting) heritage to play roles which are not suited to them. Whilst on the point of actors, I believe that their acting (whether acting on their own decisions or the directors) was so pathetic that funny parts were dull and any serious plot point is so hilarious by how poorly it was delivered.I can continue over how poorly made this movie is, from the many mispronounced names to the specific lack of knowledge of the characters and world, but for many movie goers this should be enough to dissuade you from going to see this movie. However, after all this I haven't even talked about the biggest crime this movie committed.This movie had a budget of $150 million, in which M. Night Shyamalan could make this movie with plenty of source material. From this he lazily took whatever parts he decided and threw them together to make this disgustingly unforgotten patch of rough in a field of diamonds, doing so with no regard to the original piece or fanbase. With so much hype, people went to see this movie to give it a box office of $319.7 million... people who were fans were scarred and people who were new to the franchise now look down upon it for this is its legacy.
They made double what the budget was, and I would not consider this worthy payment. It's more akin to THEFT for before anyone had a chance to say how they felt fans and the like went and had this horror show burned into their retinas.
Honestly despicable.
If i had any final thoughts, it would be this. The show this is based on is worth a go as it would be a complete and utter shame for anyone to miss out on the story that will unfold. Also just pretend this doesn't exist... It's not worth the pain...",The Last Airbender

I have to admit I'm rather surprised by the overload of 1/10 ratings! Are they for real? I can accept that you may be really into the cartoon and see it a certain way, and that you might therefore disagree with someone else's adaptation, but lets face it it's a kids movie. What did you expect? On the negative side, I did find the dialogue a bit immature at times. I reckon I could have helped them out myself, so I'm not sure what the professional writer was doing?

Regarding the movie, I felt in no way it was ""rushed"" to the end and loosely developed, on the contrary, it was somewhat slow-paced (as most M.Night Shyamalan's movies are)and it did a great job in developing characters, even though some personality changes were performed given the more teen-to-adult focus (but nothing as gross as what was done to Aragorn, quite the contrary in my opinion). I believe it is too much to expect a 440 minutes show to be reduced to a 103 minutes movie without some cuts. I've just finished watching the first season and still think he did a great job.

But there's only so much a die-hard fan can take.From the moment the movie started It felt stilted and wrong and phony. The first interaction between Sokka and Katara was awkward, and made me wince a little to watch. they jumped around too much, with little in between, basically becoming a 'greatest hits' version of season 1 of the animated series. There were no little moments in between to just calm down and laugh a little. it was all BANG BANG BOOM, all the time. It saddened me the further in I got, which is really bad, considering I wanted so badly to love the movie to pieces, no matter what the naysayers decided to spew.All the actors were pretty bad, but I think Nicola (Katara) and Seychelle (Yue) did the best with what they had. Nicola put some much needed heart into her portrayal of Katara, and you actually sort of kind of believe her concern for Aang. Seychelle made for a heartbreakingly beautiful Yue who painfully needed more screen time. Dev digs the lukewarm flow too, as Zuko, but I grew to like general iroh, another actor who put heart into his character, something the rest of the cast needs to learn how to do. No matter how crappy the script, if it ain't got heart, it ain't got nothing.I'd recommend a once through in IMAX 3D, but definitely too painful for another run-through after that. I hope and pray book 2 is able to be green-lighted, just so they can learn from this one and make it better.",The Last Airbender

I've never walked out of a movie in my life, but if I hadn't bought tickets for the 4 of us tonight I would have been fine with leaving this one.

852,oldtimerock,What Could Have Been A Defining Fantasy Epic...,3,3 July 2010,"First off, I will not bash M Night. His previous work (Unbreakable, TSS, Signs) to me, were fantastic movies. When I heard he was helming this project, I thought to myself: ""The Happening and Lady in the Water type-casted him. Perhaps this will bring him out of his shell and expand his directing talent"", I gave him the benefit of the doubt, because he CAN make a good movie. Unfortuantly, this production in no way redeemed his career. In fact, it could be his final career killer, at least as a writer. From the moment I heard about the movie, I was instantly excited and couldn't wait for it to be released, as I was a fan of the show from day one. I saw a few of the early trailers and thought to myself 'This is gonna be good'...you know the rest.The plot, the character development, the acting, the casting, it was all dreadful and straight up mocked what was possibly one of the greatest written cartoons out there and Nickelodeons finest work. Without getting into details, nearly every feature of the movie (save the CGI, which was acceptable at best) was downright terrible. Zhao honestly gave me the creeps, and not the good kind. Ozai was far from intimidating, Zuko, Katara, Sokka, and to an extent Aang (or Aung, as it is pronounced in the film) feel more like extras then actual lead parts. To sum it up for myself, the two best parts of the movie were when Aang was about to unleash what I can only describe as badass waterbending, on the stunned fire navy fleet (you know what happens, FAIL) and the minute the movie ended and the credits begin to roll, knowing this butchering was over.P.S, that cannon mounted on the fire navy ship was kinda cool",The Last Airbender

The only criticism I have is that the character of Zuko wasn't brooding enough. We are avid watchers of the show, and I thought the movie was true to the show, except it was lacking the humor. The effects were amazing. Don't listen to critics. This is a great movie, appropriate for the entire family. We all want to see it again, and can't wait for the sequels to come out.

I ignored the controversy surrounding it, ignored what people were saying so I could go into it and get my own opinion of it.I wish I hadn't. The acting is flat throughout the movie. I was hoping maybe Noah Ringer or Nicola Peltz would get better through the movie, but they don't. Peltz seems to be crying every time she's on screen, and Ringer seems to be reading the lines as he's acting them.The pacing is way off. One minute they're in the Southern Water tribe village, the next minute the crew is freeing an Earth village and flying off to free the next. Then, they're in the Northern Water tribe, and the Fire nation is about to attack, and Yue is in love with Sokka.Which, if you had only seen the movie, would seem out of nowhere. There is no hint that they'll maybe have some sort of relationship. They are on screen together for all of two minutes before there's kissing and crying that she's sacrificing herself to etc. etc. She's not on screen long enough to give any sort of emotional connection to the character, which left me kind of shrugging when she passed. In short: If you are a fan of the show, don't go to see this film. It lacks the heart and charm the series had, and throws out all the fun for a drably serious plot that feels forced. Oh, and don't bother with the 3D. Its more of an after thought than anything.",The Last Airbender

The ""dialog"" consisted of stringing together a couple lines from each of the half hour cartoons in the series, and then butchering the lines and pronunciations. Shyamalan claims to have been a fan of the cartoon, which is an obvious lie. Stay far away from this movie. Get the cartoon series on DVD instead. The cartoon is the diametric opposite of the movie.

856,c-86778,You Passed the Test?,3,24 January 2020,"At the beginning of the last decade, The Last Airbender film was meant to be the entrance to the world of film for the original TV series that it was based on. However, after viewing the film both before and after being a fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender (2005-2007), this was not what the film became and I did not like the end result of the film adaptation. My top concern is that director M. Night Shyamalan's attempts to make the film flow took away from who the characters were supposed to be.The movie begins with two teenage siblings, Sokka and Katara, living in the South Pole who come across a large spherical iceberg containing a mysterious boy. They discover later that he is the Avatar after the banished prince, Zuko, of the Fire Nation arrives to take him from the village or burn it down if he does not. Aang has yet to realize that there are no other Air Nomads left.The plot flows into Zuko (Dev Patel) and his uncle Iroh (Shaun Toub) testing Aang. Once Aang realized they would imprison him instead of freeing him, he escapes the ship to be reunited with Sokka, Katara, and his flying bison named Appa (Dee Bradley Baker). They travel first to the Earth Kingdom and begin saving small villages, before Aang's imprisonment, release, and their arrival at the Northern Water Tribe. Aang learns how to bend water as the Fire Nation attempts to invade the Northern Water Tribe and wipe out the water benders. Aang has to finally let his emotions flow to fulfill his task and then accept his role as the Avatar at last.The Last Airbender is consistent throughout its 1 hour and 43 minutes at not matching the tone that the original TV series set. The seriousness that was portrayed by the characters did not make them act like the ages they are supposed to be. Aang (Noah Ringer) was 12 years old in the film, the same age as the actor who portrayed him, but Ringer's tone in the role was more somber and anxious than the relaxed and joyful 12-year-old Aang from the original series (voiced by Zach Tyler Eisen). The Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) in the film is also more serious and stiff than his sarcastic, meat-loving counterpart in the TV series (voiced by Jack DeSena), and for a film meant to be about peace and the flow of emotions, Sokka's film character does not seem to contribute to either of these.What they did well in the film though was that they had the different groups of people wear colors that represent those differences: Earth Kingdom people wore green, Fire Nation wore red and black, Water Tribes wore blue, and Air Nomads wore mostly yellow. In a way, the different colors also connected with the composition of the film. The Fire Nation wore red and black, symbols of power, passion, and evil, which contrasted with the Water Tribe's peaceful blues. The battle between peacefulness and power, light and dark, was shown when the moon changed from blue to red with the treatment of the moon spirit.The scene that contributes the most to the flowing of emotions is when a strong flashback is placed well at the end of the film. Aang is about to bend the ocean into a giant wave to stop the fighting, but before he does this, his mind flashes back to his memories of learning from his guardian, Monk Gyatso. The happy memories, and past regrets, flow through his mind as he concentrates on bending the ocean in a way that is visually appealing to the audience. Aang releasing his clenched grip on containing his emotions displays to the audience the need for other people, the audience, to stop letting the past stop them too.The Last Airbender's overall plotline leaves out many of the humanizing details that Avatar: The Last Airbender has; how to be relatable to the audience and put more of the intended emotion into their voices. For trying to fit what was 20 episodes of a TV show into one film, the change was like trying to add the pieces of one puzzle to the overall image of another puzzle; it just does not work out to be the best masterpiece that the film had the potential to become.",The Last Airbender
857,londynbridges,HORRIBLE,1,1 July 2020,An absolute disgrace to the show. I wish I could give this 0 stars. They ruined ALL of the characters and charm of the show. If only there was a memory wipe to forget about this movie.,The Last Airbender
858,rhiannon_starfire,I really wanted to like it...,2,1 July 2010,"As a fan of the series I was very excited to see this movie, only to be utterly disappointed.SPOILERS TO FOLLOW...For starters, the acting was really horrible. Personally I was rather annoyed by all the ""controversy"" surrounding the elasticities of the cast. Its a movie guys: get over it. But I think the actors they chose were too inexperienced or didn't suit the role they were meant to play. Iroh was the only exception, and even then was lacking some of the character's nuances that made him like-able.There was no character development to speak of. Katara narrates through the movie, which would have been fine, except that they were using the narration to substitute for missing scenes and character interactions. I don't want to hear her tell me ""Sokka and the princess got close"" I want to see it happen.Now, I get that there was a lot of ground to cover in one film so some material is going to be excluded. But pivotal stuff shouldn't be. They were in Kyoshi, but we never met Suki. There was no Omashu, no Jet, no Roku... But what kills me is that it was only one and a half hours when it could have easily been two or two and a half.The other thing that bothered me was Fire Lord Ozai. In book one he was this big ominous entity that you never actually saw, but was pretty intimidating. The Ozai in the film isn't intimidating in the least. The most menacing thing he does is say ""Kill the moon spirit!"" Not impressive.Some things I did like. The costumes weren't bad. The North Pole was beautiful. The effects were nice... overdone, but nice. And I liked Appa.Ultimately, I am sad and rather angry. I wish that I had waited and not spent the money to see it in theaters. Fans will be disappointed and strangers to the story will be unimpressed.",The Last Airbender

860,mad_berov,A movie about how NOT to make a movie !,2,30 August 2010,"As a fan of the animated series, I was pretty confident no one could screw the movie THAT badly. To my bitter surprise, Shayamalan proved me wrong.What made the TV-show such a delight to watch in the first place? We've got Aang - the flippant air-bending prodigy, Katara - the sexy and hard water-bending novice, and Sokka - the sarcastic and always-hungry warrior. Then we've got the power-hungry Fire Nation who spreads terror and oppresses much like the Nazis. Next, we've got Prince Zuco - the sex-symbol with burnt eye, and his hilarious tea-addict uncle. All together, they provide the show with wonderful comic relief, moral virtues and suspense. The movie has none of them ! Acting performance is unspeakably poor and would repel anyone not familiar with the original show - Aang is bewildered and reticent; Katara is always whining; Sokka is neither funny, nor brave; Zuco evokes only mockery; his uncle is pathetic; the Fire Nation, supposed to be the most powerful, has nothing horrifying about it - they even need present fire if they are to shoot it at someone! To put some numbers, Season 1 is roughly 400 minutes, and the movie's just a quarter of that time - it is understandable to miss a lot of scenes, I agree. What I can't forgive Shayamalan is that he has omit all adventures that actually shaped the characters as individuals and as a team. Instead, the movie sticks to one-liners which cover a whole (or 2) episodes of the original sequence - ""blah blah, this is the water-bending master"" and Aang is already ready to bend the sea. Ridiculous! Yes, the effects look cool and the music is fine. That's why I give it +1 star.To sum up, in my opinion this movie had all the potential to be as EPIC as Lord of the Rings. What Lord of the Rings and the original Avatar TV-series have in common are the great characters, the intriguing mythology, the epic sieges, the power-struggles, some love every now and then. The only movie's potential, however, is to enrage the fans and bore anyone else to death.",The Last Airbender

The film does have great depth (You have to pay attention), wonderful cinematography, beautiful flowing ""dance"" ti chi elements when ""bending"", and a VERY deep and meaningful storyline. I think that most of the bad reviews stem from resentful ""Fanboys"". Its like most people cant understand that if a cartoon series (or book for that matter) has 200+ HOURS (or pages) of episodes, characters, stories , etc... that it just IS NOT going to fit or translate perfectly over to a 2-3 hour movie. Something has to give people. This was not made to be an exact live action duplicate of the t.v show... NOT TO MENTION this was GOING to be a trilogy! So all that crying and babbling on and on about how ""this"" and ""That"" or ""Who ever"" wasn't in the movie KEPT THAT FROM BEING MADE INTO A MOVIE! If you people would have just enjoyed the FIRST movie for what it was, there could have been two more and your favorite parts from the cartoon would have been realized in full live action greatness. If you haven't seen it, RENT IT... FYI I have never watched the cartoon series or really heard much about it. This was my first experience with the mythos and thought it was quite unique and enjoyable. This may be also why I could care less that the names were slightly pronounced different, or only a few people could make fire, or all these other trivial things people have been FREAKING out over! THE MOVIE WAS GOOD! It was, and I HATE M. Night Shyamalan ... SERIOUSLY. His movies as of late have been pretty bad, but NOT this one. THanks! and ENJOY the movie :)",The Last Airbender

865,romanmatt,The Last Airbender Worst Movie of the Year?,1,2 July 2010,I just had the worst film experience of the year and it came in the form of The Last Airbender. The Last Airbender directed by M. Night Shyamalan. I agree with most of the reviews that say this will probably be his last movie that he gets the privilege of filming. With his last movie The Happening which I like to call Not Happening this film makes that film look good. With the budget of the film around 200$ million and another 100$ in advertising this will be a very costly fail of a film. Noah Ringer as Aang was only of the only correctly casted leads the other two children casted as the helpers and the one as the narrator were extensively miscast. When a film has to rely on narration and flashbacks you know there's a problem. Don't get me started on the 3-D it makes the film look so dark and half of the film is shot at night. You can't even see anything half the time. When a film is shot in 3-D or animated in 3-D it works great but when it has been filtered through the conversion at the last moment possible it does not work at all. The Last Airbender Worst Movie Of The Year? Rottentomatoes.com has 97 negative reviews out of 106 and average rating of 3/10. You can add mine to that making it 98. Just stay at home or go see Knight and Day that was a fun popcorn flick that is light years better then this garbage and as a bonus it is not in 3-D.http://www.newglitch.com the Everything Blog,The Last Airbender

That was the only thing though, and by no means was it enough to mask the odor that is ""The Last Airbender."" Not only did I love the series, but despite M. Night's last flops I still respected the guy and had high hopes for this movie. My friend and I were in shock the entire time at the bad acting (I do NOT want to hear people say ""well, they're kids, you try doing better."" I don't act, but I can still tell what bad acting is) and the rest of the theater was laughing at the horrible dialogue.This is the first time I really felt I needed to express my love or hate for a film.

Basically the same thing with this movie, but there is no comedy just sad grey seriousness. Although i can imagine Aang and everyone's reaction to this movie and it just made me laugh. Plz watch that episode tho you'll get a kick out it as your watching this movie 🍿",The Last Airbender
869,clarkesummers,Horrible and Heart Shattering,1,24 May 2020,"I was 6 when this movie came out, I waited for months to see it, begged with my siblings to go to McDonalds to get a 'The Last Airbender' toy, and went to see it the month it came out- I came out of the theater and started crying. It wasn't because of anyone dying, it was because i was so disappointed with the absolute horror that as this movie- I was physically reacting to the months of me waiting, anxiously asking my parents when it would come out, like it would have changed in the last day, and building up that they were making a movie of my favorite tv show, those ideas all smashed. I waited throughout the movie because it must get better- right... wrong, it just got worse.
I ignored this movie for years after it came out on DVD and I watched it again, and it was still just as bad, I rediscovered it a few months ago, watched it alone, showed it to my family, one member whom couldn't watch it all the way through. I was worse than I remembered it being.
As a movie separate from the television show it's not good either, the acting is inconstant, and often bad, the plot is very holey, characters have no motivations or arcs, the dialogue is bad, so much exposition, the cuts are weird, and the choice of shot, composition, and framing are the opposite of what you are taught to do. Now removed from my horror it's quite laughable how there are no good parts to this movie.
With regards to A:TLA is is worse, so much worse, the names are wrong, the cast whitewashed, important plot ignored, plot rewritten, lore changed, characters unfaithful to the original, sometimes even disrespectfully so, motivations changed, and so many other things big, and small are ruined from the source material. It is a bad synopsis of the first season, that at school, would get you pegged for just reading the Wikipedia page... and then forgetting half of what was on it.
I could talk about how heart-wrenchingly awful this movie was for hours, and I have, but I need to stop thinking about it.
I implore you to not watch it, or at least watch it with a ranting buddy... I mean, friend. If you have seen this movie and you enjoyed it, good for you i guess, but you should watch it again, and this time- pay attention.",The Last Airbender
870,JohnFKlink,A big waste of time!,1,19 January 2011,"I loved the original Nickelodeon animated series ""Avatar - The last Airbender"" and even while i was watching ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" I did not regret it. But as I watched the movie ""The last Airbender"" I felt like I just wasted 103 minutes of my rare lifetime. I really regret having seen this movie and I am glad that I did not go to cinema to see this movie.!!!The following text may contain SPOILERS!!!The story was far away from the original story of the animated series. The cast was terribly, by which I do not mean the talent of the actors but the roles the actors were cast to play. In the animated series the firenation guys were white, by which i mean white as snow. And the watertribe members were tanned by the sun. Uncle Iroh was... let's say fatter. In this movie it was vice versa. That sucked that the tanned and black actors who look indish or arabian had to play the bad firenation. That seems to me like an old and stupid cliché. And the stupid moves which should be ""bending"" were too much. Just ridiculous!!",The Last Airbender

I was unable to even finish the movie. I wish I could rate it lower. I understand that adaptations are difficult to reflect in the same light as the original content but the direction style, casting, writing, acting, and animation of this movie was lazy, disrespectful, and devalued the core ideals of the series. The movie proves painful to watch. I grew up watching the series and still now as an adult I am still constantly in awe of how wonderful of a show it is.

One of the things that I found annoying is that they pronounce the name Aang as ""Ung"" it's pronounced ""Aaaang"". In addition to that, they also pronounce Uncle Iroh's as ""Eeroh"" not as ""I-roh"".The effects we're decent, although the bending looks quite stupid and useless. Once scene was an earthbender literally spending half a minute bending a pebble. Grabbing that pebble and throing it would've made more damage and made it more quicker. I want to add that bending in the series was a form of art. It was basically nature flowing through you, you're controlling it through your emotions. They should've based the movements through that one episode where Aang and Zuko went to the Sun Warriors.Bending requires precision and strong powerful movements. The movie would've been accurate if they were portraying a dead octopus because all of their movements we're nothing but floppy hand gesture without any depth or emotions. It was almost like this was being filmed at 3 in the morning with gas attendants as the actors. There was zero dedication.Benders were used as warriors or soldiers because they possesed and used this gift, but in the movie it seemed like bending is the last thing everyone wanted to do and use.In conclusion, this production was nothing but a Bollywood remake of Avatar with highschool students as actors.",The Last Airbender

I can agree with some people that the special effects and imagery were pleasant to watch. Now, you may be wondering, why did I generously give this film 2 stars? Well, a problem with this cinematic film is that it skims over vital parts of the plot. Some of these key events would have made the movie flow much better. Secondly, this film whitewashes 2 of the main characters (Katara and Sokka). As a fan of the animated series, it was somewhat of a shock to me to see ""white"" Katara and Sokka. I have a darker skin tone similar to Katara in the animated series, so I was disappointed when watching the movie. Third of all, they didn't have an accurate portrayal of some of the characters, such as Uncle Iroh, who is supposed to have a more rounded body shape. Also, the pacing of this film is horrendous. I do not want to go into detail about it. Lastly, please watch Netflix's live-action of Avatar And The Last Airbender series when it is released.

881,jamesschlottman,Come on M. Night... Really?,1,20 July 2020,"Let me preface by saying ""don't waste your time"", if you watched the TV Show you will only get upset by watching the movie. Let's just hope Netflix doesn't butcher it like M. Night Shyamalan did with this.Avatar: The Last Airbender was one of my favorite shows on Nickelodeon when I was younger. It was adventurous, humorous, fun and serious with an underlying lesson in every episode. M. Night Shyamalan gutted every aspect that Avatar fans loved about the show and turned it into a bunch of dancing clowns. Not only did he butcher the pronunciation of every characters name, he took away their personality, removed major plots and made everyone completely unlikeable. No beef with the actors, but they definitely weren't given the right direction for their characters. Aang was lame, he was no fun, he didn't showboat, and he had no sense of adventure. Katara had no energy or life and was just there to fill in unwarranted conversation. Sokka was definitely not funny, and he was boring as all else. Appa and Momo got completely shafted. Zuko was semi decent, although his scenes were lame and his bending was even lamer. Uncle Iroh had no wisdom and joy in him whatsoever. Ozai shouldn't have even been shown except for maybe a flashback, even still they should have just had a shadowy silhouette. M. Night Shyamalan tried to combine the Kyoshi Island episode with the Haru prison episode which failed terribly, especially since we didn't get to see Suki or the real Haru.The element bending was a joke. First, the characters had to go through a lengthy process of dance moves just to start bending the elements, unlike the show where the elements moved more insync with their movements. Next, firebenders needed fire, well except Iroh, who was able to light himself on fire and not be burned some how. I mean if they needed fire around to bend you would think they would just carry some flint and steel or something, but no they had to rely on torches and so on. In the show Katara gets upset with Aang because Aang is such a natural waterbender, instead the movie portrays Aang and scaredy cat who struggles to waterbend. I can go all day on how terrible the bending was, just trust my first statement and ""don't waste your time"".Overall I would have to say the movie was probably one of if not the worst show to movie adaptations I have ever seen, and I mean DragonBall Evolution was a complete mess. M. Night Shyamalan needs to stick to movies like Unbreakable, Split and Glass, those were great for the most part but I think it is because he created them, he didn't copy them from anything. He does much better work when he does his own thing and they can be more serious. The Last Airbender should have been light hearted and fun with some amazing special effects, instead we got boring slow with decent special effects.",The Last Airbender
882,colonelme,Wow......,1,1 July 2010,"There are not words to describe this epic disaster of epic disasters. How could the creators of such an amazing series let this happen. I was constantly appalled throughout the entire movie, granted, lots of stuff gets lost in the transfer of books/shows to movies, but this wasn't even in the ball park. My friends and I, all very big avatar fans, were searching desperately for anything good in the movie, we must say that we found nothing at all. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie previews before airbender started, but thats where the enjoyment ended.I've seen the series through many times, that I could easily list all the stuff they missed or how they could've at least referenced some very important events. Momo and Appa were nothing in the movie, they were barely even alive, they are supposed to be main characters. Sokka had no silly funny lines like he has all over the series. That is barely the tip of the iceberg. Just awful, hopefully our $11 dollar sacrifice will save others from suffering through this.

We have not (yet) watched the animated series, so we can't compare the movie to it. In fact, I personally don't care for Anime style cartoons. It always seems that the Japanese to English retreads leave something lost in translation for me. It appears that a lot who have posted hate the movie because of the changes made from the series. I have to say that just might be a good thing. The series could have remained as a niche hit with a relatively small cult following (I had never heard of it before the movie, obviously). The movie, in its changes, offers to make the Airbender a household phenomenon. Selling out? Maybe. Remember though, I don't ""get"" anime, but I get this. My son loved it. I did too. The action and effects of the movie were good enough. Nonetheless, it was the themes that set it apart. Freedom, rising against oppression, unity in diversity, and peace through non-violence are all touched upon. So what is the point? The point is that beyond not conforming to the series, it is cool in its own right and opens the door for a whole new group of Airbender fans.

I went searching around for information the day it came out, and was quite disappointed to read some of the more scathing reviews. I was therefore torn about seeing it myself, but I did, and here's what I have to say: This was not the worst movie ever. Yes, the storyline was choppy; yes, there was little character development (especially in Katara's case, which upset me); and yes, the writing was... sub-par (a Fire Nation soldier practically whines in one scene that being hit with rocks ""really hurt!""). But all things considered, it could have been much worse.There are things to keep in mind, such as: this isn't the kind of film M. Night Shyamalan bases his career on. This was an attempt to cram approximately ten hours worth of story into a 100-minute movie. And truthfully... maybe he shouldn't have done it all on his own. I would suggest, if nothing else, a different writer for the follow-up. (Mike & Bryan, perhaps?) The main focus was probably to emphasize the action, not the plot. It should have been a bit more in favor of the latter, true, but at the very least, the fighting/bending sequences were rather fantastic. Basically, what was lacking in grace was made up for in style.My advice is to take this movie simply for what it is: an exciting action flick that can probably only get better from here.Also: does anyone but me think Momo looked like Zoboomafoo with wings and pointy ears?",The Last Airbender

I really thought that some of the criticism was exaggerated because it doesn't resemble the original series enough. I thought ""oh, how bad can it be?"" Oh boy, was I naive!We really struggled with finishing this movie.
Bad script, no proper structure, no relationship between the characters, no emotions, bad visual effects, many scenes didn't make sense and most importantly: no humor at all. And humor is probably something that made up a big part of the original series. The film seemed completely stiff, the characters had no chemistry at all.
And what kind of Uncle EEE-rruh was that? These character traits didn't fit to the one in the series at all.
And Appa and Momo were kinda creepy...
And as for Dev Patel: He is a really wonderful actor, he was already in really great productions... what was he doing in this movie?I'm not a person who has super high expectations regarding movies, but this ... The only positive aspect: The movie managed to make me forget the coronavirus for a few hours.

I guess it is easy to want to compare the movie with the cartoon, but it is really not fair. Making a movie on a large scale costs a lot more money, and the time frame allowed is rather short compared to what the cartoons can cover. Plus, people and computer animation are a bit more limited that cartoon characters. All things considered, the movie covered the essential points and did a good job in character development as time allowed. I was impressed with the dance-like movements these young actors learned for their bending powers. I also appreciated the inclusion of the theme that Aang wasn't to harm others, just show power. That's refreshing considering all of the violence in the world. I know many won't agree with me, but I've tried to appreciate movies for what they do accomplish and not what they leave out. The Harry Potter movies taught me that. I say give the movie a chance and try to appreciate the movie by itself.

Or should I say, ""SOAK-A""2) Who was the cast chooser!? Who ever was did a ""GREAT"" Job! You should earn an award for... idk.. oh! How about... ""WORST CASTING EVER!!"" The actors are dry, and lifeless. They have NO emotion. But, I can tell that is not their fault... (I mean, entirely) it's mostly the director's fault.....3) NO COMEDY?!?? Tell me a joke. Ok... funny!! . Tell me a joke the movie said?? You: ........... NO COMEDY! Good job......4)Where's the exciting parts in the movie, again???? Ok.. I didn't mean the action. There's action.... but u was talking about the fact that the BEST parts in the movie are cut out. Like-THINGS YOU DID OK WITH.
1 The CGI when it comes to Appa is pretty cool. When me and my siblings were new to this movie, we LOVED seeing Appa!! We were worried he wasn't there at all!!
2 ok, the action is pretty good, tho. The actors do have skills, but only in fighting
3 and last, when the avatar got out of the ice burg was pretty sick. But... you could at least add the part when he says,"" come closer...... CAN YOU PLAY PENGUIN SLEDDING WITH ME??!""But that's all. thanks for hearing my opinion!!

903,kylehanzl,This is actually torturous.,1,23 April 2021,"Avatar the Last Airbender was a television series that aired on Nickelodeon from 2005 - 2008. This show has received unreal praise even to this day and is seen as the greatest show Nickelodeon has ever produced. At the height of its popularity, they decided to turn the beloved series into a movie. The unfortunate thing is that the move did not live up to the show; not even a little. The movie is an embarrassment to everyone involved and a slap in the face to the fanbase of the original television show. The first issue is with the casting of the characters. The creators of the original series based the regions of the fictional world off of actual cultures that exist in our world. Each one represents mostly Eastern regions like China, Japan, Tibetan Monks, and indigenous Arctic tribes. They took the core concepts of Air Nomads (Monks) and the people of the Water Tribe (Inuit and Yupik) and decided to cast dull, poorly trained, white actors. Another major issue is the deviation from the source material, i.e. The show. The firebenders could not create their own fire, the characters personalities were nothing like their shows counterparts, they never mentioned previous Avatars, there was no giant ocean spirit attack during the battle of the North. And finally, the bending itself. It seems that the team just ran out of money and stopped putting the special effects of characters bending. There are scenes where characters are moving their arms randomly and nothing happens. When we finally do see some bending, it is in the form of some half-a** fight scene where two characters take turns pretending to know what they are doing. Don't even get me started on the random little rock that apparently took 10 people doing a lot of weird dance moves to bend. All in all, I think the only reason you should ever watch this movie is to make fun of it for the dumpster fire it is. I give this movie one star, and the only reason it has 1 star is because there were like two moments where the movie was so bad it made me laugh.",The Last Airbender

At the end of the movie I sat in shock. 8yr old me was horrified and I began to cry. I had such great expectations for this movie and was severely disappointed.

906,callan-rm,Could it have been any worse!?,1,10 April 2011,"I'm a huge fan of the TV series and actually a fan of M. Night Shyamalan(or at least I was). OK, he seems to get worse with every movie but how many other movie-makers have made something like The Sixth Sense?I've avoided watching this for a long time because, from the reviews, I knew it was going to be disappointing. So I psyched myself up, I was prepared for disappointing. What I wasn't prepared for was absolutely DIRE from start to finish. All he had to do was take a great story with some of the best characters ever created and bring it to the big screen! How could you fail!? Most of the movie makes no sense, the dialogue is some of the worst I've ever heard and it's utterly lifeless. I really can't understand it - one of the things I always liked about Shyamalan was the intelligence and subtlety of his films but the script here has been dumbed down to a ridiculous extent. Most of the characters are different from the TV series notably all lacking a sense of humour - Zuko seems more depressed than angry, Uncle Iroh, rather than looking like a defeated, tired old man who is very wise underneath, looks like someone trying hard to be wise and spiritual saying inane pseudo-wise-spiritual things, Sokha isn't funny and Aang isn't playful. And why change the pronunciation of the names? Did the original creators get them wrong or something? Then there was the bending - why bother with it at all when it's so slow? - surely hand-to-hand combat would be more effective. There were so many scenes of warriors waving swords around in the middle of nowhere while standing still waiting to be hit with some bending- really not an effective way to fight at all. I feel sorry for the actors - a lot of them didn't seem right for the roles but it's kind of hard to tell with dialog that bad. And I feel sorry for the set designers who obviously worked very hard and created some amazing backdrops for this travesty. It's bad because of the screen writing and the direction and they both point to the same person.It's sad that a cartoon (essentially a series of 2D drawings) should have so much more life and energy than a big budget, live-action movie and it's sadder still that someone with M. Night Shyamalan's talent (I believed in you man!) should entirely disappear up his own backside. It's such amazing source material that I'd love to see it done well on the big screen.

However, my seven year old nephew recently got into the show and when he heard there was a movie, he wanted to watch it. So I finally decided to watch it with him.That was a mistake.Very few of the characters names are gotten right. (How is that possible? They're pronounced clearly in the show.) Not to mention the incredibly weird white-washing and the probably racist choice to make the Fire Nation (the bad guys) Middle-Eastern/Indian/ambiguously brown.Firebenders can't create their own fire and have to use preexisting fire which makes their takeover of the world entirely unbelievable. Throw some dirt onto their fire, pour some water on their fire, scatter the fuel and blow out the fire with wind. How did none of the other nations think of this. Even my seven year old nephew yelled ""Just put the fire out!"" during the battle at the prison.Speaking of the prison, there's a reason the prison in the original was basically an oil rig in the middle of the water, there was no earth for the earthbenders to use! How'd they mess that up for the movie? Were the earthbenders in the movie brain damaged? Did the Fire Nation just beat them over the head with a club and hope they forgot how to earthbend? You're surrounded by your greatest weapon (a whole bunch of dirt) and you can't fight back? Put out the fire and you would be basically untouchable. It's so frustrating it makes me angry.I could continue. I really, really could. But I don't want to waste anymore of my time thinking about this dumpster fire.

First off this is one of M, Nights best films since signs worst is the village, the happening and lady in the water.2. The cartoon show is good but is to G, too campy not not like dragonball z the movie is dark, wicked everything the show could've been3. The martial arts was good there was not a lot of fighting one on one combat but the movie showcased the arts of wushu and tai chi making this the first USA movie to do so.4. Because this is a PG Kids movie the script was poorly written in the acting sucked but who cares i've seen worse5. And finally the storytelling come on 20 episodes in 2 hours he nailed it i don't see what the problem isAnd now long story short i thought the movie was good not bad or excellent but good so whats with all the hate what more do you want thats what a sequel is for.

I hope they make this into a live action movie. There is so much content and story, and so many directions it could go.However, watching the movie in the theater was the biggest box office disappointment I've experienced. We debated walking out and asking for our money back, but we kept saying.. It must get better, we'll watch for 10 more minutes.. It didn't. Shamalan should be flogged for destroying such a rich and wonderful story.

916,KahleAlfire,"The Last Airbender, an Entertaining Time Killer. (not as bad as people say)",7,2 July 2010,"Avatar: The Last Airbender was easily one of the greatest American animated series in the past decade. I imagine that most of you who are reading this review have seen the show a few times. I would not be surprised if many of you have seen every episode and possibly even own them on DVD. I honestly do not believe that Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, the creators of the animated series, ever expected the cartoon to become immensely popular among such a wide age group and audience. With such high expectations obtained from the original series, it is unsurprising that the movie did not live up to its animated counterpart.The truth is though. This movie has gotten far worse reviews than it deserves. It was defiantly not the greatest movie, in fact, far from it. However, the massive hate for this movie is almost unimaginable and unrealistic. It is difficult to take such heated reviews seriously, when so many unbiased and medium rated reviews are obtaining thumbs down in an attempt to hide them...I went to see this movie, fully knowing it would not be the best movie out this year. However, I was surprised that it was, at least, far more entertaining than reviews suggest. I would rate this movie 5 out of 10, (I put 7 out of 10 to negate some of the damage of the multiple account haters). I would watch the animated series over the movie. However, the movie was not a 1 out of 10. 1 out of 10 is, in my opinion, a made for TV SciFi movie. This was still miles beyond something like that Below is a list of obvious annoyances and problems with the movie:-------------------------------------------------------Mispronounced names - This had to have been done for a reason. There is no possibility that they did not know how to pronounce Aang, or Sokka. The question is, ""Why did they do this?"" Jumpy plot and time-line - The movie was sectioned off randomly. Flashbacks, especially, would have made more sense if actually used as an intro to the movie. This is an obvious sign of the incompetence we get form M. Night Shyamalan and the movie's writers. There is really no excuse for this.Bad writing - Honestly, the actors are not that bad. The problem is what they had to work with. The writers were just bad. Dialog was condensed into dribble in sections that would have mattered, and expanded into pointlessness in others. Still, 95% of it was not as bad as a 1 out of 10 movieThe narrative intro was changed - Why did they decide to do this? It is obvious that one of the main problems with the film was the hurdle they had to overcome by condensing so much material into an hour and a half. Yet, they decided to change the intro narrative into one that actually explains LESS than the original from the animated series...Ignorance of the animated series bending techniques - Fire bending is not supposed to require an external source of fire to work. Bending of the elements is supposed to be nearly instantaneous and choreographed to match the martial arts styles being used. By ignoring these facts, the action was almost slow in comparison to what you would expect.Lack of funding? - It almost seems as if they were having serious issues with funding for rending time in this film. Many of the scenes seem like they were supposed to have had bending added to them in post, and yet it was just ignored -------------------------------------------------------Despite this list, I still found the overall movie entertaining.So what does this all boil down too? Nickelodeon could have made this the movie of the summer. In fact, the movies could have been made into a rival of more popularized sagas, such as Twilight or Harry Potter.The biggest mistakes Nickelodeon made were hiring M. Night Shyamalan, and attempting to condense the whole series into 3 movies (this movie is season 1, Book 1: Water.). It is pretty obvious that the movie could have massively benefited from having better writers, a better director, and more air time. Possibly 5-6 movies? A huge undertaking, but with the ability to develop the world and characters in depth, an overall better chance of succeeding.My advice is, if you want to see the movie, do it. It is not as bad as all the haters suggest. Just do not expect it to be great. However, do not see it in 3D (not enough effects). It is entertaining enough to make you remember the series you love. If we are lucky, they will create the second and third book, with a different director. Maybe then they can salvage this trilogy. If not, we still have the animated series, and we should all be looking forward to the 'unknown' new series that Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko are supposedly working on.",The Last Airbender

918,ingolfslandj,"Disappointing Beginning, Beautiful End",7,1 July 2010,"The beginning of the movie was not the strongest. Shyamalan didn't build on character, which is odd for him as that is what he usually is best at with his films. Instead he dives into plot incredibly fast. Most of the acting is ""sub-par"", but considering most of the actors are kids I'm going to grade it on a curve. The girl that played Katara though was pretty awful. They could have found someone better. Also, some of the dialogue was a little weird. There were places where it felt either forced or unnecessary.The struggle I had too was that I was comparing it to the cartoon. Those who wanted it to be identical to the cartoon are going to be disappointed. He keeps most of it intact, but trying to adapt a 2 hour movie from a 18 episode story is going to mean lots and lots of storyline cuts and changes. He does it. A lot.Something that kind of irked me a bit was that instead of making Zukko the main antagonist, he really made the Commander the main antagonist. Also, he made the mistake of showing the fire lord. The beauty of the cartoon was that Zukko was Aang's antagonist, the Commander was Zukko's antagonist, and then later Zukko's sister becomes the main antagonist for both Zukko and Aang. The Fire Lord really isn't that big of any kind of antagonist until the third season. Revealing him so soon is way, way too much and unnecessary in the beginning. This was a bad error on his part in adapting the story.The final thing I'll say about what was bad about the movie was that he did way too much exposition, and not enough SHOWING what is going on. People usually come to see a movie to SEE stuff, not to be told stuff because they can't fit it in or something. I could have shown him tons of scenes to cut to add what he told us through narrative. Also, trying to match the opening scene of the cartoon with the element benders was cute, but kind of unnecessary, especially when he doesn't overlay it with Katara's voice.On to the positive. I thought Zukko and his Uncle did a good job together, I wish that Shyamalan would have focused on this more. The action and special effects were actually pretty sweet. I don't think I've seen anything to that extent before so I was very pleased with how that all pulled together (especially since this was the first time Shyamalan actually worked with this much special effects before). I thought the cinematography was beautiful. The directing I thought was close to perfect. Shyamalan's directing is always solid. The story I thought was quick and concise. I had mixed feelings as I kept going back to the cartoon, but at the same time for a 2 hour movie it did it's job in not dragging along.It felt as if the beginning was struggling and then somewhere in the middle it really got it's footing and took off. I found myself really starting to get into the film and the action. The final Northern Kingdom scenes were awesome. I thought that all was really powerful. Shyamalan flexed his emotional muscles here and really made you get into the whole mythology. The unfortunate side to all this is that it's at the end. That should really be happening in the middle of the story.On a personal side note, I feel like there are HIGH expectations for Shyamalan (as there should be) and with those expectations he did really let down people with this movie. For any novice first time director, I think people would give this movie a pass and say it was a decent movie. But because Shyamalan is directing it's considered a ""huge letdown"". I think that's somewhat a valid notion. Shyamalan to some extent is becoming a type of George Lucas who in the beginning had a creative spark that really did wonders. Somewhere along Lady in the Water he started to lose that spark. I think he thought he was invincible when it came to making movies and now is putting out crap as if nothing can be wrong with them. I think he needs a gut check, and needs to try to rekindle that old creativity. If he doesn't, then my guess is that he's probably going to be done as a director soon.Side note, I thought if Shyamalan would have ended the film with Aang bowing it would have been a GREAT way to end it out. Thats what I thought he was going to do. But then he goes to the Fire Lord talking to his daughter and making it like it was supposed to be this BIG deal. It's like. Who cares? That was a total buzz kill ending. Just bad intuition in the editing room there.Here's a bit of perspective for those who are big fanboys of the cartoon Avatar: The Last Airbender. My wife went to see it with me. She has never seen the cartoon and really doesn't get into this stuff. I was surprised to find that she LOVED the film. She said she thought it was a great. Those who haven't seen anything to do with the main cartoon might actually just take it for what it is and find it as a fun movie. Those of us who have watched the show are going to be more critical as he takes liberties with the story and characters. Maybe if we take a step back and try to see it for what it is we might not be as upset.",The Last Airbender
919,lantern1984,I liked it,10,2 August 2010,"Yes, that's right, I'm disagreeing with the other reviewers. I don't see why every one is panning it. I loved it. I loved the show since it first came out and the movie stayed as true as it could, considering they had to compress over twenty chapters (episodes) into about two hours. The only part that I found disappointing was that Appa and Momo didn't get much screen time, but I guess the film makers were saving their special effects budget for the actual bending. The three year time frame, instead of six months, was a nice touch, since it gives the actors time to grow while they make the rest of the trilogy. I also liked the new limit on fire bending, as it mostly evens the field between the Fire Nation army and the other benders, and it makes it that much more dramatic that some people, like Iroh, aren't hindered by it. It really makes him powerful, and ""The Dragon of the West"" was one of my favorite characters because he balanced power and wisdom.Speaking of dragons, I'm not sure what to make of the dragon in the spirit world. Was that supposed to be Roku's dragon, or the spirit manifestation of Roku himself? I guess that gives M. Night Shyamalan something to reveal in the sequels.",The Last Airbender
920,alyssavirus,Brace yourselves,1,1 July 2010,"Sure, the whole ""racebending"" thing is totally awful, but why don't we focus on something else.The movie was bad- REALLY bad. I'm pretty sure whoever wrote the movie had no higher than a fourth grade education and only saw the Boy in the Iceberg and the Siege of the North episodes. The dialogue was as bad as the actors, and the characters were boring and static (with the possible exception of Zuko). None of the important minor characters were there (among the missing: Bato, Bumi, Haru, Jeong Jeong, Jet, Teo, and Suki), and neither were any of the odd creatures that they come in contact with (no platypus bears or turtle ducks, and Momo looked ridiculous)- Appa looked okay, but was only treated as a vehicle; his only relationship with Aang was by way of transportation.I guess I can be nice and say that the effects were actually pretty good, and the Blue Spirit part was decent; however, that's not enough to make the movie bearable.If you're a fan of the show- like I am- be ready to be severely disheartened. And I don't mean that in the traditional sense of the word; I mean you'll be so fed up with the movie that you will actually want to rip your heart out of your chest.",The Last Airbender
921,headbangerx3,"Not Bad, but Still Disappointing",7,1 July 2010,"Im noticing a trend here. Everyone is so quick to judge The Last Airbender in an extremely negative connotation because of either it's issue with race, with M. Night's decision's and approach as a director and so forth. To start off, I have been a fan of Avatar: The last Airbender since the beginning of the series, so of course I went in with some serious expectations. As for myself, the movie comes off as 50:50. There are things that were perfect, and there were things that were questionable and eyebrow raising. Just to say, I saw the non 3D version because I am so sick and tired of Hollywoods newfound trend in 3d movies. Anyway, the effects for the most part were pretty amazing, I don't know why people say otherwise, everything from the designs of the settings, the fire, water, wind, effects were all very good. The only point where effects seem to be bad is somewhere in the beginning where it is obvious the Soka and Katara are in front of a back drop. Now when it comes to the performances, the ones that truly shine are by Dev Patel as Zuko and Iroh. Noah Ringer as Aang isn't to bad but there still seems to be a strong emptiness in his character that the fans aren't familiar with. The most upsetting thing about this movie is in fact the certain pronunciations that the characters make. From the very beginning the girl who plays Katara pronounces Avatar as Ah-vatar, and Sokka as So-kah. But the most painful one to endure was the fact they decide to call Aang, Ung. This alone is enough for any Avatar fans to feel betrayed and disappointed on every level. As the movie went on I started to accept the pronunciations, because of M.Nights need to make this world feel as real as possible. Another highlight of the movie are the fight scenes. When the use of bending comes into play in battle, everyone who is a fan will have that little tingle in the back of their neck that says Oh YEAH. One thing that may be a turn off is that in order for the benders to pull off any bending, they have to pull off a full on dance/fight combo before the send any element at their enemy. Though it may be pretty cool, there's times where it might test your fanboy patience.There is some pretty cheesy dialogue, and there are points where you wonder If a certain part of the movie might feel unfinished or not. But overall this movie is not as bad as everyone is out to make it. It's no masterpiece, but it does have some awesome effects, they do stay true to the story, and set pieces and environments are amazing. Yes as a fan there will be things that will disappoint you, but just remember the difficulty it has to take to translate a very huge animated series into a live action adventure; especially with a series as mystical and epic as Avatar, just keep that in mind.",The Last Airbender

The special effects were good and the story was enjoyable. My main objection is the having to wait on the next parts.I now am wishing I had the back story of this. In fact it has interested me in the cartoon that goes with it. I have a feeling that a lot of viewers expected everything to match the animation. I will say though that they did seem to shove a lot in to this first movie with the back story and the first element. But it seems to me to have been pretty smoothly done, which I think many people don't appreciate. People, Movies that are based off series or books are very unlikely to be as in-depth, with as much background, because face it, they're trying to fit this story into a limited time frame.

For one, they pronounce Aang's name ung (like hung without the h). Sokka's name? soaka (like soak with an a). Iro (eye-ro) is eero, and the list goes on. The plot from the TV series was taken, twisted around, and ripped to shreds. So many things happened in the movie that never happened in the TV show, and many things that did show from in the movie from the TV show were poorly depicted. The dialogue was super cheesy and out of place in many situations. What I'm trying to say is, if you watched the TV series and then watch this, you will be sadly disappointed in this movie. If you don't follow the series, this movie will appear quite corny and poorly put together. 1 out of 10 stars. Way to mess it up, Shayamalan.",The Last Airbender

In that context, the acting is fine. Yes, some of the monologues sound a little awkward, but he's not some inspirational leader, he's a kid trying to figure out how to be the Avatar.If you don't try to pick apart the individual performances and details, the movie holds up well.

First there is the white-washing, then there is the bad dialogue, and after that is the character development. In the show everyone except the villains are white instead of Asian. Then there is the fact that the dialogue sounds like amateurs were the ones who said it. Then there is the character development. The characters are flat and bland compared to the tv show. Sokka is completely devoid of humor and Aang does not have any innocence. This reminds me of the episode where the characters watch a bad play about themselves.

929,zeroneff,Nickelodeons Epic Fail,4,5 July 2010,"As much as I live Avatar The Last Air Bender series, this The Last Air Bender is too much to bare. The Last Air Bender is a perfect example of one person having too much control over a film. M. Night Shyamalan had the perfect story to work with, and all he had to do is adapt into a film scrip. Instead we see more concentration on the set than the story itself. We never get attached to any of the characters, the pace of the film was to fast. The wasn't any time for anything, moments that should have been inspirational wern't, moments that we to sympathize with the characters were just ""ok get over it"" moments. There was too much tung-twisting moments, and phrases that didn't make sense. Were was the proof reader. M. Night Shyamalan should have forgotten about the entire series, and just build The Last Airbender from the ground up. ( and if he did, he did a horrible job at it) The story wasn't the only failure of the film, some of the acting was just unbearable, I don't blame the actors for it, I think instead the focus of directing was on the boy from Texas that was playing the role of Aang. With that said, I did like how they (I don't know who to give credit to) brought world Avatar the last aibender to life. It was filled with accurate sets, creatures and costumes. I think thats the only good thing from it. Over I think it was an Epic fail and I blame Nickelodeon, and M.

I would whole heartedly recommend the show to anyone who is reading this review. Well, when I first heard that there was a live action movie being made it felt like the first day of school, excitement mixed with sheer terror. Then when I found out M. Night was directing it it went from excitement to I have to give a speech in my underwear with the audience behind a one way mirror. Of course he didn't let me down at all, there is being influenced by the source material and then there is this. He just picked and chose what to use, fire benders don't need a source of fire other than the sun (if he's allowed to murder the next movies what will he do about the eclipse). The bending in this movie is nauseating, take fire bending for instance, it's movements are based on Northern Shaolin Kung Fu. It is a very fluid art but the movements were blocky and awkward as with the water bending (Tai-chi). Overall I think this movie should be a catalyst to kill Shyamalan's career.",The Last Airbender

I wanted to pull my hair out when they pronounced Aang's name wrong again and again along with Iroh, ""Avatar"", and Sokka. This was frustrating and distracting from the absolute garbage I was attempting to concentrate on. The plot was scattered and didn't really tell you ANYTHING about the characters, their motives or emotions; and the acting was only on par--(I don't blame the actors because they had an awful script to work with so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.) M. Night really screwed up here and with over 20 episodes of material to work with he managed to butcher the entire first season/book of Avatar: the Last Airbender in a mere 103 minutes.

I am a huge fan of the series and had been awaiting this movie for months. I understood that this was to be a children's movie, but the series was for children as well and I loved that. What could go wrong? This movie was a cinematic abomination. The entire movie, which covers the first ""Book"" of the series is rushed together and jumps around in a totally nonsensical manner. There is absolutely NO time spent on characterization. None of the characters had any depth at all and may as well have been cardboard cutouts. Major plot points are summarized through narration or montage and the film would leave any person not familiar with the story absolutely dumbfounded. With all of my heart I discourage you from seeing this movie. Go see Karate Kid. Go see Killers. Go see (I cannot believe I am saying this) Eclipse.

934,zuegenable,is not as bad as they say,7,7 August 2010,"Imagination is a powerful tool that provides us to differentiate whats a bad and good movie. The Last Airbender is a good movie if you don't compare it to original animation. I felt this movie has more sense of reality and feelings on character. i can see Aang is sad in the movie to be an Avatar because he knew he had to take up a mighty responsibility with his age of an child/an age of playful/rebellious condition (just like in the animation). Animation from nickelodeon are virtue, because viewers mostly are children. Story are the same, plot the same. More like a serious, mature movie to me after all. Movie pace is fast, but you don't get lost by it. You'll be still inform by the movie storyline, only quicker(compare to virtue animation). The fighting scenes are incredible fun to watch. The uses of CGI are fantastically beautiful. The act of each character is quite bad, except Aang, he is perfectly fine as the serious Aang in the film.You'll realize whats Mr.Night movie is all about, The Last Airbender was his different genre of movie making career. Mr.Night just wanna expose himself to more genre of movies so he can capture the real picture of what the thoughts about his movies. Well, certainly he is a surprise man.Is not entirely a children's movie, its a matured movie and is fun to watch. 6.5/10 for this movie. Is not bad after all.",The Last Airbender
935,DenverGrey,A disaster in sheep's clothing...,1,2 July 2010,"As an adult, when I first went to watch the animated series I was skeptical. But after beginning to watch the season, I had to watch it all. The story flowed pretty seamlessly and the characters were well developed with inner conflict and reasons for their actions, not something you find readily in a ""children's"" cartoon. So when I saw that it was being developed into a film, I was actually excited. I wanted to see Appa and Momo in action, I wanted to see Sokka deliver corny lines for comic relief, I wanted to see the story in real life. But instead all I got was a poor excuse of what could have been a good movie.The first BIG problem I had (and I know this may sound silly, but if you watched the show, I'm sure you are with me) was that they pronounced the main character's name wrong. Instead of Aang(like hang without the H) they would say Aong (think Gong, but beginning with an A). It distracted me so much that I couldn't help to think if anyone in the movie had actually seen the show, or if they just had speech impediments or were dyslexic. Maybe it's not that big of a deal to some, but just think if in the Simpson's movie they said Bert and Humer the whole time. That's kinda how it felt. Next, the acting was on par with that of a 5th grade school play. And not even your own kids school play where you have to like it. It was dreadful and left me thinking that I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. No emotion, no inflection, just bland reading of lines coming together to make a sentence instead of feeling what it was that was being said. And lastly, the story and script. There was so much raw material to work with, you would think that something good could come out of it. But instead I felt dragged though the whole film from one scene that hadn't been setup or explained to another. Development of characters and plot were completely void and I couldn't find any reason to care about anyone in the entire movie. The children in the theater applauded when the movie ended and so did I, but for very different reasons. The children applauded because they know not what they had just seen. I applauded because I could finally get the hell out of the theater.",The Last Airbender
936,anderswsp,The Last Airbender deserved an good movie; but this movie just doesn't deliver.,2,21 August 2010,"Despite being 22, I'm an absolute fan of the cartoon, and I have watched every single episode. I was looking forward to this movie a lot. I entered the cinema full of hope and anticipation, but exited shell-shocked because of bad it was.The first thing I noticed was that Sokka and Katara couldn't possibly be related with their ""tribe"" because the entire tribe, (like you'd expect on the south pole) are Eskimos. Sokka and Katara are not. I was, however, willing to let this one mistake slip. If only that had been the only one.But I kept noticing how it's different from the cartoon over and over again, and it didn't stop. I wont go into details, in case you despite all this still feel like watching it, but it's so far from the original story it might as well have been an expensive, but incorrect recap of season one. I'm tempted to give it one, but it does have some nice effects, there's two things wrong with them though. There's not enough bending, in the cartoon all the benders bend their elements, and fight in hand to hand combat when they have to, but in the movie it's the opposite, and they seem to be reluctant to bend unless the script (and possibly a tight budget) allows them to. Secondly I noticed that, ignoring the awesomeness of a flowing, moving living sphere of water (or fire), that the bender doesn't look as if they're bending, instead, they look like they're simply preforming some memorized movement patterns, knowing, or hoping, that the effects (which I'm sure was expensive) that were to be added later by computer, would let the audience forget just how awesome it should have been.But, all being said and done, this could be a moderate movie, but only if you haven't seen the cartoon, or if you can miraculously make yourself forget all the things that made the cartoon so awesome.

937,sukruozan,Epic fail: The Last Airbender,4,26 July 2010,"The original story and the series is the one of the best TV shows I've ever seen. We actually watched it three times from beginning to end. As a the last airbender fan the only thing that I can deduce from the movie is that, Night Shyamalan one day woke up saw his children watching avatar and decided to make a movie out of it. And he listened the story from his children and never read the story or watched the animation.The film is like the remaining memories of an ordinary adult who sit and watch the whole avatar story at once. The acting is mediocre. Also the choice of races is so annoying. Fire nation is (I don't know why) Indian. Katara Sokka and grandmother are the only white people among an eskimo tribe etc.When you watch Aang, if you don't know the story you can easily be convinced that he is a character like Anakin Skywalker who will soon become Darth Vader. The actor (playing Aang) tries to be cute but it remains as a trial not actually happens.The only thing that I may like is the visualisation of the material bending scenes. Shyamalan is not a good choice this is obvious.",The Last Airbender
938,emaleesigur,The Last Airbender Movie hopefully ever,1,26 December 2011,"This movie was absolutely beautiful in 2-D. The color and special effects were all together astounding. That is the only good thing I have to say about this movie. Why paramount decided to allow such a successful television series be directed by M. Night Shyamalan is unknown. With his recent flops in the box office, it should have been a no brainer that a television series so critically acclaimed would be a disaster if directed by someone who has only had one, maybe two, successful movie(s) out of ten. It's not that the story line was too complicated. There have been many books made into movies that are perhaps even more complicated than Avatar: the Last Airbender. Lord of the Rings is probably the most acclaimed. Have you ever tried to read one of those books? The print is small and the book is thick yet Peter Jackson captured it beautifully enough to win over 15 Oscars at least for the entire trilogy. Though the storyline wasn't Oscar material, it was definitely enough to get great ratings if directed by a person such as Jackson. Shyamalan managed to capture some of the least important scenes in the Water series. The one important I do remember being in the movie was dragged out as audiences watch the Avatar create a massive wave to take down the fire nation. That could have easily been executed in one minute, instead, we sat there watching the wave SLOWLY rise and rise and rise until finally it was really really big and even then we had to wait for him to do his Thai chi or kung fu moves to push the water on top of them. As far as the action, it was barely interesting. They should have made the movie PG-13 so that at least the violence could captivate the audience. That's sad when the movie needs to be more violent to make it more interesting. As much as I think Thai chi and kung fu and other forms of martial arts are beautiful, it's not interesting watching them spend three minutes doing it just so they can get a small rock to hit someone in the face. If it really took that long, I would've just gone ahead and punched someone. At least it would've been done faster. The television show was not long that, every movement did something, not every ten movements does one thing. All together, this movie was a disaster and if there should be a sequel, it should be directed by someone else because I guarantee if the same guy is directing it, they really won't make very much in the box office again",The Last Airbender

With that, I went expecting some things to be great, and some to be really bad. With any adaptation, whether we're talking about TV series to film, book to film, or even musical covers, there will always be some that love and some that hate. This is a great example of that very thing. You can already see from the score I've given and the title, I've enjoyed this movie. There were plenty of unnecessary pieces thrown in without consideration to the series' order, the acting was not great or even good, and everything was just...well....rushed. However, the action scenes were fun, and by the end you are given everything that is needed to see just where things stand and a peak into where the adventure will go, which is exactly what I was expecting would actually be to my expectations. Nearly everyone at the theater applauded this movie, and plenty of them will be anxious for the next (if there will be). I have had far worse experiences at the theater compared to this from films that movie-goers/reviewers swore were masterpieces.

The characters were not developed, and the story line was more condensed than a readers digest version of a novel. But the worst part was the fact that they couldn't even pronounce the names right. They are not soft vowels. Plus they just glossed over the reason Zuko was banished and added scenes that were never in the series.

944,ComradeSpuff,It's like someone took a wikipedia article and used it as a script...,4,2 July 2010,"Before I say anything, I would like to throw in a couple of facts.Fact #1: I have not seen the animated series. I saw half of the first episode before I got distracted, this review is based on the movie alone.Fact #2: I saw this movie in 3D, to attempt to redeem my negative feelings towards it.Now for the review.I feel like The Last Airbender can be summarized by this. I felt like I was watching low budget actors who had a script that took a summarized wikipedia article and transferred it into a script.The acting in the movie was absolutely terrible. There was not a single person in that movie who I thought did a good job. Part of this was due to a terrible script. Everything was so formal, that it felt extremely unnatural and over-dramatic. It also didn't help that they took about an 8 hour season and condensed it into a 2 hour movie. The entire thing seemed rushed and it took my brain several min. to catch up on the story since they flew through things so quickly.Action? I was going into this hoping to see some awesome elemental battles and fights. As soon as a fight began I felt adrenaline start to pump. Within 10 seconds, that quickly died. The fight scenes reminded me of a Pokemon battle. Taking turns and waiting for the attack to finish. The pace of the fights were terribly slow, and short lived. Also, only like one guy was visibly killed. I feel like this had to do with the 3D aspect of the movie.The movie's 3D was decent. It didn't seem to be over-exaggerated, however there was a lot of flickering and occasionally things looked cut-out instead of natural. I also feel like since there were so many special effects that had to be given depth, this probably contributed to the slow fight scenes with little action.The way it was filmed was nothing spectacular, but no terrible complaints. There were a few angles that I thought were bad. But it seemed to be lit and filmed in typical Nickelodeon Studios style. It was bland.Overall, I feel like this movie was not worth going to see. Maybe a rent when it comes out on DVD. Honestly, I'd just wait til it was on instant queue on Netflix. The 3D isn't worth it once again, and the movie lacked any sort of depth. This seems to be the trend once again with 3D movies.",The Last Airbender

The acting makes me want to face-palm throughout. It's even worse than Showgirls. At least that one has amusing one-liners. This one just made you cringe throughout.

I have heard really bad reviews about it and that had been preventing me to watch it even on DVD. But since it was on the flight entertainment menu I just wanted to see how bad it was.And yes indeed, all the bad reviews were right anyway. As a big fan of the wonderful animated series, I really can't take this. Shyamalan got it all wrong, whether intentionally or not. From the horrible casting, changing the names pronunciation, plot butchering, fight choreography - everything is wrong. This movie is totally crap and should have never been made. He can't even bother to use the very endearing Avatar: Last Airbender cartoon soundtrack. And the kid who plays Aang is utterly horrible, I cringed every time seeing him on screen. I agree with the fans who suggested Brandon Soo-Hoo to be the perfect actor who can play Aang, but it's a good thing as well that he's not joining this disastrous film since apart from the horrendous cast it's already beyond help anyway, due to Shyamalan's directing.The beautifully crafted, wonderfully narrated animated series is a real gem, something that will be a timeless treasure. Give it a favor, watch it and rewatch it again and again. Don't bother watching this movie or even buy the DVD, it's destined to be forgotten.",The Last Airbender
947,itzbtodac,M. Night Shyamalan destroys another movie once again.,1,2 July 2010,"I don't even know where to start with this review. I never write reviews for any movie (no matter how good or how bad it was), but I am making an exception for The Last Airbender. M. Night Shyamalan utterly took Avatar: The Last Airbender and completely murdered it. From actor choice, to storyline, to directing, he failed at every aspect of this film. For starters, I was an avid fan of the animated series. Before watching Avatar, I hated watching American-made cartoons and American-dubbed cartoons. I find them terribly made and terribly translated. But when I watched Avatar, my perspective changed. This was one of the very few American-made cartoons I thoroughly enjoyed watching. The series captivated me with the storyline, plot, characters, and fighting scenes. The Last Airbender, however, took all the good things about the series, put it in a blender, and grounded it up to no recognition. To name all the bad parts of the film would take too long. I'll just start with the terrible mispronunciation of the characters names. Who the hell is Anhg?? Who the hell is Soka? It's Aang and Sokka. Get it right. Next would be the terrible acting. I cringed the entire movie at the horrendous acting job by all the actors/actress (especially Katara and Aang). Aang is suppose to be a happy, carefree kid who learns that learns to become serious when need be. He's not some retarded martial arts kid who just flies around kicking butt. My final complaint of the movie would be the pace of the film. Shyamalan rushed the entire first season for no apparent reason. Now, I'm no film expert, but from beginning to end, the entire film was rushed. There were rarely any character introductions for audiences that don't know the characters. Transitions from scene-to-scene were VERY amateur. The entire just kept jumping to different scenes and some scenes made me ask, ""Why did you even include that there?""Overall, I would rate this film a 0 if I could. I have never walked out of a movie so disappointed and angry. Shyamalan took a perfectly awesome series and turned it into complete garbage. Actually, calling it garbage would be an insult to garbage. I just don't know how he is going to direct the next two books because if he's directing them, I will definitely not waste my money again.",The Last Airbender
948,lilica-lune,:0,1,25 March 2011,"I was on a 14 hour plane trip and I couldn't finish watching it. I am a massive fan of the cartoons and it just could not have been any worse. From what I saw these are the things that annoyed me most:1. They pronounced the names wrong. It was a cartoon where they said the names out loud, not that hard to pronounce them right. 2. Sokka and Katara were white, Zuko was dark. I'm pretty sure it's the other way around. 3. A rock would have been funnier than Sokka. 4. They did some 30 second dance to lift one drop of water. In the cartoon Katara raised her arms and a waterfall cascaded. 5. The fire benders couldn't create fire, what is with that? I know in the series they're the only ones who can create their element so it kind of makes sense that they can't in the movie but it's just part of being a fire bender. 6. Could anyone actually see Zuko's scar?There are probably loads more things wrong with this film but like I said I didn't finish it. I cannot believe that someone actually paid to make this film, or that people would pay to see it. The only thing that sold tickets was the gleam of hope that it would resemble in some way the amazing cartoon from which it was born.",The Last Airbender

I only went to the movie to see it 3D and enjoy the effects. so... regardless of what the origins might have been here is what i think of the movie:IT SUCKS 1 - acting is poor... like a 3rd rate cheap school-class movie 2 - story is stupid... nothing makes sense in any way 3 - NO 3D. i have a pretty vivid imagination... so i thought bending stuff around was guaranteed to get me some stuff flying around the cinema... air debris, gusts of fire, streams of water passing by my chair. save for 5-10 seconds that was actually the logo of the company making something in the movie and the subtitles everything could be 2d",The Last Airbender
951,delia1940,I hope Shyamalan is not allowed to do movies EVER AGAIN,1,18 July 2010,"Boy this movie sucked! Yes, is bad. It is sooo bad that I hope that M. Night Shyamalan is not allowed to even enter theaters or write the word movie EVER. He has to be the worst director that has ever and will ever exist. It is actually a simple story that got butchered so bad that made NO SENSE what-so-ever. It you want to watch something more interesting watch a dog take a crap. It will have better 3D and at least it will have an ending that you will understand. I took kids with me to see the movie and I had to do something special after the movie to cheer them up because they were so bummed after watching the movie, I could not think of just leaving it like that. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! It is not worth watching ANYWHERE. Even for free, I would even say that even if someone pays you to watch it DO NOT GO SEE IT. Yes, it sucks that bad. I am not a fan of the series and only watch parts of some episodes so I did not care about the flow (and plethora of inaccuracies) for me it did not make sense. The kids I took first they were peeved and then they were so sad it was really bad. I would have to say I will make it a rule NOT to see anything that M. Night Shyamalan touches. I think even if he visits a set for 2 minutes to say hi to someone, avoid that movie, he sucks so bad he can ruin a movie by him just been there.",The Last Airbender
952,gours,Wth?,2,27 November 2010,"I'm going to try to watch this again, because I'm not really sure, - but I think, this is the worst movie I remember seeing.Ten lines - are you serious? I have to write ten lines? What can be said. It's like Kung Fu movie with no action. The actor moves (sometimes, with a fierceness) and air moves in response! Yep, the air! The person they are fighting is 100 feet away - moving dirt. or whatever. You have to watch it to understand it - but please believe, you will be annoyed like heck.And since that was apparently not ten lines. I'll continue, but really the first two lines were enough. The acting was atrocious. No really. I'm so confused - I don't even want to think about it. And whose idea was it require 10 lines anyway. How does that make sense? Who needs ten lines for every movie",The Last Airbender
953,SITDxBASS,M. Night Disappoints again...,3,1 July 2010,"I, like many of you, was eager to see this. I went to the midnight showing of it where I live last night and was thoroughly disappointed by it. The way some of the dialogue was shot was absolutely abysmal... Sokka - What are you talking about? -cut to Aang- Aang - I have to go here. -cuts back to Sokka- Sokka - Alright, let's go.Not only does all the dialogue feel rushed, the whole movie is rushed too. Where it took Aang, Sokka and Katara about probably a quarter to half a year to get to the North Pole, it seemed like they got there in 5 days.Sure they had some things that were interesting, like how Iroh and Zuko test Aang at the beginning to see if he is the Avatar, and every time Aang tries to waterbend he almost causes tidal waves because of all of his emotional surges.He did however leave out many people who were instrumental to shaping Aang in the first season, such as Suki and the rest of the Kyoshi warriors, ""Mad King"" Bumi, and the much hated Jet and the rest of his not-so-hated followers.Where as the cartoon had it's whole charming attitude, M. Night Shyamalan just took bits and pieces from the first season and just smashed everything together just so he could fit in to just over an hour and a half. It seemed as if he would have let the final cut of it be closer to two hours or even two and a half, he would of had a lot better of a film on his hand.From one fan to all of the fans of the show, I have to say don't bother paying the theater prices to go see this unless you have a discount theater in your area, or just wait to Red Box it. For such good source material from the show, M. Night Shyamalan basically glanced over it and took a big dump on it and this movie will leave you feeling like he took a big dump on you as well.",The Last Airbender
954,wolfwindshadow,Excellent movie,8,1 July 2010,"I went to see this fine movie tonight, having spent all my spare time in the last several days watching all 3 seasons of the cartoon series. The movie may be a bit rushed but stays true to the cartoon series, this makes for a better movie in my humble opinion, as many people will recognize the places and people in the story, rather then having to re-learn the who's who in the story. As I said, the movie is a bit rushed, but then look what it took to tell the tail of Lord Of The Rings, 3 movies that together have you in a seat for nearly 12 hours, This movie would fast become the same if we where to develop each character as they are in the cartoon. I would say that seeing this film is well worth the price of a ticket, and that I will likely see it twice.",The Last Airbender

Granted we did not have 22 episodes but please, a serious Aang, not so funny Sokka or whatever he wanted to call them. I was really looking forward to the fight scenes but these were all off and required extra moves necessary. I did not feel there was enough time to get to know the characters and for the characters to develop a relationship amongst themselves.

However, I was left disappointed. It was the small things that irked me. The pronunciation of the characters names was different for no reason. Fire benders can no longer create their own fire unless they have the help of Souzin's Comet, which by the way is now 3 years away (the entirety of the TV show lasted less than a year). I don't understand why these changes were made. Also, important parts of the story were left out which could cause problems down the line. And finally, while the acting wasn't great (Noah Ringer was particularly bad however that is expected seeing as it is his first movie) it was the dialog that ruined this. The dialog seemed forced and stale. With over 7 hours of source material to work from I would have expected more.",The Last Airbender

But the outcome really amazed me, what I saw was a really touchy film.

958,morgulbipking,M Night embraces diversity to make an awesome movie!,8,1 July 2010,"I went to the midnight showing and was excited and pleased with what I had viewed!M Night pleased me with the casting, and it needs to be said that he is not racist. M Night left the casting open for any race. Take for instance Iroh and Ozai...Cliff Curtis is Maori...(Ozai) Shaun Toub is Iranian...(Iroh)Iroh and Ozai are brothers, so I was very impressed that M Night didn't cast them as the same race. The same goes with the Caucasian acting leads in the Southern Water Tribe. Hello!! That shouts diversity! M Night chose the actors he thought would represent the characters the best. I think he did an excellent job with Katara, Aang, and Sokka. Also, in the other nations portrayed, there was clearly diversity as to which races made up which nations. They were all very mixedsoI am pretty sure that makes M Night not racistMany people and critics have complained about the underrepresentation of the ""Asianness"" to the film. I think M Night did an excellent job capturing that spirit of Asian culture when he changed some of the pronunciation of names. The cartoon series itself Americanized the show when they pronounced the names different than they would in Asian culture. M Night was simply reversing the change to traditionally represent the makers of the cartoon. What's so bad about that?Other strong points -The bending was absolutely beautiful. I was completely captivated any time bending was happening -The music and score absolutely made me feel a part of the film -The sets were absolutely gorgeous and I noted several times how closely they resembled the cartoon -M Night threw in a few little things to make the cartoon lovers happy! (For examplewhen Zuko arrives at the Southern Water Tribe, his men dash fire in a long lash over the heads of the villagersit was in the background, but M Night was sure to include it!) -Appa was wonderful and looked just perfect! -M Night did an excellent job condensing the first book down into a simple story that an outside audience could understand (There is simply no way to add every little detail and adventure from a 20 episode series into one movie)Weak points -The dialogue was a little weak and seemed a bit childishHowever, this is a children's film and it was made for children to understand! -The movie was shorter than I expected and a few extra minutes to develop characters would be welcome (maybe some of the deleted scenes will help capture this?) -Sokka was a bit too seriousbut who knowsmaybe M Night has plans for him in the other films! I am very pleased with this film and am excited to see it again!",The Last Airbender

960,brobs1217,I have never been so close to walking out of a movie before,1,4 July 2010,"When I was deciding if I should see this movie I looked at these reviews and saw all the bad press it was getting. I didn't believe it because I absolutely loved the cartoons and couldn't understand how Shyamalan could screw up such an amazing story. So I ignored what everyone else had to say and I went to go see it.....Boy was that a mistake....I was clinching my fists the whole movie because of how bad it was. First of all, Shyamalan pretty much butchered the first book by taking a shortcut through every scene. When the movie starts, Katara and Sokka find Aang within 5 minutes, they don't say a word to him when taking him back to their village... Katara asks if he is okay when he wakes up...and then the fire nation comes and takes him away. Almost no dialogue and no interaction between Katara and Aang (Sokka doesn't even talk to him). Yet Katara and Sokka feel a tremendous need to save him (even before knowing he's the Avatar). Terrible character development by Shyamalan. They then are able to make it to the southern air temple within 15 minutes of the movie starting, might I add.Shyamalan avoided fight scenes like the plague; and when there were fight scenes, they were ugly looking and awkwardly constructed. Aang would do little dance routines when doing basic air bending which just looked foolish.A scene that really bugged me was when they traveled to an earth nation village that was under siege by the fire nation. Not only did this scene not makes sense, but you wonder how much Shyamalan really cared about the accuracy of the story. He had it so the camp where they capture earth benders are IN THE MIDDLE OF A MOUNTAINOUS AREA. There are about 10 firebender guards and 50 earthbenders and they're standing on earth. It's like the movie was trying to say... ""This gives you a basic understanding of what the cartoon is about."" A cliffnotes version of it, if you will.The acting was just horrendous... that's all I have to say. I saw a preview of the movie on HBO with Shyamalan talking about how he casted people. He said that he found the actor for Aang on Youtube. Now, I'm not sure if this kid had acting experience or not but it sure does look like Shyamalan took him from Youtube.The icing on the cake for it all was the fact that they pronounced ""Aang"" as ""Ong"", ""General Iroh"" as ""General Eeroh"", and ""Agni Kai"" as an ""Agni Kee."" I couldn't tell you how many times I bit my tongue at the sound of ""Ong."" Please don't go see this movie if you are expecting it to do justice to the cartoon. I am one who normally says ""I paid for this movie so I'm going to get my money's worth."" But I regret not walking out.",The Last Airbender

962,rockinkat,An epic failure even an 8 year old can smell. No respect for the original.,2,1 September 2010,"This movie was done without any respect for the original show. Bad casting, bad writing, and too compressed. They also couldn't even get names pronounced right. This is based off of a very popular cartoon series, pronunciations in the cartoon should set precedent! There was no humor and very little adventure, both of which were what made the original cartoon series so endearing to it's audience.If you are looking for some good entertainment, you should rent the cartoon series on DVD or instant streaming. This movie couldn't even keep the 8 year old in the row behind me complacent with the bad conversion(I kept hearing ""that's not his name!"" ""that's not what happened!"" in the background), the original cartoon series was able to keep my dad captivated for all three seasons. My dad usually won't watch things which aren't live-action.I wish I went on Tuesday; the discount theater I went to would have charged me $1 for my ticket instead of the normal $2. I want my $2 back! If I'd gone to the normal theater and paid $10 I'd feel so cheated right now. Even more so if I'd gone to the more expensive 3D showing.",The Last Airbender

Joss Whedon should have directed the movie. It is a lighthearted fun comical series, with a story that's engaging. M. Night Shyamalan is a dark and disturbing director.

964,eskimo5,I felt it had the potential...,4,19 August 2010,"I had seen the trailers for The Last Airbender and was pretty intrigued, being somewhat of an anime fanatic (I know TLA is a cartoon) I've seen adverts for it or seen it mentioned. I had never watched the cartoon so was maybe looking to the film to pique my interest.My friend who is into the cartoons dragged to me see it, I wanted to see it personally though having read bad things about it, but I generally don't let critics stop me from seeing a film.There are two points I have FOR TLA: I thought the effects were pretty good BUT I did see it in 2D. I'm not sure whether in 3D/IMAX it was terrible I think I saw somewhere that in 3D the effects were bad. I thought it had a decent plot, however from what my friend told me they tried to cram a whole season into a measly 100 minute film (I was expecting two hours, maybe two and a half), I didn't have a remote idea of the story line of TLA and even i felt it was rushed. Acting Wise:I though Dev Patel was pretty good, the adults were generally good too.Bad points: Again, the rushed plot...honestly everything happened so bloody fast. The acting was probably the worst thing ever, I heard when casting they were looking for people who had martial art skills, sure it's a franchise where it's big on marital arts but there should have been a trade-off - so the martial arts aren't great but maybe we'd get better acting... The acting by the guys who played Aang and Katara felt...I dunno a little off...but I'm not an actor so I don't like making too many comments. But because they had the most screen time I think that's why many felt the acting was bad. I was a little disappointed in Jackson Rathbone (or whoever the guy from twilight was) I thought that maybe he would be good but I didn't think he did well...My friend walked out afterwards saying she thought it was good ??? Who knows...I DO think that with some script re-working (again he has a great idea/plot to work with) some recasting (or maybe train the actors better?) it could be a brilliant movie.",The Last Airbender
965,jkyleshepherd,The Last Airbummer...,2,2 July 2010,"When I heard that they were making a movie adaptation of this film I was afraid that they were not going to be able to capture the levity that makes the series so attractive. The series covers some very heavy subjects, but interjects some lighthearted humor, even if it is childish. The mix of heavy subject and lighthearted humor is the bread and butter of the cartoon and what captured my imagination even as an adult.This movie I would equate to those like Transformers (both the original and the sequel) where the special effects were spectacular and the scenes were full of action and excitement. Yet the storyline of the movies does little more than put the characters in the same place at time. The Avatar animated series is rich with plot and its characters are deep and complex. Like any story that is told in a series format it has the luxury of being able to spend the needed time to develop the character in depth and tell the story with all its complexity. After seeing this movie I and needless to say more than disappointed. With a movie like Transformers I had very little story line to compare the movie to. The Last Airbender is a whole other story because as noted the animated series was a very complex story that guided the viewers through all the events and emotions its characters experienced through their journeys. The Last Airbender movie misses the mark on so many levels that it is astounding.In my mind it appears that Nickelodeon gave up most if not all creative control of this film. Where some (while some may still argue) Peter Jackson got the point with The Lord of the Rings trilogy in that they were to long for some, but just right for those who expected as close of a book adaptation as they could get. Lets get real 2 ½ plus hour movies just turn some people off, but for the die-hards, we will sit there as long as it takes to do it right. I think you can see that same theory in action by the writers, directors, and promoters decision to divide the final book in the Harry Potter series in to two movies. It too is a long and complex story that just cannot be directly adapted to a 2 hour movie frame as still hold its integrity. This in my mind is what happened to the Last Airbender. Think about it The animated series told one book in 20, ½ hour episodes. That's 10 hours of content in an 1 hour and 43 minutes. When you go back and watch, every episode tells a piece of the story that will be built on later or add depth to a character or their actions somewhere else in the story.So how would you do this??? Not the way it was done anyway I can't sit here a say that 6 movies or 3, 3 ½ hour movies would do it either, but what was done almost looks like they may not have the intention of doing three more movies They knew that they could not pull it together in one movie so they just crammed in as much special effects as they could, promoted the hell out of it, and then made the last minute 3-D conversion to give them the extra bang for their buck (up to 11.75 a ticket or more). Then they would take that money a run as the movie fizzles out into oblivion I would be hard pressed to think that anyone short of the special effects creators would be satisfied with the finished product that was presented in theaters. At this point it is very unlikely that I would see a sequel, if there ever is one. I will just have to get the box set and watch 'em in three ten hour marathons. I would still enjoy that more than what I saw in the theater even with a numb butt, dry bloodshot eyes, and being miserable from the 10 pounds of candy and chips I would certainly consume. Oh, and I won't have to pay 5 more bucks for 15 nacho chips and a tiny cup of tasteless nacho cheese. Oh well I guess I will head to the store and pick up "" 'Avatar' : The Last Airbender"" on DVD so I can get started",The Last Airbender

After waiting the previews of the movie with my and him becoming excited about seeing it, I decided I wanted to see it too.I was HIGHLY disappointed in the fact that you have to pay an additional $3.00 for 3D glasses, which all children will want, yet that is about 5% 3D effects! There were some good action scenes that would have seemed better if they were in 3D...so you feel like you really got ripped off! I will point out that my son does know what to expect when it comes to these series of cartoons and he quickly was horrified with the mispronounciation of the names of the characters. Also, he definitely noticed that a lot of the important details were left out and he had to fill me in on what SHOULD'VE been there! Personally, I was disappointed in the ending being that you are forced to be left hanging as there was no definite ending.

968,deunan109,A mockery of a destined to be a classic TV series,2,5 July 2010,"First, I agree with another reviewer, this is the last time I ever pay to watch an M. Night Shyamalan movie. To watch and make any sense out of this film you would have had to watch the entire first season of the TV series. Why? The movie lacked character development beyond the actress playing Katara narrating the film, possible as a last resort after the cutting room put this mash together in some desperate effort to save the plot. The biggest problem with this film overall is its length, an hour and forty-five minutes is just not enough time to pack in over 15-hours worth of story line as is clearly seen in the film's haphazard way of jerking the view from one location after another with each new location scrolling across the picture. Aang doesn't even know about the war until the Southern Air Temple and doesn't reveal that he is the Avatar until the Earth Bender prison camp. The tension of the series is also absent; the entire wrenching, building tension of the TV Series' chase and battles between the main protagonists and the main antagonists comes down to one line delivered by Soku during a rest/training stop-over in the film as, roughly, ""I think we are being followed!"" Zoku only encounters Aang 4 times in the film (once as the Blue Spirit), never meets Soka and meets Katara only at the end during their duel in the moon pool cave with Zuku's ""Who are you?"" as an opening line before they fight. I have no idea how the next two films are going to work sense key characters (i.e. the Kyoshi Warriors, Avatar Roku, King Bumi, etc.) and events (i.e Avatar Roku informing Aang about the comet and the gangs encounter with the pirates) are absent from this film. Save your money, re-watch the TV series, I know I have to just to get the bad taste out of my mouth.",The Last Airbender
969,heynickiheynicki-asthma,Chill Out...,4,2 July 2010,"So everyone has been writing about how bad this movie is and, honestly, I think they're all wrong. I was a huge fan of the TV show on Nick and after reading all the horrible reviews it got, I had a horrible sense of dread going in to the theater. But as the movie got going I realized that everyone that slammed the movie was wrong. Sure, The Last Airbender isn't in line to win any Oscars this year but it's not a bad movie. Everyone is talking about how bad the acting is but I didn't think it was too bad. Go back and watch the first Harry Potter film because the acting was right on par with that...and that's coming from a huge Harry Potter fan. The story did jump around a bit and the movie was too short but remember, this movie was made for kids...you try keeping a kids attention for more than two hours. Honestly as a fan of the show the worst part of the movie was the mispronouncing of the names of some of the characters and the 3D. I just didn't see any point in changing the names and the 3D only distracted from the film. So all of these wannabe critics need to stop trashing the movie. They shouldn't have went in to a movie based on a children's cartoon expecting The Godfather. Just saying.",The Last Airbender
970,laserboy1134-1,Worst Movie 2010?,1,2 July 2010,"I enjoyed the Last Airbender Cartoon. It was well written and well made, especially for a Nickelodeon show. But this movie is an over-complicated telling of the animated series that skims over important details and reduces characters to the most forced lines of weak and laughable dialog I have ever heard. The (attempt at) a plot focuses around 4 kingdoms at constant war, with each kingdom being able to harness a particular element. The Fire Kingdom seems to be targeting the Water and Earth Kingdoms, and has already destroyed The Air Kingdom. Those in a kingdom who control elements are ""Benders"", and the main character, Aang, is an Airbender who was frozen for 100 years, unknowing of the extinction of his kingdom. Aang is also The Avatar, who can master every element. In the cartoon, this plot worked, but imagine an attempt at forcing this in under 2 hours. The acting here is the worst I've seen, the actors feel almost removed from this movie, which is understandable with how it ended out. There is one good thing about The Last Airbender, and that is special effects. The elemental bending effects look great, particularly the fire bending, but, the fight scenes focus too much on hand to hand karate, and are extremely poorly choreographed, making what would be a cool attack look like a group dance. The kids didn't enjoy this movie, at the showing I saw, nor did the parents, and nor did I. This movie is a mess, and should be an example on what film-makers shouldn't do while making a film.2/10 F",The Last Airbender
971,dooberheim,Not a bad movie if you haven't seen the TV series,6,25 January 2012,"I rented this movie because I thought it was something different than what it was, and I had never heard of the Nickelodeon series. I also didn't know the target audience (younger teens and younger). But, just in itself, I didn't think it was a bad movie considering. Probably my never having seen the series helped my impression of the movie.I found the landscapes and sets to be quite beautiful, and the entire premise of their world is an interesting one. There's a lot of nice visual art in the movements of the benders, and the CGI was well done. Character development and plot are appropriate for a movie aimed at young viewers. I wouldn't expect deep character development or a complicated plot - just fairly well defined good and evil, some adolescent love interest, and a lot of action. This movie delivers that in an easy to watch and pretty package.It's something I'll watch again, probably, when I just want to watch a fairly simple feel-good movie. If you've never seen the series, you might find this to be a nice little movie to watch with your family.",The Last Airbender
972,crashmaker,Appeal to certain viewers,10,20 December 2017,"I guess we have to view this movie at a new perspective.
Imagine a world of avatar, that has never got to seen the classic avatar, the last airbender series. Just for a moment, of course, imagine that there would be a country on earth with high influence on movie development because they could be a country with very high amounts of cinema consumers. I won't name any maybe existing countries that would hit that description.To ""appeal the viewers"" in that country, and to make a release at least possible and not censored, you remove any characteristics that could be mistaken for any existing things that could upset the comm.. eeeh the possibly existing country.What do you get? Well, 100% the opposite of what avatar is.This movie was ruined because of real life politics and facts that got the producers to create a film that was allowed to be shown in the soon-biggest cinema revenue countries in the world.If you ever wonder how many movies do not show any kind of western supremacy but rather showing them evil and any maybe existing country that will not be named as a good or neutral one, then you probably now know why that is so.enjoy the series but keep away from this movie that took a big toll on ""political correctness"" - the kind in the wrong direction.",The Last Airbender
973,vallgeran7,Its103 mins long and has to cover >440,7,17 September 2010,"*Not this review is late due to the fact all the e-tears made me wait till it was out at the discount theater, only to realize this like Napoleon Dynamite is yet another victim of hype, Napoleon Dynamite still holds my number one for worst movie ever, this movie is at the least worth seeing once.* First off this series is not anime, its made by Nickelodeon, anime is from japan this is an American cartoon, huge difference to any one who's seen something other then Naruto. Second off even if your weird enough to go about calling this an anime I honestly can not name a single movie based off anime that had half this movies advertisement or landed a good review on the English version.You need to realize fist off this is a Nickelodeon movie that pretend to be Asian in origin, and realize that a movie based on a series just like a book is always gonna skip and change things. Also to fight the mostly white cast complaint, I hate to point this out, but traditionally the good old US casts white actors or at the least mixed whenever possible for main character positions, if you want a sample just look up Charlton Heston and take a peak at some of his odd roles. Most films with out white mains that are major tend to have a foreign company involved, this includes Jackie Chan movies, believe it or not he has his own special martial arts stunt school company he uses in most his movies, plus him and Jet Li do films with Chinese company s.Now that I got the basic this is not gonna be the book/series disclaimer and the lovely reminder that American films love white mains, or at the least a famous non white to compensate, you might actually see where I am going with this. This movie flowed pretty decent, I do admit I only saw maybe 5 episodes and they were all around when they got Toph or what have you so I only had the basic story knowledge to begin with. There wasn't any horrible scene changes or anything else, seems like they skipped some stuff (already explained that the season was 4.5ish times longer) in the name of staying on story.It kept my attention pretty well, amused me at times and I even got past the white characters who weren't white in the the show. The cast did bother me when I first saw previews for the movie but I sucked it up, at least they weren't pretending to be anything else (*cough* Prince of Persia *cough*). I did expect more out of the brother with the boomerang in the comedy departmental but again side stuff is fun, but wastes time if not tied to the already shrunken down story.The CG was very good, not sure how anyone who's seen a movie at least once can't at least suck up the its not like the book/series blues and notice the cg was beautiful. I loved the ships and the Northern city in the movie. The martial arts was performed well, adding it to the cg made the battles seem pretty damn decent, maybe not Gladiator epic, but still not something to scoff at.In the end I personally would have to call it the Buddhist version of Narnia, and as long as you use your head and realize if you cough up the dough for the movie, that yet again its about 4.5 times shorter then the first season. So think of it like a movie that covers 2 books. It still has the basic storyline plus really good cg/martial arts, and the normal faults of any book/series gone movie. Get past that and avoid wasting cash, and wearing an E-dunce hat when you see it and hate it for all the reasons people cried about Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, etc. Learn from the past people, ignorance is not bliss.",The Last Airbender
974,pavan_pat,Horrible Movie,1,26 June 2012,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I am a huge fan of the animated series. This movie rarely got anything right. I have never walked out of a movie before but left this one 25 minutes after the movie started, and I tried to give it a second chance but it was painful to watch the second time around. First off the movie can't get the main characters name said correctly. It's an American based television show where the main characters name is Aang, pronounced with a sharp A not a soft one. Honestly how on earth do you mess up a name. The personal characteristics of each person was poorly portrayed in my opinion. At the beginning of the movie when Aang visits the earth benders he tries to instill courage in them to go against the fire benders, which is wrong because Aang has more of a carefree spirit towards the beginning of his series and becomes more serious through his encounters. In fact it was actually Katara that instilled courage in the earth benders in the series to revolt against the fire benders. Forget the fact that they weren't even held in a metal prison. Second they left off the island of Kyoshi, which leaves an important person later in the series. and my last and biggest problem was the final part of the movie where he was suppose to combine with the sea or water spirit for the final attack. that was a great disappointment because it was soooo plain. I have never rated a movie before a 5 before ever...... and I have seen a lot of movies. I felt like this was a punch to the face to a great show. YOu can make a movie that i 1 hour and 30 minutes long out of a series that in its first season this movie was based out off of had 20 episodes. This is the worst possible movie I have ever seen as a fan of the original thing and I would recommend to not watch it.",The Last Airbender
975,shiningstar2006,This movie is a shell of the cartoon...,3,2 July 2010,"The thing that was great about the cartoon was that despite having a very strong, serious central plot line, the show was still very lighthearted. I think that this was one of the things that made Avatar such a favorite among people of many ages. I was terribly disappointed to see that almost all the humor, if not all of it, was missing from the movie. It was as if they took the cartoon, ripped out it's heart and soul, and threw us the carcass to watch on the big screen. If I didn't know the cartoon like the back of my hand, I would've had no idea what was going on. The story jumped from plot line to plot line so fast you would forget what the characters were doing. They definitely tried to fit too many ideas into one movie, because some things felt like they never even got fully explained. I hate to write this bad review about a movie I had been SO excited to see. I loved the TV show, and even if this movie had just been OKAY I'm positive I would be raving about it. But it wasn't. The greatest part of the show, the part that made it seem like Aang, Katara, and Sokka could stay true to their personalities while saving the world, was gone. They were all so serious, too serious to even be considered the same characters in my eyes. Don't get me wrong, I think the actors did their very best, I'm sure of it, but I don't think that they really understood what the characters were like in the cartoon. In the cartoon, even though Aang, Katara, and Sokka had to save the world, they still were children at heart. The movie forgot that.If you're a huge fan of the cartoon, this movie will probably be disappointing. It doesn't have the same feel as the show, and it ends up feeling like a parody of something that could've been great.",The Last Airbender

Night Shyamalan was doing this movie,and after going to the movie today and finding out it will be a series, I was worried. I took my son to it today and I was VERY disappointed with it. How can a director have a 20 episode script written for them and still screw up the movie? Name changes, missing character introductions, poor acting and changing of key events helped cause this movie to be terrible. On a positive note, the special effects were good and that has saved this movie from getting a lower rating. I am a huge fan of the T.V. show and can only hope that if this project moves forward for the other two books, that they will either cause the director to be loyal to the series or find a new director ( which I hope for) because this one sucked!!! Sad thing is that an 8 year old feels the same way so not even the kids are happy with the adaption! Pretty sad huh?",The Last Airbender

OK, i missed some humor but i didn't mind, it is some darker, like i expected from a movie. I really like the music too!

I consider myself something of a fan of bad movies, and this is by far the worst piece of cinematography I have ever seen. I cannot emphasize it enough: this is a truly, honestly horrible movie.

979,ctulhu_eternal,All in all I can't see why people hate this movie so much,8,16 July 2010,"First,let me say that I've seen the cartoons as well so yes I do like the movie even though its not the most perfect adaptation. I do however still think this is more then a decent movie,and as I've seen only reviews that slander the movie and seem to only point out its bad sides but none of the good ones.I thought I'd make a review to show the good sides as well which are there I assure you,all you need to do is shove aside the veil of blinding hate and quit comparing it so much to the cartoons.Even though its not that great an adaptation,it does have its charms.I personally took a liking to some of the characters and I didn't find the actors performances to be so god-awful as everyone seems to say this movie had no characters and that the acting was stiff and lifeless...were we watching the same movie?To me some of the performances like Shaun Toub and Dave Patel were all they could be under the circumstances. They really convinced me,Shaun Toub as Iroh really made me see how he cares for his nephew(Zuko) and tries to guide him throughout the movie to a better destiny then the one his father(Firelord Ozai) has offered him,very good performance in my opinion.I also bought into Dave Patel's(prince Zuko) performance as the banished prince who lost his honor in the eyes of his people,who wishes nothing more then to regain his father's love and the respect of his people and retake his rightful place as heir to the fire nation's throne.To be perfectly honest these two did deliver the best acting in my opinion but Noah Ringer was also very adequate for this role and the rest of the cast weren't so god-awful as everyone wants you to believe. I unlike my fellow reviewers did not find anything confusing in this movie,did not find any bit of it boring or ridiculous,it has all the action and all the talk it needs,all you need is open eyes and ears and perhaps an open heart...I give this movie an 8/10 because I did enjoy it and I'm sure there are others out there like me.If you haven't seen the cartoon then you should see it first,just to see the difference,but don't dis the movie,give it a chance for what it is...a beautiful fantasy movie that revolves around spirituality and human emotions dating back to our very beginnings.",The Last Airbender
980,maesterchronos,M Night Shyamalan is a terrible moviebender...,1,3 July 2010,"I should preface this review with this; I am a huge fan of the TV series, and until now a decent fan of Shyamalan. While I am still a fan of the series, I am unsure if I will ever be able to see a movie by this director again.I would love to tell you what I liked about the movie, but the list is so short that I can sum it up by saying ""Sokka"", but even that is hard to say with confidence. As the movie progressed his writing and acting plummeted steadily.When the movie began I was excited, sitting in my seat in costume with a friend, also costumed. Seeing the first few minutes I was pleased. The characters looked decent so far and the acting, while little to go on, was not great, but acceptable. My first odd look was given when Katara addressed Sokka, or should I say SO-KAH. His name was pronounced incorrectly! And not only his, but about every character other than Katara and Zuko. Even ""Avatar"" was pronounced as ""AH-vatar"", and that wasn't even consistent. This is understandable if it was a book adaption, but did he see the series at all?!Alright... I can look past that, let's keep going. So he is out of the ice and Zuko sees him from far away. he exclaims ""Uncle, look"" which was said in a voice identical to the TV show. It was amazing, but it was possibly the only line from the movie I enjoyed, and not even because it was well written. How sad.So the first dozen episodes are summed up in the first 20 minutes and more complaints come. For example Iroh (or EE-ROW) looks terrible, and nobody in the fire nation sports the top-knot. Those are small complaints but I quickly realized...Boomerang beats bending? All bending in this movie takes an eternity to begin. A character is often dancing for a solid thirty seconds before anything moves. Not to mention fire bending is impossible almost without a fire source. Why didn't the air nomads just put out their lamps and stomp them when they attacked? There were a few scenes when Aang and Katara danced around for a straight minute and nothing was bended. In the time it takes to perform an air or fire blast you could stab said bender in the gut and be on your way...I suppose the acting deserves a word. Other than a few moments that were, to say the best, not terrible (usually no more than a few words), the movie was filled with actors that recited their lines as if they'd learned them a few days ago and as of yet are still just getting used to saying them. Katara for instance was more like Ember Island's Play Katara than the actual series's Katara. If you have seen the series you will appreciate just how sad that is.I still wonder who this was intended for... Was it for fans? Because if so the story was so diluted and jerky that I can't imagine anyone like myself ever enjoying it, even if the acting wasn't as atrocious as it was. Maybe it was not meant for the fan (doubtful). In that case it was jumpy and difficult to follow. Some lines were so badly written that the best acting would have had no hope of saving them. This movie was less than two hours long, while I am grateful I had to sit though no more, it wouldn't have killed Shyamalan to put a LITTLE of character development in the movie. The closest we got through the whole movie to anything of the sort was a child of no importance retelling Zuko's past. And even that was more back-story than development. All in all I would rate this move an ""F+"". Be grateful for that ""+"" M Night. It is only there because of a select few moments, usually involving Zuko or Sokka. Some of which were in the trailers... but... not the movie?! Wait... I am going to have to make that a straight ""F""... Sorry pal.If ever you loved the TV series, or even if you have never seen it. Do not watch this movie. To those of you who have already watched it, M Night Shyamalan owes you an apology, and I for one shall be waiting for it.",The Last Airbender
981,ImTheBlizzard,Better Than Most People Give It Credit For!,8,30 August 2010,"I can only say that I've watched the show within the last month (all three episodes and the extra stuff) AFTER I watched the movie. There are things that could have definitely been better, but for the most part, I actually liked the movie.About the movie, my opinions: Yes, Sokka could have been pronounced right. Aang, too. And Sokka could have been WAY funnier.Katara was Katara. I was happy there.Zuko was...okay. That would have been a difficult person to play, no matter what, so I respect the actor for his portrayal.Iroh could have been funnier, too. I think overall the humor part of the movie needed to be raised, so the audience could expect something more than just another out-of-this-world action movie.This portrayal was closer than Eragon was. Enough said there.*SPOILER ALERT*But the part of the movie versus Book 1 that I thought was actually IMPROVED from the series was the end battle. From the Sokka/Yue kiss and her going into the water (and her hair actually returning to black because the moon spirit left her!), to the Avatar saving the day with a wave instead of a big blue monster (...) made the movie all the more enjoyable. I applaud the cast and crew for those decisions.So I think overall the movie had its ups and downs. Characters that probably should have been introduced (Suki) weren't, but things were improved to make it a more cinematic experience versus just a kid's show.But as much as it had its faults, I think The Last Airbender was a great movie that portrayed enough of Book 1 of the series and held the new audience's attention with short introductions and lots of interaction. I say, great job, cast and crew!-thumbs up-",The Last Airbender
982,covebet,"Remember it's a live-action film, not the series itself.",6,1 July 2010,"Purely from a gigantic fan's point of view on the movie, at first it made me angry and annoyed. It is extremely different in many ways when compared to the series it's created from. Though, it took me a good half hour to finally get it through my head that /of course/ it will be very different; it's a live-action film. It needs to fit about 8 hours of plot (Book One) into a 1 hour 45 minute slot. It skipped a lot of things, and the story changed quite a bit in some spots.Even though all that, I did like the movie because it was ATLA. Almost from the very beginning you can notice differences between the series and the film.First of all, they say ""Avatar"" as like you are saying the first part of ""avocado""; Sokka is ""so-kah""; Iroh is ""ear-oh""; Aang sounds like the ""ung"" in ""mung"", but with a long 'a'.Aang never names Momo like in the series when they meet. He simply shows up a handful of times during the movie, and Aang calls him by his name once.Monk Gyatso, and Aang's life at the Southern Air Temple, has some significant differences.Haru takes a completely different form, pretty much. He is a young boy, who was bending pebbles when the Fire Nation soldiers go after him, and run into Aang, Katara, and Sokka. They all get tossed into a camp and meet Haru's father, but one big things is: The camp is full of earth. It's not a metal monster out in the ocean. Which brings me to another difference:The Fire Benders can not create fire on their own. They can only take it from another source (torch, campfire, etc.). With the exception of Iroh, which I can only guess is because of his ""Dragon of the West"" status.Before the movie came out, from looking at the commercials and whatnot, Sokka (and the actor who portrayed him) annoyed me extremely. Though, to give some credit, he does have a few moments in the beginning. (When they first meet Appa, and when they battle Fire Nation soldiers at the camp where the Earthbenders were held.)Princess Yue and her life, along with the Northern Water Tribe, are different. Yue is the leader of the tribe, as her father had died. There was no arranged marriage, and when Yue 'dies' to bring the Moon Spirit back to life, it's different.Aang gets tricked and ambushed while looking at the statues of the past Avatars, then captured by Zhao, where Zuko in his Blue Spirit mask releases him. (No frozen toads, though!)Ozai would NEVER say half of the things he said in the film. He's too nice.Among many, many other changes in the story line, and some details, side stories, and filler were cut from the series for this movie.As well as other things added into the film.But let me tell you: The special effects are amazing. There is LOTS of action, and even a bit of blood. It's really great, and takes you right there. I did not see the 3D version, so I can not comment on it, but the effects are nice! When it was first revealed that a live-action film was to be created, I had my doubts. I still had my doubts as I was walking into the theater. But I wasn't let down completely, and I do suggest that every 'Avatard' should see itt. Not necessarily in theaters, but maybe when it's out on DVD. If anyone watched this movie without ever watching the series, I suggest you watch the series right away. You'll know so much more into the story, and you'll get to know all the beauty of the show. I actually think it's preferable to see the movie before the series, so then you won't be angry when you notice all the differences every couple of minutes. :PI give it a 6/10, out of love and respect to the series it's based off of, and the effects. Definitely the effects. Did I mention I love the effects? It's a nice movie with lots of action. Not a great film, but a nice one.",The Last Airbender
983,xstvnssx,I can appreciate some things,3,3 July 2010,"A disappointment to all ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" fans. The movie tries to condense the entire first season of Avatar into 1 hour and 40 minutes (couldn't they make it at least 2 hours long?). I admit that the director did a good job bringing the characters through every key point in the series, but some support characters are missing and character development falls behind; powerful characters, such as the main antagonist, don't stand as intimidating as they should be. Visual effects (especially in 3D) were very enjoyable to watch, but slow paced (and for some reason always thrown in slow-motion). In the series fight scenes were very sharp and quick; it was basically what really sold the show to me. Costume design was excellent and the sets were beautifully done. One of the most disappointing traits of this movie is that it has almost 0 comedy. To wrap things up, if you really appreciate martial arts and the forms, this movie is for you.

I was hooked immediately and have become a total avatar freak watching every episode at least three times. Then the more I seen of this movie in commercials the more I worried, but still hoping for the best I purchased tickets several weeks ago for a midnight preview with eager anticipation. I wore my favorite avatar t shirt and went to the theatre three hours early.I was so disappointed in this movie that after the first hour I could not take any more and got up and left. It was not just that things were different from the show but the story itself had actually mutated into something completely different, and not in a good way. I feel like the spirit of the show was totally missing. there was no fun at all, no shipping, and the action was not exciting.Avatar fans do yourself a favor and skip this one, stay home and put in the season one DVD instead, and I am certain a better time will be had by all.",The Last Airbender

My son is 12 and has watched the cartoon for some time. I've always thought it was rather lame - like a bad Pokemon show (which is also silly). While the cartoon seemed to have a decent enough storyline, the characters were so silly that I just couldn't stay with it.When I saw the trailer for Airbender, it seemed as though they were trying to get a hold of an older audience and do away with the silly factor. So, I was actually anticipating what seemed like a good movie.After seeing the movie, it seemed to just be another 5-6 star movie with some good technology. The story does seemed to move too fast and is likely leaving out a lot. But what would you expect? You only have an hour and a half to get it all in. I've seen many movies that were much better books, so if you're expected an exact replica of the cartoon, don't go. If you've never seen the cartoon, it is possible you won't be infuriated for going.Is the acting great? Nope. Were the special effects good? Yes. Will I see the next one? Sure. Why?

986,gl11,"I believe M. Night Shyamalan will ruin the world (fans will get this, but i doubt Shyamalan will get the reference)",1,3 July 2010,"Let me start that I am a huge fan of the series. Book 1 of Avatar: The Last Airbender. There is a lot of material to cover: 21 or so episodes of 22 minutes of material each to be specific. Now, i can understand if the actors do not look IDENTICAL to to their cartoon characters, i can understand if Aang doesn't turn into a giant Koi monster at the end, and i can even understand making Sozin's Comet come in 3 years for the sake of explaining why the actors could age during the making of the possible sequels. However, this doesn't excuse the pathetic excuse of an adapation that was delivered to the fans. Shyamalan, just like everyone says, should be ashamed of himself. First off, the acting. What is it about this guy that brings out the worst in actors? I saw the Happening (huge mistake) and Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel, and John Ligusamo (sp?) are decent actors. But what i saw in the happening was a terrible performance from each of them. Here i saw the same thing. Not recognizable actors but terrible acting. To start the script was something a 3rd grader could write. No depth and no redeeming quality to it. One of the great things about the series is the amazing writing. There are witty comments and great stories told. Here? none of that. The actors didn't deliver, the story was boring, and I just didn't feel impressed. Secondly, the story itself. Heres the thing Shyamalan, if you want to make sequels you need to realize what you'll need for all movies. And you have no excuse for not knowing that being that all three books were out before you started this project. Sure people were upset about the cabbage man and bumi. Now, i can understand these two not being in the first (i thought maybe bumi could be introduced in the second movie) but where the heck was Roku and Suki? If anyone noticed the two roles were cast on IMDb. On TV spots you can even the kyoshi warriors dropping down on the fire nation while dropping from green silk from tree (check it out! they're there). I even found pictures of them online from the movie. But guess what! no kyoshi warriors. Does Shyamalan realize the relationship between Suki and Sokka is rather important? It must have been left on the cutting room floor. great decision. And no Roku! i believe he is one of the best secondary characters who helps teach Aang about being the avatar. Him, not some stupid dragon spirit. That isn't Roku!The effects i don't think looked all that bad. The 3d was horrible however. They shouldn't have rushed on that. The bending though was bland at best. Shyamalan should have looked into the different martial arts used cause im pretty sure each bender did the same motions. and what was that about the fire bending? they can bend their own fire! thats the point. Making sure to distinguish between the different bending types is probably a big factor in helping the audience not get bored seeing the same laughable stances. But you know what my biggest peeve about this movie was? the names. I literally sighed of relief every time they got a character or places name correct. But of all the names to get wrong, they get Aang. And lets not forget Sokka, Iroh, and the name ""Avatar"". Some people may say that the pronunciations are more authentic and such, but heres the thing. If the series wanted to pronounce Aang with a short A, they would have. And since they used a long A, then use it! Its not that hard. You only have to watch the first 30 seconds of an episode to get learn that. Its in the intro of the show. But no. I understand people upset at this ""racebending thing"". But im more upset that Shyamalan couldn't keep to the bare factsAnd recently i saw him saying why he thinks people though it was bad. He says his vision may get lost with his ""artistic accent"". That must be an incoherent babbling accent that allows no competent words to be heard, cause none of us got his interpretation. I may not have come off angry enough about this film, but I hope summing up my review i can be. There are basics that this man should have realized were rather important. Rather he rushed his time to deliver an atrocious movie that will get him a quick buck. Probably not even that with how many people are protesting this movie. I hope those who saw this who aren't fans of the show aren't turned off to the source material. The series ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" is probably the greatest animated epic of our time, and one of the best of all time. What Shyamalan did was butcher a great story. If there was going to be a sequel, i hope Brian and Matt have enough love for their story to give it to someone to do it justice, and not have this men ruin this story further than it already has. I give this a 0 out of 10, and hope that fans of the series live to see an ACCURATE live action representation of this show.",The Last Airbender
987,keith-891,Pleasantly Surprised,7,3 September 2010,"After three weeks of reading terrible reviews everywhere for this movie, I was discouraged. I re-watched the first two seasons of Avatar the Last Airbender to catch up on the story before I saw the film.I was pleasantly surprised! I'm not sure if it was because of my ridiculously low expectations or because I already knew the story, but I came out of the theater wondering why it was rated so poorly. The story was choppy, and left out some important parts, but in general did a good job explaining Aang's journey to learn water bending. It was fast, and and left a bit to be wanted, but was sufficient enough to show the first season in an hour and forty-five minutes.The characters weren't as bad as I expected either. Zukko's uncle was portrayed as kind, wise, yet very powerful, and had his characteristic accent. Aang could have been a little bit more cheery, but given the growingly dim situations he was facing, his happy expressions became more serious toward the end of the film. His martial arts prowess was very impressive. I agree with another review that the fire lord was revealed much too quickly and didn't have the in-your-face evil atmosphere as he did in the series, but instead had a more complicated dark personality. I was impressed, though, by the amount of personality that the ""extras"" had. You were able to see fire kingdom troops as people, and the other tribes' racially diverse populations were refreshing.The less-than-stellar acting was augmented by choppy writing and young actors. Some of the young actors express strong emotion by huffing with their noses, which happens a lot with young actors in general. The graphics were very impressive and it was admittedly ""cool"" to see elemental bending realized in believable cg. The martial arts styles followed the series with fire bending represented by Hun-gar kung-fu, and water bending represented by Tai-chi Chuan. Low expectations mixed with a former knowledge of the story allowed me to enjoy the film and gave me hope after reading the grim reviews. If you're a fan of the series, watch the movie and make your own opinions.",The Last Airbender
988,bobbyo180,OK for what it was,1,7 July 2010,"I went into the theater expecting to see a terrible movie make from a cartoon. I left the theater in awe and wonder. I was in awe of how they could ruin a such a great cartoon and I wondered why they decided to change it so much.The plot was basically the same, which is good, but the development of the characters is nonexistent. The characters are introduced and are just there. Since they weren't developed you have no feeling for them. There's no connection you feel to any character so you lose interest half-way through the film.The acting and the way the story progressed were both sub-par at best. The costumes, fighting scenes, and environments were beautifully created but could not save this movie.This is a good family film, so take your family, only if you have young children though. But if you are a die-hard fan of the cartoon just ignore this movie, you will be sorely disappointed. If you are just a casual watcher of the show, as I am, then you should see it. The movie was OK for what it was, which was just a terrible re-imagining of the cartoon. But for all you casual fans and families, see it. It will hold your attention and the kids will love the action.",The Last Airbender
989,jahid1081,I had to give it 1 out of 10 as there is no option for giving no point at all,1,5 November 2010,"I am totally done with Mr. M. Night Shyamalan. Seriously mister, how many chances do I have to give you to deliver a movie that does not fall apart like a house of cards? ""The Sixth Sense"" is still the only reason that I've seen some of your crappy movies like ""Lady in the Water"", ""The Happening"", ""The Village"", and finally the one that I'm writing a review about.Honestly, I kind of knew that this sort of a disaster would happen as soon as I read that Mr. M. Night Shyamalan is heading this project. ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" is one of my most favorite anime of all time. I'm afraid that M. Night Shyamalan has made me doubt that after watching this movie. What is wrong with him? I couldn't relate to any of the characters of the movie. Specially Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone. They were worse than terrible in playing ""Katara"" and ""Sokka"". ""Sokka"" wasn't funny at all as he was supposed to be. And what's up with ""Commander Zhao"" and ""Uncle Iroh""? Aasif Mandvi seemed like a comedian literally trying as hell to fit into the shoe of a fierce war strategist. And couldn't they find anyone else other than Shaun Toub to play ""Uncle Iroh""? Seriously!!! Has anyone related to this movie ever watched the anime? Even Randall Duk Kim who plays ""Old Man in Temple"" could have been a better choice to play that part.If you are a fan of the anime, I strongly suggest you not to watch the movie as it will literally annihilate all of your favorite moments of the anime from your memory.If Nickelodeon is still interested in making feature films of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"", I would suggest to start over like Marvel did with ""The Incredible Hulk"" with an all new cast and crew. Please put the two most capable persons for the job - Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko - in charge of the scripts and most important of all - PUT SOMEONE OTHER THAN M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN IN CHARGE OF THE DIRECTION.I'm now going back to watch the anime again.",The Last Airbender

Like one reviewer said, no development at all. I totally understand that its only a under 2 hr movie so what can you do really? At least develop the characters though like the TV series. Didn't show Aang dealing with anger , or Sokka dealing with trying to learn to be a warrior , matter of fact, Suki was nowhere to be found. At the end of Aang controlled Avatar state like a pro ,instead of triggered by anger , How do you go on with the other books then? I could look past pronunciation changes to the characters names , but at least make it feel like the series .

991,kristinaa_k,Fail!,1,10 October 2010,"Mr. Shyamalan, f*** you! This is probably the worst adaptation of any cartoon ever seen. When you decide to make an adaptation, you watch the original cartoon first, then try to make the film. This is a disaster, I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Please, fans of Avatar, do not watch this c***. I strongly recommend you to avoid it by any cause. Don't watch it even if they pay you to watch it. The horribleness of the movie almost made me cry. The plot is awful. Acting, you cannot call that acting, it's just a bunch of kids with the same face expression trough the whole film. And the whole atmosphere that is supposed to be happy, funny, cheerful, is just.... NOT. So I beg of you, do not watch this horrible movie.",The Last Airbender

I was hoping since this movie is based on the immensely popular kid's television show that the M. Night Shymalan effect would not be in effect. I was completely wrong. I was the most bored that I have ever been in a movie that is around two hours long. The fight choreography and action scenes were so few and far between that I found myself wondering if this was ever going to get over the exposition portion of the plot. About fifteen minutes from the end it finally did. Sadly, that was not enough to save this movie.Do not go see this movie. Save yourself the money and the two hours of your life.",The Last Airbender
993,ftballbob,A Movie So Bad its Bad,1,1 July 2010,"I was unlucky enough to go to a midnight showing of this movie and can in no way recommend it to anyone old enough to read this review. If there was any movie made for a razzie, it would be this one.Awful acting and an almost non-existent, disjointed story could be forgiven if the effects were cool and this movie took itself a little less seriously. But know, having watched the first season myself a while ago I can remember some very interesting action sequences, but none are present in this except ones made to look as boring as possible. This movie also makes me never want to see another 3D movie again, as its completely absent from 95% of the movie and just a way to milk you for all you've got. The actual effects there are decent at best at this point in time in cinema, and when they are there, boring as hell. Really from someone who has watched the series throw this whole movie I was waiting for something cool, something standout or memorable at all (so many instances in the source material), but to no avail. But could this be a movie so bad you find yourself laughing through it? Unfortunately no, Shyamalan will deny you any humor in his adaption for fear of it being to interesting. There are a few moments I found funny but probably not intended to be so. What you will find plenty of is stiff, horribly bad acting. Its one of those movies you would rather stab out you ears rather than listen to again. The soundtrack is that generic action music when its there but most of the time its absent.After seeing that this movie's lead was a kid picked from the internet and seeing bad review after bad review I appropriately lowered my expectations, but it was leaps and bounds worse than I could have prepared myself for. After leaving the theater amidst the resounding boos I realized that the one redeeming quality of this movie is that as bad as it is, at least it was short and forgettable. I would have probably fallen asleep if it was longer and want to forget that as quick as possible. I can take no further part in Shaymalan's quest to make a movie so bad it makes his former snoozefests look good. Just don't see The Last Airbender because if that movie makes money, Shaymalan wins. Worst $14 I ever spent.",The Last Airbender
994,desireedoria,I loved it,10,15 July 2010,"DON'T BELIEVE THE ANTI-HYPE!As an avid viewer of the series, I'd have to say that I absolutely adored this film. M. Night did and involved most of the actual story and characters as he could, it's not like it was easy to condense a 20 episode season into a 2 hour movie. So, of course it wasn't going to be as detailed as the show was. &Of course changes were going to be made so that it could make sense from HIS interpretation of the series. But it did cover a lot of, if not, most of what the story covered by the end of Book 1. I have no idea why people are complaining that ""it wasn't exactly like the series."" I mean, HELLO! Of course it wasn't going to be, if the movie was going to be exactly the same thing as the series then why even make the movie? Yeah, it didn't follow the series EXACTLY the way it was laid out, but did Transformers follow the series it was based on? I don't see anyone bagging on them, so you know what? GET OVER IT! Avatar: The Last Airbender was a show created for kids. End of story. &Can we just forget about the race thing already?! I mean, c'mon! It really isn't an issue...unless you're an ignorant slob who has nothing better to do with his/her life than complain about the most futile things. Because seriously, EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER in the show was Asian, does that mean only Asian people are able to bend elements? How are you supposed to explain that to a 5 year old (who is basically the movie AND the show's target audience, btw, for those 39 year old men still living in their mother's basement who are sitting around their computers all day complaining and whining their butts out about this movie)? M. Night involved every race in that movie to make it as diverse as our world is today.

Zero character development and shorthanded story board leaves the viewers and more importantly fans with a bitter taste in there mouths. I went into this movie hoping for the best but preparing for the worse (hint hint ""The Happening"") but even this I could not take.I am giving this movie a 2/10 as it did have some positives like costumes design and special effects but other than that this movie deserves little else. If you are a fan of the series please for the love of god don't watch this movie.

997,Lenoan,Laughably bad. This film just doesn't cut it.,3,5 July 2010,"I tried to give this movie a chance. I tried to look past the poor taste in casting choices & I tried to look past the bad reviews. And now here I am, writing one myself.There were many parts of the movie that I just laughed at. I'm convinced M. Night Shyamalan makes it his goal in life to create bad movies just so people can talk about how bad they are.""Soaka"", ""Ong"" and Katara gave terrible delivery of their lines and I don't think Shyamalan's bad writing is enough to justify it. I cannot for one second believe that these actors were the best for the job.They had no chemistry, and there was no real friendship development between the main Trio. Most of their dialouge is ""Awvatar"" related stuff. ""Ong"" seems to be better friends with Zuko than he does with ""Soaka"" and Katara. Again, Shyamalan's writing, which was probably dug up from his 2nd grade writing drafts archive, is to blame.Dev Patel was probably the last actor I thought should be cast as Zuko and yet, he was the one I liked the most. How is it I found myself looking forward to his scenes than with the wooden ""heroes""? His uncle ""Eero"" is another story, as I felt he lacked the light hearted, comedic vibe that IROH has in the cartoon. Once again, not the actor but the writing.Shyamalan's way of trying to extinguish the casting controversy fire is to sprinkle ethnic actors all around. Of course he fails to do so. He makes the evil fire benders, prisoner earth benders, and helpless water tribe people of all different ethnic backgrounds. What does that say to you? I did not feel any darkness in Fireload Ozai and felt he lacked the truly evil, creepy vibe. Or am I talking about Commander Zhao? How is it that Ozai and Zhao look more like brothers than Ozai and ""Eero""? At this point, I am not hoping for a sequel but a reboot with a new director and writer. Patel is probably the only actor that should be kept, as I feel Zuko is the only character the film got right.",The Last Airbender
998,kraal-mornan,Not as bad as many said it to be,6,18 October 2010,"Hearing and reading other reviews, I didn't have high expectations when I went to watch the movie. And, I have to tell you guys, I was very surprised because of that.Okay, there have been many obvious changes, some of which I didn't like - just an example, the bendings looked way better in the series, following the fighters every move and stuff. But then, I feel that the disappointment of many stems from the things that have been left out. If we say that every episode is exactly 20 minutes long (which is not so, but makes counting easier), then the running time of the movie would be over 7 hours - then everyone would complain how overly long it was.Okay, they could have added like a half an hour more running time, focusing on character development and expanding the background of the World. My point is, I agree, the screenplay could have been better, but I've seen worse. A LOT worse.I also wouldn't say the performance of the actors were wooden, as many have pointed out. It was quite okay. They will not get an Oscar for their acting, but no, it wasn't bad at all. Actually, the acting seemed pretty natural to me.A very strong point of the movie is the soundtrack, because it just beautiful and monumental. Thumbs up for J.N. Howard.tl;dr version: While the movie was nowhere near as good as the original series, it wasn't that bad at all.

I had an open afternoon on Independence Day yesterday and my wife and I decided to go. I didn't even know it was based on an animated series until I started reading the comments here. I don't go to many movies in the theaters. I usually save the money for movies that look like they will be visually thrilling, or come well recommended by friends (or if they're James Bond movies). Also, I am a M. Night Shyamalan fan - and yes, I even liked Lady in the Water. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie and I was completely surprised to see its middle to low rating on IMDb with all of the negative comments. I thought the special effects were amazing (for those who disagree, you've been spoiled. This movie was stunning). The acting wasn't distractingly bad so I didn't even think about the acting quality until I read some of the comments here. The plot was pretty good for only a 2 hour movie. Long story short: -My friends recommended it -I will recommend it to other friends -It's worth the ticket price to see it in theaters -I now want to see the entire animated series -I will probably buy this when it comes out on DVD -Although not popular to the masses, Shyamalan is the man!",The Last Airbender

The original story they wrote had a lot going for it..not brilliant, but very good.I enjoyed the action scenes and the special affects: I saw it in 2-D. I enjoyed the acting for the most part.

1003,mrkaphie-1,"Last Airbender was a moderate success, for a monumental task.",6,2 July 2010,"The Last Airbender is a movie based on one-quarter of a brilliant cartoon series, Avatar: The Last Airbender. Having to string together multiple plot-lines, deciding which parts of sub-plots to cut or keep, had to be a daunting task for M. Night Shyamalan. He did a decent job.As a fan of the cartoon series, I can say that I was pleased with the result. The movie DID capture the basic spirit of the series (though little of the humor.) And the story has important messages for the modern audience: respect for the sacred, acknowledgment of the spiritual, respect for nature, respect for their fellow human beings, and respect for diverse cultures. I like to think that those who see this movie will be guided to the cartoon.The very world-concept of the series is fascinating, too -- something that also comes through in the movie adaptation. Pseudo-far-eastern cultures blend with martial-arts, magic-like psycho-kinetics and quasi-Earth-like alien animals to create a convincing whole. It's an alien history, a mystic history, that for all its fantasy reflects parts of the real human experience.There are only two places where Shamy falls down a little in making the movie. The plot is a bit choppy in the beginning of the movie, having the effect of slowing the flow of the story. Second, some of the characters weren't as developed as I would have liked. But both of these failings were minor in light of the over-all work. They were understandable failings, considering the pre-existing source for the movie-plot, not to mention the inherent ""far-outness"" of the world of the Airbenders.

Earthbender picks it up and, explaining that it had come from the water tribe, offers it to Katara: ""Oh look, it's a water-bending scroll"". It DID showcase Momo's curiosity.

This separates them instead of bringing them closer.BAD: Ozai explains that 3 years hence, all fire-benders will be able to produce fire from their chi. huh? we needn't know how they make fire. OK: Zhao's death (so graphic - that was probably the reason for the PG rating) at the hands of 4 water benders.BAD: why does Bishil(Azula) not have amber eyes?BAD: No hint of Aang's crush on Katara.

1008,reader111089,My brother and I were so disappointed,1,30 August 2010,"What can be said that hasn't been already said about this movie. I couldn't believe how bad it was. I had already decided not to see it based on the reviews here, but a friend of mine had some spare movie passes so I decided to see it and judge for myself. Having already read several people's reviews here I went in to it expecting the worst, and I got it. I saw it a couple of weeks after it was released and me and my brother were practically alone in the theater in the middle of the afternoon on a summer weekend. And while the movie was playing several of the very few other people in the theater walked out, but I was determined to make it to the end. The acting was just SO bad. And the nearly constant narration was so annoying, but I understand why they needed it. If they hadn't added it in nobody except a die-hard fan would be able to follow along. Changing the name pronunciation was incredibly incompetent and alienated me more than anything else I think. I hate M Night for this movie. I will never EVER pay anything to see anything he directs again, and I apparently am one of the few people who actually liked ""The Village"".",The Last Airbender
1009,jonball717,The LAST Airbender is hopefully the LAST M. Night film I ever have to see,2,10 July 2010,"I'll start by saying that I love the cartoon series Avatar: The Last Airbender and had high expectations for this movie. Then I read the awful reviews it was receiving and my hope started to fade away. However, I held on to the idea that everyone else was simply being too hard on the film and not giving it a fair chance. With this mindset I went into The Last Airbender movie with hopes that everyone else was wrong and I was about to see a great tribute to an amazing series. Then the movie started, and I realized something horrendous. Everyone else was right, and the movie was absolutely awful.The acting in the film is perhaps the worst I've watched in a major motion picture in the last ten years and was downright painful to watch at times. Moments in the movie which are intended to be inspiring or serious, are instead corny and embarrassing. Out of the entire cast I could see only one person who actually seemed to know how to act, and that was ""Uncle."" He did a nice job overall but the other main characters in the film act as well as wooden planks and as a result you're never once engrossed in the film. The dialogue in the movie sounds like it was written by a middle school student flunking English and it amazed me that anyone would actually put their name to the burning trash heap that is The Last Airbender.The pacing of the movie is nearly unbearable. Nearly every scene exist to simply explain what's happening and the character's actions are irrational and confusing. I understand that it's difficult to cram an entire season of television series into a movie, but it's been done before and with amazing results. Based on the poor job M. Night did with this adaption, I'm not sure he even watched the series. Thank God that the theater I watched the movie in didn't show it in the 3D, from what I've heard it's a waste of money and only serves to hurt the only good feature of the film, it's special effects. It's also worth noting that the actual ""bending"" in the film is nothing like the cartoon series. Why does it take 15 seconds of karate motions to begin to bend an element, in the series each motion the character made translated to a corresponding reaction from their element. Anyway, the film is awful and you should NOT waste your money on it. I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because it was short. Any longer and I might have had to have walked out of the theater.",The Last Airbender
1010,aimemusic,"Yet another hatchet job from a famous ""HACK!""",1,3 July 2010,"I am an avid movie goer, and I love films. I work in the industry, so I can find an amount of enjoyment from just about every film project, be it merely the execution of the below the line crew. I am a firm believer in the auteur theory of film, where a director's artistry effects a story and its telling through film. A fan of the animated series, I am very disappointed with the big-screen adaptation. I have heard much grumbling about the casting of various characters and much of it based on race and so forth. I am a little curious where the need for ""Asian"" casting is for a ""mythical"" world. Although much of the themes come from that region, the same could be said for Joss Whedon's ""Firefly"" series which spawned the feature ""Serenity."" I don't think I heard the kind of complaints and ragging I've seen for ""Airbender."" Actually, what I find quite humorous is that Noah Ringer looks very much like the actual cartoon depiction of Aang. No. I don't blame casting on this films abject failure. I place entire blame on Mr. M. Night Syamalan (note, this will be the only time in this review where his name will show - he will forever after be referred to as HACK). This director scored big with 1999's ""The Sixth Sense,"" but I fear that it's really been all downhill since then. The HACK had come to be known for ""gimmick"" films. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Sixth Sense"" and saw it multiple times in the theater. The directing in that film seemed inspired and still as a ""novice"" filmmaker (only two others under his belt), the HACK looked to have a promising career in front of him. Then, he went on to direct several forgettable films, one even spawning the crux of a parody film. With the release of ""The Happening,"" I believed that his career was over, and that the HACK would finally be thrown to the b-movie graveyard. Then, he comes with a great opportunity - Airbender. The story was already there, ripe with drama, conflict, emotion, and tension. The underlying story would have been simple to portray and parlay into a hit. THE HACK MISSED AGAIN.The acting was abysmal. I've seen better performances by beggars on the street. Many of the actors are quite talented, but like Lucas, the HACK has enabled the poor performances and shown the worst of these kids, doing them a great disservice. Dev Patel and Shaun Toub (offering the best performances of all the actors) seemed stifled and uninspired. Jackson Rathbone's character seemed to be slightly ignored, and he seemed to be late on almost every cue. None of the other performances deserve mention, as all of the rest I would like to forget. The story never really stuck to the original arc. I don't remember the Firelord actually showing up in the first book of the series. He was a dark and mythical figure, feared as a tyrant and almost revered as a demigod. Here, Cliff Curtis was completely miscast. Shaun Toub would have made a much better Ozai. Stilted and halting dialog, massive divergence from the television show, and underwhelming visuals...I fully lay the blame for this fiasco on the HACK, who's own children are probably angry with him for ruining what he says was their favorite cartoon. I wonder where that director from the Sixth Sense has disappeared to, but now, looking back, I believe the ultimate genius of that film rests with the producers who must have taken over the film during the editing process. If I can dissuade anyone from wasting their money on this film, I will - but worse than the $10.00 it now costs to see is the wasted time. Time I can never get back.Mr. Sham-a-lam-a-ding-dong - I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!",The Last Airbender
1011,catastrophe20000,A disappointment but still at least worth one watch.,6,1 July 2010,"I was really excited to see this movie and went to the Midnight release with high hopes. The movie started and everyone was so excited but that didn't last long. Aang was then introduced and his name was mispronounced and from then on people in my theater, including myself, cringed every time his name was said. Other names and words were mispronounced throughout the movie and the acting, in my opinion, was not very good. Also the 3D wasn't very good and at points it was just blurry to watch. However I am a huge Avatar fan and I think that if you are a fan you should still at least see it. I would not pay to see it in 3D or buy it once it is on DVD however if you are a big fan I would at least go see it at a matinée time or rent it once it gets on DVD.I had a tiny gut feeling that it might not be good when I went in, based on my history with Shyamalan's movies (The Happening...the movie where nothing happened) and I'm sad to see that it wasn't. I had really hoped that this would have been better, but maybe, if they make a sequel(s), the characters would somehow learn to say the names correctly.6/10",The Last Airbender
1012,zazzs,"if you see this movie you will want to commit murder, therefore, this movie can cause violence",1,1 July 2010,"M. Night Shyamalan decided two years ago that he would recreate the first season of Avatar: The Last Airbender as a live action film. Even before the dreadful movie came out, there was already a skeptical view towards the racially incorrect cast, but mainly the fact that it's M. Night Shyamalan. He didn't prove our expectations incorrect. Now what was it exactly that made this movie such a failure. There are many sources of error; irrelevancy to the show, poor graphics, incomprehensible plot, bad acting, bad script, etc. Well, The Last Airbender was capable of bringing all of these into one film, and more. Like the true die-hard (and incredibly nerdy) fan that I am, I mapped out the entire first season on paper, and created a checklist of all the events that occur. After watching the movie, I looked back at it and noticed I could only check 5 major plot points out of 33 that were correctly portrayed in the movie. Disgraceful. Now comes the exciting part where I rant about everything that was wrong.Content: Even before they got to the first scene I could tell it would be an awful movie. It had a homage to the title scenes where the have benders of the four nations doing their things, but the movements... OH GOD the movements. The benders take minutes of useless martial arts before they actually make stuff move, and when it does, it just looks like the bender is having some sort of magical seizure that somehow makes the elements move on their own. Speaking of benders, there's one scene where 10 earth benders do 15 seconds of crazy arm flailing, and they move one rock the size of a soccer ball. On top of that, the next part of the opening sequence had Katara narrating a Star Wars-esquire white text, black screen. Then her narration continued for the rest of the movie, because Shyamalan can't properly have actors portray a movie, so he's having someone tell us the movie instead.Again on the topic of bending, fire benders can't bend unless they have a source of fire nearby. This is the most retarded concept introduced in the movie. This just kind of makes them suck. And of course, Iroh is the only one who can make his own fire, and when he does, everyone poops themselves and run away. It's not explained, and makes no sense, like everything else in the movie.Last bending note; Katara never learns how to heal.There are twenty episodes in the first season of Avatar. The movie leaves out 11 of the episodes. Yes, 11. 55% of the events that should happen don't.In these episodes, they also leave out major elements of the show. There's no Pai Sho, and therefore no Order of the White Lotus. No kick ass animals except for Appa and Momo (who is never called Momo in the movie, by the way).Shyamalan changed around how scenes occur, and the order in which they happen, too. When Aang is captured by Zuko, uncle tests him to see if he's the Avatar. Not only is this wrong, but it makes no sense. Why the would a rock stand up just when it's around him?! When Haru's village is combined with Kyoshi Island and they find a water bending scroll there. Wrong. Aang enters the Spirit World when he's in the Avatar State and finds a talking dragon in a cave that tells him the world is gonna die. Wronger. Aang goes to the Northern Air Temple alone trying to find his people, only to be turned over by a random Earth Kingdom civilian. Even wronger. Zuko and Aang have a fist fight. They also leave out about 10 vital characters to the series: Suki and the Kyoshi Warriors (although the are on Kyoshi Island at one point... or what's supposed to be Kyoshi Island anyways), King Bumi (they never go to Omashu), Haru (a character with the same role as Haru is there however, but he's like 4), Roku and Fang (but there is a black dragon in the Spirit World we're left to assume is Fang), Jet and his Freedom Fighters, Bato of the Water Tribe, June and her Shirshu, Jeong-Jeong the deserter, and Yue's father (who is apparently supposed to be dead). AND THERE'S NO - CABBAGE MERCHANT.Mispronunciations: This just made everyone angry, and was just really unnecessary. It's Aang, not ONG; Sokka not Sohka; Iroh not Ear-oh; Avatar not Ah-v-tar; and it's called Agni Kai, not Agni Key. Oh, and Gran-Gran is called Grandma. That actually made me sad. Not only can't Shyamalan make a movie, but he also failed 5th grade English. What a shame.Characterization: None of the characters look right with the exception of maybe Aang. There are no proper relationships established between the characters. Sokka and Katara don't even know Aang's name yet when they decide they're traveling the world with him. They barely even talk throughout the movie. Sokka just has no personality, they never focus on him and his has a very minor role in this movie. Katara's a dumb -. Zuko's not nearly whiny or angry enough... plus he doesn't have the incredibly intimidating ponytail. Nobody in the Fire Nation seems very ruthless, actually. The only character, in my opinion, who seems to have the correct personality in the movie is Uncle Iroh. He doesn't have his same level of tea loving, but he still maintains the proper Uncle philosophy.There are probably many more areas I could bash this atrocity some call a movie, but these were my main grievances.",The Last Airbender
1013,Aaron110,Fantastic Movie - A Must Watch for all.,10,12 August 2010,"I went into this movie with very low expectations but it turns out to be a fantastic movie.I can certainly see why it is getting such bad scores from critics. It is not depressing. It does not promote a negative outlook on life. It has no suicides. It has no teenage angst. It has no existential ennui. There's almost no blood in it. Very few characters are killed. It does have heroes. It is life affirming. It does demonstrate a respect for life. It makes the argument that people can wield power without becoming corrupted by it. In short, it challenges the world-view of many artists, many critics, many movie makers and many in the Hollywood establishment. It is a minor miracle it ever got made. It is no surprise to me it is doing a better business at the box office than most experts anticipated.This is such a great movie on all levels. The story telling is on par with the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings franchise, brilliant cinematography and mind-blowing special effects. The action scenes were extremely interesting, as were the philosophical underpinnings of the story.The overall tone of the film is eastern, not western. Eastern world-views prevail. Nature prevails over technology. Spirituality prevails over materialism. Harmony between nature and spirituality is emphasised. Peace is not achieved, but is the clear goal of the story. The goal is peaceful coexistence between the four nations. This film was meant to be the first of several, but the others will probably never be made. There are too many forces opposed to this film. That is too bad, since we will not get to see the impending alliance between Aang and Prince Zuko and we won't discover the role that Uncle Iroh has to play in that alliance.A must see movie I give it 10/10 - pure entertainment with a great ending.",The Last Airbender
1014,royesboy,"I need some more synonyms for ""Bad""",2,3 July 2010,"First off, I must say that i don't normally write reviews. However, having seen this excuse for a movie, i feel compelled to express my downright disappointment. So: Simply put, it was bad. Unbearably bad. Mind-numbingly cruel, to say the least.The Acting was bad. Lifeless, boring recitals of dialogue tumbled off the stiff tongues of what, in my opinion, were a set of dry, rigid actors. Save, it was not completely the actors faults. The dialogue was shallow. The bad script combined with a set of inept actors, made the experience dry, and unable to stir any emotion within me (except drowsiness). It left me empty, waiting for more.Although I felt that the 3D aspect added no effect to the movie whatsoever, i will admit that the visuals were not that bad. However, I felt as if there was still room for much more development. The bending, particularly fire and water bending looked rather decent, even though their employment in the action scenes was dull. Honestly, i thought that the fighting scenes involving this bending were rather lacking.I am a HUGE fan of the series, and one thing i noticed is that while the series contains a mixture of intense moments and light humor, this movie failed to incorporate either. The action felt raw, bland, and largely unexciting, while the humorous element, was not present at all.Sokka (mispronounced in the movie, as ""So-kah"", among other names), whose character is SUPPOSED to be humorous, is not. He, just like EVERY OTHER CHARACTER in the movie, is not only underdeveloped but falsely portrayed. Sokka is funny, Katara is kind and caring, Aang is jovial, yet none of these characteristics were properly illustrated. The only character who i think came close to embodying their character was Iroh,even though his physical appearance was a bit awry.I understand the difficulty of compressing an entire 'Book' of a cartoon series into a two hour movie, but i thought that the time spent during the movie could have been better used. A lot of time was spent dwelling on petty details of lesser importance, while several other important aspects were left out of the plot completely! This compression of the original book caused the movie to feel rushed, and jumbled! It seemed as if it was merely a compilation of miscellaneous snippets of footage, crammed into 103 minutes and shoved into the faces of an expecting audience.I wont be as harsh as other critics, but i think that overall, it was a poor movie. Take it from me - the poor 14 year old who actually wasted his money watching this lame movie. Seriously guys, save your money, and don't make the same mistake I did. Stick to the cartoon.",The Last Airbender
1015,suestern,Why even bother,2,18 July 2010,"I can't believe they even bothered to run this film. It does ABSOLUTELY no justice to the series. There was no real character development, the major events in the first book were minimized while other less important events were given too much time. Like Aang, that's right not Oong, finding out what the Fire Nation did to his people got what maybe 7 minutes of play. Or Sokka and the princess's love tale and her death. There was no real build up to it. I didn't feel anything when she died. Shyamalan should NOT make a second one. This one was a flop and anything else he tried to do with this one will be as well. The series was completely amazing, I really got into it. But this was a TOTAL let down. This was 95 minutes of my life that I will never get back.",The Last Airbender

Why am I being so harsh? I don't care about the pronunciation of the names, and whether the movie followed the cartoon. The whole movie is just packed with filler. this movie should be 15 minutes long, OK 20 tops and in regular format, not 3D.But no, instead we get to watch the slow training of the avatar; how he learns to master the elements and use them...sort of...then do it a little better...oh wait...train a little more...there you go young avatar...you teach that water ball who's boss...on second thought now go find a spiritual place where you can meditate and let us watch you for a little bit longer, don't mind us we'll be taking a wee nap. This is pretty much the whole story folks. watch this kid learn to ""master"" two elements and two elements only;not four, this cow can still be milked so Mr. Shyamalan is going to show us the other two elements in the sequel (if we are lucky) maybe a third movie will show the damn avatar using all of the elements, and for the heck of it he wakes up and realizes that it was just a dream or that he was dead all along.

Night Shyamalan could take this amazing cartoon and make a disgustingly dreadful film. Part of Aang's charm was that 1. he was twelve, 2. he was funny, and 3. he was so innocent. Making Aang's character have the voice of a grown boy (deep and serious) is definitely not the way he should have been portrayed. So you get some of the main characters names wrong... but Avatar is pronounced with an A not an O (like your sitting in a dentist chair). IT'S THE NAME OF THE SHOW (I mean come on!!!)So you get some of the main characters weight and clothing wrong... but Zuko's scar is what makes his physical character and contributes to his whole personality... where is it? you literally have to use binoculars to see it. The entire movie was a piece of sh*t and should be thrown out with the trash. DON'T BRUTALLY MURDER A CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED CARTOON (for three years running) WITH THIS PILE OF CRAP!!!!!As a fan of the avatar series I am personally insulted by this film and hope to god that next time M. Night Shyamalan wants to destroy a cartoon series he does it to something stupid like Bob The Builder! M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender wasted 103 min of my life that i want back!But honestly what can we expect from him? He has actually topped himself, and by this of course i mean created a worse movie than The Happening. M. Night Shyamalan hasn't made a decent film since the Sixth Sense and Signs.

The claim that actors were not picked for looks but acting skills is absolute crap. The dialogue was very flat and calculated. Sokka sucked; i can't describe his crappy performance any further. Katara was not as strong as the cartoon character; she was tearful and wispy in the movie. Zuko and the fire benders in my opinion performed well. Zuko was strongly played and you felt his desperation. Aang looked the part but no emotion behind his performance. The one thing I was looking forward to most was the avatar states; which were absolutely weak and far and few between.Again I say I was disappointing in this movie it dragged on and on.

Aang sounded like Ung, Sokka like Soka, and even Avatar was pronounced wrong. Then, there's the acting. It was OK, except with Katara. The only reason the acting was bad as it is was because of the screenplay. An actual quote was 'Sokka, I'm scared. don't make me more scared!' Can you say that in real life? Than, there's the effects. They were also OK. Very cheesy, and Appa will give me nightmares. And the whole movie was just rushed. One second, Aang comes out of the ice, than the next thing you know, the movie ends. Luckily, I used a gift card and didn't waste any money.

1023,catryona,Depressing and exciting at the same time.,8,7 July 2010,"As a fan of both the show and the director, I'm conflicted. I came out of the movie disappointed - but the more I thought about it, the more I liked it. There are parts I hate and parts I love. Since you've probably already heard all about the bad bits from every other critic and reviewer out there, let me start out with what I loved.When I heard that M. Night Shyamalan was going to direct a live-action adaption of Avatar: The Last Airbender, my first thought was that he'd take the opportunity to explore the darker themes from the series, which often got passed over in the cartoon. But Shyamalan didn't just emphasize the dark parts of the first book: he took the theme of the first book - water - and made it into the plot of the first movie. The connection between water and emotion becomes the basis for Aang's character development: rather than being an Airbender who can bend water, he must become a Waterbender in order to master the element. And becoming a Waterbender entails accepting your emotions - even the negative ones, which Airbending instinct would have Aang avoid or ignore.Noah Ringer performs admirably as Aang, expressing subtle emotion through both expressions and body language. In a lighthearted moment he shines as a normal child who forgets, for the moment, the enormous responsibility he bears, and throughout the entire movie the gentleness that got him the role emphasizes Aang's compassionate nature. Jackson Rathbone, as Sokka, has few opportunities to bring the character to life, but carries off his few humorous scenes smoothly. Nicola Peltz's Katara is not as hot-tempered as the original, but every bit as determined and talented. Dev Patel brings Prince Zuko to life, poorly-concealed rage and frustration evident in every line, and while nothing can compare to the Uncle Iroh we loved in the cartoon, Shaun Taub's concern for his nephew and his obsession with tea and pretty women gave me the warm-fuzzies on several occasions.The most enjoyable moments in the movie for me were the battles - in particular Aang's one-on-one with Zuko at the North Pole - and for a first-time action director, Shyamalan is quite good at drawing one into the action with camera angles and timing. The scenery was amazing, eye-catching yet familiar, and the bending beautifully done. If you're looking for a movie that brings the world of ATLA to life, or a subdued emotional drama that addresses issues that were glossed over in the cartoon, you'll enjoy this movie....However, if you're looking for a movie that introduces and establishes the characters properly, has well-written and non-repetitive dialogue, follows the principle of ""show, don't tell"", doesn't get distracted with unimportant characters and scenes, and reproduces the cartoon in both atmosphere and event - you probably won't. While the characters' emotional journeys are generally in the show-don't-tell zone (a subtlety that I find appealing), everything else is explained, sometimes confusingly, sometimes two or three times in the space of a few minutes. Several important scenes lack the dramatic punch that the cartoon had. Sometimes the scenery and special effects overshadow the characters.So in some aspects, this movie falls far short of the mark, where in others it exceeds my (admittedly not very great) expectations, and while on the one hand I'm disappointed - on the other I'm thrilled. I think that with the experience of one action/adventure under his belt, Shyamalan could do much better with the second movie. I certainly hope that he has the opportunity.",The Last Airbender

The movie ran too fast. 20 minutes into the movie, we were halfway through book one, and I half expected that the entire series would be made in one movie! But then, when we got to the second half of the book, the movie started to work. The story was explained fully, and more time was taken to develop the movie. The fight scenes also made the movie much more enjoyable, and the acting seemed to improve. However, there are several minor issues that give the movie holes. The acting truly is not good whatsoever, and it's clear that some characters screwed up in a scene, and Shamylan decided not to do another take (Ed Wood?). It will be clear to you that there are a few issues that don't make sense, but it still deserves a view. Many people like this movie, and they have reason to do so. Dev Patel gives a brilliant performance, and Noah Ringer did well for a rookie. When the sequel comes out, I'd like to see the movie pace itself, so that it will not seem so unprofessional.Overall, the movie deserves a view. The acting isn't good, though some individuals did well. The fighting is excellent, and the special effects are legendary, but there are some minor, and some major, issues that will make you unhappy, such as too many slow motion sequences, and bad writing.See it only if you are a fan of the T.V. series.5/10",The Last Airbender
1025,felixschlang,Misleading Votes and Reviews,8,4 October 2010,"I just saw ""The last Airbender"". After watching a pretty good movie, I went online, to check, if there is going to be a second part, as the story ends kind of in the open. So I checked IMDb first, and see, that this quite good movie only gets a 4.4! So I start reading the user reviews to find a reason, and I find it quickly.I have never seen a single episode of the anime series ""Avatar"" so I am not a fan or anything. With that background, the movie was at least decent. I actually liked it and hope, there's going to be a second part. Don't get me wrong, it's a simple movie, but it has a nice classical good vs. evil story with some twists and surprisingly not so bad acting from some unknown actors. The special effects are really good and the musical score very nice.The only reason, why ""The last Airbender"" got a 4.4 Voting, is because of upset fans of the original ""Avatar"" series, who are angry and come to IMDb to get rid of their frustration. I can understand them. It's not nice, that the movie is that far away from the original, but to call it the worst movie ever or a waste of time is just wrong.",The Last Airbender

When the time reaches, you have to pay back and perhaps you have to sacrifice. This is the essence of Asian values. For most of the Asians, we exist not because we have the power to conquer but we have the power to keep harmony with other people and even other elements in the World.""Why did the Fire tribe not die at the end of the battle?"" Some people may wonder when they leave the theatre. But life is not whether you can rule over the World or impose what you believe on other people. Life is how to coexist with other people and other species. If air teaches you how to appreciate life, water teaches you how to accept who you are.

1027,pym-gi_antman,Loved it,9,10 July 2010,"I don't understand why all the bad reviews. I'm a big fan of the cartoon and I thought the movie was great. A very few times you could tell the kid actors were lacking in skill but that's because they are kids. Overall it felt a little rushed but that's because he had to fit an entire season in one movie. The plot followed the cartoon. I think the reason for all the bad reviews is that the overall look of the movie was too dark and not flashy/fun enough for kids and wasn't violent enough for adults. It's stuck somewhere in the middle. I still liked it a lot. The landscapes, villages, etc are very pretty. I hope they make books 2 and 3.",The Last Airbender
1028,Bgrubz,M. Night does it again,4,10 July 2010,"He does it again, I kept telling myself how can he screw up a movie based on a TV series but he does. Now I know that its difficult to cram a season into a film that can be sat through with out breaking it up but it played more like a clip show then an actual movie jumping here and there and everywhere. Had I not known who was who I would have been completely lost. There was decent development of characters and when he tried to offer back story it was done horribly, one such is having some child revel the past of one of the main characters of the series who got put to the side and only showed up when he absolutely had to be in the scene. Also the acting was very drool, with the exception of one or two characters it sounded like they just remembered what line to give at that moment and that was the take they went with. And it would seem that none of the characters actually matched their Series characterization rolls, aka Aang who is a fun loving carefree spirit in the show really appears to be just a whiny little kid in the movie, Zuko's rage in the movie was equivalent to the acting of Hayden Christensen's acting of Anikan's rage in Star Wars III, forced and not really there.Having said that when there was 'bending' being done it was well done at least. The only decent parts of the movie really was the 'bending' scenes. I would almost say if you want to see Avatar: The Last Airbender, watch the series. You'll get more out of it and save yourself 6-12 bucks depending on the theater you go to, or the 12-19 bucks you'd spend on the DVD/Blueray release of the film, or at least feel your money was well spent.In summary I feel I should be refunded at least half my money for sitting through that, and M. Night should stick with movies with plot twists you can spot ten minutes into the film, at least they can be original and entertaining.",The Last Airbender

I do not go into the movie theater looking for something bad or mistakes in the movie. As a fan of the show simply going to enjoy the movie, i went, and needless to say, it was an AWESOME movie. Honestly, most of the actors in this movie are just starting off, so some of the characters (Katara and Sokka for the most part) were somewhat lacking on their acting skills. But everyone loved power rangers when they were kids, but have you seen the acting now? its pathetic!!! My point being, that even if you find something wrong, thats okay. It a interpretation and they did the best that they could. The special effects were fantastic, water bending especially! I cannot wait for the second and third book, and if they don't get released i will be sincerely disappointed. Besides, the acting might get better. If your looking for a movie that inspires the imagination and lets your mind run, this movie is for you. I loved it so much that I have seen it more than once!! See this movie, you wont regret it!",The Last Airbender
1030,MissUrae,I Just Wasted Two Hours of My Life,2,1 July 2010,"Although others seemed happy with this film, it didn't live up to my standards. The actors and actresses chosen for certain roles were entirely inappropriate and did not correctly portray their characters. The fact that there were background characters of non-Caucasian ethnicity was very irritating, because the leads roles were played by Causcasian people. Having Caucasians as the leads did not fit with the ethnicities specific to certain groups (like the Water Tribes, who were supposed to be Inuit). It doesn't seem fair to do that when most of the people in the world of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" are obviously not Caucasian. It seems like the producers just put non-Caucasians in the background so that they could say, ""Hey, we didn't white-wash this movie!""Even though the air/water/earth/firebending was amazing, Shyamalan's adaptation of this amazing TV series was mediocre, at best. Actually, it was below mediocre. It was just flat-out BAD. Don't waste your time on this pathetic movie.",The Last Airbender

You have a couple small moments through the whole movie that are ""3-D"", when all it really does is hurt your eyes and make it hard to see anything really when you take of the glasses.When I watched this in regular format I liked the action, adventure, etc. The story as a whole had a good back story and a good story as you went through it. I believe the actors did a good job of acting and portraying their roles.No matter what everyone else says. THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE. You should watch it. But not in 3-D.",The Last Airbender
1032,Jim-Koonce,A Disaster if nothing but.,1,4 July 2010,"Spoilers:I was extremely upset with this movie, I myself am I huge fan of the animated series and was so happy to hear that they were going to be making a film for it and M night was going to be directing and writing it. Though his last few films haven't really been up to par I was hoping that this would be the one movie he could come back with. Though I think that he truly killed his career with this one. The actors in this movie were like watching a rocks. They had no emotion and no characteristics of the roles in the series. Sakka or Soakka played by Jackson Rathbone, was terrible. He made Sakka to serious and was i felt in to many leader positions. Sakka's is suppose to be funny and crack jokes. Katara played by Nicola Peltz was just as bad, she had no emotion and seemed distant from Aang. She also showed no motherly characteristics towards the others, as in the series. Aang played by Noah Ringer was extremely upsetting. He wasn't fun, he didn't seem to care to play or want to have a great time with life. The only actor I thought that did do good in this movie was Shaun Toub, playing the role of uncle Iroh. He did a excellent job at showing care and leadership for Zuko played by Dev Patel; however I was upset that he didn't show the laid back side of Uncle Iroh. And to be honest I was hoping more for a heavy set guy to play him.Overall there really was nothing good to me in this movie. Even the graphics were terrible. I am very surprised that this movie got green lighted and was allowed to be made. For me I think this should re-done. I honestly don't understand how they could have screwed this movie up so much when they had the series to go off of. if you don't know the series and you want to go see this movie I think you will be very confused and lost and if you do know the series then I think you will feel upset and displeased. I am already naming this as the worst movie of the year so far.",The Last Airbender
1033,drowninghippo,horrible,1,1 July 2010,"This was a movie that could have been fantastic, but true to form Shymalan managed to destroy a cartoon with great writing and humour with horrible writing and count them 1 (one) joke. Where it did get laughs was the remarkable job that was put into making the ""fight"" scenes as awkward and clunky as possible; combined with horrible acting and a convoluted plot of 30 second clips from episodes of the show smashed together made it nearly impossible to watch. Even from the very beginning M. Night seemed determined to ruin a great show mispronouncing every character's name and taking the flowing martial arts inspired bending from the show and lengthening them to an almost ridiculous degree. The Last Airbender was directed incompetently and with the know how of a 3 year old, at one point Katara runs from off screen to shove a fire nation soldier for back talking the AH-vatar. SOH-ka left all of his humour from the show back in his igloo along with his awesome boomerang, opting for a more our-budget-was-running-low- from-all-the-last-minute-3D model. Uncle EE-roh was cast amongst a double handful of other actors of middle eastern descent furthering the Fire Nation = terrorist archetype M. Night seemed so intent on denying ever happened. The Earth Kingdom consisted of the only Asians actually in the movie and did a great job of portraying them as dirt poor and weak. The Air Nomads seemed to all be Buddhist monks who couldn't even defend themselves as their bones lay scattered in their prayer fields. All in all this was an absolute waste of my time and money. Take my advice if you want to go see Avatar, don't waste your money and rent the TV show.",The Last Airbender
1034,jmh2298,Not as bad as people are making it out to be.,7,16 July 2010,"This movie is not as bad as people make it out to be. I have watched quite a bit of the animated series with my daughter and I believe the film did it justice. Yes, the exposition seemed rushed, but it still clocked in at 1 hr, 43 minutes. Yes, the dialogue and delivery was amateurish at times, but has anyone ever actually listened to any of the dialogue in any of the Star Wars movies. I purposely viewed this movie in 2D knowing that Shyamalan did not intend or at least film this movie with 3D in mind. Therefore, for those of you who were disappointed with the 3D version, the director should not be blamed, that decision is made by studio execs looking to suck more money out of us.The look and feeling of the film matched that of the series. The environments, dress, and look of each nation was distinct and interesting. If anything, one of my biggest gripes with the film is that the Avatar isn't childish enough, yet he still struggles with the notion of hurting people. I enjoyed all of the fight scenes as well as the accompanying special effects. This wasn't a perfect film by far, but it is definitely not deserving of the hatred it is receiving. This movie was way better than Shymalan's last two films (The Happening, Lady in the Water). When he is at his best, he captures suspense and emotion like no filmmaker since Hitchcock. I believe he was close to capturing the emotion provided from the source material. Let's remember folks, this is after all a cartoon aimed at adolescent boys.Unfortunately, like The Golden Compass, the next installments of this franchise will probably not be produced, due to the overwhelmingly poor reviews and ticket sales. However, like The Golden Compass I would have liked to see the progression of the films.",The Last Airbender
1035,wsmusician,"Forget ""Race""bending, ""Storytelling""bending is here!",1,3 July 2010,"M. Night Shyamalan has delivered to us a movie so boldly out of proportion to what is the standard of storytelling that a Raspberry is a shoe in for The Last Airbender. Taken from the hit Nickelodeon cartoon series ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"", Shyamalan's version seems to depict random scenes from the first season and put them together in what comes across as a two hour recap of what happened, instead of the well plotted out and character driven story from the cartoon. All of the characters are dry and never develop in any fashion. Don't get me wrong there are attempts, but they fail to bring meaning and depth to the audience. The special effects are well done, Momo and Appa look great! However the bending does not seem to flow from the martial arts (like the cartoon), instead it is the product of martial art like movements. The main protagonist, Aang, has his name mentioned many times during the cartoon and not once in the movie is it pronounced the same as the cartoon characters'. Sokka's name was pronounced two different ways during the movie. To change this from the original did not make any sense to me. Finally the end of the movie where Aang helps save the northern water tribe is very anti-climatic. Instead of a giant water fish spirit pushing the fire navy away, Aang glows (why we're never told) and make a big wall of water that scares the fire navy away. Quite frankly, I'm not sure why this movie got past screen testing stage. Bottom line: horrible writing, bad acting (or directing), little to no character development (or even a reason for their actions), and boring fight scenes leave this movie in the forget me pile. Go buy the cartoon on DVD and pray for a reboot.",The Last Airbender
1036,da_yeti,The Last Airbender is just meh,5,2 July 2010,"Overall just middle of the road film, not as bad as some say but meh non the less. Poor pacing but it is just as much Paramounts fault as is the Director, it needed to be longer. The acting is not that bad, first time actor Noah Ringer does OK but you can tell he is new. I felt Katara was the worst, and least developed character there is no connection with her and she is not like the shows Katara at all she feels weak and whiny.I can see what M. Night is trying to do with the fire nation but it also makes them come across as weak, and makes you wonder why all these other powerful nations would like the fire nation take them over. Fire Nation just comes across as military strategists, and there is really no anger in them.Name pronunciation had to be the biggest turn off for me especially with Aangs said as Ong in the movie. It was horrible, his name and pronunciation came from a show not a book there is not readers interpretation here. Should of just went with Aang and let it be cause there were a few people in the theater that said aloud ""Ong what its Aang"" Fans of the show may like it, but I found it watchable but it had so much potential to be great. I am worried that the sequels won't be made, but there is always a chance for a reboot.",The Last Airbender
1037,ajb92,"Not good, not bad, just decent.",7,6 July 2010,"After reading several of the reviews, I have to say this movie was not nearly as bad as everyone is making it out to be. I feel like the pacing was really good, considering how much material they had to compress into an under-2-hour movie. Shyamalan had to do some rewriting to make the story flow better, which is to be expected, and I think as a standalone story, it was really good. Even though some plot elements were moved around, there wasn't that much deviation from the original storyline. The visual effects were also gorgeous. The bending (when it actually was happening...more on that later) looked great, and the locations were beautiful.All that being said, I had several complaints about the movie. I have no idea why, but they mispronounced over half of the main characters' names. Iroh became Earoh, Aang became Ong, Sokka is Soaka, etc. I think they also butchered Agnekai (the firebending duel) if I remember correctly. The bending, while cool-looking in parts, was not nearly as good as it could have been. When the characters are fighting, it looks good. A little slow, but it's tolerable. However, when the characters are just training, I was very confused. It takes them several long, exaggerated motions to just make a little something happen, which was a far cry from the show, in which a motion = immediate bending. And that's not the worst part. Stranger still, there are many training cutscenes where they are going through the motions and absolutely nothing happens at all. It's as if they completely forgot to animate the water or whatever they're bending.The acting was hit or miss. Aang was a miss. Not only could he not deliver his lines, he also completely left out Aang's happy, bubbly side which was such a big part of the character. Sokka was actually decent. I was skeptical when I found out it was the same dude that played Jasper in Twilight, but Rathbone actually did a pretty good job. Katara, while capturing her looks very well, lacked a bit in the acting. Zuko was the opposite of Katara: good acting, bad looks. Iroh looked okay, acted well, but left out the endearing quality he had in the series. (yes, this has already been said by someone else) The Fire Lord and Admiral Zhao both confused me. Why take two really intimidating characters and cast some chubby Indian guys to play them? Not only did they leave off Zhao's Wolverine sideburns, they also threw his tough-guy demeanor out the window. The Fire Lord was even worse. In the series, he was this really tall, buff guy; had long hair, a goatee; very scary-looking character. In the movie, he's some Indian guy with short hair. Not an accurate portrayal at all. The acting on both Zhao and the Fire Lord were okay, but it's hard to appreciate that when they look so different from the way they're supposed to.All in all, despite having many flaws, the movie was still worth seeing at least once. It's tough to cram an entire season of a show into a movie and make it flow well, but Shyamalan passed in my book. Not an A, or even a B, but he passed.",The Last Airbender
1038,david-park33,Worst movie so far of 2010,1,1 July 2010,"I am sorry to say that the last air bender, is a shame. A big disappointment. Over the course of 10 years, M.Night Shamylan's career had gone from an Oscar nomination to the worst reviewed movie of 2010. Airbender, or so its called, has terrible acting. The actors are too stiff or not comfortable with the demands their characters require. Second, the story, it is too disorganized with all of the characters and the decent special effects, I still had the thought in my mind: Is this movie any similar to the cartoon series? The answer came to my head after the first half of the movie: No. I wanted a refund or just to leave the theater. Many people left during the course of the film and I did not want to waste my money, which i already had. After the film, people booed and threw things at the screen.

Yet now, I was compelled to write this review as a warning. I have seen EVERY movie on IMDb since 2005 believe it or not and this was by far the worst movie I've seen The actors and the acting was disappointing. The editing was horrible. I think the director suffered some kind of depression or breakdown during filming. The special effects were worse then in most B-TV movies and that's not a lie.I loved the animated series and understood that this was a movie for kids. That doesn't bother me. What bothers me is that this movie isn't even a shadow of what the animated series was.I lost an hour and half of my life watching this and Im honestly surprised the director had the balls to put his name under this ""work"". Sometimes ""bad"" movies are so ""bad"" its good, or cult, or ""accidentally"" funny. This was just plain bad. If you really want to see a movie and don't know what to see, look on IMDb for something else or watch a movie you have already seen a 2nd time. Words can not describe how terrible this was.

1040,rurouni-soujirou-674-555980,Poorly executed but brilliant.,6,6 July 2010,"In the world of The Last Airbender, the four nations have been at war for a hundred years. The Fire Nation's army of machines and Firebenders (people with the ability to manipulate their natural element) has exterminated the Air Nomads, worn down the Southern Water Tribe until only one Waterbender and a handful of women and children are left, and captured many towns in the Earth Kingdom, imprisoning and breaking the spirits of the native Earthbenders. Only the Avatar, born with the ability to bend all four elements, is powerful enough to put a stop to the Fire Nation's invasion - but the Avatar hasn't been seen for a century. And then he is found at the South Pole, encased in ice but alive, and unaware of how long he's been missing.At first The Last Airbender seems to be nothing more than a decent story told badly, as the titular protagonist, Aang (played by surprisingly good newcomer Noah Ringer), struggles through clumsy exposition and uninspired dialogue on his journey to the North Pole. There he must master the art of Waterbending in order to further his training as the Avatar, who is tasked with keeping the peace between the four nations, and between his world and the world of the spirits.Many obstacles lie in his way, and, surprisingly, Prince Zuko and Admiral Zhao (both from the Fire Nation, and both obsessed with capturing Aang before he becomes strong enough to stop the Fire Nation's advance) are the least of his problems. Aang's own worst enemy is himself.Faced with the enormous responsibility of being the Avatar and the horror of the extinction of his people, he shoulders the burden of his destiny reluctantly and refuses entirely to address the negative emotions that threaten to overwhelm him. His suppression of his pain results in the near-suppression of his ability to Waterbend - a plot development that is nearly lost as Shyamalan becomes distracted with subplots, side-stories, and intense but unnecessarily long battles filled with showy CGI and martial arts.But in the end, the scattered threads of narrative weave together in a breathtaking climax - and one that speaks to me and many others - as Aang finds the strength to face his pain without letting it overcome him, face his fate without losing himself, and takes his destiny into his own hands.",The Last Airbender
1041,MirrorBride,Ignore the critics and judge for yourself,10,1 July 2010,"The Last Airbender was entertaining for me and my audience at the midnight showing. The theatre was packed, and everyone seemed to love it. Though the reviews say the movie is horrible, I say everyone go and judge for yourselves. I was surprised to really enjoy it after the reviews I read before going.The effects were awesome and the bending looked amazing. They made everything look so real. My only issue here was that the 3D wasn't as ""poppy"" as I hoped, but it was good anyway and worth it.The sets were very well constructed and CGI'd! Especially the Northern Water Tribe's kingdom. It was made entirely from snow and ice and it looked extremely real and just gorgeous.The costumes were amazing and very true to the cartoon. Aang's tattoos are more defined here, and Katara's hair is much better styled than how it was in the show. The costumes you see in the show are pretty much what you get in this adaption.The writing was pretty good. Some time is skipped here and there in the movie, but if you pay attention you shouldn't be lost. Aang and Sokka's name pronunciations were both changed to how they were originally supposed to be until the cartoon made them easier for kids. The name changes didn't bother me too much, because they sound similar to the cartoon anyway. One thing I liked is that it was easy for me to compare some things to Christianity! I thought the acting was very well done. Noah Ringer was great as the awkward, young Aang. He also has fantastic fighting skills and a certain charm about him that makes you sympathize with him. Nicola Peltz was a fabulous Katara and her acting abilities shined through in her performance, notably when she was alone with Aang. She brought some emotion to Katara that in the cartoon seemed to be repressed some. Jackson Rathbone as Sokka was such a great cast choice. He has the same goofy charm about him, as well as being very handsome and caring. Did I mention handsome? Last but not least, Dev Patel as Zuko really showed his acting abilities. I really sympathized with Zuko because of his performance. It was very emotional and heart felt.The music was so gorgeous and true to the scenes. James Newton Howard has done it again.My only nitpicks about this movie was that I wish it could have been longer. I was having so much fun watching that I didn't want it to end. The biggest issue with the movie I had is the lack of Suki. I hope they bring her back in future sequels, because she was a favorite of many fans.If you go in expecting a blockbuster film, you will be upset. If you go in expecting an entertaining movie, you will be entertained and may even love it.",The Last Airbender
1042,Team-Preston,Could have been so much better.,6,2 July 2010,"Based upon the Nickelodeon series Avatar- The Last Airbender.First off, I watched season one of the series over the past few weeks and am watching season two currently. I love the series. Totally awesome work.This review is of the currently released film directed by M. Night Shyamalan.Review: Is this going to a be a super hit? An Academy Award winner? A deep drama? No. It's a 400+ minute series truncated in to 100 minutes of special effects. Everyone will bicker about parts of the series being clipped off, combined with others parts, parts shifted. Which parts were most important to you? The cabbage vendor? Mang the gap-toothed fan-girl who called Katara a floozy?Everyone will have a favorite part, and in a film adaptation you can guarantee those sacred cows will be slaughtered in the name of condensing the film in to one easily chewable bite for the target demographic.I think if I could have one wish for the film, it is that I wish it was about three hours long so they had time to really delve in to the characters and the events that shaped Aang, Katara and Sokka etc.That wasn't to be. The target demographic is the short-attention span generation and 90-100 min was all they had to tell a really long and deep story, which is a crying shame.Without spoiling things I'll say that series events are shifted around. Parts that were originally Katara's became Aang's. Some bits were chopped off. Some bits were shifted slightly. I feel that the overall vibe was there, and the cuts and shifts made were due to time constraints to build on Aang's character as we had little time for anything else. I would have loved to see more characterization, but again, time constraints.Show don't tell. I hear that all the time and in this case it was necessary. There was a lot of ground to cover (literally) and a bit of back story was necessary.Effects. Awesome. Choreography, awesome. Acting, some was a bit flat, some good. Plot, largely the same as the original series and largely true to it. I believe that the writer and director did a fine job in dealing with the constraints they had. If they had more freedom it could have been better. Just remember that their hands are tied in many ways on this.Whitewashing? I call BS. While the original series was entirely Asian in many ways, the film is more regionalized: some nations being Asian, some Indian, some Caucasian, some mixed. Some sigils were neutralized. Still the overall flavor was right. It's still the same story, with the same theme. The regionalization is there to make it palatable for everyone: Whites, Asians, Indians, Blacks, everyone, not just a single culture, which I think is reasonable.Pronunciation of names? Seriously people? That's a pretty lame nit-pick. Gimme a break.I think I would have liked a fat uncle Iroh, but Shan Toub did an OK job with it. Noah Ringer did a fine job as Aang. Dev Patel was good as Prince Zuko. Nicola Peltz (Katara) and Jackson Rathbone (Sokka) were a bit flat, but they didn't have a lot to work with either. They didn't really get a chance to shine. M. Night Shyamalan directed without his usual tricks, switcheroos, and whammies.The Grade: Overall, the film was enjoyable but felt rushed. Like the whole thing was a montage or a highlight reel of the series. The kids in the theater cheered and said it was awesome, so that is great. If it does it's job it'll get people to watch the series for more of the good stuff as this was just a taste.Did it suck more than anything has sucked before? No. Fans of the series will likely be let down as their expectations will not be met. Then again, fans are always bastards to make an adaptation for. Everyone judges an adaptation by the original material and not on its own merits. It's called an ADAPTATION for a reason. Still, you can never please some people.",The Last Airbender

The sheer idea of converting a season (420 minutes) into a movie (103 minutes) is basically impossible without cutting scenes, especially important scenes. The sad thing is... the scenes weren't the only things cut. Character personality was completely wiped out, every character, Sokka especially, were basically 100% serious. The character personalities were the CORE thing that made the series good. The actual events were twisted as well and random lines were directly copied from the series to the film which was the cause for some very odd dialog (important lines..... randomly thrown in).Major events were broken. Aang and his party made it to the Northern Water Tribe in about 30 minutes (29% through) while in the series they made it here in chapter 17 (91% through). At the end it was revealed the comet would come in THREE years.... not months.For some odd reason it was decided that all the names would be pronounced differently as well... perhaps they weren't aware the names were already pronounced in the series.In all, the movie was made bad by loss of personality and twisted scenes. If you loved the series this movie will be bad. Otherwise... it might be good. Don't feel like going more in depth, it's two thirty in the morning.",The Last Airbender
1044,AlexandreBilodeau,"M. Night Shymalan, The worst well-known director of our generation",1,2 July 2010,"I was a big fan of the show, from the wacky humour, to the adventurous plot lines and the character development of all of the characters. As a fan of Avatar, the last airbender, this movie was a complete disgrace to the franchise. M. Night Shyamalan should be utterly embarrassed with the ""film"" he put out. It was apparent that he had a vast budget. The scenery, effects and props were top notch but that's where it all begin to fall. Choice of actors/actresses and dialogue were the worst I've ever seen in a movie. I felt that all the dialogue written for the characters were dragged on, terrible and way to formal for anybody's tastes. The movie was filled with wordy and boring explanations instead of bringing the viewers and telling them a more intelligent way. Dialogue was cheesy and awkward, and casting choices was off. Not one character looked to be in their right place, but I won't bother going into detail, there are enough threads on this. There was too much plot to fit into 2hr movie. I seriously doubt, and hope they won't make this a trilogy. It's hard to make a trilogy when the first is utter garbage. As a fan, I hope they remake this movie with better choice of actors/actresses and most crucial of all, another god damn director. The failure of this movie base solely on Shyamalan and should apologize for ruining such a rich in culture franchise. The humour was taken completely out and left with a bland, full of dialogue movie. I fail to realize how M. Night could proudly put this rubbish out there with his name on it. His movies as of late has been terrible at best and should consider a new career. He's been riding off the success of Sixth Sense for too long and I do hope that this is ""the last airbender"" done by him. I left this movie feeling robbed of my time, money and left with this bland feeling in my head. This is the worst movie I've seen in a while.I gave this movie 2/10. I really tried hard to like this movie but it was impossible. I think Shyamalan should rethink his career choice, or at least put more thought into the movies he makes. I urge viewers to skip this movie, and if wanted, catch it when it comes out on DVD. We shouldn't promote garbage movies like these.M. Night should be ashamed. He went from directing terrible movies to ruining great franchises.",The Last Airbender
1045,wellborn,utterly awful,1,10 July 2010,"The director couldn't even have the character's names pronounced correctly. It's not as if there is a television show, that if he bothered to watch it, he would then know how to pronounce them. The graphics suck. The script is so bent it barely follows the show. (How is it that an original writer from the series didn't write the script?) The acting in the show is so overdone and over acted it reminds me of the old Conan the Barbarian movies (only not as good). And finally the characters have lost all qualities from the television show that make them endearing. If I had doubts about M. Knight before, they are totally confirmed now. I will never pay or spend my free time on one of his movies again.",The Last Airbender

There was NO EMOTION. Characters were NOT FUN. Bendings were terrible.Katara kept spelling Aang's name wrongly. What is ANG for God's sake? Sokka should have been fun but instead he was very serious and not fun at all.Shortly, the film was not even close to the anime. I suggest everyone to stay away from the movie. Don't even watch it, it is a waste of time. Go and do something better instead. Or even just stay at home. If you liked the anime, you are going to hate the movie. It is a total Disappointment!!!",The Last Airbender

Comparing with the cartoon version, can't believe I am seeing such a boring, bad graphics, story , unfitted actors etc., Everything in this movie is horrible.

I definitely do not recommend to this movie, if you have already seen cartoon version of this movie.Hope this helps :)",The Last Airbender
1048,movieholic93,"Out of loyalty to the show, I'm giving it a 6/10. Shymalan however, gets a 0.5/10",6,23 August 2010,"I am a huge fan of the show, and ever since the first trailer was online, I was excited. The show had been amazing, and the trailers and TV spots looked epic. But, unfortunately, M. Night wrote the script and cut off huge chunks of the original film to be able to convert it to 3D faster (I wouldn't know if the 3D was good though. I saw it in 2D). The script was pretty horrible, and there wasn't a lot of character development (but as fans of the show remember, there wasn't a lot of character development in book 1; most of it was in book 2)but the actors seemed to do their best.Ringer as Aang was very sweet and he fit the role, even if he was really stiff. Peltz as Katara had the right Katara-ness about her, and did okay. Rathbone as Sokka did alright, but he took himself a bit too seriously, he should've just had more fun with the role. Patel as Zuko was spot on-he had the right amount of angstyness about him, the unrelenting drive to regain his father's love and respect...they just should've given him a sensible script. And Toub as Iroh was almost perfect. I really didn't think he could do it, what with the lack of belly and only one mention of tea, but he was Iroh, no doubt about it. The visuals (in 2D) were really good, and the bending looked cool, but it was almost completely mis-matched with the bender's movements. The soundtrack is incredible, one of the best things James Newton Howard has done! The script is, like i already said, horrible. Dry, flat, and predictable. The pacing is really rushed and hard to follow. And some of the shots are blurry, the camera angles a little too close for the genre.Overall, this movie could've been one of the best out this summer; instead, it was one of the biggest disappointments in film (for me, anyway). It barely passes as a dim reflection of the show. Out of loyalty to the show, I'm giving it a 6/10, but I'm giving Shymalan a 0.5/10.",The Last Airbender

The people who edited the movie sections to create the previews should of been in charge of editing this movie in its entirety. The acting from the Happening is back in the insipid dialogue's and character formation. I don't understand, with all of the tools afforded to the director to make an awesome movie. From an already developed storyline and a cast of characters, how could you ruin it so badly? This movie was boring from the very outset of the picture. It was like a preteen television drama filled with lackluster acting. The boy was aggravatingly unbelievable and the girl was sort of bland. The setting was perfect for a great movie but the actors and the storyline bogged it down with sheer boredom.",The Last Airbender

I would complain about the poor acting, the lack of Asian actors, the jumping from fire nation to water nation and everywhere in between, and the short time to fit in an entire season but the biggest crime of all has to be the script which gave the actors no opportunity to act. If M. Night Shyamalan was trying to create his own interpretation of this popular Nickelodeon series he did a bad job.

What i got instead was two hours of horrible acting and monotony. This was the only movie i ever fell asleep during. this was the only movie where when i finally woke up, i had to turn and wake up my friends who also fell asleep. One of the most boring and cheesy movies ever created by mankind. Don't bother to see it, unless you get in for free. And do not go see the 3D, its barely visible.

No the actors aren't superb, neither are the special effects ""Avatar""-like and the story is rushed through (it can't be done in any other way i guess) but all factors and moments from the series were realized in a sensational accurate way.

1054,carollof,A Let Down,1,4 July 2010,"To sum up the movie in 1 word, disappointing. M. Night Shyamalan is known far and wide for his spectacular movies but his latest piece, The Last Air Bender, will badly hurt if not destroy his career. As a lover of the original series off of which the movie was based, my expectations were high. I wanted to see what creative things M Night was going to do by putting his own spin on the show. But once you see the acting, characters, and clothing, you wonder if he even saw a single episode of the show. It was the little things that upset people like the fact that they didn't have the right articles of clothing, the right look of the characters themselves ( tall, short, fat, thin ), and worst of all they didn't pronounce the names of the character correctly! Its not like the show was based off of some ancient tale where the names are pronounced differently depending on where you are from, it was a cartoon that was made here in America with clear pronunciation. Besides that, M Night decided to change how the story was told, certain events happened differently than how they happened in the show. And lastly, the story was rushed way too fast. They tried to cram as much information in as possible which took away some of the drama and action that was needed and just made the film seem sloppy. To all the major Avatar: The Last Air Bender fans, I cannot say that I was satisfied but I do urge you to go see the movie and form an opinion of your own.",The Last Airbender
1055,mcgerm,A 4 because I averaged it with a 7 year old's opinion,4,3 July 2010,"It was tolerable only when the actors mouths were shut. No one should ever give M Night the money to ever make a movie again. He just about ruined for me something special that I have shared with my son. We used to watch together every new episode as it aired my son loved it for the action and silly jokes, I loved it for the excellent story and themes. Avatar: The Last Airbender became something really special for us that we shared, and M Night said the reason he made the movie was because it was special for him and his kids too. He must really hate his own kids!As I watched I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt: maybe he is trying to do this in a documentary style, umm no that was not it maybe he is trying to play to kids, uh no he would have included the series' slapstick elements if he wanted to do that... In the end it was just plain bad and amateurish.",The Last Airbender
1056,robmerrick181,Discouraged by the Laziness of the Writing and a Care for the Story,1,17 July 2010,"I am a huge fan of the cartoon series, and when I saw the first trailer back in January, I had already marked my calendar and was counting down the days until it was released. My sisters and I have the whole cartoon DVD series, and it became a habit to watch them together. With such a beautiful story to work with, I was sure that there was no way that M could possibly mess up this film, even though he has had a ""hit and miss"" career. I have to say that after I've seen the live action film, I couldn't have been more wrong.The special effects were sufficient, and the acting could certainly have been decent if the makers had spent a little more time on the scenes. But the biggest let down from the whole movie was M's portrayal of the story.If you've seen the cartoon series, then you know that they have their fair share of cheesy lines. My thoughts were that these would be dropped from the movie, but as it turns out, it seems that they added nothing but cheesy lines and dropped all of the beautiful moments from the series. There was no character development, you didn't feel attached to anybody, and the scenes had the worst flow that I think I have ever seen from a movie. We joke around in our family, saying that if M had just gone word-for-word from the series, he might have been able to pull it off.On a positive side, the best part of the film was about the first minute or so, in which they recreated the opening sequence of the four nations bending the elements. The style of this one scene was perfectly executed that if you're willing to pay for tickets to see just that one scene, then this film is meant for you. However, if you decide to watch it, walk in with the lowest expectations you can have, and then it's not so much of a slap in the face when nothing makes sense.",The Last Airbender

The main problem is the cartoon series all episodes combined is hours and hours and hours long. This film is 90minutes and there's to much to cover and the bad acting doesn't help. The floating flying thing I forget its name anyway in the cartoon its a cartoon is knows air bending it can fly great its a cartoon, in live action its just computer generated amongst young crap actors.

Night Shyamalan's Movies even some of those that people deemed as complete flops.When I read some time ago that Shyamalan would be directing this movie, I was interested to see how it would turn out, as I had already watched the whole series. It turns out for those who have watched the series from beginning to end like me, would be hurling insane insults at Shyamalan for the rest of his natural life.The compression of 5 episodes may have been forgivable but a whole book was a big mistake, the huge jumps in the storyline would be able to loose anyone. I liked the idea of using a lot of new actors but, I also believe most did not do well getting into their respective characters.I do sympathise though, just the task of directing a movie(which he has not written himself or had a hand in writing) while staying true to the Nickelodeon Series was, is and will be virtually impossible even with todays CGI.This does not sway my view of Shyamalan as a director who has a unique way of telling stories which I do enjoy.",The Last Airbender
1059,nguyencs2,Lets jump off the racist and nitpicking bandwagon for a second,6,2 July 2010,"I am an avid Avatar fan and had high hopes for the movie. After seeing all the bad reviews, I was a bit sadden but still tried to keep an open mind. I definitely can see why this movie can suck but I didn't think it was that bad.Acting was obviously not that great but it didn't ruin the movie for me. Added with the less than spectacular dialogue and script, I can see why it is a shoe-in for the worst movie ever award. Everyone on the cast could have used an acting coach. The dialogue didn't flow and often time feels out of place. The biggest issue I think for this movie would be the script/story.As a fan that watched the cartoon, I knew what was going to happen. This movie isn't even two hours and it tried to fit months(or hours depending how you look at it) of story telling into 1hr and 43mins. The story was so rushed to the point where you can't immerse yourself into the world. I think Shyamalan's biggest mistake is changing things that didn't needed to be changed.There's a lot of things I like about this movie. I like the depiction of all the races even with the minor changes(fire bender needs fire, etc). I felt ""bending"" was adequate in the movie and enjoyed the action sequences though I was disappointed for no avatar creature at the end. I like how they tried to keep the lightheartedness of Aang and should have done more of that. I liked how the flashbacks were done as I didn't feel distracted by it. I liked how Aang finally accepted his role and bowed back though still unsure of himself. The movie should really have been 45mins longer to adequately give it the necessary buildup and connections. I'm not going to say this was a great movie but it kept me entertained enough. People with race concerns need to take a step back. The movie can't be a complete adaptation. Don't ignore that fact that there's more shades of skin color in this movie than anything else out right now.Final verdict: the movie isn't great but still good enough to entertain.

PLEASE NOTE IF YOU ARE A CARTOON AIRBENDER FAN, DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Aang smiles a total of two times in the whole entire movie when he is supposed to be a happy boy.

When I saw the advertisements for it I was excited, but after watching it in theaters, I felt like the movie was for the most part,inaccurate. I know they have to squeeze all of book one into a 103 minute movie, but still ... there are somethings that shouldn't be changed. For example, in the movie, the fire bender can only move the fire, but in the cartoon series, they can create it. There are some scenes in the movie that I felt needed to be revised. For example, when Katara and Sokka find Aang, there isn't a beam of light that shoots out and signals to Zuko that the avatar is near. ... Or later on when Princess Yue gives her life back to the moon spirit, she did not lay down in the water. ... It didn't happen in the cartoon and I feel like that shouldn't have happened in the movie either ...(It would have been nice if they included story of how Princess Yue's father saw her become the moon or something like that) However, the most disappointing parts of the movie was the fact that most of the character's personalities were wrong and their names were pronounced wrong. Katara is supposed to be motherly, but instead was whiny. Sokka is supposed to be the comic relief, but was serious. And the last time I checked, Aang rhymed with bang and not gong. ....

1063,RubberPuckie,Promising Movie Falls Short,5,3 July 2010,"I have never read the Airbender books or watched the Airbender shows; however, the previews and trailers for 'The Last Airbender' had built up an immense amount of anticipation in me. I am always a fan of martial-arts flicks and the trailers for this movie hinted at a steady flow of butt-kicking. Yet when the movie ended, I overhead someone in the row behind me remark, ""Lame!"" While I may am only a casual movie-goer, I agree with him to a certain extent. There were fun-filled scenes, but other parts left me scratching my head.I believe that the main problem of this movie, especially for noobies to the element-bending world, is that the pace was overly quick. The history and development of the world was skimmed over, leaving many questions that viewers would never get answered or would have to be inferred from later scenes. The concept of the world is very fascinating; the movie would have been more enjoyable had I had a strong understanding of it. Sitting through the movie seemed much like going on a hike without observing the scenery. Some people may like this, but viewers who want to feel a connection to the characters and world will be disappointed for some parts. While I say that the movie was too fast, I also think that many parts could have been taken out altogether. Those scenes had me wondering what purpose they served. Perhaps by deleting these scenes, the makers have devoted more time on the meatier, important scenes. The actual story may not have been what I hoped for, but the action scenes were enjoyable. Noah Ringer (Aang) provided a showcase for his acrobatic moves, making them enjoyable to watch. The other actors also definitely showed that a lot of work went into creating these scenes. The graphics were superbly done - the 3D version looked tremendous. The movie has its share of ""ohh"" and ""ahh"" moments, but they were not plentiful enough for me to leave the theater with satisfaction.

I'm not really sure what plot is in the movie so I can't spoil anything due to the multitudes of plot holes throughout the movie. The editing is not good. Unlike most current movies, you can actually see where the green screen shots were. Cheesy fight scenes, horrid acting (probably the worst part) bad editing, and all this was made with a budget of around $150m I hear. I mean, I literally was screaming at the movie for every new disappointment that had come up. By 20 minutes into the movie, I seriously had no idea what was going on. This tried to fit the plot of every episode in 2 seasons onto a 90 some odd minute movie. This was not good in the least bit. Go to see it only if you need something to yell at, it really does get extremely boring. I wouldn't suggest this movie to anybody, maybe my greatest enemy, but not anybody I actually care about.

1065,tjayxd,"Disappointing, yet Entertaining/ Unfair and Unjust Casting still Stands",3,9 July 2010,"As an anti-caster AND a huge fan of the series (I own all three box sets)I can honestly say the movie is not as bad as I thought it would be. Though there were many laughable and cringe worthy flaws, I found the movie to be enjoyable. In preparation for the showing, I wore my Water Tribe shirt with pride and as a water element fan my favorite part was of course, when the 4 bad ass water benders killed Zhao. Some laughable moments was seeing Sokka lead a group of eastern Asian water tribes kids, it was hilarious seeing how M.Night cast a white lead with so many eastern Asian extras. What is he trying to prove? Another laughable yet cringe worthy moment was when the group of earth benders did this cool synchronized Kung Fu routine. In my head I thought ""o snap, those fire benders are gonna get it now"" but instead a small piece of pebble flew by. ""wtf?'""LoL""""seriously?"" Now onto the acting. In my opinion Noah Ringer playing Aang or shall i say Ong was just okay for me. He was not perfect but I was satisfied with his performance. Now for Katara and Sokka, I was disappointed before the movie came out and I still am. Katara is my favorite character and i felt like this film sucked out all the personality in her. Two of my favorite parts in the original series was when Katara gave that moving speech to the earth benders in prison. In TLA Aang gives the speech instead. Wth? Aang is not the only lead character, Katara is too. My second favorite part in the original series was when Katara fought Paku, this showed Katara's determination and morals. But they totally omitted that scene from TLA.Though i did enjoy the film, out of all the flaws, one thing about the movie hurt the most. Fire Nation. The clothes, the armor, and the architect in the movie represented by the Fire Nation was clearly of Chinese/Japanese influence. Although I did somewhat enjoy Dev Patels performance, he is not Zuko. The role for Zuko could've been an opportunity for a new a young eastern Asian male star. There are many younger eastern Asian kids in America watching this movie and TLA allows them to be proud of ""their"" cultures. The only thing is, ""they"" can't even represent their own cultures.",The Last Airbender
1066,mistert806,M. Night Shyamalan is the next Uwe Boll,1,10 October 2010,"I went to see this movie mainly to see if it really was as bad as the critics said. Yes, it was that bad. I also thought it would be one of those films that are so bad they're good. It did have its share of unintentionally funny moments, but overall, it wasn't so bad it was good. It was just bad. The story pacing, the acting, the fighting scenes, just about everything.The special effects did look decent, but since they were filmed in 2-D,I'm sure would look hideous in 3-D. First thing I notice in the actiing department is that both Sokka and Katara are just terrible, Especially Sokka. It was like he wasn't even trying. In contrast, Dev Patel, as Zuko, was overly hammy, not unlike Nic Cage. Aang was not quite as bad a Sokka or katara, but still pretty bad. Nobody was really convincing here. What's even worse than the acting is the storyboard. This story is broken, choppy, uneven, and moves along with all the grace of a one-wing dove. It's also incomprehensible, and leaves a lot of plot holes and things unexplained. There was a supposed love-interest subplot between Sokka and the princess, but that was pretty much non-existent and pointless. Overall, I'd give this a 1 out of ten, and seriously hopes it wins the razzie for Worst picture. I also hope M night wins for director. Nobody deserves it more than him.",The Last Airbender
1067,grilethredc,awful,2,10 July 2010,"I really wanted to like this movie, but unfortunately there is almost nothing good I can say about it. I did enjoy the bending scenes, and some of the sets were beautiful, but that is really this movie's only saving grace and it is the only reason I gave this movie two stars instead of one. The plot was a complete mess, the script was horribly written and the acting was atrocious. The best way I can think of to describe this movie is to call it the Cliff notes version of the cartoon series. I can't help feeling that M. Night Shaymalan didn't actually watch the cartoons,and instead just skimmed through the plot summary and made the movie based on that. The movie races through the storyline at a frantic pace, using random lines of dialogue as a thinly veiled excuse to cut out major parts of the story. When Sokka, Katara, and Aang arrive at the water kingdom, we hear the narrator announce that Sokka and Yue ""became friends quickly"" or something to that effect, and we're expected to accept that as the entire basis of their romance. For some reason, this movie tries to cram the majority of the season in about 45 minutes, just so they can spend the entire second half of the movie on the last two episodes. The characters have no personality whatsoever in this movie. The lines in the movie were very obvious and oversimplified, like M. Night Shamalayan was expecting the audience to be comprised solely of 8 year kids, or he spent almost no time and effort writing the script. It honestly felt like the script might have taken about an hour to write- that's how bad it was. The acting is at times so awful, I felt like I was watching stage actors delivering lines in a play. Jackson Rathborne (Sokka) in particular is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. He spends the majority of his screen time staring off into space with a dopey, vacant expression on his face. It literally looks like it hurts him to think. When he does have to deliver any lines, he does so with no emotion whatsoever. The main feeling I had after watching this movie was confusion. Why did they change the pronunciation of the character's names? Why did they cast actors who look nothing like the characters they were portraying? Why did they try to cram an entire season into an hour and a half, instead of making it two hours, which may have actually given them time to build a decent storyline? Why wasn't the script written by the shows creators? The only answer I can come up with is that M. Night Shamalayan and the producers didn't care enough to put the time in to actually make anything decent, or thought their audience would just be a bunch of kids who wouldn't care if the movie actually had any substance. If you absolutely must see this movie, I would recommend waiting until it is out on DVD and renting it as it is certainly not worth paying the money to see it in theaters.",The Last Airbender
1068,benavides96,Better then the credit it's given!,8,2 July 2010,"To be honest, this movie was pretty great, it is better than what people are giving it credit for, in order to understand the movie, you have to be into it, not just giving it a bad review because you don't understand. The only thing that didn't make sense and disappointed me, was the 3D,and the way the names were pronounced. The 3D was definitely not good, so just watch it in 2D, and the names problem, well you'll understand when you see it. But otherwise the movie was awesome. It was in good relation to the TV series. I really enjoyed the movie, I hope they do make the sequels, cause' they need to do fire, and air, BUT TWO THUMBS UP, VERY GREAT MOVIE",The Last Airbender
1069,mrcortright42,Horrible,2,30 June 2010,"The movie was probably one of the worst remakes of my life. They left out 14 episodes out of 20. Haru seems to be a 4 year old boy who appears for about 2 minutes and has almost no lines. The other characters such as Suki, Bumi, Bato, and Jet are not introduced. It goes too fast. From the water tribe, Aang and his gang go straight to the imprisoned episode which combines with another episode The Waterbending Scroll, and the Air Temples are mixed up. To people who do not watch the series it could be extremely confusing. All in all, skip it. The TV show was clearly written out and planned and everything for M. Night to make it a movie, but he even butchered up an already written movie.",The Last Airbender
1070,pabstar,great preview. horrible movie,1,1 July 2010,"I have been mulling over why this movie was so horrible. At first I thought it was the acting which was never once believable. Then I thought it was the crude use of Japanese storytelling into a movie obviously intended or American children. But what it ultimately comes down to is that the screenplay was so blatantly horrible that no one could have done this movie justice. The dialogue has been written with the eloquence of gore movie and the flow of the movie is so sporadic that and undeveloped that it felt unbearably strained. I was very surprised that no one walked out of the midnight showing. The movie implies that there will be a sequel. If so, I do not think anyone who watched this movie would brave it. Overall, the movie was almost bad enough to be funny. In which case I would have enjoyed it. Was this the worst movie I ever saw? I believe that it very well may be.",The Last Airbender
1071,tamagotchi198,A boy defeated people by fear.,9,1 July 2010,"This movie was awesome, it was exciting and amazing and AH! It made my friend choke on its awesomeness! The pronunciation sucked monkey tails, but it was still awesome. The costumes were really good as well as the bending. Although, it's hard to tell genders in the earth kingdom. The props were crappy -Aang's staff was fuggin awesome! I wanted to grab the staff and go ""Yeah -this is MY staff now!"". It was a really fast movie, not that I can complain since it was a whole season of a show. I believe that Zuko was hot, but then again he has weird hair tuffs near his scar. You never really got too into the characters for how fast it was, but Sokka showed his comedy and boomerang awesomeness in his fighting. Aang was cute -I just wanted to pinch his cheeks o//o!! I liked watching this movie because, well, it was fuggin awesome! Okay I'm done, enjoy the movie or live a life not knowing what great awesomeness this terribly picked cast(besides Sokka and Aang)could show you.",The Last Airbender
1072,dome_rocker,Unfaithful,1,1 July 2010,"I really don't know where to begin with this review. I am maybe more upset that I couldn't be the first person to give this movie a review, warning people to not waste the time and money watching it. I found out this movie was going to be made a few months ago, and decided to get refreshed on the story before the release. I saw that all three season (or books), were available on an online rental website for instant streaming. I quickly fell back in love with all the characters, simple yet heartwarming story line, and well planted detail in all of the environments the characters traveled too... This movie... Which honestly was one of the biggest multimillion dollar let downs that has ever existed, had none of those things. There was no proper character development, which robbed the movie of any real emotion. Now that I think about it, it seemed like a bunch of failed movie clips where compiled together aimlessly to make the film. Now that I think about it, it is a waste of time for me to write much more. You as a reader shouldn't have to read about the multitude of fail that this movie conveyed to myself, and millions of others. However, the last thing I will leave you with its this. This movie was beyond inaccurate to such a level, that I will pray M. Night is pulled from butchering any more of this wonderful story... There had to be something special about this story, for so many people to passionately write negative reviews about the butchering of the movie. My advice... Go get a movie streaming account... Spend a couple days blasting through all three books of the last air bender... Then don't go see Shamalama-ding-dongs rendition^-^",The Last Airbender
1073,madisonvampangel,not very good,4,1 July 2010,"This movie was very disappointing to me. I have watched every episode in the cartoon series on nick. The names weren't pronounced right like it is in the show. The scenes were waaaaay different than what i have seen. When i went to watch this movie, i was hoping for something close to the show and got something totally different. When i heard about Shozen's Comet, saying that it was suppose to come back in three years, it just ruined it even more for me. When in the show it was suppose to be at the end of summer which is why Aang had to hurry and learn all four elements so quickly. In this movie there is no hurry to even learn anything, and the end fight with the Northern Water Tribe and Fire Nation, Aang was suppose to have a fish looking water thing around him while he fought with the Fire Nation. In the end he just rose the water up and then let it fall back down which was not that entertaining. Over all it was very disappointing and misleading.",The Last Airbender
1074,bzhengrockz,Truly Awful Piece of Film,1,1 July 2010,"So I will try to avoid plot summary, but I must say there wasn't much of a plot be spoil. For those familiar with the plot, there aren't many advancement. The script was poorly written with some strange lines. I do not understand how the script went through the initial phase, but it did. The effect was good, but that was the only part that's good about the film. The acting was poor, at best. If you are expecting any true martial arts, you are in for a bored. The acting was unnatural and artificial. Uncle was actually decent, but in comparison to the rest, great! But rarely can a few characters carry a bad film, and this is a prime example.In sum, I wouldn't recommend this film for fans or non-fans. For the fans, this will ruin all hopes you had going in. For the non-fans, there are no plot and it is an utter waste of your time. This might be the worst film I've seen for years, rivaled by the likes such as the Revenge of the Killer Tomatoes.",The Last Airbender
1075,D_NeverEnding,Whether you're a fan of & seen the Cartoon or not... This film just plain sucks,1,6 July 2010,"Things you might hate if you've seen the Cartoon & is a fan...The Cast, The changed name pronunciations, Noah Ringers voice as Aang, Not having enough or any of East Asian(Asian American)/Inuit actors, having to many Caucasian & Indian actors, Not seeing enough of Appa or Momo, Momo not being called Momo, Left out characters from Book 1(Avatar Roku, Kyoshi Warriors, King Bumi, Freedom Fighters etc...) the butchering of the story, The person who hired M. Night to Write, Direct, Produce & Cast this film!Things you might hate if you've haven't seen the Cartoon & wasn't a fan...The Acting, The badly done Action scenes, The 3D converted version, not being able to follow whats going on in the film, the slow motion action scenes, the story development, the character development, The person who hired M. Night to Write, Direct, Produce & Cast this film! Things you might like whether you're a fan or not...Some of the CGI(The bending, Appa, Momo) & some of the sets... that's about it.All and all this film was just horrible as an adaption and as a film on its own right, the whole film just felt rushed like he wanted to get to point A to point B with no explanation behind it, he left out key parts in Book 1 & key characters from Book 1 as well like Avatar Roku who's like the only guide to Aang in understanding the Avatar State and why the War was started etc... instead he replaced him with Roku's pet dragon Fang? who was the guide in the cartoon into finding Roku at the beginning and now can apparently talk but in the cartoon couldn't and instead used telepathic abilities to communicate with, Ozai looked the less bit intimidating and i couldn't even understand why he was even in this film when he doesn't show up till Book 3 and characters that were suppose to be in Book 1 weren't and after watching this film I really couldn't remember anything memorable about it except for how badly directed and how bad the acting was.The Cartoon itself was an amazing piece of work one of the best American made cartoons i have ever seen which involved the East Asian culture with the Four Nations, the Bending, the Kung Fu etc... so much so some people even dub it as being an Anime itself, Is Avatar an Anime no, yes, maybe, if not it's the close's American made cartoon to it which the thing i loved most about it was the ""East Asian made-like Fantasy World"" and all the East Asian based characters involved in it which sadly M. Night disregarded and instead decided to make the film a diverse cast(if you call it one) which personally i don't think a diverse cast would of made sense in the Avatar world anyway because of it being so heavily in-bodied in the East Asian culture.Its a pity, this film if done right could of been the next Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or the next Hero or House of Flying Daggers or Fearless or Iron Monkey or Yip Man 1 & 2 etc... like those films the cartoon had a different flare with the martial arts being that bending was involved in it and the film's themselves could of been one of the best trilogy's made since the Lord of the Rings i mean the story was there and frankly i don't think a 1 hour and 30 minute film would of did it(Book 1) justice anyway.If i were you i would watch the cartoon version and avoid this film at all cost matter fact i would avoid all M. Night films at all cost everything after Signs that is because before that he was great after that his films just became confusing and bad.At this point I don't know what i would be terrified of more being put in a cage having to fend off a pack of hungry lions for my survival or M. Night possibly making two more adaptations to this monstrosity.Although if you suggested i be put in a cage of a pack of hungry lions to being the only way of stopping M. Night from making two more adaptations to this monstrosity i would highly consider! that how painful this film was to watch.",The Last Airbender
1076,rodblagojevich-779-118948,Captain Planet: The Last Airbender,1,1 July 2010,"I had only seen one episode of the Avatar cartoon. Only one. From what I saw, it looked like Americans trying to get rich on making stuff look like anime. So, I went into this movie with absolutely no expectations. None-what-so-ever. And, while I expected the girls cosplaying, painting blue arrows on their head, and sticking blue masking tape on their arm to be the worst site of the night, what I saw in the movie theater made everything earlier pale in comparison.So, let me just delve into the plot. We have two characters. Both of their names are too long and ridiculous to remember; and while they're the focus of the first half of the film, they serve no plot purpose what-so-ever other than to fill time. Let's refer to them as WaterBoy and WaterGirl for the rest of this review. WaterBoy is a random teenage boy who hits things with an ice pick and despite having no actual combat experience, can beat a soldier whose been trained his whole life to fight in combat. He has a ponytail and looks like a complete dorkwad with it. Then we have his sister: Watergirl. She sucks at magic. Then, she gets better. That's the extent of her character development. But apparently because she's the only water bender from this one random tribe, she's set to accompany the most important person on Earth. That's like saying- I'm the only political scientist in Farmerville. I deserve to lead the President of the United States around by the nose.So these two geniuses run across the Last Airbender, this movie's protagonist. His name is Un(Like UN. Get it? Because he unites the nations. Like the United Nations. But not really because the United Nations doesn't actually work). And, despite the fact that he's the most important person in the world that everyone wants captured, the Water Twins decide that they, being 12 and 13, are best suited to protect him from evil. Anyway, no one knows this guy exists, save for Prince Emo Angst the Third, who hates his father. He has no other character to him except that. In fact, this is how he starts most of his conversations: ""Hello, I'm the prince. I hate my father. Nice to meet you."" So since nobody in the world knows this guy is alive and despite the huge tactical advantage that gives them over their enemy, Waterboy convinces Un to take off his robe and reveal himself to some villagers. They're rightly disturbed and the Fire Army occupying the area, despite the fact that Un hasn't killed or shown the ability to kill a single one of them, decide to run away because that's what soldiers do when they encounter their most important objective. But eventually, Un gets caught. Then Prince Emoface saves him. Then he escapes Prince Emoface. Then a bunch of junk happens and they discover Un actually sucks at magic. So, they now embark on a quest to learn how to use magic.Blah Blah Blah, he learns how to use water magic. Waterboy, despite the fact that he's got no standing, prestige, or skill as a fighter is appointed as the princess's guard. Because you know that despite the fact there are men with twenty years of combat experience in service of the nation, we're entrusting the life of a member of the royal family's care to a random stranger who just walked into town, fights with an ice pick, has no actual combat experience, looks like a dingus, could very well be a spy from the people trying to kill them, and is 13 years old. Yeah.Meanwhile, Un and Watergirl learn how to actually use magic. Then, a bunch of fire people attack. There's a giant fight. Prince Angst McCrybaby shows up and complains about his father and how he hates him some more some more. An important military general runs past the front lines of an open battlefield into enemy territory to kill a koi fish. Un summons a giant wall of water. Blah blah blah. It's over.Let's add insult to injury. While the plot sucks, the acting is even worse. It feels like I'm watching a sitcom or playing a video game. Character says something. Slight pause. Other character moves to face the other character, says something back. It's just plain awful. From the very beginning of the movie, you can tell it's going to be painful and you already paid too much. And as the movie goes on, the awful acting grows more apparent. People in this movie laughed at the serious scenes. They're just that bad.Then, we have the special effects. They're good. They're hardly 3d. Are you planning to pay the extra $3 to see it in 3d? Do yourself a favor- don't. You miss nothing. Like, the extent of the 3d is a leaf falling. That's it. Like, they'll make people standing in the foreground 3d. But, they won't make various special effects sloshed throughout the thousands of Matrix scenes that way. Why? Because this movie is terrible.Look, I could write about this movie for hours. I want to. But, I've got work in the morning. So, if you haven't gotten anything from this review, get this: Avatar iCarly with magic. I had three people that loved the cartoon series come to see this movie with me. It all hurt them on the inside. Do yourself a favor: don't see it.",The Last Airbender
1077,de-main-man,Hurk Durk don't bother,3,1 July 2010,"Spoilers :Sokka was painfully unfunny and same with Iroh. No comic relief made me not like any of the characters. They kept saying Aangs name the name like ong from ong bak instead of Aang as in angus. I Think M didn't even watch the series he just got a synopsis wright up and made the movie. I don't think anyone in the movie actually saw the series or else they would have realized how bad the movie was. Special effects were OK but hardly any of the movie and the fights were all one hit take downs or a counter then a take down. No real special moves were explored like the octopus which she learns from the scroll. The, what I would call main characters had little interaction with each other so I didn't feel like they were friends and the fire lord had a ton of screen time that was completely unnecessary and took away from the story. Like filing in plot whole to move the story on except they weren't actually plot wholes as Aang or one of the other characters already said it in the previous seen. For example: Aang "" The northern water tribe is going to get attacked because im here"" next second fire lord "" we must attack them that's where the avatar is. Stupid. Then Aang at the very end summons a giant title wave to destroy the ships he spends 2 minutes of on screen time making it rise and loom over the fire nation ships. Then he stops and calmly sets the wave down not destroying any fire nation ships. Then all the fire nation soldiers in the village stop attacking and they bow to Aang. Then there's a scene with fire lord about the commit that's coming in three years and azuza being told by the fire lord that she needs to stop Aang from mastering the other 2 elements. THE END. Im writing M tomorrow to tell him how bad this ,movie was. Also no suike or kyoshi warriors. All I wanted was one damn boomerang joke.",The Last Airbender

You have to do some forgiving, but if you just let go and enjoy the ride it is actually a great movie. It was rushed in the beginning and could have been better if the scenes were longer. But I hope we get to see the rest as I am sure they will only improve. Look how awful the first Harry Potter is!!! Same with Twilight. Yet they are still great movies that get better each time. So give it a chance and keep and open mind. Don't try to force it into a literal translation of the cartoon.

I understand that due to timing differences the story in the movie wouldn't be nearly as in-depth as the series, but they totally dropped the ball on this one. If you had never seen the animated series you would be completely lost in the lack of story within the movie. the scatter brained attempt to display the characters and introduce there stories failed miserably. I will be surprised if this movie receives enough support to substantiate the sequel. Which is another killer. They are going to string the entire story out over a 4 movie ology. It should be two movies at most, 4 is just a joke. Bottome line Epic Fail if you loved the cartoon....utterly epic fail",The Last Airbender

The movie is nothing like the Emmy award winning series. As i saw the movie i felt like asking Night Shyamalan wat Shia Lebouf asked the cop in transformers ""ARE YOU ON DRUGS"". This was clearly a directorial debacle. I think Night suffers from Mental aberrations.I knew that the only character who could have a serious role in the movie would be prince Zuko. But in this movie every character is sick and they suffer the same illness Night does, probably :). Aang seemed to be in some confusion, quatara was never babbling and what can i say about Sokka ,for all the non-sensical talk(which was amazing) he did in the series, he was totally dumb in this movie. This movie is horrible, i must keep saying this to me. The one good thing by far about the movie was its special affects. They were great.My advise to all people would be to let this one go, i know its difficult but it would save you a nightmare, for all the great series its been on Nickleodean.",The Last Airbender
1081,parrishj87,Walked out.,1,1 July 2010,"Here's the plot twist Shyamalan is known for- it sucked. I've seen every episode of the series and was absolutely giddy to see this. The good part was the CG was pretty great. An absolutely beautifully set movie. That's where all the money went. The acting and writing is that of a 90's Saturday morning made for t.v. movie. Understandably, when you turn 20 T.V. episodes into an hour and a half, it's gonna drop a lot and be rushed. A major folly for Shyamalan, worst directed movie I've ever seen. Inevitably this movie will end up on nickelodeon in 2 years, I'll wait for it to end up on USA networks in 5 before I decide to watch it in full. Don't waste more than a dollar to see this movie.",The Last Airbender
1082,xxthecatalystxx,Avatard: I'd Rather Stick My Hand in a Blender,1,1 July 2010,"Dialogue: Written by a 5 year old child. Vocabulary probably totaled MAYBE 100 different words, doubtful though. I am convinced the people who wrote this can't read.Acting: Pretty terrible. Almost every action or line seemed forced.Casting: ummm since when was every person in avatar from India? Storyline: Nothing flowed or made sense. Someone who hadn't watched the show would be lost. Characters such as Apa and Momo we're essentially cut out of the film and other important characters like Boomie and Tsuki were cut out completely. Obviously things had to be cut out but half of the key parts of the story were changed and turned into freak, hybrid blends of characters, places, and events.Tone: The whole feel of the movie is completely different from the show. Instead of having a light hearted, enjoyable, go gettum vibe like the show, the movie was just somber and emotionally dry.Directing: Shyamalan definitely never watched the Avatar series. The main characters had completely different personalities. Ang was confused, depressed, and totally stoic half the time. Saka was an able, coordinated fighter and serious the entire time. Katara was a weak, emotional girl. Also the different nations and ethnicities lacked a distinct flavor. The costumes is all that set them apart. (again this might have had something to do with most everyone being Indian) He also made a lot of detail mistakes (e.g. imprisoning earth benders in a prison made out of rock and earth) Further some unimportant parts which could have been left out entirely like rescuing the earth benders were given excessive time in relation to their importance to the story. I am convinced this was to give another race besides Indians face time. Most of all the whole movie was steered in the wrong direction and completely lacked the essence of the show. Oh and I think he purposely made a weird decision to change all the pronunciations for everything in the show which just managed to really irritate everyone throughout the film.Soundtrack: Meh. Don't really remember it being much of a factor good or bad. Can't really blame them since they didn't have much of a film to work with.Production: 3D effects were almost non existent. Colors, camera work, editing were all well done though.The one upside to the film is the special effects with bending are cool, but besides that waiting in line was my favorite part.",The Last Airbender
1083,jmc713-780-391628,"Awfultar: The last ""Night"" Blunder",1,1 July 2010,"As a huge fan of the TV series who has scene it in its entirety at least 4 times (it comes on at last four hours a day so it is very easily watched) I would say it is a disgrace to a show that was well thought out to the point where every bending style is based off a specific form of Martial arts and research on Chinese culture is done to perfect fire nation. I would not waste my time talking about how Shyamalan Never watched the show, unnecessary dialogue change , the lack f fire lord mystery, personality changes, and missing characters such as Suki Bumi and Jet.I would just like to say I should have took the hint when Shyamalan was talking about about his treasured horrible blue spirit scene and said Ong twice.For Preservation of my respect for the brilliant show I will separate this as an entirely different story. It is the story of Ong, Soakuh, and Ee-Roh. For a movie with such good potential M. Night Shyamalan really screwed this one up. I would now go as far as to say he is a bad director.He got lucky with the 6th sense and signs was OK but this was horrible. People talk about how horrible the dialogue is but it think it is worth saying there was only 3 pages worth of script 10 tops. Without Dialogue you do not have character development so you don't now any characters. And the character with the most lines just said ""secret library"" repeatedly.And plot. What plot? There was no transition and no good explanation of anything. And how do you have a montage when you are liberating people and putting up posters how do you then proceed to ask how you are being followed. And when the plan from the secret library is finally unleashed it only last 5 minutes.And of the racial character blunders I could have handled that but how are who of the main characters the only people in the south pole who are not Eskimos? The scenery and special effects were also pretty bad. If their is no script at least make the movie look cool. It wasn't poor fights hardly any bending and the coolest thing they did as make a giant wall of water that's when the fire nation realizes how bad the movie is so they turn tail and leave.Final conclusion. Don't waste you time, don't waste your money, and don't waste your life. I can say the advertising was good because it drew in a huge midnight crowed but the reviews will cancel that out I'm sure of it. I would like to tell Shaylaman to stick to clever twist but e can't even do tat right anymore.",The Last Airbender
1084,galediversion,Should never have seen the light of day,1,1 July 2010,"Very much a spoiler, but since my review is cheaper and worth it, I would just read my review.""Maybe I'll see it because it will be so bad it's funny!""!DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!That was precisely the reason I went to see this movie and I swear to you: There is no satisfaction in making fun of it. It's almost offensive how bad this movie really was. Even if you're not an ""Avatar"" fan there are aspects of the movie that were lacking.For the non-fan:The characters were bland. There is not much to say for the script but even ""We have to go after him"" can be said with more feeling. The actors didn't seem comfortable around each other at all and even Sokka & Katara seem like they'd just met a couple days before Aang appeared. Zuko's rocky relationship with his father doesn't seem to have any grounds whatsoever because his father appears to CARE for him despite burning his face, banishing him and pretty much sentencing him to death. I haven't even begun to say anything about how inaccurate they were!The story was choppy and the cinematography was atrocious! Jeez- Louise! Some of the first words out of my mouth during the movie were ""Who let the r****d handle the camera?"" Angles most professionals wouldn't even consider appeared in the movie and couldn't even be redeemed by a good story. It skips from scene to scene, not explaining HOW the gang got to any location or what struggles they might have faced to develop character. the non-fan would be entirely lost--""The Southern Air Temple? What and where is that?"", Northern Water Tribe? Earth Kingdom? if you don't already have that cartoon map imprinted in your brain you have no idea that it usually takes characters WEEKS to get from one of those places to the other! Weeks where the characters should have gotten closer, warmer and easier to relate to. At no point in time did I feel like rooting for any one character. Not for Aang to save the world, Zuko to kill Aang and end my misery or even princess Yue and Sokka's sudden and unexplained love-connection. I can definitely say that instead of trying to cram nothing useful into an hour and a half. Shyamallama could have at least crammed some character development into a nice three-hour film.For the AVATARDS:(Trying sincerely to avoid complaining about all the important scenes and characters that were cut from the movie to make room for useless s***)Are you like me? Did you notice little nit-picky details? For some, it's hard to focus on the little things when such humongous problems are shoved in your face. For me? Easy as cake. Just to name a few of the small nit-picky things that bothered me:Her name is Gran-Gran, not GRANDMA. Appa is ugly--who designed him?! Monk Iazo is black...? (Okay this doesn't bother me so much as... There aren't ANY other black people in the movie) Zuko's scar looks more like he had trouble taking off red clown make-up. The earth-benders are contained.... ON TOP OF EARTH (one of those moments where you're like ""O_O .... excuse me, WTF are you doing?"") Sokka was not funny. In fact he was ugly and pale looking. Why did someone think a Twilight actor could be this funny-man? No Roku? No Face-Stealer? The fish seem entirely useless in the movie when they're actually key to a pivotal moment in the series. Oh, and Appa is uglyThere was definitely more but that's what first comes to mind (the experience was so traumatizing that this morning I could tell my mind had tried to suppress it)It took, like, 5 minutes to bend anything. Everyone basically preformed a musical before any bending occurred. Seriously, every time Aang started ""bending"" I was waiting for Ozai or Xiao to shank him from behind. They wouldn't have to try very hard to get to him because the effects people made it very clear that soldiers could get right next to Aang before his powers took any effect. The bending looked STUPID. I was trying to avoid saying anything but it DID. In the cartoon, each movement of the body corresponded with a movement of the element. They didn't have to preform complex Tai Chi before the water even thought about rising. I don't know if this was an attempt to make bending seem like it honestly took forever to learn, but it just made every look like they were struggling to use the slightest power (Oh by the way, only Iroh can create fire? DUMB. The Firebenders are so INTIMIDATING because they can use fire where ever and whenever they want)!Aang is supposed to be a powerful bender, but his wind attacks don't pack any of the oomph they did in the series making him seem very very weak. He is also eager to redeem himself as the Avatar and learn the elements so he can save people but Noah Ringer just seemedwhiney and frustrated all the time. Plus what's with all this passive-agressivism? ""The point of the Avatar is not to hurt anyone""? So you make a giant tidal wave and then let it fall because it scared them away? That is not the kick-ass Avatar that I want to save ME.My last note is probably the most irritated and repetitive problem of the whole movie.

1085,homecoming-780-550126,Horrid.,1,1 July 2010,"(This has spoilers).First of all, I just want to say that I am a HUGE fan of the show. Since the day it came out my friends and I have loved it, we have Avatar parties where we just all hang out and order Pizza and watch Avatar seasons. So we were looking forward to this movie.And if you're a fan of the original series, do not BOTHER to watch this.Anyway, we all decided to get dressed up as characters for the occasion. My favorite is Zuko, and I knew he was going to be butchered. So I wore the fire nation outfit he has in the first season and worked hard to make it exact. Accompanying me was Aang, Uncle Iroh, Appa, and a male version of Toph. At the theater we met several other Aang's, Suki was there, Jet, the Boulder, and we were all equally excited. We went to the midnight showing and waited.Big mistake.M night completely ruined it.. Everything was absolutely horrible. He completely changed up the story and didn't include important characters like Jet and Suki.. Especially Suki since she comes back. Zuko's burn is BARELY noticeable.. And anyone that watched the show knows how important his burn is, Also, he didn't have the right hair. What's going to happen when he separates from the fire nation? When he cut off his hair in the series it was to show he was separating from that. Iroh wasn't anything like the character, maybe just in wisdom, but he only drank tea one time. Sokka was serious and didn't once crack a joke or complain about being hungry.And the names were all wrong. The only people who's names they said right were Yue, Katara and Zuko. That's it. Everyone else was butchered.Momoe and Appa were in it but they were horribly done and honestly, pretty creepy.Also the bending was all wrong. When you bend the element moves with your steps. They were doing about 10-15 moves and THEN one attack would happen. That's not right at all.And, if you've watched the original series, we know Aang is given 10 months to master the elements and defeat Ozai. In the movie, Sozin's comet is THREE YEARS away. THREE YEARS. I suppose that's so he can release a movie every year.. But really? 3 Years is plenty of time.. There's no rush. And what's going to happen? Is Zuko going to become Ahng's (The way they say AANG -.-) teacher? Or will he magically figure it out somehow while Zuko dies or something?. If you're a fan of the original series, do not bother to see this movie. Seriously. It's a giant disappointment and a waste of time and money. I think i'm going to skip the other movies and just watch the cartoon series.",The Last Airbender
1086,m-edgerton,All of You Crazy Fans Need Some Prozac... Seriously,7,1 July 2010,"I went and saw the midnight showing of Avatar: The Last Airbender, and let me say this, it was a great movie. All of you idiots busting on it are only doing so because you wanted it to follow the original storyline exactly and wanted every little detail to be in place. I have news for you, no director will ever do that, they want to put their own spin and style into and they will. So my suggestion is to just go see the movie, knowing that there will be a few technical details out of place, and appreciate it for the effects and great story that it is. Not the one or two details you saw out of place, Really? You are gonna sit on here and rant and flip out over this, it is just a movie, your not gonna die so calm it down.",The Last Airbender
1087,nathantwhite,"Ovotar (Avatar), Ung (Aang), Yroh (Iroh)",1,1 July 2010,"M. Night Shyamalan simply butchered what could have been a great film. His writing was cliché, obvious, and just didn't sound like any way that anyone would talk. The complete lack of character development was despicable, the fact that a short but beautiful love story was condensed to one line of crappy dialog ""they became friends quickly"" made many people in the theater including myself let out a groaning sigh, and the fact that Aang (or ""Ung"" as the movie would say it) was not funny at all was a huge disappointment.Casting a 30 or 40 something black guy to play the role of the 75 or 80 something Asian monk was an..""interesting"" choice. Same with Uncle Iroh (or uncle ""Yroh"" as they pronounce it), a lighter skinned, somewhat shorter man with a large pronounced belly being played by a tall skinny guy with darker skin and dreads...dreads?..I mean what the hell?One of the simple things that bugged/angered me throughout the whole film, which I've mentioned, was the constant mispronunciation of names, the most important names in the story fell victim to this, such as Aang, Sokka, Iroh, and even Avatar. Too many important things were cut out, and too many important story points were unscrupulously changed.IF they make the rest of the series into live-action movies such as this, there need to be more than one movie per book, and M. Night Shyamalan needs, and I mean Needs, to be off the project all together.If you're not a big fan of the series: Save your money. If you are: Save yourself the pain.

1088,missmiss13,I really liked this movie!,8,1 July 2010,"I was not familiar with the storyline regarding this movie before I entered the movie theater with my son. I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was a great story and the actors did a great job! I cannot wait to see the sequel if there is one. I think this movie would really appeal to the teen population. As a parent, I would recommend this movie for parents of children ages 8+. It was not ""Avatar"" but had a charm all of its own. I would see it again and I rarely see a movie twice. I would also recommend this movie to my family and friends. Maybe the key for me was that I went to see the movie with no preconceived ideas concerning the script.",The Last Airbender
1089,eternalpraise07,Can I Sue M. Night Shymalan,3,1 July 2010,"When I saw the teaser trailer a year ago, I became ecstatic about the release date being a die-hard fan of the Epic animated series ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"". My only concerned was how M. Night would condense a 22-episode storyline into one movie, Figuring it would be at least two hours long. You can understand my disappointment realizing it was only an hour and a half film. The scripting was amateur and very cliché, the acting was terrible at best and there was no emotional connection. Although, some moments required a feeling of sadness, heartbreak, distress...you didn't get that feeling from the actors. The special effects were great. The world of the Last Airbender was definitely captured very well but it seemed as if M. Night spent all his money for production on the special effects then the actual movie itself.The storyline was rushed and there were a lot of missing pieces and characters that were not introduced or addressed which will unfortunately make it harder to produce the second and third films, being that those missing elements play a role in the continuing story. The script was poorly written, so its no surprise the movie was bad because everyone involved had a terrible source of inspiration. Its obvious that the writers on the cartoon were NOT involved in the process of making the movie!",The Last Airbender
1090,XkaiX,If you are a fan of the show don't go see it.,1,1 July 2010,"This movie was based off of a TV show so my question for M Night whatever his name is,is how can you mispronounce the names to such a degree that I have trouble knowing who you are talking about? How can you leave out important characters like Bumi? Or the Kiyoshi Warriors? What happened to Roku? And the cabbage guy? A lot of important people were left out or replaced like Haru. In the show he is about 18 and the movie has him as a child.Why cant the fire benders make their own fire like in the show? Micheal Bay should make the next movie. At least there would be interesting explosions to distract me from the horrible pronunciations and awkward dialogue. I didn't see the movie in 3-D so i don't know if that makes it any better. The bending was to elegant and fancy and not simple enough to look like it would be any good in an actual fight.",The Last Airbender
1091,and_you_brutus,"After much anticipation and heated controversy, M. Night. Shyamalan's portrayal of the animated Avatar: The Last Airbender finally hits the fan.",7,1 July 2010,"Airbending aficionados undoubtedly have mixed views; while being excited about the film-adaptation, they are frustrated about changes and omissions.While it's not possible to include content from all 20 Season One episodes, Shyamalan achieved this decently -- not only including some more important details to the plot of the storyline, but allowing for continuity by implying many adventures took place off-screen. While we were saddened at the absence of such characters as King Bumi and Suki of the Kyoshi Warriors, key points were displayed or insinuated, but perhaps a little too thoroughly. In fact, if one were not familiar with the events of the animated series, the movie comes on too strong at points, rapidly firing a lot of information over a short amount of time. For example, the chapter in which General Zhao captures Aang was heavily rushed. It lacked smooth transition from scene to scene, element to element. Throughout the film, the absence of smooth transitions made the characters' actions seem without cause or reason. We move to fast across the Earth Kingdom, it's difficult to get the feel of the large amount of time we are told is passing.Perhaps the biggest disappointment was the lack of characterization. Shyamalan crammed so much action and story into the film, the deeper understanding of the characters and their interrelationships was superficial. Katara and Sokka didn't really have a lot of reason to follow Aang, other than Gran-Gran's pushing them to do so. Sokka's character was especially upsetting; bereft of depth and complexity. Shyamalan wanted the film to be darker and more mature, but Sokka was simply underdeveloped and acted without real motivation or conviction. The sarcastic, energetic youth we saw in animation was far more real and easier to relate to than the drab flesh and blood on screen. Even Aang moved more for convenience of a stressed plot than internal forces driving him to fight the fire nation. We did not see his grief over his fallen nomads, conflict of a young boy thrust into a role of being the Avatar, and confusion about suddenly finding himself in a world ripped apart by 100 years of war. Instead, we were told these things existed. Throughout the movie, we are compelled to ask why these characters are doing what they are doing. We're told a lot; in fact, much of what we learn from the characters are in exposition-giving dialog rather than from expressions of the characters themselves. For example, a two-minute conversation between Iroh and Zhao sums up a great deal about the former general's past: a once proud and brilliant military general, his failings at Ba Sing Se, the death of his son Lu Ten(unnamed in the movie).In fact, the deepest character with whom we could realistically relate was Prince Zuko. We understood why he was tracking the Avatar, and we could empathize with his desire to return home. The most delineated character in the movie was the villain, which is undoubtedly the most redeeming quality of the film. Still, disappointment came with a very important detail, which could have been easily fixed: his scar. Certainly the animated series exaggerated the scar for emphasis, so the film need not make it as prominent, but we could barely see it! The scar isn't a simple cosmetic blemish: it was symbolic of the permanent emotional damage his father placed upon him. The scar (not the physical) was the whole reason Zuko pursued the Avatar. Not because the Fire Lord ordered him to, but because Zuko felt bringing Aang back to Ozai could heal the unseen wounds inflicted upon him. Zuko, as Iroh suggested, very well could have led a humble life -- a normal life. Zuko refused not for the regality, but for the chance to regain his father's love. The prominence of the scar symbolized the burning pain of humility and betrayal. It was barely noticeable in the film in the best of shots.While Avatar fans may be disappointed by significant changes in the script (a dragon spirit replaces Koh the Face Stealer, Zhao's hollow death scene), the most upsetting differences are the flat, superficial representations of the characters. Despite these shortcomings, Last Airbender was still an enjoyable film. The special effects were tasteful. They executed the ideas well enough to be understood without being overdone, which tends to be the case with fantasy genre films. The Fire Nation naval ships were especially impressive, as was the firebending itself. Shaun Toub carried the film much of the time, portraying a surprisingly convincing Iroh, albeit different from the Iroh in the animated series. Aasif Mandvi's weaselly Zhao disgusted us more than his drawn counterpart, whom we merely disliked. While we anxiously await Book II: Earth, we can only hope Shyamalan develops our characters better as he finishes the story.",The Last Airbender

We will continue to watch the cartoons as long as they are on Nick Toons. That being said we also loved watching the movie. Yes the name change of Ong or whatever is stupid, but overall the kids and I had a great time! It helped that we know the characters so well. I don't know why I didn't hear is was only the first book (focus on water). Dev Patel was the best as well as the guy who played Uncle. The kids left the theater convinced they could water bend and it made a great excuse to have a water fight. People just enjoy the movie and give M. Night a break.

1093,SparkyCatFox,Good if you aren't expecting the impossible.,8,1 July 2010,"Two years ago I heard that Avatar: The Last Airbender was being made into a live action movie. Years have passed and I patiently waited, and I honestly believe that the wait was worth it. Of all of the adaptions I have seen, this has by far been the best. There are a few problems I have had with the film, but most of those reasons are justified.First of all, there are a few changes from the series, such as name pronunciation, but I forgive these because I believe that the changes he makes, actually make sense. If it's culture based, why shouldn't the names? I can live just fine with Aang sounding like Ah-ng.The acting wasn't the best in some situations, but I'm not going to be harsh on that, since it is some of these actors' first time on screen. However, the material that was left in this film was just enough for us to understand the basic story and not drag us away to a bunch of sub plots.It really felt like M. Night was taking what morals were learned in Book 3 of the Avatar series (that we all were confused about) and put them in the first book so that things will make sense later. (Those who've watched the series should know what I mean.) All in all, I have to say that this adaption was much better than most adaptions I have seen before. From the tampered Percy Jackson, to the destroyed Dragonball Evolution, we finally have something that I've been looking for in an adaption for years. Things taken directly from the source material.",The Last Airbender

Names are pronounced weird, scenes are mixed around and a lot of vital pieces are completely gone. They rushed the entire plot-line and the time-line is completely whack. The effects were terrible, it took WAY too long for the benders to actually bend their elements (i.e. it takes 5 or 6 earth benders to move one rock and with multiple movement for one piece), fire benders can't create fire at a whim, they have to use fire close to them or around them.It was a waste of money, and a waste of time, and I would definitely advise against seeing this movie.",The Last Airbender
1095,Iainfrisken,"Made me sad, lost faith in film",1,1 July 2010,"After months of waiting for this movie and planning my week around seeing it I knew within the first 5 minutes that the film would be absolutely nothing like the animated series that I love. I was disappointed by this as me and my friends had so many times recently played director and cut the first season so that it would fit a two hour film window without leaving strange holes or leaving anyone in the theatre out. We were all naive. Apparently the best way to do a live action adaptation is to watch the series at 10x speed to get a feel for it then just do whatever you want. None of the dialogue made it into the movie. Zero. Not a single character was recognizable. The bending was nothing like the series, it was a goofy looking dance. At one point they had a formation of a dozen earthbenders doing some kind of line dance to move a small rock. Everyone who was in anyway responsible for selling the rights to this movie to these hacks should be deeply ashamed.All of that fanboy nerd rage aside; this was a terrible terrible movie. The acting was wooden and forced. Not that that is very surprising given the abysmal script. I haven't roll my eyes during dialogue so much since star wars ep 2. Special effects were nowhere near good enough or often enough to begin to hide how awful the movie was. I want my 2 hours back. I will never again watch a movie by the director ever. tl:dr - fanboy side I'm disgusted and hurt. movie fan side - I feel robbed my 13 buck and I won't fall for it again.",The Last Airbender

Unfortunately he was completely serious. Visually the movie is great. That's where it ends. The writing was so simplistic and terrible that I was personally offended. The acting was just south of god awful and the storyline was non-existent. The acting was phoned in by every actor on screen and I felt myself laughing at moments I knew were not meant to be funny. And I understand using pauses for dramatic effect, but there was way too many and they were just awkwardly long, it made me fell like the actors forgot their lines and they said screw it when it came time to edit. After train-wrecks like Lady in the Water, The Village, and The Happening who is the idiot that keeps green lighting his films?! Why did nickelodeon waste its time and resources on a terrible director like this? This had the potential to be THE summer blockbuster but instead it was the single worst movie I've seen Nickolodeon put their name one (and let's remember, I grew up on movies like Good Burger) and besides The Happening, this was M. Night's biggest insult to movie lovers.There is gonna be at least 2 more installments to this disappointing series and if they hope to salvage anything, they need a new director and an acting coach.M.

You need to cut some, change a part here, and condense the show down. Just to let you everyone one know that the credits start with ""Written, Produced, and Directed by M. Night Shyamalan."" This could have been a great movie if they took out the M. Night Shyamalan part. Please do not waste your money on this movie. Do not give Shyamalan any of your money. And if you do have to see it, don't see it in 3D. There are maybe two parts of the movie that really use 3D. The rest was just a way for Shyamalan to try and make more money off of us.

I expected to see Earth, Air, Water, and Fire bending, that's exactly what I got. Trying to fit 10hrs of a season in two hours of a movie is difficult. People are never satisfied. If a movie is based from a novel, people are angry because all info is not included in the movie. The same here. Why do people think it's possible? Sure the acting isn't Oscar nominated acting, but the story line is there. The special effects are amazing. The casting was great. Everyone portrayed the characters from the series. People forget, when a movie comes out, especially in a trilogy, the first movie is the hardest because of the introductions of the characters to people who aren't fans. The second movie will give the opportunities to go deeper in the stories of these characters. Overall, this movie is very, very enjoyable, and entertaining.

1101,WquinnC,Not as bad as it could've been.,7,1 July 2010,"This is my first review so wish me luck.OK. Before saying anything, let me say that I am a HUGE fan of the show. I've been hooked and amazed since the first episode and have been waiting for this movie since it was announced.I've been reading a lot of reviews for this movie, and, well, they haven't been...good. And believe me, I completely understand everything that has been said about it. Yes, there were a million things wrong about the movie. I absolutely hated the changed pronunciations of the name. The 3D wasn't as good as it potentially could've. It didn't flow nearly as smoothly as it could've. But I think it could've turned out worse than it did.First, I think it did a good job of capturing the essence of the show. I think that more character development should've taken place in the movie. It seemed like Zuko had the most out of any character. Aang seemed way too serious. The only time he seemed like he did in the show was when the group was at the Southern Air Temple and Aang was telling Sokka and Katara about his friends and such.Second, and quite possibly my favorite part of the movie, the soundtrack was the most amazing movie soundtracks I've heard in a LONG time. It gave me chills at times and just seemed epic.Third, I thought the casting was great. A lot of people are calling M. Night racist for casting white people as Sokka and Katara and darker skinned people as the main antagonists in the movie. I think this is stupid, as M. Night himself is dark skinned and Zuko and Iroh turn out to be good guys anyway! I also thought the CGI was pretty cool and I liked that M. Night made less experienced firebenders have to use outside sources of fire to bend, so it kinda evened the playing field.However, the movie did not run smoothly whatsoever. I felt like the script was poorly written and therefore the actors couldn't do much with their abilities. I could tell they were trying but it just didn't work.So, in conclusion, I think it was OK for a 1 & 1/2 hour adaptation of around 8 hours of cartoon, despite a choppy structure, underused 3D, and a poorly written script. I give it a 6/10.",The Last Airbender

The acting in this movie was terrible. And that's an understatement. None of the characters had any emotion and none of them were developed at all. The dialog, which there was very little of, was monotonous and stupid. None of the characters came even close to having any good lines. In addition to that, the whole movie felt like 30 second excerpts pasted together. The scenes were scattered and confusing. Even with my familiarity with the series, I was lost almost the whole time. Characters names, ages, and personalities were changed for no reason (M. Night says he changed the names so they were said like real Asian names, but it's just garbage), which resulted in me feeling annoyed whenever someone said someone else's name. Also, vital characters like Suki, Avatar Roku, and Bumi were completely left out. and the ending climax... Well, there wasn't one.On a brighter note, the scenery was excellent, especially the Northern Water Tribe city. and the special effects were so-so.

This movie did not do the story line justice. Where the actors should have been clearly Asian they were either white or Indian. Nickelodeon decision makers should have picked another director anyone but Shyamalan. I don't think I will be watching the other movies if Shaymalan is the director. I agree with the critics in saying that this will be the summer's biggest flop. This films budget should have been written off as a bad debt and re-filmed under new direction.

1104,steve-clay-wilson,What rational fan could rate this well,1,1 July 2010,"I don't track directors, yet, at the end of the Avatar box set M.Night Shyamalan's promised to follow the spirit of the series. What happened? Where did these characters come from? I could have done better casting from a high school and a shopping mall (and I am half-blind). Also, he deleted all kinds of material that could have easily been included (at minimal cost) Even the mention of the 'spirit world' at the beginning was betrayed at the end when Princess Yue ascended as a moon spirit. No, he just let her drown in the spirit pond and let the others drag her, now dark-haired, body out for Sokka to weep over. Talk about totally missing the whole mystical point of the series.Additionally, having Prince Zuko give up the chase and join the team in Book 1 (as well as Fire Nation forces) screws up a number of story lines. Where did the Avatar not being able to have a family come? The previous Avatar was Fire Nation and married. Mr. Shyamalan apparently just decided he wanted to rewrite Avatar - The Last Airbender and now fans do not recognize what is going on. I would recommend the original series trashing this movie and starting over with a more faithful director. In any event, DO NOT let this man touch the sequel (and yes there needs to be one just to get the taste of this one out of my mouth)!!!

1108,steveaguilar,The disappointment was greater than I expected,2,1 July 2010,"When I learned that M. Night Shyamalan was going to direct this movie, I knew it was a mistake. I'm sure the Nick peeps thought a big name would benefit the movie, but it hurt it dramatically. From The Lady In The Water, it was apparent that when Shyamalan gets an idea, no matter how bad it is, he will stick with it. It was incredibly selfish of him to change to pronunciation of names of some key characters(primarily Aang's). I don't care about authenticity to the origin's of the names; I care about the movie being true to the greatest cartoon I've ever seen! And it simply wasn't. Now I recognize that it was a paramount challenge to consolidate Book One into a movie, but they simple rushed too much. They didn't develop the characters at all: no fun-loving Aang, no slap-stick Sokka, no determined Katara. And where was Suki? Bumi? Jong Jong? The mechanist? The Duke and Pipsqueak? Jun? Why was Haru a little girl-looking kid? Why was Uncle Iroh so skinny?!? Did any of these people watch the cartoon? Fire Lord Ozai's face should not have been seen, just like in the cartoon. That was one of the great mysteries of the cartoon for the first two seasons. Shyamalan completely failed to capture the charm of the show.I will say this, though, I hope they do make a Book 2 and Book 3. They have certainly set the bar so low, that anything has to be better than this. But please, please, please, do not let Shyamalan be involved in them. Correct the name pronunciations - I can forgive the inconsistency of the first movie if it means improving the film-adaptation of the show. Get someone like Michael Bay or Brian Singer. Or the dude that directed the Rush Hour movies; he was able to mix humor and action.I did like that the nations kinda sorta had their own ethnicity (except Monk Gyatso didn't really fit). I was so tired of people whining and complaining about the casting, but at least the cast could have made some effort at good acting. I think they should have let Jackson Rathbone have more interesting lines, they definitely underutilized one of the few recognizable faces.This really was bad. It is so unfortunate. I really wanted this to be a good movie. This is a sad day.",The Last Airbender
1109,sean-neigel,waste of money,3,1 July 2010,"it was completely butchered. the primary storyline was there, but the details and how they were carried out were a complete mess. Ang and a few other main characters had their names mispronounced. all the main sequences that added to the plot were missing, like going to omashu and kyoshi island was not an island, when ang was attacked and where were completely wrong, and about most every detail was butchered about the characters and plot. the scenery was breathtaking and amazing with the level of detail being spectacular, but that doesn't excuse them from representing the anime in the way that they did. and in the end, ""Written directed and produced by m night shyamalan"" he didn't give any credit to the anime that he based it off of either. it was a disgrace of a movie and should never have been made",The Last Airbender

Really? 3. Ang is a happy kid. Saca is a witty jokester, not Jasper Cullen. Movie Katara does not fit the cartoon Katara. 4. where was the fighting? the action? the slow motion was not working for me. mad important fights were missing. this movie sucked. the most disappointing thing i've ever seen. m knight s***head should not make movies anymore. period. a movie of avatar had enough potential to be the movie of the summer & he ruined avatar for the entire country. who said he could direct this? nickelodeon should sue him. whose idea was it to replace Avatar Ang/Ocean Spirit with a giant wave? are you alright? have you ever watched the cartoon? wow. this movie might have been almost disgusting. i hope it gets taken off screen out of the movies & burned with Avatars dignity. thanks for robbing it. thanks for nothing. thanks for the disappointment, loss of 15$ & 2 hours of my life. pure disgrace. give up. sheesh.",The Last Airbender
1111,csinglehurst10,Did anyone who created this movie actually watch it?,1,2 July 2010,"Did anyone who created this movie actually watch the series? M. Night Shyamalan really needs to put the writer's pen down, and back away from the movie sets. Going into ""The Last Airbender"" (already butchered in my opinion when lacking the 'Avatar') I was saying to myself, ""this will make or break him, yes the preview showed a few flaws but hey, it has potential,"" but NO. He had to go and make the errors that are easiest to avoid, mis- pronouncing two main characters' names, not calling one by her real name, (ahem, Grandma? ), and making Uncle skinny. In addition to the audio errors, he decided to not give each character their characteristic facial hair, a very key point to what makes each character themselves. ""Superficial"" qualities aside, Shyamalan, being the writer, producer AND director of this insult to the Avatar world, seemed to feel that the bending of the four elements was less important than this physical battling the soldiers of the fire nation and their prey were engaged in. When I wasn't laughing at the over-sized water tribe members banging their sticks on the ice, or the blue spirit half heartedly kicking a fire nation soldier in the background of Aang's, oh wait I mean Ong's, close up, the earth and fire bending was utterly pathetic. the rock walls rose as if they were waking up from the earth and not quite ready to face the fire, the fire had to be bent from existing fire, and was hardly ever used. And Aa - Ong's ""airbending"" was made to look more like he was using a faulty vacuum cleaner which was randomly spewing inconsequential dust at his foes. The water bending was alright, after they went through the twenty different tai chi steps to coax it out of its source. But overall Shyamalan seemed to be capable of overlooking the fact that it was called the last airbender, not the last air fist fighter. Anyone who has actually followed the series would know a few major things about entering and being the liaison between the spirit world and the avatar world, and a few things about Aang's past, and Aang's destiny. For starters, when he leaves his body, if it's not where he left it, he can't come back, so sorry epic Zuko battle scene but that would NOT have happened. Then there's Aang's past life, sorry dragon spirit, but Aang, being the avatar, will fight and will kill people if it is necessary to return harmony to the four nations, so says avatar Kyoshi in season three. As an air nomad monk, he was taught to never harm anyone or anything, so dragon, you are wrong!After the major plot flaws, Shyamalan could have easily had a epic ending to make up for his brain-hurting project, not ending with Aang's blue koi spirit monster was just unacceptable. With a 150 million dollar budget, you would think he would be able to get that right, it's a huge glowy thing that messes up the fire nation, but no Aang just sort of plays with the huge wall of water, then releases it and the boats are a bit stirred up? What on earth did that do? M. Night Shyamalan had this one chance to regain his pride after releasing the movie that created the mockery statement, ""it's the trees!"" And he blew it. Taking a beloved classic, and butchering it into a overly dramatic, incorrectly scripted, overpriced movie had better be the straw that breaks Nickelodeon's back because if they are going to make two more ""The Last Airbender""'s, they need to find someone with enough tact to respect and uphold their writers' intentions and not destroy the hopes of children everywhere. This movie had potential to be awesome, but was ruined by the choice in director. Let's hope it gets better in the future.",The Last Airbender

1113,darrell-hon,A Poor Copy and an Artless Sham,1,2 July 2010,"First let me say that I do not recommend this film, especially to fans of the animated series it was based upon.""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" was a brave venture to take themes of both anime and American cartoons, elements of Asian mythology and culture, and a strong political message bravely displayed in a universal theme.Watch the cartoon series and you can see clearly that there is a powerful and clear message about the plight of Tibet at the hands of expansionist China. Aang and the concept of a child Avatar chosen among mountain faring monks is a clear analogue to the story of the Dalai Lama, especially with the ensuing massacre of his people by a nation that is culturally similar to the Chinese.The live action film adaptation however is a cowardly pandering for the sake of access to more market exposure. By gutting the art, humanity, and humor from the story, and by altering the racial profiles of all participants, the film is effectively self censored enough to be aired in Communist China without fear of being banned.The Chinese based Fire nation are now Indian, and all references to their culture and customs have been gutted and their characters made generic enough to make the shoe fit, about as well as a shoe fits on a toeless foot.The Tibetan analogue Air nomads are now a mixture of several races so that their massacre can no longer be referred to as an act of genocide, thereby removing any notion of racial guilt.Then there's the fact that the Earth nation is overlooked completely, which is sad. As the only other Chinese analogue, they gave a balanced racial view to the series. Nevermind the Native-American/First-Nation/Mongoloid appearance of the Water tribes being replaced with generic white people. Oh, and don't use the blue eye excuse, there are tribes in East Asia of such indigenous peoples that have blue eyes, so go get an education, M. Knight.This blatant form of self censorship is how all artists sell out and their work becomes a product for sale and no longer qualifies as art. M. Knight Shyamalan used to be an artist. This film clearly shows that he no longer is.",The Last Airbender
1114,stephanib2009,This movie SUCKED!,1,2 July 2010,"First off... Did M. Night Shyamalan even watch the Avatar series on TV? Or take a glance at it? Also, Dante Basco, the original voice actor said that he would be interested in playing Zuko, but they made the cast predominantly white. The show was based in Asia, how do you screw that up? It was White people, Arabic people, and Hispanics.. Now, there is nothing wrong with any of those ethnicities (I'm white) but, none of them looked Asian. If you have seen the series, you'll hate it, if you haven't seen the series, the lack of plot line and the anti-climatic story will make you hate it even more: seeing as how you won't understand what you just watched for almost 2 hours.This movie was horrible. Don't waste your time. M. Night Shyamalan re- wrote the movie, it wasn't even funny... it's a waste of time.I hope he paid the actors well, because they had to do a really crappy job for him.",The Last Airbender

It just failed, and it ruined my children's innocence. I want to paint a picture as to how bad this movie was, My 10 year old got me to watch, DVR and purchase all of the Avatar Cartoon series, and I got into it with him. So in January over the Super Bowl the trailer came on for the movie, since then my Son has been waiting for this, and I mean the boy has been feening to see this movie. So he had a smile from ear to ear upon entering the movie. 94 min later my son came out a different person... He was border line crying because the movie was not close to the same as the cartoon.

That being said, I took two six year old boys to see this movie and they loved it. It did not have too many slow parts and kept the kids interested. As an adult, the film did lack something and that was acting which the director is definitely to be blamed. If the lines don't work or sound cheesy he is the one to fix it during production. I understood the the story line from the movie without having any prior knowledge. It is by far not the worst movie that I have seen and would hate to not see the continuation of the story on the big screen. I believe that it should have been longer and filled in more of the history but we are dealing with the attention span of children. It would have been nice if the director had chosen to cater to a wider aged audience. I believe the failure for most people is going to be that it was designed for younger people, much like Ben10 Alien Swarm.",The Last Airbender
1117,josephvozniak,This movie is not that bad!,5,2 July 2010,"The movie definitely won't win any awards, (except maybe for the CGI) but it definitely is not as bad as the reviews that it has been getting. Yes, all of the child actors are pretty bad, although Noah Ringer sometimes does a pretty good job as Aang, especially in the action scenes. As for the more experienced actors, I thought Dev Patel and Shaun Toub did a very good job portraying Zuko and Iroh. Although the movie's story is slightly different than the cartoon's, fans should see many familiar places and events remade beautifully and realistically. Maybe it was because I have seen every episode of the show, but I always knew what was going on. I guess I could see how people who are unfamiliar with the series could be confused at times, though. The film seems like its been hacked into pieces and reassembled, only giving you an abridged plot line. The movie was definitely cut to fit time lines, which really hurt it. The original, unedited script was probably pretty good, but, in an interview with M. Night and DiMartino, they said it would have made a seven hour long movie.Those are my only critiques of the movie. The rest was rather good. The action was great, if a bit sparse. I would love to see more of it. The CGI was beautiful, some of the best I had ever seen at times (Although, I did not see it in 3D). Art direction was superb; the world is absolutely beautiful. I hope that this movie makes tons of money so that the sequels can be made. I believe that with a few tweaks, more experience for the cast, and a better written script, the sequels could be great. M.

It should be noted that I never watched the original series, so I'm not upset over plot inaccuracies/name mispronunciations. I'm just upset because it was a terrible, terrible waste of my money.Story was poorly executed. The idea itself doesn't seem so terrible but it bounces around so much with everything feeling trivial and half explained. Acting was worse than I ever thought possible. The dialogue was delivered without any emotion. All the scenes meant to make you feel fail completely. For instance when the princess chick decides to sacrifice herself for a fish or whatever. I couldn't care less. Weak characters all around.Action scenes were hardly awe inspiring, which is a shame because after the first fifteen minutes when I realized this would be a stinker I figured I'd at least get THAT much.

I'm not particularly a fan of anime and have only seen the first three episodes of the show but was able to follow the story line very well. I also thought the computer graphics were some of the best I've ever seen. And the scenery that was created for this movie were not only appropriate to the storyline, but visually stunning. I must not have been the only one who liked it because when we left the theater everyone was clapping and cheering! I have a feeling that if you are a die hard fan of the show, then you might disappointed by the cuts they had to make in the storyline...but, hey, how else were they going to shrink the whole first book (season) down to an hour and 45 minutes. I think that Shyamalan did an excellent job of reducing that huge amount of material down to a regular length movie. I also think that most people (by far) have never even heard of the original show, and he did a good job of introducing this material to them. I very much hope this movie does well enough so that he can make a movie out of books two and three. Perhaps if he does he could make them a little longer so that he could cover more of the original material. I hope other people will give this one a chance, it deserves a lot more credit then it was given by the critics.

First off they had a director who hasn't made a decent movie in a decade, also for being as poorly cast as it was and having the cheap second rate 3D it was an excellent movie. Many people have criticized the effects but i thought they were good and matched how they looked in the cartoon pretty well. I'm sure if this movie had the same team that did an effects driven film such as Transformers or Avatar it would have been breathtaking instead of just really cool. What is this world coming to that everyone thinks they have to pick out all the bad things in a movie and can't just enjoy the good parts. I've heard many people criticize the casting, saying it was all white, that didn't bother me, what bothered me was that the fire benders, who are the bad guys, looked Arabian, which I thought was racist. Why is it that the stereotype of Arabian people is that they are all terrorists? I have a few close friends who are Arabian, to have that stereotype exploited in the movie of a TV show I love made me very angry!

When i started read on these horrible reviews I was heart broken, but when i saw the movie i was blown away. It has stunning visuals and awesome CGI. The bending was great and the martial arts was awesome. Honestly, I have been hyping myself up for this movie for the last couple of weeks, I must have watched every episode 20 times. Although there are some minor changes like names and people and plot points dropped you have to understand that this movie was like 100 minutes its hard to jam 20 half hour episodes into that time period. The actors were sometimes a little dry but they are young and inexperienced. I thought Noah Ringer did a good job for his first movie. A major point was the script which is not just M. Night's fault its the creators of the animated series that helped him right the script. It was sketchy at points but through out the film it got better and at the end i started crying because i thought to myself wow this is great for what M. Night had to do. So go into this movie with an open mind its an adaption so parts had to be cut and shifted, but i believe if you are a true fan you will see it like I do, and see the great story, of Aang and Katara that we grew up with.

We were wrong... incredibly wrong... First things first, why would they change the pronunciation of the names, i honestly don't think they should've done that. Also, its Asian BASED!!!! who casted these characters... i mean Aang is fine, 'cause lets face it he does look like the cartoon character, and Sokka, well us girls can't complain 'cause Jackson is hot!... Katara is pretty and we OK'd her... BUT... Dev Patel as ZUKO?!?! really?!?! why would they do that... Shaun Toub as uncle Iroh, he's Iranian (a great actor but he's not uncle Iroh)... Aasif Mandvi as Admiral Zhao who is Indian, and then you have Fire Lord Ozai... i mean honestly they could've at least tried to make it seem like they were basing the characters from the cartoon. They missed a wonderful opportunity to have a box office SMASH!!! IF they decided to make a sequel they would have to make some major MAJOR changes... starting with the writer and director... he may have hit it big time with the Six Sense but honestly that was YEARS ago... he doesn't understand that the fans of the series would expect a very large movie, respecting the original series.

Katara - I think I can relate Katara from the cartoon to the film so it was not too bad Ang/Aang - He was a little too angry and confused compared to a jolly and jun loving little kid in the cartoon so that was a little off. On the whole the storyline was messed up and the dialogue delivery was pretty bad. The action in this film could have touched the intensity of ""matrix"" had Shyamalan paid more attention to it. The action and the fight scenes were very slow and lame. The bending was also unbelievable. One question that I keep asking my self is that how can a director take an insanely good story with a very famous video interpretation of that story and still not manage to make a decent movie?

1128,smileyca05,Massive Disappointment,2,2 July 2010,"When I first saw the trailers for this movie, I could not have been more excited. As a huge fan of the show, the fact that they were making a live-action movie of The Last Airbender thrilled me. Although hesitant about the prospect of having M. Night Shaymalan direct the film, I decided after a few trailers that this had potential to be M. Night's saving grace.I unfortunately could not have been more incorrect. I do not blame the actors for the dismal portrayal of my favorite cartoon, I blame the lack of decent writing on the script and screenplay, not to mention Shyamalan's horrific sense of camera angles and their uses. Overdone scenes of close-ups gave the film a corny feel. But worst of all, Shyamalan didn't allow his talented group of young actors to act. The plot was rushed and gave absolutely no chance for character development. He drastically altered the characters and skipped over several main points of the first season. A much better choice would have been to give the job to a real director who knows something of character and story development, not a washed up hack who has been riding the success of The Sixth Sense since its release. Attempting to squeeze an entire season of an intricately worked series into an hour and a half long film cannot work when you cannot write well enough to adapt a screenplay. In addition, the casting for Sokka couldn't have been more off. Jackson Rathbone is a pretty strong actor (as shown in his Sundance film ""Dread""), but Sokka is a comic relief character. He would have been much better suited to the character of Zuko, although Dev Patel carried Zuko incredibly well.Overall, this film disappointed me greatly. I saw the potential that the film had with its talented cast of youngbloods and its strong veteran actors in the background, but the script writing and directing of M. Night Shyamalan once again dropped the ball on an incredible chance.",The Last Airbender
1129,beautiful_falling_stars,It's not as bad as you think.,8,2 July 2010,"Alright. I went and saw this movie yesterday, and while I raised an eyebrow at it for a little while I still had an open mind. Yes I know the pronunciation of the names was a little different from the t.v series. And trust me I am a major fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender. But while there are some questionable things with this movie, it really was a pretty good movie. I enjoyed it thoroughly. The only things I would have really wanted to see more of was more little pieces in the story. They could have made the movie longer and added the Kyoshi warriors and The Gang (Aang, Sokka, and Katara) meeting them. I think that would have added more into the film. But as I said before it really was not as bad as people think. You have to go into the movie with an open mind. How many times have film makers made a film about a book or a video game or a television series and it's been way more different than what was actually originally created????? I would just encourage open minds! I loved the movie. It's great to see it in life real action. And I think after I thought about it after the movie the casting for the characters was right on target. I think every one of them were. Sure the acting was a bit elementary for some of the characters, but it's going off of a television series anime/cartoon. I think they all did well with what they had. Although I do think Aang and Sokka could have had some funny lines in there somewhere. But it's a great movie and I'd recommend going to see it! The bending looks awesome and I'm sure they spent a lot of time getting the techniques down! Those techniques can't be very easy getting them from Martial Arts. Just take a chance go see the movie and reevaluate it in your head. And the music won't disappoint you!!",The Last Airbender
1130,DGKnipfer,"Crouching Actors, Hidden Script",1,2 July 2010,"Worst movie adaptation ever!!! They took a very clever and well made kids cartoon and dumbed down the dialog into stilted, chopped up word mash. Worse, Shyamalan spent $150 million dollars on effects so you could watch all the fight scenes in slow motion and the bending scenes look poorly animated. It actually looks like the Firebender army stands around posed and waits for the pull line to yank them back.They couldn't even pronounce the names of characters from the cartoon correctly. Has Shyamalan actually see the cartoon? I doubt it. No comic relief, no child like joy, no tempo, no fear of any character getting hurt, no suspense, and way too much important story information glossed over in the rush to reach the end of the film. People unfamiliar with the source material walked out of the theater shaking their heads and wondering why they wasted their money. The only reason I'm giving this movie a 1 out of 10 is because we can't give it a zero.",The Last Airbender

I have never waited for a movie to come out like I've waited for this one... ONE YEAR! the first time I've heard that they are making this movie I was so excited and happy... As July 2010, gets closer I get so excited and was eager to see it. Today, July 2nd... I took a day off work to see this movie... I am now heartbroken and very very sad as I am reading the reviews...I hate M. Night Shyamalan! I will never ever watch any of his past and future movies!!! I think I'm just going to watch my DVD collection now...",The Last Airbender
1132,lightaric,M. Night Shyamalan what is wrong with you!!!,1,2 July 2010,"I specifically created an account here just to warn the general public and those who enjoy the show Avatar: The Last Airbender to ABSOLUTELY NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.I loved the show that Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko put such hard work and creativity into. The characters were memorable, the world, it's cultures, and story line were amazing. In the end it was all butchered in front of my eyes in 3D! Every second watching that movie was painful and assaulting to the eyes.For the sake of comparison I'm making a list of everything that was wrong with this movie.1. Shyamalan, why are you having actors talk like they are reading from cards. Where is the emotion and realism? and why are the characters so different from the show what the heck!!!2. Why is there an age difference in characters from the show and movie? Why does the acting suck?3. I understand you were trying to incorporate different cultures into the movie but seriously none of the cultures match up. In the show the Fire Nation look more Japanese, The Earthbenders more Chinese, the Water Tribes are more like Eskimo/Inuit, and Airbenders are similar to white Buddist monks. Getting everyone together is cool but in this case it was a blow to the movie.4. That was the worst use of CGI I have ever seen. The 3D doesn't look like 3D. The commercials were for show, which is bull.The bending looked cool but there wasn't enough of it.5. Firebenders do not need fire to bend dear God! If that was the case then every other bender could have put out the fire and that would have been the end of the fight!6. Tai-Chi, Hung Gar, Ba Gua and Northern Shaolin are martial arts. NOT swirling and spinning your arms aimlessly! Dancing and doing tricks is not martial arts! 7. Jumping from one scene to another is crappy storytelling. Skipping important fights and scenes from the show is just lazy.8. Every fighting movement was bending, there was very little physical contact in the show. I expected more bending because the story revolves around it...speaking of which.9. WHY CHANGE THE STORY LINE??? IT MAKES NO SENSE THAN TO TICK OFF THOSE WHO WATCH THE SHOW!10. The only good things to come out were the occasional bending, the background environment, and Appa who looked somewhat in character.If Michael Bay or even James Cammeron directed this they would have at least had the courtesy to make this movie an entertaining and visual experience. Shyamalan if you are reading this you have made this movie fail so hard it makes me cringe just thinking about my lost $12.50 and 103 minutes of my life. You suck! Don't make another movie for a few years. For anyone wanting to seriously see this movie only go to burn time, money and make fun of how crappy the movie is. For those who love the animated show may God have mercy on your soul after seeing this.",The Last Airbender
1133,kittynyara,Unbelievably disappointed,1,2 July 2010,"This could have been Lord of the Rings epic. Instead it was an epic fail. Let's just start by saying they couldn't pronounce the characters names correctly. That's like calling Spock (sp-ah-k), Spoke (sp-oh-k). Seriously, to have gotten something as basic as that wrong is pathetic. It looked like a low budget SyFy (no offense SyFy) made for TV movie. The bending was weak at best and often off time to the character's movements. It was shocking how dumbed down the bending ability was in this movie. Some was understandable, but to dumb it down for all bending was too much. The choreography looked impromptu. The battle scenes were a mess of half hearted flailing arms. I've heard better dialog from old soap operas. The close ups were too close. So much so that I could count nose hairs. Was that really necessary? The intro looked like it was added last minute. The music track was both off time to the action in the scene and mastered so poorly that it couldn't be heard over the rattling of the theater's speakers. The whole production was no more than a mesh of selected scenes from the series that were changed, rewritten, or otherwise made shorter to speed you to the end of the movie. To top that off there was no sense of fluid transition from one story board to the next. This made it nearly impossible to follow the story line for lack of continuity. I was unfortunate enough to pay for the ""3D"" version which looked 2D most of the time. The parts that might have stood out as 3D looked like cardboard cut outs pushed forward to give the illusion of 3D. Way to take advantage of a trend to make extra money. PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! Turn around! Go back to the cartoon! Do Not Waste Your Money On This Movie! You will be unbelievably disappointed",The Last Airbender

Avatar makes a huge wave that could of killed so many fire benders, but instead let them flee for there lives and saves the Northern Water Tribe. i would recommend this movie to some one who likes Action and Spirituality.

What the hell was that all about? We didn't hate it, but we sure hope they fix silly little things like the names in book 2!!! Also,If you Try your best to over look the whole race change with the fire nation and you will enjoy the movie a whole lot more!!!

1136,mongoliankid,what the hell?,1,2 July 2010,"this should really receive a 0 out of 10 but the minimum was 1. oh my gosh where to start? -names were pronounced differently than from the series. maybe it was supposed to be the right pronunciation, but it still sounded weird. like sohka instead of sokka, and eeroh instead of iroh. -the plot was all scrambled. parts were missing like the kyoshi warriors, avatar roku wasn't even in it, THE WHOLE WATER FISH SPIRIT THING AT THE END WAS TAKEN OUT. -the actual bending was messed up too, like the actors had to do all these flips and spins just to move a tiny bit of their natural element when each movement should be able to do that. firebenders could only manipulate fire and not create it...how dumb is that? only iroh could create fire when he faced zhao(who did not have big sideburns) and he didn't even fight with it either! and sozins comet lets them create fire? heck no it makes them super powerful! -it felt really rushed. the characters had no emotion. almost like they were not acting! there was no development and the actors were not fit for their roles...well except for maybe iroh who played his character okay. but he wasn't funny :(avatar fans like me...don't waste your time with this pile up bull-poop. don't watch it.",The Last Airbender
1137,navx2810,"Shame, just pure shame.",2,2 July 2010,"First off, let me tell you the good things about the movie;1. Good fight scenes.. Sometimes. 2. Zuko and Sokka's actors did their characters right compared to the rest of the cast. 3. They did follow the story, kinda.Done! Okay, now onto the bad things;1. Shamalammanammalyn taught the actors English, NO WORD IS PRONOUNCED CORRECTLY, I can't stress this enough, it ruined the experience for me. 2. The action scene's felt slow, mainly because the actors did a two minute martial art form only to conjure a snow ball basically. With the lag, I felt like I was watching a commercial for Microsoft's Kinect. 3. The story was altered, and while I understand somethings have to be left out, let me just say, in a non-spoiler edition, the ending of the movie was not the ending of the first season. Same outcome, different scenario.In closing statements, I enjoyed Zuko's actor and character in the movie, it really felt like him, especially when he gets angry, you can hear it in his voice. Sokka was good, he looked the part, but the direction didn't add a lot of comedy for him. Momo and Appa were only seen about 3 times and never had a big role in the movie. Iroh didn't look his part, but he certainly fulfilled it. If you like avatar, go see it just because it's avatar, otherwise, watch the show. This ruins the experience for people who've never seen the series before.",The Last Airbender
1138,KeiraRenee,Could've been a lot better...,2,2 July 2010,"I've been a fan of the TV series since it premiered, me and my brother always pretended to be benders. When we heard a movie was coming out, I was so excited! I saw it Thursday, when it came out, and I was disappointed.One thing that got on my nerves is how they changed the pronunciations of most of the names. I get he wanted to make it closer to Asian culture... but Americans know them as ""Ay-ng"" not ""Oh-ng"", ""Sok-uh"" not ""So-kuh"", etc.Another thing that REALLY made me disappointed is that the Kyoshi Warriors were completely cut out of the movie. They only briefly mention them in the montage that skipped over the rebellion in the Earth Kingdom. Uh, hello? Suki becomes a main character in Book Two and Three.The characters also had no development or understanding. Aang is twelve, he's not supposed to be a serious person. He didn't want to be the Avatar at first, and he shouldn't act like it right off the bat. Sokka's like the comic relief in the series, he's supposed to crack jokes... there were only, like, three times that were supposed to be humor. And when I first saw Zuko, I wondered where his scar was--they could've made it a little more distinct.They seemed to have rushed the movie. They could've taken a little more time to add depth to the movie. I wouldn't have minded if it went over 2 hours, although I'm sure the reason it was cut down was so little kids could watch it without getting too antsy watching a 2-hour movie.All in all... they tried, but nonetheless, they failed.",The Last Airbender

1140,eavaldezz,Not Very Good But Had Its Moments,4,2 July 2010,"OK the bad stuff about the movie. first off dialog, it had almost none.the whole movie was maybe a three pages long worth of dialog.The dialog in the animated series drove the story, not the visuals which the directer/writer/apparently everything else decided was not important. Second, it skipped A LOT of chapters and scenes from the animated series, which is supposedly what Shamyalon based his movie on. Skipping so much content led to failure to have proper character development which brings me to number three. the character were one dimensional with few exceptions. unless you are a fan of the animated series would you have understood why Katara follows Aang like a stray puppy and why General Iroh is with his nephew,Zuko, to capture the avatar. Now to the OK stuff. the visuals were awesome! it was a very impressive interpretation of the element ""bending"" from the animated series. Also, there were the very fine details like the fire nation uniforms, boats ,costumes, etc that were very accurate to the animated series. however,(spoiler alert) getting wrong how many days Iroh besieged Ba-Sing-Sei, not having the pirates scenes from the animated series that led to Zuko's boat exploding, and having the dragons replace avatar Ruko was completely terrible!!! For those who have never seen the animated series would probably not get any of the previous things mentioned but for the loyal fans of the series, I'm very sure were very angry at these few details. All in all, it was a mediocre movie that for an hour and a half for 10 bucks was not entirely worth it. if the movie had been three hours long, with more dialog, and more character development it probably would have been an amazing movie. Shame it wasn't. I don't think we should petition to not have the next movies made, we should petition m night Shamyalon removed from making these movies and have somebody who will stay absolutely true to the animated series direct/ what ever Shamyalon tried to do. and those are my two cents in the conversation. peace.",The Last Airbender
1141,EjaeChilds,How could the Creators let this happen?,1,3 July 2010,"Its understandable to want to see your creation on the big screen but to let a director like M. Night Shyamalan help make that happen is a complete disgrace to this most loved animated series!! As a fellow fan, hearing the controversy over the casting of the characters was one thing but to have the characters mispronounce each others names is out right HORRIBLE!! Did Shyamalan just look at the series and had the ""mute"" button on? Did he not hear the pronunciation of the characters names in the series? The characters pronounced Aang as Ung, Sokka as Sooka (as though it was mooing like a cow). I'll ask again, ""how could the creators let this happen""? As I have read the reviews previously to seeing the movie, I still wanted to see it but thankfully I went to a early show and only paid $5 to see this movie. The storyline was pretty choppy and did not let you care for the characters. It was put together way too fast and left me feeling like I was lost considering I know the series like the back of my hand. Quite a bit of key characters were left out like the Kioshi warriors and Avatar Roku who eventually become key characters in the series. The only person who left me with some sense of familiarity was the character Ihro in which they pronounced ""Er-roh"".By all means I am the type of person to give most things a chance and I did with this movie despite others reviews and comments but I have to agree with just about everyone on here who gave this movie a bad rating. The creators should have waited until a director like Spielburg or Michael Bay to come and direct this wonderful cartoon series. To take this wonderful animated cartoon and turn it into a choppy mess, left a foul taste in my mouth. After seeing this movie, I had to go home and watch the series again to get the bad taste of M. Night Shyamalan directing out of my mouth.IS IT POSSIBLE TO REMAKE A MOVIE THAT JUST CAME OUT???",The Last Airbender
1142,peterthechef336,The Avatar: The Last Movie of Shyamalan,1,3 July 2010,"I'm a pretty reasonable person, so don't think I'm exaggerating. I'm pretty ticked off about the whole movie. I've watched all the cartoon version over and over. I even watched the Extras version of the cartoon! There's a whole lot of things missing and changed in the movie. Like there's the Kyoshi warriors who apparently were taken out for some reason, how Appa looks like a cow on laughing gas, how Aang's name is pronounced Ah-ng when it's suppose to be pronounced Ehh-nng, how Zuko's Indian, how Uncle Iroh is not fat, and etc. My main complaint was how they took out the Kyoshi warriors. Missing Kyoshi warriors = quarter of the story gone. Also, how like half the actors are Indian. It's an Asian themed cartoon, so there should at least be SOME Asian people as actors. Apparently to Shyamalan, Zuko is Indian. Since when was Zuko Indian? There's only fire,water,earth, and air bending along with the sub-bending, but there's no race-bending. That's like putting black people as the Na'vi in the Avatar(the blue people). I'm starting to think that Shyamalan (the producer) made half the actors Indian because he's Indian himself. Also, the graphics are kinda horrible. It looks like as if the people were just dancing around on ecstasy while the elements were just floating around themselves. Basically, what I'm trying to say is, this movie COULD'VE been good, but Shyamalan butchered it.

I think he's the type of director who got a very lucky start by producing one or two successful blockbusters. And then the success got into his head that killed his ""talent""/luck. He ascended on his bloated ego into an alternative dimension of his own construct and totally lost touch with this reality.

Seriously don't watch this movie you'll never get the time or money back. They mispronounce Aang's name the entire movie. Not to mention almost everyone else. The awe inspiring speech he gives to the imprisoned benders' is laughable. Every seen sounds like they are giving a book report there is no acting ability present in the least bit.

The complains, the utter disgust in general... But nothing I read or imagined could prepare me for the mutilation I witnessed last night. I thought rape was illegal?? If so, M Night Shamalyn (however u spell it) should be arrested, tried and convicted. This movie was a complete mockery of the series I love dearly. It needs to be completely remade by someone that can actually put together a movie. I could have created a better and more entertaining movie, with sock puppets!! Instead of showing vital parts of the story, 90% of the time, they just had one character verbally explain it. For example, Aang decides to go around the world and try to help villages that have been enslaved by the Fire Nation.. Well instead of showing all that, they simply say it... then 2 minutes later, magically appear in the Northern Water Tribe Kingdom, ready to learn how to waterbend. Ridiculous. What the hell was this man thinking, if at all?? Did he watch the series at all or just read the summary on the back on the DVD?? Firelord Ozai wasn't even shown in the series until the final book, at the end. Instead he was this dark figure, murking in the shadows, speaking with this evil and ominous voice. How is he portrayed in the movie?? A somewhat compassionate figure that pretty much replaced Commander Zhou. A lot of the things they had Ozai doing in the movie, he had no part of. Like I said, he was in nothing more than flashbacks, face never being shown, until the last book of the series. That was the whole thing about the man. He was completely mysterious and evil. No compassion for his son whatsoever, unlike how the movie would have you think. If you're going to make a movie based on a series, at least leave some semblance of that series or leave it the F alone. The Avatar cartoon was an adorable series, full of excitement, emotion, love, action and just overall goodness. There was none of that in the movie. No humor whatsoever. And MoMo looked like a friggin Monkey. He's a Lemur!!! And what the hell noise was he making?? It was flat out creepy. MoMo is supposed to be an adorable trouble maker, constantly getting into mischief. I could go on and on about all the atrocities of this film. Simply put, it's TERRIBLE.

1148,mosleh1235,Definitely below expectations,3,3 July 2010,"I was always very fond of the animated series of Avatar, the fighting sequences were very well executed as well as exciting to watch, the dialogue and tension between the characters felt real and somewhat alive and the show had one of the best plots I have seen in a while. These elements, however, are missing in the last airbender. I don't know if M. Night Shyamalan meant to make a trashy movie such as this one but he did a very good job of doing so because usually this is the kind of movie I usually try to avoid. The second day the movie was in theaters I rushed to watch it (the first day is too crowded), I bought a large popcorn and soda and prepared myself to experience a movie that would hopefully be as well executed as the animated series but what I saw was the complete opposite. I constantly waited for the movie to get better, thinking that Shyamalan added a twist or something that would make the movie better but he disappointed the whole theater. At the end of the movie I could not stand up because of the embarrassment I had just seen. The movie portrayed the four nations quite well and the tension exists but it does not go as deep as the animated series does and for fans of the animated series they could tell you that the fighting sequences, dialogue and just the plot itself of the last airbender does not represent the animated series at all. I watch the movie and think of all the potential the movie had. M. Night Shyamalan cannot take all the blame though because the actors also did a poor job, they made the story seem rehearsed as if they were not feeling was they were saying, better actors would of been able to pull this off. The only character in the story I felt did kind of a good job was Zuko played by Dev Patel but I was very disappointed that he did not have his scar that he has in the animated series. Overall if you want to watch the movie, don't watch it theaters and especially don't watch it in 3D, I wouldn't even rent the DVD...just wait for the movie to come out on TV, that way you lose no money.

I had not attended a movie at the theaters for about 6 months because nothing was worth seeing, then the time that I finally think the movie might be worth it, it is the worst experience I have had since eragon. I believe that the best actor in this film was Abba the flying beaver. Shyamalan needs to lay low for a while, because if someone finds him they'll probably be wanted for murder.

Boy, was I horribly mistaken! This had to be a sad mistake for what people call films today. To start how is it possible to pronounce names of characters from a series that originated in the United States!? Second who was in charge of choosing these actors?! No offense or hate towards any race, but who thought that these people could portray these characters!? For starters Zuko was supposed to be 1.bold with a ponytail and 2. He is half Chinese and half Japanese! Skipping most of the more important scenes this film or better yet this power point served a nothing more than a giant recap! How do you even mess up the opening sequence, it is said in the TV show every episode! Costume designs were horrible, I have seen people at anime conventions look like these characters 100% better. The special effects were sad, when your bending the elements you don't do a dance with a delay in between your element moving! And even though I understand the adaptation of the fire bending it should not have been changed. I feel the director of this film had not taken any time to do research! I would not be surprised in the least if i found out he has never seen the show. However, in this entire mess I feel we have found a new up incoming actor........the best character in the film would have to be OPPA! The only thing that looked like the original and the only thing that did not speak to ruin the film. There is however ONE thing that came out of this film that i would thank the director for and that would be the fact that i love avatar more than i ever did before.

I thought the character for Aang was spot-on.You have to understand Shyamalan and how he does things. They're campy. They're quirky. He doesn't play by Hollywood's rules so people are out to get him. Is the movie perfect? Certainly not. Is the movie terrible? No way! If you really look at the Avatar cartoons, with the directors comments popping up all over the screen, it's kind of a campy thing, too. I think Shyamalan was a great choice to direct it, except for the way people love to hate him, which is unfortunate.The special effects are phenomenal. Nobody much is talking about that. The movie moves along at a very fast pace and doesn't for a minute bore you. The fighting scenes manage to keep things moving without the cheap blood flying and gore but still seem plausible.I left the theater excited to see the next one.",The Last Airbender
1152,afoolswisdom,The Last Airbender likely the last movie by Shyamalan,4,3 July 2010,"The Last Airbender, the movie, written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, was a far cry from being representative of the Nickelodean cartoon. It actually did the reverse, it shamed the cartoon. The main characters were not fully developed or realized, they did not represent the wonderfully developed characters of the cartoon show. The compacting of an entire season into a single movie was as complicated as Shyamalan made it look. He jumped all over the place and tried to fill in storyline with rushed narration. This was just one in a series of changes that Shyamalan made to a classic cartoon that ultimately led to a disappointing and frustrating viewing of The Last Airbender.Uncle Iroh, played by Shaun Toub, was not even a close representation of the lovable and tubby, tea drinking font of wisdom that is Uncle Iroh. Sokka, played by Jackson Rathbone, was supposed to be comic relief and was not even remotely funny. He was serious and dour all the time. Many of the characters in the movie were not even remotely close to their counterparts in the cartoon show. This begs the question, did Shyamalan even watch the same cartoon as his children? In addition, do not even bother watching this film in 3D. If you do, ask for your money back. It was not filmed to be a 3D movie and that was made abundantly clear by the fact that there were scenes where the forefront was clear and the background was seriously fuzzy. Who thought this was a good idea? It is sad that this film was a horrible adaption to a wonderful cartoon series. Likely, they will not be able to continue the series do to terrible turnout for this movie. It really is a great story, hopefully in the age of recycle and redo's, someone in Hollywood will be able to better adapt the cartoon to the big screen.",The Last Airbender

Unfortunately most of the comments ask the same questions. Spoilers ahead!!The reason why the names sound different is M. Night wanted the names to be more Asian and accurate. His reasoning is because he's Asian.The reason why fire benders, except for the high level fire benders, can't generate their own fire is out of fairness. All the other benders needed their element nearby and available in order to use. The fireballs and any fire is always seen being siphoned by the fire army. More fair but also some boring fights.The Kyoshi warriors were in the trailers but were cut for time and pacing. Too bad since the little they showed in the promo looked pretty sweet.These were issues he discussed that most people keep criticizing that had some real answers behind. I'm all for making the rest of the movies but with a new director, producer, and writer.MAJOR SPOILERSDamn it M. Night, why animate such an awesome tidal wave and not even use it?

We never connected to the characters like in the cartoon version at all...all the drama and emotion was sucked out this movie, NO CONNECTION WAS MADE MR.KNIGHT!!! and YOU WERE WRONG your prediction of 85% of ppl going to see this movie didn't see the animated version..YOU WERE WRONG on that!! some pplz pplz recast this movie at least over half the cast and get another director....cause the story is already well written..I WILL NOT BE WASTING MY MONEY TO SEE THE SECOND OR THIRD BOOKS IF HE IS GOING TO BE WRITING THE NEXT ONES, ID RATHER WATCH THE ANIMATED SERIES AND REMEMBER THE AVATAR THE LAST AIRBENDER IN ALL ITS GOOD RICH WRITING AND DIRECTING.",The Last Airbender
1155,sonadadark1,Don't succumb to group think: this movie was worth seeing,5,3 July 2010,"This movie was a pleasant surprise, deviating from the standard youth-fantasy-epic fare to create something more subtle and sublime with dreamy direction, visuals, and cinematography.The pace and energy were more gentle than is typical, allowing the viewer to relish the lush visual effects and the grace and elegance of the martial arts, which were distinctly more Tai Chi and Falun Gong than Karate or Judo.The battles weren't teeth-grinding-in-your-face gritty stress-fests, but rather fields of movement in the background with visual effects as accents. Artistry, not brutal realism, prevailed. If you wait for the DVD you'll be missing out.My only displeasure was that I found the editing sub-par during the background, giving a slightly disjointed effect where none was called for, compounded by some unfortunate voice-over narration.I could see how some would be bothered by the distinctly non-Hollywood acting, but I enjoyed that the actors were plain spoken and avoided the usual overwrought dramatics.Definitely don't listen to the critics--I'm wondering if they honestly watched this movie or just the trailers, especially when they pick on Dev Petel for being an inadequate villain, when clearly he wasn't the villain, and was a stand-out among the actors, along with Shaun Toub.Critics seem to have decided to pick on Shyamalan for not making another Sixth Sense. To me it seems like punishing him for not living up to their own unrealistic expectations.If you love the usual Hollywood fare, think you know how movies are ""supposed to"" look and how actors are ""supposed to"" act, or you were a huge fan of the series who expects a movie to hew closely to the source material, you'll probably be disappointed.Personally I think Hollywood churns out block-busting crap, I don't expect one piece of art to obey any other piece of art, and am sad for people whose pre-conceptions prevent them from being open to and enjoying varying experiences.I enjoyed the movie a lot and hope they make two more, which I would definitely go to see them in theaters.",The Last Airbender
1156,Bite_then_bleed,The only other way I could compare it's disappointment would to reference Dragonball Evolution and The Lovely Bones.,1,3 July 2010,"If you are a true fan of the series do not I beg of you do not waste your money to get your heart broken. First of all if you going to cram an entire season into one movie it should be a lot longer than an hour and a half. Every thing was so rushed and dodgy, it was like they lost half of their film and just pieced together what they had. I despise when a cocky director CHANGES everything to make it his own. If you have a show with such a cult following don't change everything around especially not the names, let alone the story line. Even really important characters were taken out, please explain how you would've furthered the series without the Kyoshi Warriors! Furhter more Appa and Momo who have such a big part in the series you barely see in the movie, I think Appa and the nameless Momo have a grand total of like 10-15 minutes in the whole movie. And for someone who was planning on making all 3 movies without a bit of comedy how would you have presented Toph? Even the sets of the movie were ruined, with the exception of the Northern Water Temple that was perfect. But the fire lords throne was merely a fancy chair not the blazing inferno in the show. Sorry if I'm kinda all over the place with this but for a movie I've been jonesing about since last year I felt kinda robbed. Especially by the bending. All that flailing and stomping and kicking just to move one small rock REALLY SLOWLY. If they by some miracle make a sequel of this fire M.

1157,reeboker89,missed opportunities,1,3 July 2010,"OK so i have been a fan of the TV show like I'm sure all of you have been, and i was excited as hell to go see this movie but it disappointed me in many ways. Im not saying this movie is a not see but i think he missed out on a lot of details. For example aang was supposed to go into the avatar hall at the southern air temple not the northern one. Also it was supposed to be katara who led the earthbenders to rebel in prison that was on a ship not ground, this was so the earthbenders couldn't fight back. We were also supposed to meet suki and the other kyoshi warriors, plus see sokka and suki start liking each other. Aang wasn't supposed be to captured by the general at the northern air temple, he was supposed to meet the mechanic and the glider people. He was supposed to be captured while looking for a way to make his friends better. I totally agree with the last comment before mine though. The characters had no depth to them what so ever. I hope the follow the series better in the second movie they missed so many important details and events that set the path for everything else, I hate it when people do that. They try to put their own twist on it and most of the time it ruins it for the people that have been waiting for something like this.",The Last Airbender
1158,inking-k-crawford,So Much Fail in So Little Time,1,3 July 2010,"M. Night Shayamalan -- you should get an award for being able to put so much fail in so little time. I must congratulate you as well; no other film has made me facepalm, cringe, sigh, or simply seethe with contempt as your ""The Last Airbender"" has done. I must concede that you, sir, have certainly won the honor of now being one of my most disliked directors of all time.Let me begin by saying this: Avatar: The Last Airbender began in 2005 as an animated series on Nickelodeon. It was a drastically different show for the network, as it had a complex and ongoing plot while animated in the Japanese ""anime"" style. The show quickly gained popularity for its interesting, dynamic characters, action-packed scenes, beautiful animation, and captivating plot. It aired for three 'seasons', or books -- Book One: Water was what has currently been adapted to a live-action feature film by Mr. Night. Oh, wait, no it hasn't; the film had little to no resemblance to its highly successful and brilliant predecessor.For those of us who are fans of the show, the film is a complete and utter disaster. Immediately, fans will notice that the pronunciation of MAIN CHARACTERS' NAMES is done incorrectly. Sokka, Aang, and Uncle Iroh all have their names butchered continuously throughout the show. This alone will turn most off. It also leads me to believe that M. Night created the film by scanning through trailers of the animated series on Youtube before setting out to create the script. Secondly, a number of vital characters were not in appearance. I understand that when works such as a novel or series are translated into film, editing must make important and necessary decisions. However, the editing team seemed to tie a cloth around their eyes and swing an axe at random scenes before finalizing the movie.For those who may have interest in the film and are unacquainted with the original series, you undoubtedly will not enjoy the film either: the camera frames were either uncomfortably close to a character, or panning so quickly that the focus was blurry and gave you a headache. The actors' of the film were unable to portray any characteristics of the original characters, and some remained static throughout the hour and forty minute movie. The dialogue is choppy and repetitive, resembling the story one might construct in junior high. The score to the film is also unimpressive, evoking a run-of-the-mill-fantasy-film sensation in one's stomach.There were only two things I enjoyed in the film: the creatures, and the outfits. But don't spend $10 on a movie ticket to see the few moments of glory Appa, Momo, and other creatures get or to oggle the clothing of Earth Kingdom residents. If you must see this movie, save your money and your energy and wait until you can rent it later on. In the meantime, I suggest watching paint dry -- it will be more entertaining than ""The Last Airbender"" ever was.",The Last Airbender
1159,sdunn8609,Really good movie,8,3 July 2010,"I have seen the entire series and watching this movie amazes me. Shyamalan has done wonders with the two hour movie. Although it has taken out a lot of the parts from the series to condense the movie, it was still put together well with the most important parts so everyone is able to follow the movie. No one who hasn't watched the series was left behind at all.As for all the people giving it bad ratings: Many people think that the characters names were mispronounced. Wrong... I was thinking the same thing before I went and saw the movie. I watched a behind the scenes and it mentions that the name pronunciations are changed because they are pronounced the way they are in their language.The narration was good for the movie. It filled in parts that were other wise to long for the movie. If Shyamalan was to put in everything from the series to the movie, well... I would still be in the movies and then the movie would be hated by everyone cause it would be to long.I enjoyed the ending of the movie very much. It really makes me want to see the next series to come out. Especially for people that have not seen the movie, it makes that edge of the seat ""I want to know what is next"" feeling.Overall this movie is great! I would recommend to all my friends.",The Last Airbender

This site is here to inform people of the movie and not of the animated series.If you thought it was cheesy, because there was no blood or gore... of course there wasn't, it is a Nickolodeon Movie.

The only reason i did not walk out was because my feet hurt from working all day, and I wasn't ready to carry my four year old (who fell asleep) out of the theater. The characters were not developed, the dialog was lame and if you did not see the cartoon (as I did not and so I'm told) it doesn't make much sense. There was no mystery, no suspense, and no build up to the supposed epic battle at the end. Everything was handed to the audience and the characters with little or no struggle. I wanted to see this movie based on the previews but I left feeling somehow cheated. I have never been to a movie, until now, where random strangers were commenting to each other about how bad the movie was. Do not spend a dollar at red box for this.

Even with that warning flashing at the back of my head, it was disappointing. As a fan of the series, all I could think the entire movie was, ""How could it manage to be this WRONG?"" It takes some talent to take such a great show like Avatar and just crush everything- the characters had little to no depth or personality, the dialogue was stiff and almost painful, the plot was rushed... And that's just the major stuff. If you want to be nit-picky, there are a plethora of complaints that I'm sure others are making at this very moment.What happened is this: Shyamalan took the very basic bare-bone idea of Avatar, and then decided to make his own movie about it.If you've never seen the series and have no idea about anything: I'd still recommend that you wait until it's out on DVD, and just rent it or get it from the library for free.

The movie skipped all the important scenes, had crappy effects, and it sounded like an elementary school play. I advise not to see this movie. I was so upset I wanted to leave. The director did such a horrible job. The characters are suppose to be Asian! What's with the white people and Indians? The bending wasn't the same as the anime. It took like five minutes just to bend water. And the slow-mo made it even boring. The 3d was crap. Nothing popped out and it's just a waste of money.",The Last Airbender
1165,bsgnerd,This movie is worth seeing.,10,4 July 2010,This movie is worth seeing. That being said it wasn't great. But it wasn't as terrible as the critics are making it out to be.M Night did make some changes and leave out some cool things but he had to. He made many good choices to format a kid's show for the big screen. This movie is for kids not for 30 year old men. Some little things are just plain brilliant. Like introducing the Fire Lord early. If the 3rd movie is ever made there won't be time to get to know his character and understand his insane drive to take over the world.Martial Arts were very good. I one scene at the Northern Kingdom Anng and Kitara are water bending in unison. Anng has years of training and it shows. Kitara has only begun her training and it shows.For those that didn't like the casting of 3 lead characters as whites I understand. But it is important to recognize that MOST of the cast and many of the secondary leads are very ethnic looking. I would bet Airbender has more ethnic actors cast than any other Hollywood movie made this year.Just some thoughts on a very good first movie.

I'LL TELL YOU WHEN YOU HIT ONE!} I normally don't write reviews but this movie compelled me to inform the world of what would have gone through your mind had you seen it. Save yourself the two hours, I'm telling you now. World, M. Night Shyamalan is the worst director ever. In my personal opinion, everything he's touched since The Sixth Sense just went straight to hell...so you could only imagine my joy when I discovered he was the director and the writer of this movie. To be clear, I didn't go in with a negative attitude. I will admit, I didn't want to see this at first, but something inside me told me to have a little faith. I figured this was a sign, that maybe- just maybe, this movie wouldn't be a 2 hour train wreak like every other movie this guy touched. Well, it was. The actors were terrible in every way. They looked nothing like the characters they were trying to imitate. Not to mention there was NO character building whatsoever in this script. M. Night Shyamalan defended himself, saying his audience wanted a serious movie. Well, I wanted a serious movie but to completely rob the characters of personality or humor? Not quite. Not to mention the actors were inexperienced...and it's not just that they were kids. They were bland and dry and boring. I think I could have done a better job acting than they did. Also, the mispronunciation of quintessential names; like Aang. Last time I checked, ""Aa"" did not sound like ""O"" so why they called him ""Ong"" is beyond me. Oh, and Sokka? Sounds like Sock-uh right? WRONG. It's Sew-kah.{THIS ONE HAS THE SPOILERS}Why did I give it a 3 and not a 1? Because, this movie had its moments. I thought the ending was alright, the giant fight scene was pretty well choreographed and the costumes were even pretty good...Appa was wicked. The set was amazing. The Northern Water Kingdom was spectacular, it gave me chills. Also, the water bending at the end when Aang lifts the ocean against the Fire Nation, the effects on that were amazing...even though they beat it to death, 5 minutes of holding up water. {NO MORE SPOILERS, YOU'RE GOOD}The music was phenomenal-and it gives the audience a little glimpse at just how epic this film could have been if M. Night Shyamalan killed himself before making it. I'll watch the next one if said event happens.In Summary; One of the worst movies I've seen in a while.

1167,Noir1981,The Last Airbender?? More like A waste of my time!!,1,4 July 2010,"If you are wanting to see this movie then I would suggest going to see another movie. I felt like I wasted my time and money on seeing this film. I felt like monkeys could have done a better job then this clown that made thus 150 million dollar film.I apologize now for my spelling for the names First off in the first part of the movie the screwed up. The first they show Anng or Ohng (They total did not say there names right) he was was in the Ice but when he got out he did not needed to be cared out or even helped out. Also he was not this shy confused little boy that was having a hard time with water bending.Then next thing is when they first go to a earth village it was suppose to be Kiyoshi Island but instead they skip that part and go to where Katara get all of them arrested and they put all of them in the middle of nowhere in a mountain, NOT A SHIP BUT A MOUNTAIN. Then you have Anng give Katara's speech and then they you see them beat the Fire Benders then cross the gates that held them and then walk into the village that is no more than 5 feet away from the gates. Then the Show the Statue of Kiyoshi.They give Anng a water Bending scroll that Katara was suppose to steal and they show him having trouble Water Bending. He Never had Trouble with water bending it was earth that he was having trouble with. Then they show a bunch of scenes that showed the country and Anng then wanting to go to the Northern Air temple. They skip the part where Katara and Soka had been sick and where he need to get the frozen frogs to get them better. Instead they have get arrested at the Northern Air Temple not from a refugee but from a Fire Bender Spy. Really?? a Spy?? They kinda got blue Sprite right. He does save Anng but Anng does not try to leave him in the middle of battle.After that they blow Zooku up and move in to invasion for the Northern Water tribe. Master Paco never fights Katara and the place is ruled by the princess and Soka does not volunteer to protect her but was order to. Also he does not help out with the planning of how to fend off the Fire Nation. That is another thing Tough out this whole movie the Fire Bender ALWAYS HAD USE FIRE THAT WAS THERE AND NOT THERE OWN FIRE, AND WHEN IRHO DID THEY WHERE AFRAID OF IT. They never USED a TORCH or a Fire Pit to Create FIRE!! They Total Messed that part up for the benders.Zhoul also does not die in the first Book and he also fights Zooku. Oh also Zhoul, and Zooku does not have there fight when they pull into port because they show them while they are out to sea when they meet.I would strong advise any one that loved the series not to see this movie because they would not like it. Within the first five minutes for the film I wanted shoot myself on how it was. There was no plot in the film and did not make any sense. It was kinda like watching Dragonball but worse. They got nothing right about the movie.Also instead of having Anng Master the Element by summer's end they give Anng three years to Master the elements because that is when Sozan's Comet arrives.",The Last Airbender

Zuko and Aang worked really well for me. I thought they both portrayed the characters well. Uncle and the fire lord were great they both were very convincing. I wanted so much to see more of Azula, but I know that's later. I wish there was a little bit of humor with the Sokka character as he was lacking some of clown like personality.

It wasn't trying to win Best Motion Picture. It was trying to please its young fan-base.The other people throwing stones are the fans themselves. I won't give away what made it into the film and what didn't, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that twenty or so hours of plot-line simply won't fit into an hour and forty minutes of movie.I love Vanilla Coke more than any other drink in the world. And I knew when I bought Vanilla Coke flavored chap-stick, it wouldn't be exactly like drinking one. But it tastes the same, and that's what matters.

In the cartoon common names for the fire nation were Lee, and so on. So therefore the fire nation should've been Chinese. In the cartoon Uncle Iroh was a fat, humorous man. In the movie he was thin and somewhat serious. In the beginning of the movie Sokka and Katara were the only Caucasians, everyone else were Eskimos. Not only were races an issue for me, but the pronouncation of names were a problem as well. ""Aang"" was pronounced ""Awng"", ""Iroh"" was pronounced ""E-roh"", ""Agni kai"" was pronounced ""Agni key"", ""Sokka"" was pronounced ""Sohka"", this became confusing and irritating to me. The last thing that disappointed me was the delivery of the story. It was too quick in the movie. They should've just made two separate movies. I really think that the director should make dramatic changes to the incoming movies. In the end the only thing that wasn't so disappointing was the effects.",The Last Airbender

Night Shyamalan should never receive another movie production dollar again. I hope he reads all these reviews and goes missing for 100 years to think about it.

1174,kkq17,Not as bad as I thought!,5,4 July 2010,"Coming from a fan who watched the series twice over, I think that i can give a somewhat just review.After reading the horrific comments and terrible ratings for The Last Airbender, I must say that I was almost moved not to watch the movie. But, being the fan that I was, I still went with some friends who had never watched the movie. And I must say, the movie isn't as bad as many here claimed it was, nor was it worthy of anything over 6 stars. When I walked into the theater, and the movie began, I braced myself for the most horrific movie I would ever see. So, I held my breath throughout, just flinching at the moments where everything could go wrong. And I'm happy to say that I only winced a few times. It's best to start off with the bad parts, because that seems to be what everyone's looking for. I felt that some of the younger actors (though Noah Ringer did fairly OK) were struggling to convey the right form of their character. For fans of the series, everyone knows that Katara is a strong-willed girl who can be emotional at times. However, in the movie, she came off as sappy and overly dramatic. I did not feel any of her strength and really could not connect with her. And that was the case with a few other characters -there was little development in them and therefore little connection could be made. My other complaints were that Commander Zhao did not come off as evil and commanding as he should of, and despite his great job in his role, Zuko came off as merely sad and not complicated as he should have been (that'll lead to problems in the later movies I tell you). Additionally, some parts of the movie felt quite rushed and hardcore fans will be flabbergasted at Shyamalan's temerity of putting some events out of order (not major events), or even creating entirely new scenes just so he could sew the story together. Some, like I, will also point out that Shyamalan did some annoying reworking of character names (Aang to AHN-g, Sokka to SOH-ka, Iroh to EER-oh, etc.)As for the good parts... there were a few. The cinematography was wonderful as it was done by the same man who did it for the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Also, a few of the actors, especially the older ones, did a fine job of carrying out their role. The movie certainly had a lot of action sequences that kept me excited. I was happy to see that they did stick to the distinctive styles of bending. Also, Shyamalan did manage to get 50-70% of the facts straight, though he did twist a few things to make this movie work. However, it apparently worked because for my friends who had never seen the series, they understood the movie just fine, and also quite enjoyed it. I myself also found myself liking the movie at certain points, and completely forgot I was supposed to be hating it. So, in summary, the movie is no where near as bad as critics have claimed. I frankly agree that the movie deserves a 4-5 star rating, because despite the fact that Shyamalan screwed some things up, the movie stood okay on its own. For people who have never seen the series, they will find the movie fascinating and original. For those who have enjoyed the series, please watch the movie with a grain of salt -it's an ADAPTATION, not a strict remake. The movie is mediocre yet pretty cool if you set your doubts about it aside. So just kick back, relax, ignore the bad parts, and do your best to enjoy the movie.",The Last Airbender
1175,mixmasterlees,Absolute Failure,1,5 July 2010,I signed up to IMDb just to Put a bad review of this movie. My good year is ruined because of this movie. I will never see another Mknight Shama whatever his name is movie again. This is the first time i have ever seen a movie with absolutely zero character development. This is also the first time I have ever wanted my money back.I could go on for ever but it's already been said by other people.this is the best way to describe the movie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAD9ke15FuUDon't watch this movie >:(,The Last Airbender
1176,maryelip,Don't waste your time and money,1,5 July 2010,"I hate to say this, but the movie was a MAJOR disappointment. If you think this movie is going to follow the anime series, you are very wrong. I don't think the director/screen play writer watched the series! Here is a small list of major things wrong: Main characters name are pronounced wrong, time-line is wrong, character personalities are wrong, element bending is portrayed wrong......... I had read the reviews before going and tried to keep an open mind, but the critics were right this time. I had to console myself by going home and watching the anime series Book 1. It makes me wonder what Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko think of the mess Nickelodeon made of their series. If Nickelodeon even considers making a Book 2 movie, they have a lot to fix and a lot of people to convince that they are fixed!",The Last Airbender
1177,camhaygood,Bad. Bad. Bad.,2,5 July 2010,"Awful. Just awful. The minute this movie started I was excited out of my mind for it...Until I watch some of the first sequences of the movie. M. Night honestly couldn't imply anything without the characters asking annoying questions frequently, and they would say something every once in a while that was just completely unnecessary to the story. Occasionally it would be so bad I would literally laugh out loud. The story also moved way too fast for anyone to comprehend anything, and the Aang in the movie just wasn't very...Aang-like. It seems like they took just about anyone for the part. I understand that he is to be a twelve year-old boy, but who they chose was just way too intense the whole time. As a fan of the cartoon though I had to be critical. The only thing I enjoyed was the actual bending (not the fighting sequences, because they were horrid as well). The bending, I think, was pretty accurate to the show's interpretation of each style, hence my rating of a two. Although some of the film looked like something out of a home movie which I had to lean over and share with the person sitting next to me. If you think that this will be a great movie for your kids and you weren't a fan of the cartoon then you're dead wrong. Don't go. Just don't go. It's a complete waste of time and money.",The Last Airbender
1178,lifelike-a-lovesong,It was worthy of my $8 for all of the unintentional laughs I got out of it!,5,5 July 2010,"So just to be clear, I watched the show for all three years, and I'm a big fan of M. Night, I wasn't under any illusions that this was going to be exactly like the show. But from the start of the movie, it was as if they were just making a joke out of the entire thing! From the acting, which made me laugh the hardest, to the random quirks in the writing that just made me laugh harder, I've gotta say I haven't laughed so hard at a movie in my life! (Spoilers) When the blue spirit is coming to save Aang(or Ong as they like to call him in the movie) the girl next to me says, ""What the HECK is THAT?"" Then the whole romance between Yue and Sokka in the movie was hilarious. There were so many random things in the movie it was just unintentionally laughable! I'm giving it a 5 because I really enjoyed being that entertained for an hour and a half.",The Last Airbender
1179,marcezs08,Regretful,3,5 July 2010,"This movie could have been great, some plot changes were expected when changing from a media that's 10 hours or so longer to 2, making that compression takes sacrifices, but was what they did... needed? My first complain right off the start of the movie, the names, sure each person pronounces the names different and probably the actors didn't know how to pronounce it, but even a 10 minute research would tell you how to pronounce the name correctly. For 2 hours i kept repeating the names in my head, so i didn't have to hear the name EERO, and Aangs name being mispronounced.My second complain and the biggest complain i have. the story says that the fire Nation is a powerful nation, so why when you put out the candles they are powerless, they changed the backbone of the story, the main pillar that holds it all together and makes it great.Animations are great, some graphics were enhanced like Aangs tattoos but overall it doesn't make up for the crazy changes to the main story and so it doesn't deserve more than a rating of 3 by me.MZS",The Last Airbender
1180,coco-is-mine,An excellent adaptation of a wonderful television show!,7,5 July 2010,"Hi! I would like to start off by saying that I watched the Last Airbender during it's original run on T.V. and loved it! When the show officially ended I found myself wishing that it wouldn't. After all: I had grown to love the characters. Why would I want to say goodbye?When the Last Airbender came to theaters I looked it up and read the reviews. My expectations were dropped in the mud.80% or so rated it as being somewhere between totally heretical and just plain abysmal. You can imagine my disappointment.Even after that stark dose of reality I was hopeful and so with a cloud over my head I ventured to my local cinema to experience either an extreme disaster or a surprising revival of a loved cartoon. Thankfully the latter met me at the theater.I've not seen any of Shyamalan's other films so I don't know how to rate it against them but on It's own I give it a 7 out of 10.I thoroughly enjoyed the acting (even though it was a little substandard at times), the humor, the choreography and the special effects. Nothing bad about any of it. I do, however feel that whoever gave the script the final O.K. should have gone through it again and given it a good streamlining. A few more pronouns would have gone a long way toward making it sound more intelligent.The changed pronunciation of some the names didn't bother me much. After all, America is one of the few (if not the only) countries in the world that actually uses the hard 'A' sound. How likely would it be that they would in the Last Airbender universe?All in all I think the movie accomplished very nicely what it set out to do. It took a whole season of a hit cartoon show and condensed it down to just under 2 hours.If they had chosen to make it twenty minutes longer they could have worked in some more character development and made the segue from scene to scene less abrupt.All in all, it is a highly enjoyable movie that I - a stead fast fan of the original series - would love to watch again.If you choose to see it I recommend doing so with an open mind and perhaps this thought in the back of your head: No adaptation is ever the same as the original work. Otherwise, what would be the point?",The Last Airbender
1181,ko4554,Watch it in 3D!!,10,5 July 2010,"Watch it in 3D! The bending is amazing. Visuals and costumes are just perfect. I felt everything there in 3D. All work is so grand and great. Everything seem like real - bending northern water tribe. Apa and Momo were so nice that everybody would like to take them home. It is a total clean thrilling, joyful, touching journey to a different magical powerful world, resembling our world. No sex, slang, violence. And that kid Aang moves so fast. Experience it!!M. Night covered some flaws of original script and made it more integral. Aang, Zuko, Katara, Sokka, Grandma, Uncle Iroh, Commander Zhao, Monk Gyatso, Fire Lord - all characters have played like real. A must watch for fans. Just don't take it as movie version of series.",The Last Airbender
1182,baldielocks2006,Don't waste your time,4,5 July 2010,Great story line! Could be really good! But alas......No.....Extremely poor acting it really distracts from the story. Entire movie seems like a made for TV movie that they just pasted together. Bad Bad Bad If they had had better acting this movie could have been sweet. They left it open for future movies but unless it gets a major overhaul I don't see them having the ability to get another to the movie house. Maybe a straight to DVD release. But I don't see it being possible. The effects weren't too bad I'd like to try it in 3d to see if it makes any difference. On the other hand some of the effects weren't that well done. Also the way they did it a lot of the story line was predictable but the story is solid.,The Last Airbender
1183,moviefanrj,Awesome movie for the non-animation series fan,10,3 October 2010,"Alright, so much for all the bad reviews. I have never seen the Air Bender animation series, and it seems all the bad reviews are from people that have watched this movie expecting it to be like the animation one. People should rate a movie based on its own not based on something else, that's just not fair. I enjoyed this movie very much, the special effects were great, and the Dev Patel was brilliant. Only negative thing I saw was some of the stereotypical casting of actors. Can't wait to watch the next one. Pretty sure the DVD sales and online rentals will be a hit. Directing was well done, what's up with all the M. Night negativity, I saw this movie with 5 other people who have never seen the animation series, everyone enjoyed this movie.",The Last Airbender

1185,cjackmond,Bad job from an experienced director,5,5 July 2010,"I will start by saying I have never seen the animated series, so I was not burdened by expectations, other than being entertained.M. Night Shaymalan is an experienced director, and his dialog in ""Signs"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" were good to excellent. So what happened here? The dialog was juvenile, the pace felt rushed, as we skipped from point to point. The bending seemed too much choreography for too little effect. I only differ from some of the reviews that I saw in that all of the other elements had to have a source available. There is no naturally occurring fire in most environments of our planet. I don't care that the animated series has fire benders creating fire from nothing, if this was the case, it seems that the fire nation would have conquered the world long ago. One reviewer that mentioned the sun as a source, well, let me see a bender move any of the other elements 93 million miles, and then I may agree. Unless you are fighting in a volcano, no mystical fire sources for every grunt.Several things about the last battle that bothered me as much as anything in the movie. The fact that you bother to have a walled city for defense, then you let the enemy waltz across your element (water) as if on a pleasure cruise, without even rippling the water or trying to slow them in the slightest. The you let them breach your walls unopposed and drop fire sources without even trying to put them out!! What I saw four water benders do late in the movie says they could have done a lot to slow (or even stop) the enemy before they let them breach the walls. In the real world, I have witnessed a 4 foot high wave toss about a strong man like he was a rag doll. Any surfer will tell you the same. The whole situation seems to defy my expectations of what a city would do to protect itself from a merciless invader. This could have also added some interplay between benders of both sides in battle, an opportunity wasted. Then there were the too brief stops with the earth benders. They seems so feeble offensively, if they can at an instant raise a 6-7 foot wall, why could they not have created something like a moving cloud of earth to suffocate and blind their foe? As far as character development, there was very little. The character of Sokka seemed to be little more than useless, why was his character not either removed or fleshed out? The only characters that seemed to have more than a tiny bit of background were Aang, Zuko and Iroh. The character of Iroh was, for me, the most interesting and best played in the whole movie, kudos to Shaun Toub for giving his best. He raised the review one star by himself.As I said, M. Night Shaymalan is an experienced director, what happened here?",The Last Airbender
1186,rmead06,NOT the worst movie ever people! Pretty decent.,6,5 July 2010,"First if all, it is a Nickelodeon movie. It is rated PG.Therefore, you should know up-front that it won't have the brutal/gory fight scenes that you'd see in something like LOTR which were so great. Still, they are visually awesome fighting scenes with some pretty great camera shots and some awesome martial arts. I for one got really into the fighting scenes even despite the lack of blood. The dialog isn't terrible as tons of reviews have said...It is acceptable. I thought the biggest problem with the dialog is that the 3 main characters of the movie were pretty bad. There were a few times in the very beginning where the 3 of them are talking about something important and the acting just made you feel absolutely awkward and embarrassed for them. After that, there isn't very much talking at all for the rest of the movie and it gets much much better. I don't know why so many reviews say that this is the worst writing and worst story ever... Again, it was perfectly acceptable. I was never confused, I thought it was decently creative and imaginative, I was in suspense, it was a believable story that made sense and was compelling enough. Plus, it's an aesthetically beautiful movie.The only way I can make sense of so many horrible reviews is if people were waiting FOREVER for this movie to come out and were expecting it to blow their minds... And if those reviewers were hardcore fans of the anime.I've seen some people say that this could have been as big as Lord of The Rings if it was done better... and I DO agree with that.but all in all, it is worth going to see for sure.",The Last Airbender
1187,mckee-783-621192,An 8 year old's assessment,1,6 July 2010,"I would like to share my son's review. He just turned 8 and dictated as his dad typed: I just hate it so bad!!!I'm a HUGE fan of the the cartoons. I have the whole series, including Water, Earth and Fire. It was a HUGE disappointment because even by the time I saw the commercial, I knew it would be completely crushing! I mean, the characters! Iroh was the greatest disappointment. He was not kind and wise enough. And also he was not old enough. And why can't they say anyone's name right!???I thought it was completely disrespectful to put the characters skin colors the opposite. After the first twenty minutes of it I was bored already but I have to say the effects were decent. And the Avatar did not have enough happiness in him! I think it's important to the movie. Aang is the main character of the movie, and he should at least get a little more happiness inside of him! When I got home that night I had to watch the cartoon series for some time to completely forget about the movie! And... actually, I'm watching it right now! If anybody wanted to see this movie I would suggest they close their eyes and ears!!!*********************Dad's two cents:My son became interested in Avatar the Last Air Bender, the animated series at age 4.I bought him the entire series on DVD as soon as the episodes were available and he and I devoured every episode, again and again. Compared to the magnificently crafted animated series, I'd have to say the live action movie was an abysmal embarrassment, a sophomoric and vapid display of ignorance. Go rent or buy the animated series instead. I think it's some of the best fiction ever written for children. It's incredible. It's an epic parable dealing with sophisticated philosophical, cultural, emotional and spiritual issues which have plagued human civilization since the emergence of reason. And it does it with lightheartedness and joy. The theme deals with no less than issues of greed, power, spirituality, and the formation of identity and moral values. It grapples with the ideals of pacifism. It teaches teamwork, compassion, empathy and humility. It exemplifies wisdom and the appreciation of art, nature and connectedness - connectedness to each other, to nature, to animals, to the universe, and emphasizes detachment from possession. The story line traverses goofy playfulness, tween and young teen crushes and love, family power dynamics, friendship, mental illness, and gut wrenching loss. And it's an incredible primer for Eastern spiritual ideals and mythology. But these things can't be achieved effectively without superb craftsmanship. So beautifully wrought is this story that the fun, action and struggles are adeptly punctuated with moving poignancy. The live action version is NONE of these things. No insight, no depth of character, only the most cursory references of some of the core thematic values of the animated series, and those done so poorly as to come off as just... pathetically trite. The thing I find most upsetting regarding the failure of this movie to deliver is that the original animated series covers all of what I find to be the best of Eastern culture, and we Westerners need to understand these things in this global community. Buddhist and Confucian ideals and philosophies are front and center and, in my mind, are the greatest gifts the East has to offer the world, and the very things that are most clearly in danger of vanishing in the face of the West's insignificant obsession with material gain and conspicuous consumption.And another thing, too. It's typical that this story was handled on the level it was - dismissively. Adults appear to be largely disinterested in the profound turmoil in which children are engaged as they enter their teens. They are forming their value systems, they are trying to reconcile reality with fantasy and desire. They are trying to find the balance between selfishness and empathy. They are finding what it means to be themselves, members of a community, and a species on the planet. They are in agony grappling with issues we were happy to leave behind. But these struggles are never truly resolved, and our ideas of who we are and how we fit in the world cannot remain fixed, and, yet, when they are challenged, we adults consider ourselves to be in a state of crisis, when that is the perpetual state of being of a young teen. And I would argue it's a state of flux that we should never leave, that we should always be questioning ourselves, our figures of authority, and our place in the world and in relation to those around us. I do not see these struggles as juvenile, but human, and the animated series brings all these struggles to mind. Sadly, the movie did little to bring the richness of these struggles to life. In my most critical mood, I would say this failure is deeply offensive to my sensibilities as a human being.But on the other hand, not everyone has the depth of vision and creative genius to pull off what admittedly would be a very challenging feat. I just wish I could see what David Lean could have done with this story.",The Last Airbender
1188,oberron1701,Bendding..more like Booing!,1,5 July 2010,"Mr.M. Night Shyamalan took a great cartoon,and ruined all most every bit of it.I am a huge fan of the The Avatar cartoon. I have watched with great wonder the evolution of Aang and the rest of the people in the show. But what was done to the world of the Avatar was a shame.The bending was like watching a really bad drug trip. The acting was good enough for a 4th grade play,and the casting for the most part was sub-par. The cast was to old to play the parts or not even the right ''race''. I mean come on General Iroh is a short fat Japanees Solder. Not what was on the screen. Sokka is a young teenager about 14-15 years old. You made him like he was 24! And messing with the time line of ''the end of summer '' the comet comes,to making it 3 years. It is time to stop taking good t.v. shows and destroying them just for your entertainment,because it is apparent it was not for the public.I will leave you with this.

1189,strikedawn,Better in 2D...,8,5 July 2010,"I recently had a bad experience with the 3D movies, and I from the reviews I read here, I gathered I'd be better off see this one sans the third dimension. I was right. I went with four friends, and we all came out impressed and ready for more. None of us were familiar with the original series, so we went in with no expectations. We were blown away by the special effects. The fighting sequences were beautiful, and thankfully, fairly frequent. The exposition was useful to me, if a little dull. Honestly, the weakest part of the film was the script. Quite often, I noted some points where the actors were held back by some stilted dialog. There were some moments where opportunities to loosen things up with a little humor were squeezed into an awkward one line shot. Which is not to say that the acting was poor. The acting was absolutely solid, each character played their part quite well. **Spoiler here**I really enjoyed the plot, and the conclusion of the film. The end featured the main character Aang shaping a gargantuan tidal wave in an impressive display of power, to poise it threateningly over enemy ships. The part that surprised and impressed me was that instead of releasing the wave and sweeping the enemy ships into oblivion, he allowed them to withdraw and dissipated the wave without incident. It seems a small plot point, but it's a powerful decision to make, morally and artistically. Think of Star Wars, featuring Luke Skywalker, in much the same situation, who had to destroy the Death Star killing million of people, with no option in simply forcing it to retreat. In every epic film, the bad guys usually die in a single cataclysmic explosion and that it that. I've never seen a story where the battle was ended with the bad guys running away. To me, that means a whole new way to tell an epic. From the beginning to the end, you can really tell whoever made this film had the same love for the enemies of this world as they did for the heroes. It's truly refreshing to find a world in chaos is also a world that requires everyone in it to be there, not swept away in a cataclysmic event. I really enjoyed this movie on most levels, and I really hope there's another movie for me to be entertained by soon.",The Last Airbender
1190,ejbrocato,*sigh* (might have some vague spoilers),1,5 July 2010,"I saw this movie without hearing what anyone else had to say about it.I know I shouldn't expect perfection, but the only thing similar about this movie and the cartoon was literally the fact that there are four nations that bend four different elements and the last of the air bending kind is someone who reincarnates and can bend all four elements.Some of the -key- parts of the avatar/avatar state are completely butchered.Yes, not all of the first season can be packed into one movie, but there was almost no substance to the movie and like I said, almost any part taken from the series was changed. Why? The series was so powerful, and putting it in live action is an extremely hard task, but if you are going to recreate a series of that magnitude of genius do -not- change it. If you can't make the series into three movies make into six. Making this cartoon a live action movie is attractive enough.As far as movie quality goes, it's true, Shyamalan has put together some beautiful movies, but this movie lacked in cinematography and acting. Like any other director the actors can carry or ruin the movie. This director has worked with some great actors or at least big names... Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Mel Gibson, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Rosie O'Donnell, etc. He helped make Joaquin Phoenix's name. However, this movie had some very inexperienced, poorly chosen actors that were in no way capable of carrying his script (a script lacking in pace and depth).What happened?

1191,jhime85,i hope it was the last airbender movie,3,5 July 2010,"When i go see a film adaption of something i go in with negative expectations, using this rating system has never failed me until now. At the end of the movie i was left thinking what was that? It also made me wonder if Shyamalan even watched the series or at least had the actors watch for character development purposes. i knew they had to leave some things out, but getting rid of the kiyoshi warriors and jet messes up the plot line for the sequels.that aside my most major complaint was with the bending, or manipulating of, the elements. yes the animation of the bending was great but the actors wasted a lot of time going through bending forms with completely inadequate results. fire benders should not need fire nearby to bend they create it with their own bodies, and earth bending is not that weak. a trained earth bender can level a city yet it took like 5 of them to lift a rock? I was willing to forgive the crappy characterization, the shoddy dialogue, and even... the horrible name pronunciation, but when they messed up the bending i was to through. that said i gave the movie 3 stars for somehow managing to arrive at the correct ending overall, but i will say this Mr. Shyamalan You have 2 more movies to redeem yourself, so sit down and watch the entire series, take some notes, and understand that the next movie will be even worse if you don't fix the earth bending",The Last Airbender
1192,clandestineo9,very sad about this movie,5,6 July 2010,"Alright, so as a fan of the cartoon series I was very excited for this movie. I got my tickets ahead of time to make sure I made it to the midnight premier and everything. From the looks of the previews I had very high hopes for this movie that it would actually be a great adaptation. Now I had been reading for months the mixed reviews about the cast disappointments and such but I wasn't going to let this bother me. Casting Noah Ringer as Aang I think was a good choice because the kid does look just like the character and even sounds like him and as for the other characters appearances I think Yue was pretty accurate and Zuko was OK except they could have done the hair differently and Katara was decent. Aside from this the characters looked nothing like they should but even that I could forgive. What really upset me is the fact that they couldn't even pronounce the characters names right including the main character Aang. Who the heck is ONG? And that wasn't even the worst of it. I'm being really nice in giving this movie a 5/10 but only because there were a few redeeming points in this movie like the scenery and Uncle Iroh actually having the correct personality. I had such high expectations as would any fan but was seriously let down. If you go to see this movie don't waste your money on 3D because it is not worth it and you will just end up with a headache. I think they should have made each book into at least 2 movies each because in cramming it all into one they left out soooooo much and even ended up changing what really happened in the series. I have heard that there is going to be a ton of extended version stuff when the movie is released on DVD that they had to delete out of the final cut so I am hoping this is true. If they release the other 2 books or even get to make them for that matter I hope this epic fail is a lesson and they make up for it.",The Last Airbender

1194,cheetosme89,"Never seen cartoon, but movie is great",9,6 July 2010,"I've noticed a lot of reviews bashing the movie about how it doesn't follow the cartoon at all. Well, name a movie that does follow what it was based on TV, book, comic, etc. perfectly. I'd never heard of the cartoon and just watched the trailer about 8 hours ago and went and saw the movie in 3D. The acting wasn't amazing, but it wasn't terrible. My best recommendation for when/if you see this movie is to not compare it to the cartoon and you will enjoy this movie. The movie goes by fast, I felt like I had just sat down when it ended. I can't wait for the next movie to come out. I never see a movie twice in theaters, but I would go see this movie again.",The Last Airbender
1195,Youknowofme,An excellent movie,9,6 July 2010,"I saw the movie twice. The first time I saw it was kind of disappointed because it wasn't exactly like the series. Watching it the second I was able to watch not as a comparison to the series but as an independent movies. I have to say after watching the second it was an excellent movie. It appears the writer and director was trying to make the movie realistic as possible if bender was possible, I also appreciate the fact thathe try to have the names pronounced in the proper way which deviated from the original series but made the movie more authentic. I also like the fact that they used real tai chi forms when Water bending. There are a lot of things that I like the movies. There are other things that I liked about the movie.",The Last Airbender
1196,glengordon-784-183391,"Captures the Spirit , Philosophy and Character of the Show",7,6 July 2010,"Despite hearing about some really awful reviews of The Last Airbender, I went to see it because my sister, brother, nieces and I are big fans of the Nickelodeon show. I am also an M. Night Shyamalan fan so I thought it was worth checking out. I was actually not disappointed by this rendition of the story. There will probably be a lot of people who dislike the directing style or the changing of the pronunciation of certain character names, but I still felt that it captured the spirit of the story. All of the major elements of character development are there and the strong currents of Asian philosophy make it a powerful story of responsibility and redemption. I was also surprised and pleased to see that each of the young actors was well cast for his or her part. I thought that Dev Patel made a wonderfully tortured Zuko, and the kids who played Aang, Sokka and Katara played their roles with great poise and pathos. All of the adult roles were well done, too, with great performances for Uncle Iroh, Commander Zhao and Fire Lord Ozai. In addition, the movie features beautiful special effects and gorgeous sets and costumes. As an amateur martial artist I also highly enjoyed the focus on martial arts. All in all, I thought that this film captured a truly multicultural coming-of-age story set in a fun fantasy world. Though I am sure that many were disappointed, I wanted to throw my thoughts in because my family and I really did enjoy the movie and would love to see the trilogy completed in the same style. Fans of the show, martial arts movies or kid fantasy movies should certainly try this one out.",The Last Airbender
1197,mozart_after_midnight,how to fail at making a big budget movie,1,6 July 2010,"plenty of folx have already detailed how bad this movie is. i myself have never watched the series, so i can't comment on some of the inconsistencies. instead, i will take the time to elaborate on some of the abject failures of this travesty of a film.with a budget of $150mil, you shouldn't skimp on the physical details. katara's necklace looks like it was bought for 5 bucks at the counter of a convenience store. the ""rowboat"" that the prince uses looks to be made of frigging iron and has what appears to be a firebox for locomotion...and is handily supplied with an amazingly efficient wooden oar (which in all fairness i guess was all that was really needed as he he used it to get about 15 feet away from the mother ship). the giant, flying, poorly generated air rider thing is seen swimming the last leg of the journey to the Water kingdom, which seems a tad confusing. when a flammable gas and fire mix, they don't wait till unsuspecting people waltz in before exploding, they just sorta go off instantly. that, to name but a few.audio-wise, there weren't too many missteps except for one glaring example. a real voice actor for the narration would perhaps give some credence to what is being said.how much more can be said about the acting? it somehow manages to be worse than in another of the Shay's films;""the happening"".now, as far as making any kind of sense in regards to the balance of the elements, unless the original story spells it out, i can't see any fathomable reason why the water benders who live surrounded by a freaking ocean would fear fire benders who in this version rely on outside sources of fire for any kind of offense. forgive my ignorance, but perhaps a more efficient battle strategy than fighting the invaders hand-to-hand would be to, i don't know, douse the fires with water rendering the bad guys helpless. but then again, i am just a moviegoer and not a leader of thousands of people...a few more random points that make this movie even more painful and laughable: imprisoning the earth benders all together in one place than happens to be all earth, yet they are helpless to escape.100 spear/glaive wielding soldiers cannot stop 1 masked swordsman. spears have obviously shorter attack ranges than swords in this movie's version of weapons.there is one scene during the liberation of the earth benders (of course done in slo-mo) where a single fire soldier literally hops side to side from one foot to the next several times with sword drawn while the Av very, very slowly dances to get his air attack going.simply put, the scene with the Av fighting the soldiers from the stone tablet circle was easily the most boring action sequence ever committed to film.PLEASE do yourself a favor. read what everyone is saying about this film and stay far away. this movie is not very long, but it felt like about 3 hours before i could get out of the theater. oh, and to close, this movie was billed as being 3D?! outside of the opening credits, can someone please explain where? caveat empor...",The Last Airbender

I have used IMDb for many years and never left a comment but I feel compelled to ask anyone who has not seen this movie not to see it. Don't even wait for it to come to network TV. Watch something on the Sci-fi channel instead. I went in with no expectations but to see some good graphics and some 3d effects. I did not pay to see this movie as there was a 2 for 1 special and someone asked me to come with them. I still feel like I was robbed. This is the first film I have been to that the whole theater booed at the end and made demands for the return of their money.I can count on one hand how many times I saw 3d effects and those not very good. I would have walked out but I've never done that so I stayed to the end and I should have shot myself for doing even that. I'm not even going to talk about the acting or the script as I went in knowing it was horrible but come on WHERE WERE THE 3D EFFECTS!!!! Where was the awesome bending!!! Not even that he got right...

1199,software_samurai,Why The Last Airbender will likely be The Last Avatar movie,1,6 July 2010,"Oh, M. Knight Shyamalan. I gave you a chance. I really did. I wanted to believe that despite the horrific casting choices made for this movie, you and your counterparts would deliver a fascinating story that would supersede the disappointing demographics. But, it seems that bad things do come in threes, and MKS can add TLA to his other failures. So, what went wrong? I won't delve into all the issues with this movie (it would take chapters), but I'll bring out the biggest flaws based on character and storyline in my opinion.Aang – First off – apparently MKS and the rest of his crew NEVER watched the show, because if they did, they would know that the pronunciation used of this MAIN character's name is aaa-ng not Ah-ung. OMG. Every time I heard it I wanted to punch someone in the face. Secondly, while I understand that Noah Ringer is new, the fact that he pretty much only had about 10 lines in the whole film is ridiculous. Aang needs to speak. We need to get to know him as an audience, and not just through endless voiceovers from Katara. Noah did a decent job considering his inexperience and his martial arts prowess was well represented. But that was the only good thing about Aang's character that the audience really got to see, which is a travesty in a movie that's supposed to be about him.Sokka – again, MKS didn't check the cliff notes and figure out that this character's name is pronounced Sock-a, not Sow-ca. While Jackson Rathbone (Sokka) may have looked much like his animated counterpart, that's where the similarities ended. Sokka's character in the series was lovable due to his loyalty, protectiveness, clumsiness and comedic timing. Rathbone's comedic abilities are limited and his line delivery was slow, wooden and often emotionless throughout the film. Even his romantic connection to Princess Yue fell flat and seemed completely contrived.Katara – In the series, Katara is a mother figure to the Aang-gang; but it seems that MKS saw these qualities as nagging and almost bitchy at times, because that is how Katara is portrayed in most of the movie.Plot/storyline – Okay, I understand that trying to make one film that covers 20 episodes and effectively 10 hours of storytelling, but I've seen it done. The movie was only 103 mins, I knew this spelled trouble. People have been sitting in the theatre for an easy 2 -3 hours since LoTR, so take a few extra minutes for proper storytelling. The kids would have sat through it, Shyamalan. Avatar was a CHARACTER driven series. The bending, 'racial' issues and even the overall arch of the series were all secondary to the character development of the Aang-gang and Zuko. Shyamalan apparently either missed or dismissed this when writing the screenplay for this film. He seemed to think it was more about the special effects and antagonism. The characters themselves got the least amount of attention, which was the death knell to this film.The movie barely touched on Aang's issues which ran very deep. We have a child who is mentally and emotionally only 12 years old, who's just awakened to find out that a.) 100 years have passed b.) All of his people have been killed c.) The world he knew is in total chaos due to a century old war and d.) That he has to master all of his necessary skills to stop a war in a ridiculously short amount of time. I don't know about you, but that sounds like A LOT for a child to deal with, 112 yrs old or not. That would have been more than enough fodder to fill one movie. But alas, the audience doesn't get a chance to understand Aang's plight, because it's barely presented to them.The pacing was also a huge issue. There were some scenes that were edited so poorly that you almost felt whiplash while others had long moments of wasted time and unclear focal points. Where were you MKS? Did you even show up for work most days? Anyhow, on to the few positives of this film.Zuko – Dev Patel did quite well considering. He was believable as the conflicted Prince, and his character was probably the best represented in this movie. There was just enough about him for the audience to understand his plight, but not so much as to overtake the film.Iroh – again, name mispronounced, but that was all that irked me about this character. Shaun Toub did a great job with bringing out the gentle lion that is Iroh. My only wish is that they would have brought out more of Iroh's comedic side, especially since it's integral to his character development in later seasons.Lord Ozai – This one is kind of a pro and con. A pro in that as usual, Cliff Curtis (Ozai) was great in the role; exuding the regal, indifferent ruthlessness of Ozai's power hungry character. A con in that – WTF is he even DOING in the first film? Yes, we hear about Lord Ozai in the first season of the series and get an overall idea of the menace he is buthe really has no place in the beginning of things. He's the end game, and Aang and co. have more than enough to deal with with Zuko and eventually Azula for Ozai to even be a factor yet. Again, I blame MKS for failing to even glance at the actual series or a script from it.So, in summary, TLA = fail, and I'd be surprised if Paramount gives a sequel a green light. If they do, I BEG of them to dump Shymalan in favor of directors like Jon Favreau or Bryan Singer who actually respect source material and show that in their work. Save your hard earned money for something else.",The Last Airbender
1200,delta-784-760226,Horrible! Don't waste your money....,1,6 July 2010,"This was the worst failure as a director I have seen in years, and more importantly, instead of respecting the material this was based upon, he ruined a greatly loved piece of work.Go ruin your own storyline, instead of taking an amazing one and finding a way to butcher it even when it is so simple and self explanatory. Guess why Avatar and Lord of the Rings took so long to make and cast, because they waited for the right people to audition, they didn't just take the first kids on the street who couldn't act and didn't even look the part.Stop making horrible movies, and stop mispronouncing names. I know you said in an interview that you changed the way they were pronounced to be authentic, but if you really cared about that, you wouldn't have cast the only three white people in the movie at the most important characters. Seriously people, don't waste your money on this movie, my boyfriend and I almost walked out of the theater.I am so sad about this movie, as this was one of my favorite cartoons as a child, and as a writer, this inspired me to start writing fantasy, now I feel like I wasted time and money.",The Last Airbender
1201,colhyena,Worst movie I have ever seen,1,6 July 2010,"I've never been so disappointed with a movie in my life. There wasn't one decent actor in the entire movie. Every character introduced themselves as ""Hi, I am ___, son/daughter of ___, and this is everything about me that is of any importance"" On top of that, it skipped pretty much every important event in the series' book 1. The fight scenes were pathetic, and involved watching bending moves without the bending, or watching the fire nation just stand there and do nothing right before they run away. When the movie ended, the entire audience booed & laughed at the screen. That's a first for me... The gaps in the storyline were filled with vague narrations, then suddenly the characters teleport to the next scene. We don't see them traveling or meeting people during their journeys. The Kyoshi warriors, the face stealer, and pretty much every side character was not included in the movie.",The Last Airbender
1202,kingrooster9,"No, it really isn't that bad. (Have seen it twice)",9,6 July 2010,"I am not a writer, director, or actor like the rest of the folks in some of these reviews. But, I am a movie watcher and owner of many, many film titles. I do not watch much television; however the last time I watched T.V. with my nephew, I became hooked with this animated series (not cartoon)called Avatar: The Last Airbender. It is now THEE greatest T.V. show I have ever watched and the only one that I have purchased on DVD. Then recently a live action film was released based on this series. I didn't know about it until I saw the previews on T.V. a few weeks before it's release.My anticipation sky-rocketed until I decided to use this internet thing. A lot of people were going on and on about the director and how scared they were. ""The Sixth Sense... oh that guy. Now I know what to look forward to."" While I appreciate who makes these films, I may still go a few years before even knowing who made the film. It's the previews that drew me to the theater and never who makes the film. Credit will be given after the film has ended (some of you may have noticed this). Then the movie reviews hit the internet thing and then I decided to go to the film with an un-biased attitude as possible. Until I saw a giant poster hanging from the ceiling. I went into the movie with a smile on my face, sat through it with a smile, and I had an all out grin by the end of the film. As far as the acting goes, the actors who were portraying children sounded like children and the adults, sounded like adults. And on top of that; all characters were lovable, with the exception of Princess Azula. Azula's smile was ever bit as evil as it was in the series (can't wait to see how she runs things). To those who made this film, you will only disappoint me by not continuing the story. After all of the bashing then viewing the big screen, my jaw dropped and then I said: ""Now what was so wrong with that?!"" Maybe I haven't matured yet and still retain that imagination thing.There had better be a trilogy coming and should most certainly have all of the original cast, special FX, composer, wardrobe designers, animals, the guy who brings donuts in the morning, mops and buckets, and yes... the same director! I think we'll see how many people ""hated"" this movie after DVD sales. ""Hey Bobby, I see you got the Airbender there."" Billy said as he carefully hid his copy behind his back. ""Yeah, it's for uh... my little sister."" Bobby replied. ""Yeah, me too. Wait a minute, you don't have a sister.""

1203,nathlieaeq,Terrible.,1,6 July 2010,"This movie was TERRIBLE. Everything about it was wrong. Shyamalan made arbitrary changes just for the sake of change (pronunciation of names for example). This is both completely pointless and irritating to the viewer.I loved, loved, loved the cartoon series -- even though it's a kid's show (I'm 27). Shyamalan should be ashamed of himself. The series on TV was great and had plenty of meat that could have translated quite well into the movie. I had to wait THIRTY MINUTES for anything to happen in the film. That's right, I was positively bored for 1/3rd of the movie. And what's worse? None of that time was spent doing anything meaningful. The bending, while including some impressive ""tai-chi-esque"" movements was slow and included less hand-to-hand combat than I'm accustomed to. In the series, they didn't just stand there and dance, they fought and incorporated their bending into melee fighting styles.The acting was terrible. There is just no other word for it. I know they are kids and perhaps it'll get better as they age, but it was just really bad. Actually, I don't even think it was the kids' fault... The director is the one who should shoulder the blame for this as he's the one who told them how to look, act, and move. Sokka was reminiscent of Anakin. Emotionless and boring. Yes, that bad.I think the story was condensed OK, but it certainly could have been done better. There were bigger, more important things that were left out. It was so bad that the first thing I did when I got home was put on the cartoon series to help purge the movie from my mind. I'd rate it less than 1 if it was an option. Don't waste any money on this movie. Send a clear message that if they plan to make more movies, we won't watch them if Shyamalan is directing them.",The Last Airbender

The action was fantastic although the lead kid acting was a tad stone-faced but other than that I loved the effects and story. I notice a lot of criticism from what seems to be the fans of the cartoon or M Night haters. This is an adaption of a cartoon which means it shouldn't and doesn't have to be a direct depiction of the animated series.The story was great but the pacing should have been a tad faster. I love the ending setup to work into what will hopefully be the sequel. I do think thanks to how well my family liked the movie I will check out the books and series which is what this kind of adaption is for also so in that respect it succeeds also. I did skip the 3-d as I heard ahead of time that part was rushed and was an afterthought but if folks would have researched it they would have saw the same.,The Last Airbender
1205,melloncollie03,This movie grows on you after the second time...LOL!!,8,6 July 2010,"First time I watched the movie, I was outraged. Shyamalan, after investing $300M bringing the world of Avatar to life, couldn't keep the simple proper pronunciation of the main character's names. Aang was ""ong"", Sokka was ""soh-kah"", and Uncle Iroh was ""EE-rah"". WHAT?!! WHO Are these people?? No matter how well the movie's expensive settings and CGI special effects tempt me to suspend my disbelief, the character's mispronounced names would just jolt me back into furious hatred! On top of that, compressing 420 minutes of complex material into 2 hours and 30 minutes would be challenging enough, but Shyamalan dared to accomplish this impossible feat in 1 hour and 30, dumping out key plots that develop character depth. What happened to Sokka getting over his sexism by putting on a dress and getting trained by the wily Kyoshi warriors? How about Katara's stubborn stand against injustice when she had an epic waterbending showdown against Master Pakku in the North Pole? What about Aang's playfulness with him inventing the airball game, riding the giant koi fish or most importantly penguin sledding??? Why do we get one-dimensional stiffness from all the characters? These additions probably wouldn't have cost that much time and money since he was willing to shell out $300 M. (Side note: Eclipse was 2 hours long and it costed $65M to produce: It also had less material to work with!!!) To make it worse, Shyamalan changed so many things. Firebenders not being able to bend without external source of fire. Earthbenders not being able to earthbend despite of being surrounded by earth not metal. Waterbending women.... It doesn't end there. There seems to be a lot of show with no significant results. Uncle Iroh shows off his dragon fire bending skill after the moon spirit was killed in front of him, all to no avail. Aang creates a huge tidal wave that crashes on no one.However, once I got over all these things missed and wronged about the TV series, I watched it again the next day being the big nerd that I am and surprisingly enjoyed it. I think Shyamalan had to create coherence in the movie independent of the series. I thought the actors particularly the main characters were pretty believable, especially Noah Ringer and Dev Patel. I thought the costumes, particularly that of the earthbenders, were true to the cartoons. The North Pole Water Tribe village was awe-inspiring, especially when the water gates were being raised. That was pretty cool. The kung fu was elegant, graceful and powerful. I appreciated all of this a lot more when I was resigned to the fact that it is impossible for this movie to even hold a candle to the TV series...I'd watch it again and buy the movie when it comes out but that's because I'm die hard. I don't think anyone else will though.Bottom line: I wish Shyamalan picked a fan to edit and critique the film. I would have gladly quit my job and volunteered just to fix this mess.",The Last Airbender

Some reviewers have stated that the film should have gone into the theological aspects a bit more, but I am glad they didn't. Save the heavy movies for the fall and winter. Keep the summer movies light and action-packed. I'll remind those that were overly critical of the acting in this movie that the Harry Potter crew, especially in the early movies, were not renowned for their acting chops. They developed over time and with age. The Avatar books get deeper as they go, just like H.P. I hope they give M. Night a chance to complete the series. Yeah, M. Night's recent ""serious"" movies have been lackluster. Reading some of the reviews, I wonder if people were expecting this to be another Sixth Sense. I'm glad he's branching out and getting away from the ""gotcha"" type movies he got famous with. I strongly encourage those that liked this film for what it was - a synoptic romp through the first book of the Avatar series (which consisted of 20 half-hour episodes) with excellent special effects - to offer up some positive reviews to counter the unnecessary lambasting that this film has received so far. Review the MOVIE, not the director. I should note that I spend A LOT of time watching movies. Those of you that have such negative views - maybe don't expect so much next time.

I sat through the controversy over casting and said it would be okay because like all movies you give them the benefit of the doubt. That little spark of hope was crushed in the first 5 minutes of the film. The opening sequence obviously pays homage to the series but, it butchers itself with an unnecessary introduction and far to lengthy explanation of the Avatars duties. The film is choppy and eliminates characters that are important later in the series, Kyoshi Warriors anyone. Makes the Admiral into a slippery weasel. Don;t get me wrong he was a weasel but he was a smart weasel who used and manipulated beautifully. He was not really interested in the advancement of the Fire nation, he was out for him. Zuko attempts to sound human, Iroh acted beautifully but sadly his lines are horrible. The movie is missing what made the series great, Character development, a followable plot and oh imperfect heroes which any age group can identify with.

1209,corytheconquerer,Just when I thought M. Night Shyamalan couldn't do any worse...,1,6 July 2010,"My rating shows 1 out of 10 only because I couldn't give it a lower score. It really deserves -12.The Last Airbender is the latest of M. Night Shyamalan's horrid movies. For all of those avid Avatar fans who loved the show: this movie is not for you. Although, I'm not really sure who this movie IS for. The effects were good-ish, the scenery was beautiful, and the character development was... well... there was none.If you know the show at all, you know that Aang (or ""Aww-ng"" in this movie) is a fun-loving, goofy preteen who is friendly, kind, and just. In this movie, he is a somber, solemn, and intense little kid who likes to stare just slightly off camera a lot. Katara changes from a compassionate, trusting, and inspiring character into a cheesy, cheap imitation that appears to randomly give out pointless trivia at odd moments. (To Zuko: ""I'm Katara, the only waterbender from the whole Southern Water Tribe.)Sokka (Soak-a in this movie) is for the most part played decently, although his character is supposed to be 15 while the actor looks closer to 25. He also loses his quirkiness, sarcasm, and sexism. In fact, you can just ignore the first part. He was terribly done.Zuko and Iroh, however, seem to have been played by real actors, not just some random people pulled off the street. Zuko actually acts like himself for the most part, although he is not nearly as angry as he should be. Iroh, however, has lost every single characteristic that made him the lovable Uncle from the show.The plot was missing entirely. What was originally a masterful storyline becomes a sequence of random clips strung together to form an hour and a half long youtube-like video.If I wanted to, I could rant on and on for pages. I am a huge fan of the show, and I practically have the entire series memorized. I can nitpick every little thing that was unlike the show, but that would be pointless. My point is that even for someone who knows nothing about the show, this movie is just plain horrible. In fact, for someone who knows nothing about the show, this movie is extremely hard to follow. Even for someone like me who knows exactly what is supposed to come next, this movie doesn't make much sense.All in all, this movie was a complete waste of time and money. It only cost me five dollars, but it was still a horrible deal. I feel like they should refund me at least twice what I paid for having seen that disaster.",The Last Airbender

The film has received overwhelmingly negative reviews. Wow. That is all I have to say about this film.It's almost like M.Night went to a kindergarten class and had them help write the script. Are kidding me? This was some of the worst dialogue I've seen in a long time, the last time I've seen dialogue like this was when I first saw Sky High (another terrible movie, but that is neither here nor there).The acting was hard to watch, by the time the movie had reached the 20 minute mark I was embarrassed to be in the movie theater, it was also the first time I actually considered leaving the theater this early but I decided to bite the bullet and see it though to the end. I honestly think this movie would have had better performances if they put a bunch of monkey's in the costumes and had them run around the entire movie throwing feces at each other. And Goddamn, is it too much to ask for just a little character development? I think the worst performance was shown by Nicola Peltz who completely destroyed Katara the character.All in all there are a few positive things about the film. The music was incredible, right up there with The Lord of The Rings, IMO. The cgi wasn't bad and the fight scenes were pretty well choreographed, but there weren't enough of them to make the movie watchable.If M.Night pitched a new movie idea to any studio after releasing this piece of garbage I wouldn't be surprised if they laughed in his face. I know I would. Please do us loyal fans of the original cartoon a favor and don't make the two sequels, please...for the love of God don't make the two sequels.

People complain about how Shyamalan had a large budget, but that only goes so far. You need to pay to get to the locations, to feed the actors, for all the employees and such. It takes not only a big chunk of money, but also manpower and time to make a film. I think he did well with the budget. Another complaint is about their ethnicity. There are only so many skilled actors out there with Inuit/Native blood, and what else do you expect from a film in the U.S.? Of course it's going to have Caucasian actors, though I expected a more broad cast in terms of ethnicity, it's not all too important so long as the acting is decent. Which leads me to the next subject. People complain the acting was sub-par, and I beg to differ. Sure, it could have been much better, but it also could have been much worse. The stunts were fantastic in my opinion, and I'm not one to enjoy such flashy things. People also complained about the special effects. They were great, stop nit-picking at the film for no valid reason. Shyamalan could have stuck us with some cheap SyFy original movie effects, but he didn't. They were good, but they can only look as realistic as the concept it's being made to be. Lastly, all I hear is ""baww, they left out a whole lot!"" Of course they did, you dolts. It's got a run-time of about 95 minutes, which only allots so much time for the story. Shyamalan had to trim it down, include what was necessary and what wasn't. Sure, I would have liked other parts from the show to be in the film, or follow it and have it play out as the show did, but then there wouldn't be any purpose in watching the movie instead of the animated series, now would there be? It's the same with any television show or book made into a movie. People complain about missing content, or content not being 100% correct, and that's because there's not enough time and it was the writer's and director's visions, not yours or the original creator's. If you want to watch a film adaptation of something, do so. Don't complain about it being off. If you want it spot-on, go watch the television series.I give the film a six. It touched most of the bases, had great visuals, a good story-line, great score, good acting and very good directing. It's not the best movie of 2010, but I know for certain it's no where near the worst. If you're a fan of the animated series(and not a fan-boy/girl who loves to nitpick), then I highly recommend you watch it. It's worth the time. The ending may tug at your heart-strings as it did mine.Well, there's my first review/rant. Enjoy.Monkeylad",The Last Airbender
1213,fallon-hogan584,This movie was a horrendus mess... and a giant waste of money.,1,7 July 2010,"The instant I saw that M. Knight was in charge of this movie I was worried. His past couple of movies have been horrible. And indeed I was right. As a fan of the series, he murdered the plot, the names and the characters on a level I did not think possible. Only a few minutes into the movie I was worried, and not long after that I was tell my husband (also a fan of the series) there was no hope. People left the theater and never even came back. This movie had NO character development, a confused plot (when it is all too clear in the series) and spent time on the least little things instead of what was important. And Aang? Yeah... He was GREAT at water bending, it was Katara who had problems. If it was a matter of changing the characters appearance a little to get someone who could act, it would have been fine by me. The appearances are about the only thing done right, along with the Northern Water Temple... other than that... Good Grief.",The Last Airbender
1214,Fourdfourm,"Biggest let down all year, maybe ever.",1,7 July 2010,"Now I'm probably being a bit too harsh with a ""1/10"" vote. However I'm justified given my love for the show verses the failure of the movie. Now to begin, if you've never seen the show you should. It's three easy seasons to watch and you can get it on NetFlix instant watch. So go do it. No really, go. I'll wait... Okay now that you've done that don't go see the movie. Nope really, don't do it. When it comes out on video I'll let you do it but not till then. This movie is based on very fun show and is made by someone who has a reputation for good movies (if you don't count The Happening... damn that was bad). So you will be excited to watch it. However, what you don't know is every ounce of casting, sans Prince Zuko, was terrible. Here are a couple of examples. -Uncle Iroh was not fat, short or funny. -Katara wasn't cute, at least not cute enough. -Aang was a decent choice as far as looks and being able to do the martial arts but damn was he the worst actor since that kid who tried to play Anakin in Episode 1. That brings me to the next point. Everyone in this movie was a terrible actor, sans Prince Zuko again. Then on top of that you have a movie that is trying to put 20 episodes of content into a movie. Then M. Knight decides to make the movie only an hour and forty-five minutes? Are you kidding me? This movie could have easily been a three hour style LotR epic and it should have been. Why the hell wasn't it? So for a second lets set aside the fact that it's short. So I already know going into it that things are going to be cut out. Probably a lot of things. Things that I would have loved to see in the movie. Okay I'll live. However once you're done with the movie you realize not only did they cut the little things but they cut the whole damn soul out of the movie. Characters that were suppose too be funny weren't. Hell no one was funny bar the one time Appa's tail fell on Sokka. Then on top of taking all the character out of the characters M. Knight decides to skip everything that needs to be explained (i.e. the story line) and then spends the entire movie spoon feeding you the stuff you don't need explained. One of the best examples I have of this is when Sokka meets the Princes Yue. Instead of taking a couple of minutes to set up even a basic story line between these two characters he spoon feeds you with a quick narration saying ""they became instant friends."" FFFFFUUUUUU. There are all sorts of examples like this. Where he flat out tells us something that should be painfully obviously and then skips every part of the story that makes it a... STORY!Oh and I guess I should mention this since everyone else is ranting about it. THEY DIDN'T PRONOUNCE THE NAMES CORRECTLY! Well at least most of them they didn't. Oh what's that? You wanted to them to be pronounced more authentically? W T F. You didn't bother casting according to their ethnicity (i.e. most of them should have been Asian) but all the sudden the script has to be true to the culture? No, shut up M. Knight... just shut up.I'm sorry, at the end of the day this movie was a complete travesty. The movie completely alienates even most die-hard fans that I know and there is no way it's good enough to make it up with the general population. Best bet is this will be hit with a couple ignorant parents that want to take their kids to a movie. The only bigger travesty would be if they allowed M. Knight to make the sequels. By the gods I plead to you to just let this go. M. Knight said during an interview with Time that the movie was bigger than anything he's ever done (as far as production goes) and he felt he almost lost control over it while shooting. Well I'd submit that he did lose control on it and all made it out alive is an empty, soulless shell that resembles something based in the Avatar universe.",The Last Airbender
1215,Lexik721,"Horrible, made me very upset!",1,7 July 2010,"I watched this show from the time I was young, when I heard the movie was coming out I was psyched! But when I started watching it I noticed how horrifyingly inaccurate it was, they changed the names of the characters such as Sokka and Aang, and they missed a lot of important parts in the show wasting them on other things, along with that they didn't get the characters look right either, the only accurate costume and hair was Sokka, in the show Katara is supposed to have waist length hair in a braid with to strand of hair separate, they had her hair down the whole time. To add on to the inaccuracy Uncle Iroh is supposed to be a short chubby man with gray shoulder length hair with some pulled into a ponytail the actor had dark hair more waist length, he was also tall and thin, Zuko (another mispronounced name in the movie) had about 3 different pronunciations throughout the movie, and instead of the traditional fire nation ponytail with all hair around it shaved he had a crew cut! Me and my friends were extremely horrified at the inaccuracy of this movie!",The Last Airbender
1216,fightoplankton,Deserving of better reviews,6,8 July 2010,"Being a fan of the television series, I've eagerly waited for the release of The Last Airbender. As the reviews began to pour in, I became distraught. Bad acting. Bad writing. Bad 3D. Bad casting. Boring. The list went on. The most positive review that could be found was still a negative one. It wasn't until a week after its release that I was able to see it. I walked into the theater expecting to be disappointed, as the IMDb rating fell below the threshold of what I consider a bearable film. I left pleasantly surprised. THE LAST AIRBENDER IS DESERVING OF BETTER REVIEWS!The film is fairly faithful to television series. The casting wasn't terribly on spot and the acting wasn't spectacular. I can't comment on the post-production conversion to 3D since I saw a traditional showing. I had expected a greater amount of special effects. I found it a bit unusual that they chose to pronounce several things differently than the writers of the original show. Not that it hurt the film. It was just slightly irksome to a fan. The biggest qualm I have with the movie is that it was too short, representing only a portion of the TV show's story. By the film's end, Aang is only familiar with two of the elements, which I think was a poor decision. Fastfowarding to the end of a show's plot line might have been improved the film quite a bit. In the end, the film was far from boring, and it might even satisfy someone who is familiar with its televised counterpart. I found it very enjoyable and worth seeing.",The Last Airbender
1217,imdb-785-972529,A decent attempt,8,10 July 2010,"I can see why a lot of the animated series fans hated this movie. After all, it's pretty difficult to condense nearly ten hours of a TV series into a single 2 hour movie. But as a fan of the series myself, I thought it was a decent attempt. Overall, I liked it.Then again, I didn't go in with high expectations. I hoped for something that gave a decent representation of the series, had decent casting choices and acting, cool visuals and would entertain me for two hours. In all those regards, it met my expectations.This movie is NOT the TV series redone as a live action movie. It IS a decent attempt to tell the same story that season one of the TV series told.",The Last Airbender
1218,moerbo-785-250231,Honest opinion,1,7 July 2010,"Im going to spoil it for you!!! It was not good.....This film is so bad that I felt the obligation to register on this site to warn prospective viewers not to waste their time. The Animated series was truly awesome almost every single episode had a memorable moment/quote or lesson this movie lacked all of those attributes. I felt like bending myself out of the movie theater. I gave the film the benefit of a doubt but 20 minutes in to the film I wanted to leave. The characters didn't build any sort of rapport with each other (or the audience). There is no character development and the story does not flow. The characters from the animated series were not personified on the big screen in any shape or form. I was truly disappointed. I do not think anybody who worked on this movie even saw the show. Honestly don't waste your time. I truly hope this film does not end anyones career but it was not good at all. Nickelodeon, you lost a lot of credibility with this film, a second and third movie won't even make it to DVD...maybe VHS",The Last Airbender
1219,cartoon-kid,My Opinion of The Last Airbender,1,8 July 2010,"I was greatly disappointed with how a lot of the names were misspelled, the original story line was practically thrown out the window, and how much was added in. For example, in this movie, Aang never contacted Roku who told him where to find Ko (the face stealer) who could give him information on the ocean and moon spirits. Another thing that really annoyed me was how nearly everyone mispronounced the other characters' names. To continue, Zuko doesn't look like he's even been burned...more like scratched by his pet kitten. The last thing I will say, (I could go to about 15 with this list...and thats just major things); Iroh...he is supposed to be fat, this Iroh looked anorexic...Okay this will be the last thing, firebenders...really? not being able to firebend without having a source of fire nearby? thats absolutely ridiculous...(Also, I realize that they couldn't put the entire 1st book into the movie, but they could've done better...especially with the casting)",The Last Airbender
1220,dismalmoron,Disgraceful,1,8 July 2010,"Be forewarned: This has spoilers. This review contains information pertinent to fans of the cartoon series.Disgraceful. This is the only word to be used in description of this atrocity that M. Night has created.I must admit, I am a fan of the Cartoon. I have read and listened to just about everything Mike and Bryan have had to say about their project: From how they researched everything, and used they vast accrual of knowledge to benefit their works.In Example: Each nation, Earth, Fire, Air, and Water, had their own special form: Hung Gar, Northern Shaolin, Ba Gua, and Tai Chi, respectively. This was completely lost in the adaptation. Truthfully, the bending skills were overdone, with large ""wind-ups"" before the actual bending occurred. Combined with the scene being shot in slow-motion, it was like trudging through the Foggy Swamp.The cinematography was... Lacking. The rendered background and detailed sets were gorgeous. The props and clothing were beautiful. The use of space was akin to something a first year film-school student would be proud of. Definitely not the exceptional use of camera I've come to expect from Shyamalan. Not that I expected much else from him, but I was thinking I could at least count on visual aesthetics and composition. Wrong.The actual characters, which aside from the research, are what made the story, were oddly missing. Instead, the actors delivered their lines with bland sentiments, displaying their emotions sparsely and randomly, without even attempting the personalities. Psychologists call this Flat Affect accompanied by Manic Episodes. I call it poor directing. When the adult actors were on the screen, it seemed they were able to guide themselves a bit; but it is apparent that M. Night was ""out to lunch,"" throughout the duration of filming.One of the only things I enjoyed about the film was the story. NOT THE SCRIPT. The basic plot that was created to make it feasible for 8 hours of cartoons to be adapted into 103 minutes of movie. The plot wasn't bad. The execution was poor. The movie seemed to jump from one episode to another, hitting on non-pertinent points; and glazing over some of the more important ones. Example: Rescuing the Earthbenders. Was it important? Yes. More important than Zuko attacking at the Air Temple? No. More important than the history provided at Kyoshi Island? No.The other thing that truly upset me, having a background in sound design, the lack of The Track Team was disappointing. Along with all the other research and effort contributed to the animated series, the progress they made in creating an ambiance fitting for this mystical, mythic story was discarded. Just like they were. It's disheartening. The soundtrack was mediocre at best. I did not notice it, so it did not subtract from the film, but I did not hear good usage of it, meaning it did not add to the film either.Information was very convoluted. If you'd never seen the cartoon, you'd be confused, Nay - You'd be lost. The Fire Nation was consistently said to be an evil, destructive force; Yet there was no proof of this in the film. No flashbacks to when the Air Temples were destroyed, No narratives of Ba Sing Se, and no real evidence of their fierce, warrior-nation likeness. Small references were made to things that happened, but if you did not know what they were speaking about, you would never know. It's like the animated fans are (granted - dissatisfied) Members of the Order of the White Lotus, and everyone else is merely Zuko.There is not enough space, in a mere 1,000 words, to describe all the things wrong with this film. Mispronunciation of names, lack of research, and lack of respect for a critically acclaimed animated series all contributed to this appalling, shameful feature film. What I have mentioned here is but a brief summary. I can only hope that Mr. Shyamalan listens to the fan base this time, and makes the second film much better. Either that, or Nickelodeon will hire a director that is worth his(or her) salt.In Short: Do not waste your money. I met a Shyamalan fan for coffee today. I had not seen the movie, and expressed that I would never pay to see this movie. She paid for the tickets on the premise that if it was a good movie, I would pay her back. She had that much respect for him. Right after the deceit of Aang at the Air Temple, she turned to me and said that the movie was awful, and no payment was necessary.This movie is a disgrace. A disgrace to the fans, who expected something decently representative of the original; A disgrace to the movie community, that this disjointed Frankensteinian Creation is called a film; A disgrace to the actors, because the director was obviously absent; A disgrace to the crew, for even going along with the shoddy, ill-produced shots they were told to create; and finally, a disgrace for Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan himself, who made The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and The Village.",The Last Airbender
1221,jared-caldwell,"Shayamalan needs collaborative writing, new Producers, and a complete overhaul of Editing and Casting before filming Book Two",1,8 July 2010,"I try not to give anything critical away but I do discuss some plot items; honestly, for this one it wouldn't really matter...I love to go to the movies and get lost in another world; to forget reality for a little while, accept the ""rules"" of the reality created by and for the movie, and just enjoy the roller-coaster that is a movie. I get irritated with people whom are always thinking about the plot and trying to figure it out as the movie is playing- ENJOY THE MOVIE ALREADY! Because of this, I rarely find a movie that I do not like. Movies that get poor reviews are often times fun flicks to me.All of that being said, I have now wasted 103 minutes of my life that I cannot get back; Shyamalan really disappointed me with this one. Overall, the story line has some serious potential and could have made for a cool action flick. It has heavy roots in Eastern beliefs and philosophy; Martial Arts (specifically King Fu) are a major part of the script, though not as a form of Martial Art but as a means of manipulating elements. However, it relied too heavily on the visual effect of the martial arts and some CGI that was either oddly out of place or over the top, and missed the mark on the rest of the story. That sucks too, because I am also the guy who typically loves the CGI- even when everyone said a film was overly reliant upon it. The lines were delivered flat and without emotion, the characters were not believable, the editing was horrible, and the timing was off on everything from delivery of lines to fight sequences. In one scene Aang is marshaling ""Benders"" of Earth to rise up against the Fire Nation prison guards, and the timing of several strikes was far behind the actual movement of the individual being hit- especially poor since that which was striking him was a CGI effect, and the timing was completely up to someone after the fact at a computer screen, not a stunt coordinator on set.Much of the movie was disjointed and did not make sense. I have not seen the Avatar films, so I do not know if the Fire Nation soldiers typically ride giant Kimono Dragons or not, but these things just suddenly appeared out of nowhere at one point, and really make no sense (it is the Fire Nation, so if they rode something that breathed fire, or had some fire resistant properties, that would be understandable).Noah Ringer was picked to play the title role apparently because of his martial arts abilities rather than his acting. He was emotionless at times when he should have been showing angst, fear, or anger and demonstrated disjointed emotions that were overly done in other places- there was no barometer for this kid's emotional depth. Martial arts ability over acting savvy seemed to be the norm for most of the main cast, with the exception of Jackson Rathbone as Sokka- his performance was horrifically painful to watch, yet he demonstrated no martial arts abilities whatsoever in the film so there really was no excuse for his being cast- what was Buff smoking? The storyline needed work too. A love interested is started in the final act of the film, but it is never really fleshed out, and comes to a premature climax (no pun intended), with far too much emotion (in the writing, the acting was, once again, flat) for the amount of development. The whole relationship was a poor irrelevance in the storyline and should have been ignored entirely. The plot was full of little spotty jolt that prevented it from flowing smoothly as one script, and some of the dialog was painful to hear.Unfortunately, the best performances were given by actors playing supporting and tertiary characters such as Shaun Toub as Uncle Iroh, Damon Gupton as Monk Gyatso (this is saying a lot since he didn't have a single speaking line in the movie), Randall Duk Kim as ""Old Man in Temple"", and a girl playing the daughter to Commander Zhoa (she appeared for the last 5 seconds of the film, had one line, and displayed the most accurate emotion and timing in delivery of anyone in the entire film).The kid at the concession stand before the movie, when I asked if he had seen the film, said this of it: ""I don't know why M. Knight even tries anymore"". I hate to say, I almost agree with him. If books two through four get some serious treatment, production, and casting overhauls the franchise may be salvageable, but this is going to take a lot of work. Fire Scott Aversano, Frank Marshall, Sam Mercer, and M Knight as Producers, Douglas Aibel from Casting, Conrad Buff IV from Editing (and never let them perform those jobs on any other film ever again), and recast and re-write as much as possible for books two through four.As a guy who loves movies just for the sake of movies, I knew this one sucked when I was checking my watch wondering when it was going to be over, forcing myself to finish watching because I had spent twelve bucks that I could not get back and hoping- PRAYING- that it might get better. Alas, it did not, but it did finally end. This particular roller-coaster was a disappointment- kind of like something that advertises a great thrill-ride, and ends up being a long drawn-out teacup ride with broken gears and bad upholstery.RECOMMENDATION: wait for video to watch it (preferably on Redbox, Netflix, or somewhere else it will be cheap for you) and only then so that you can be ready in hopes that Book Two will be better and you and you need watch Book One to catch up to the storyline. Safe your theater budget for something better.",The Last Airbender
1222,jadimo_hagar,M. Night Shyamalan managed to achieve what I thought was impossible: I fell asleep,1,8 July 2010,"It's hard for me to find something good to say about this movie. Even if I hadn't seen the series (which I totally loved by the way), this movie would probably still be classified as one of the worst movies I've ever seen.For starters, the dialog, it simply sucked. That kid playing Aang (Noah Ringer) could have better passed as a Pinocchio. Everything he said was so stiff, without emotion. I think he might be nominated for the worst leading actor. The other actors didn't prove to be much better. Like Commander Zhao (Aasif Mandvi), was that supposed to be the main antagonist, just pathetic. The names were another quite ridiculous point. Why start pronouncing the names differently from the series? Thirdly: the most incoherent plot I've ever seen. I'm even surprised that there are people who didn't see the series put a good review here. Because the plot didn't make sense in the least. Before you could truly start enjoying a scene it was already over. Number fourth: I can't even use Sokka's quote: ""At least the effects were decent."" Computer animation and effects have developed to a point were we are left awestruck. I had expected the plot would not be able to live up to it's animated version, but the effects, surely the effects would have made this movie worth watching ... NOT! Appa and Momo looked like stuffed plushies (like the way they would have looked like in the eighties). Then the fighting with the elements, lots of limb-movement, little bending. It looked much like ""The day of Black sun"", were that Fire Nation soldier starts swooshing around and nothing happens. And then M. Night Shyamalan managed the impossible: the dialog was so stiff and boring to listen too, that I even fell asleep. That has never happened before, certainly not with a movie I watched for the first time. There are in my opinion only 2 words for this: EPIC FAIL!I think I'll stick to the animated version.",The Last Airbender
1223,salamane,Go with an Open Mind and enjoy the Bending!,6,8 July 2010,"Overall, as a fan of the show, I really enjoyed it. Visually stunning, wonderful representations of the costumes, good sets. The different bending techniques were beautifully displayed; made me want to learn Tai-Chi! The casting was innovative and chose more for acting and character than visual accuracy, which I think was a good choice in many cases. Did the movie follow the plot of season 1 exactly, no of course not. They condensed a whole season into a 2hr movie. And did a great job. Fans will see many of their favorite elements: the blue spirit with matched blades, Momo, Appa (who looked a lot like a luck dragon), all types of bending, a great air staff for Ang, and much more. For those unfamiliar with the series it was broken down and throughly explained, almost overwhelmed with info!I've heard a lot of complaints about the ethnicities used in casting. But I believe the movie held true to the ideals of the show. Each nation, each area of the world, represented by a different ethnicity. At no point were all the characters on an entire planet supposed to be Asian.Oh, and they pronounce Ang differently, why?What I missed most from the original series was its sense of humor. There was a serious attempt at making the movie all about big epic battles and Ang's inner conflict, LOTR style...which didn't work. The original series plays heavily on the characters personalities and humor. The series has a lot of secondary characters, which can make it difficult to develop all the characters fully in only two hours. However, Sokka's bad jokes and humorous character were sorely missing from the film. Especially when we are expected to believe in his romance with Yue very quickly; a bit more character building would have helped with this. I enjoyed the references to many different parts of the 1st season, but felt the movie could have done with less journey and more character interaction.That being said I felt he explored Ang and Prince Zuko's characters very well. Even Uncle, who physically looked very different, played his part with just the right amount of relaxation and wisdom. Excellent casting for Yue by the way, spot on!The best addition to the movie was the need for fire to be present in order to fire bend. I always felt this was lacking in the series. If you put an earth bender in a metal cage they are trapped, but put a fire bender on a row boat and they can create fire? That Uncle could create fire from nothing added a nice dimension to his character.Music was a bit lackluster. I only really noticed it during the battle scenes. Where they tried, and failed, to create a Two-Towers inspiring battle scene moment.(Spoiler Alert) The only other major change I was surprised by was at the end. Ang does not become the ocean spirit who destroys the fire nation ships. I liked the ending, but had definitely been looking forward to the Ocean spirit.Overall I say, go and see this movie! Be open minded and just enjoy all the bending. Otherwise we'll never get to see the other 2 movies!!",The Last Airbender
1224,spock123,M. night should direct commercials,1,8 July 2010,"OK people, I will not waste much of your time by telling you what most people have been saying already. The movie is a huge disappointment on so many levels. I have only seen a few episodes of the cartoon series thanks to my stepdaughter. She loves it and I can understand why. Let's think about what could have been done to prevent this in the first place. How did M. Night get to write and direct in the first place? Out of all the qualified directors out there...you mean to tell me that M. Night was the most qualified? Get out! Don't they interview people for positions of great importance? Did someone just hand him this assignment without asking how he was going to approach the subject? I read a review from a woman who said she liked the film and that it was good, I suppose she thinks ""battlefield earth"" deserved an Oscar! Out of all the screen writers out there....you mean to tell me that M. Night was the most qualified? I say ""get out"" again! ""Sixth Sense"" was his best film and it is apparent that it was a fluke. I believe this attempt should be what pushes him out of the feature film directing biz.Many ""Star Wars"" fans hated Lucas for what he did for the later installments, however he couldn't have messed this up. Where were the big names on this project? How could the creators allow such freedom with their characters? How can one director serve up so many disappointments time after time and still be allowed more chances? Look at some of the greatest book-to-cinema adaptations and marvel at how they did it. It is not impossible. Take ""Lord of the Rings"" for example, it is rich in every detail. Not to mention the immensely successful ""Harry Potter"" series. JK Rowling would not have allowed such a travesty. I have not read books from either, yet I have seen the movies and have been thoroughly entertained. In fact, I have seen them numerous times. 'Airbender' I have seen once, and if I could, I would go back in time to avoid that decision. M. Night is now on my list. I will not give him another chance unless by some slim chance he does another movie and the critics give it 4 stars. I am out! I have heard the comment for people to lighten up because it is a ""kid's"" film. What? Kids have to get second or third-rate material just because they are kids? So, what can you do now? Well, if you are reading these reviews and haven't seen it, don't. Perhaps you wasted $5 or in my case $14 dollars (3D), then you may want to go ask for your money back. You may get it, you may not. At least the theater owner has feedback on your disappointment and will think twice about an M. Night movie in the future. Another step would be to write Paramount pictures to let them know that if they do a sequel with M. Night at the helm, then you would not support the film. Sounds a little harsh? Well you are a consumer and your money is as important as anyone's. Not only did you spend money but time as well. Did you pay for parking, babysitter, or gas for your car? If you still want to see the film for viewing sake, I suggest waiting for it to come out on DVD when the price is comparable to its value, two dollars. I am going to rent or buy the animated series!All is not lost! It can be fixed. All is needed is a screenwriter who can work hand-in-hand with the creators to get the story right, a casting agent to get the right actors for the parts, and a director who understands Nickelodeon's Avatar and can put it all together in a cohesive manner. It is not impossible. National Lampoon Vacation movies have had different actors for the children, the Batman movies have had different actors for lead roles as well as different directors for the sequels.OK, so go try to get your money back and write Paramount and tell them how you feel. Also it wouldn't hurt to break the news to M. Night, that he should be directing commercials instead of directing feature films. Because if his commercials stink, you only wasted a max of one minute of your life compared to 103 minutes.",The Last Airbender
1225,sonicshot45,Great movie for fans and non-fans,9,8 July 2010,"I thought this was a really great movie, I have no clue as to why this got such a bad rating. The acting was a little bad at the first but after the first five minutes, it's great. There were three characters I thought that stood out the most, Aang, Zuko, and Iroh. These characters were played to absolute perfection. The 3-d effects were great, but at times they could have been done better. The story was very easy to follow because I had watched the show many times over. My cousin went with me and could easily follow the story even though he had never watched a minute of the show.This movie is a must-see for fans and non-fans. You should go see it tonight, NOW!",The Last Airbender
1226,branonn,It seems really rushed,5,9 July 2010,"This movie isn't as bad as people say it is. It is FAR from perfect but it isn't completely terrible. Im going to compare this movie to the TV Series. First off, Ill start by saying that they got about half the names from wrong. Avatar is pronounced Ov-a-tar instead of Av-a-tar. Aang is pronounced Ong instead of Ang. Sokka is pronounced Soak-ka instead of Sok-ka. Iroh is pronounced Eer-roh instead of I-roh. Also, many events not done right and some even completely missed. I guess that's what happens when you try to put 20 episodes worth of events into less than 2 hours. Characters didn't even look right. Especially Zuko, the skin tone, the hair, the scar. The scar is way to small and barely noticeable compared to the series which takes up almost half of his face. Some characters aren't even seen in the movie. Bumi, Jet, Haru, and more. Haru kind of was in the movie but wasn't called Haru and was much younger than him. There are many more problems but if you haven't seen the TV Series it would probably just be another movie to you. You wouldn't know there was more to the story than just the movie.",The Last Airbender
1227,tlongo-787-353365,a little heat and I could have had endless popcorn,1,9 July 2010,"This ""adaptation"" (more like ""abomination"") was corny, to put it lightly. I am not going to bore anyone with discussions of cinematic this and that. Read the several hundred previous reviews which all reverberate themselves. But I do have to crack fun at the already mentioned earth-bender revolt early in the movie. Several earth-benders appear in a triangular formation, going through the motions to raise and haul small rock (as one reviewer described it, ""the size of a fat cat""). I was actually waiting for a Michael Jackson beat to start and for the earth bender at the front of the formation to crab his crotch, scream ""wooo-hoo-hoo!"" and go into the moon-walk. I think I may have even blushed out of embarrassment at that point.I have tried, and tried and tried to enjoy M. Night's movies. Albert Einstein described insanity as doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Where's my straight-jacket. Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo!",The Last Airbender
1228,RikkiMcD,Surprisingly pleased,8,9 July 2010,"I am surprised to see so many bad reviews for this film. I really enjoyed it, and was kind of shocked that I did. I can barely stomach bad acting, and surely there were moments of that in this movie, but the story and the visuals seemed to make up for those moments. I took my little cousins to see this, and expected to be seeing a cartoon (I am vaguely familiar with the Nickelodeon series) and was pleasantly surprised it wasn't. We watched it in 3-D, which was awesome. When we left the theater, I looked at my 11 year old cousin and said, ""well, I thought that this was gonna suck big time, but I really liked it."" I absolutely loved the little guy playing the Avatar. LOVED HIM. I would have liked it even better had he been a bit more childish, like in the cartoon. The young girl did okay, and the only actor I really couldn't stand was her brother. For one, I wanted to cut that ridiculously long pony-tail off of his head. Second, what was with that stupid conversation he and the water-princess had? I truly felt embarrassed for them both.OTHER than that, I loved this movie. I'm a little ashamed to admit that I even teared up at little Aang's flashbacks of his temple years during the battle at the end. I felt like these little actors did a great job. And ultimately, this is a kids' movie. Kids love this stuff, and it was cool that I was able to like it too.When I got home and looked it up on the internet, I couldn't believe the bad reviews it got. I wonder if I'm just delusional, as I'm typically a highly critical movie-goer. My advice: don't listen to all the haters if you want to see this movie. Decide for yourself.",The Last Airbender
1229,gemiellis,Horrendous,1,10 July 2010,"If there was a negative rating possible, this movie would have deserved it. I couldn't even get through the first 5 minutes without wanting to cry and maim myself. The casting is horrendous, another fail for Shyamalan, atrocious cinematography, the actual bending animation was out of sync, the acting was a joke. This movie needs to be remade with the money that the cast and crew were given. A completely new script, new actors, new director, new animation crew, scrap the whole team. This is bar none the greatest disappointment of a movie ever. And whoever did the ""martial arts"" choreography needs to never be allowed to do a roundhouse kick ever again. Last but not least, it would be advisable to not change the pronunciation of the names from the original cartoon. Complete and utter failure. I'm glad I didn't have to pay to watch this garbage.This film needs to be ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""-ed. I mean that all the cast, crew, and supporters of the film should have their souls and faces torn off from the horrible specters that were unleashed by this god awful film. Then the film needs to be shut in a box and ""lost"" or ""misplaced"" in some warehouse with millions of other containers like the one containing this atrocity.If the characters were actually real, I would label this butchery as the second worse form of human rights violation, after genocide.",The Last Airbender

The terrible acting and hidden racism, such as all firebenders are Indian and also the one black guy in the movie dies, BEFORE THE MAIN PLOT EVEN HAPPENS!!!!, turn it into a comedy. For some reason all earthbenders are Asians that can hardly bend the earth. The earthbenders do a cute little chant and it takes 5 or 6 of them to move a rock the size of pebble. The actor who plays Katara cannot stop shaking her head when she speaks. Aang looks like a four year old and doesn't bend air. He dances and air moves around him. But what makes this movie a great comedy is Jason Rathbone. He has an amazing ability of not blinking... at all... throughout the whole movie.",The Last Airbender

In spite of all bad criticism I opted to watch this movie because of its interesting plot and promising trailers. I am pleased to say that I took a wise decision. The storyline is perfect and has been written meticulously. All sequences are well connected. Actors have justified their characters. Special effects are also commendable. It is a beautiful journey with lot of adventure. Such a sharp criticism of this movie was uncalled for. The movie must be seen and appreciated as an isolated piece of work. It shall not be compared with the original series. The director has once again proved his metal for making fabulous movies.

1234,redsoxandsteelers,A great disappointment.,1,10 July 2010,"I am a big fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender. This movie is obviously not. The show was good at one thing I loved: combining good action and drama with slapstick comedy. This movie had bad drama and no comedy whatsoever. Not only were plot lines changed from the TV show, they were butchered. Here is what was left out: The Kioshi Warriors, King Bumi, Avatar Roku, The Winter Solstice, Jet, The Pirates, Ko the Face-Stealing Spirit, Jong-Jong (Aang's first firebending teacher), Haru and his Father in the Prison, Pakku (Katara and Aang's waterbending master), and the Aang/Water Spirit monster.Also, firebenders in the movie have to have fire with them to bend it, they can't create fire from nothing like the TV show. Only the high taught firebenders can create fire. The cliffhanger at the end of the movie sets off some disappointing things. Firelord Ozai says that Sozin's Comet will arrive 3 years from now, when in the TV show it is by the end of that year's summer. Azula is the cliffhanger, by the way.I would recommend not seeing this movie if you are a fan of the TV show.",The Last Airbender

Great movie ... everyone should watch it ... do not go by reviews of people who want the same old movie experience. Especially since its not girl loves boy but boy cant be with the girl cause he's a vampire! It had great effects the first of its kind in terms of the powers used by the characters of the movie. It was right up there with LOTR & Harry Potter if not better. I would be disappointed if there were no sequels especially since It would be easier to get through this movie and its sequels easier than the first two titles mentioned.No its not a mystery of dropping the ring in the volcano or stopping the Dark Prince...It is a good different story so don't go expecting the same thing from your movie! Enjoy it...its a treat!,The Last Airbender
1236,lana_969,Not surprised,2,11 July 2010,"Just a note: I have not ever seen the series but went to see the movie with a friend who had not told me he was a fan of the series.He waited to see my reaction and also to form his own opinion.About 30 minutes into the film I whispered over and asked him: "" Who the **** directed this?..Seems like a good story but someone has seriously got A.D.D. issues.""For someone who didn't know the story line..I was VERY confused and frustrated at how the story and plot line jumped all over the place.As soon as I started getting a handle on who these characters were...BAM here were more characters dropped from nowhere to ""complete"" a scene.The lines were delivered mechanically and the dialog was uninspired.My friend chuckled and whispered back to me ""Lady in the Water"", ROFL that's all he had to say and it all made sense.Just goes to prove you can take all the money in the world and blindly throw it a project and there is NO guarantee that makes the project good.I've seen some lesser known directors who have put out visually stunning pieces of work with a mediocre script to boot ( but stuff I would like to have in my library regardless because their visuals surpassed the crappy writing.) This movie however is not one of those. Too bad Pearry Reginald Teo was not asked to help in this movies production. That may have actually saved it.I've noticed that Shyamalans work has progressively gotten worse since ""Signs"". Perhaps he needs to feel that gnawing pang of hunger in his belly to truly put out something good.This is one director who shouldn't be given free reign over artistic license especially when it comes to a body of work with a cult following that was originally written by someone else.",The Last Airbender

They missed a lot of the best parts from the show. They forgot many important parts. After the first 10 minuets i knew the movie was going to suck, Kitara isn't supposed to just find Aang, she is supposed to get mad a Sokka and crack the ice with water bending and discover him. And I am very angry about the ending. In the end of book 1 in the T.V. show Aang goes into the Avatar state and becomes this giant water monster whipping out a ton of fire-bender boats when in the movie all he does is make a big wave. And another thing the fire-benders have to take fire from somewhere, in the T.V. show they create their own fire.

1241,iam-789-334729,An extremely adequate kung-fu action movie with too many stories to tell.,7,11 July 2010,"I've read some terrible, terrible reviews of this movie. I'd like to thank those reviewers for preparing me for the absolute worst. I believe that it was through their pessimistic help that I was able to thoroughly enjoy myself.Let's get a couple of things out of the way. If you go in expecting a live-action Avatar cartoon, you will be extremely disappointed. From the first mispronunciation of a character's name, the creators make it clear that they are not being faithful to the source material. This is, in my opinion, an acceptable decision. The source material is about ten hours of footage; expecting a movie to be condensed out of that corpus in a faithful fashion is as fair as expecting Hollywood to distill the essence of a book with fidelity. I never expect that from Hollywood. Indeed; what bothered me most was the movie's apparent insistence on retaining the trappings of the series that didn't move the story forward. Shyamalan seems at his best when he is telling one story; here, he seemed to be telling three, and only one is told to completion. I'm hoping the other two are expanded upon in subsequent movies.Once I got past the desire to see the TV series writ large, I found myself enjoying much of the material that was actually there. This is a thoroughly Shyamalan movie, for better or worse; the characters are mostly high-brain and expository, generally refraining from emotion. I don't know why Shyamalan tends to go in that direction, but it reminds me of the acting in Signs; I don't think I've ever seen a Shyamalan movie with an abundance of powerful emotion, and with a few rare exceptions, that pattern is repeated here. The movie also includes a few blatant expository segments; I couldn't figure out why they made it to the final cut, until I remembered Nickelodeon's branding on the movie and thought about the movie's target audience. Nickelodeon's work has often been extremely scattershot; they appeal to older audiences, but I get the distinct sense that parts of their creative enterprise don't trust the intelligence level of their viewers. I think the expository segments come from that fear, and I'd have left them on the cutting-room floor. Someone on the production staff didn't understand their target audience well enough (or I'm overestimating the audience myself).So why go see this movie? Because when you strip away the baggage, it turns out you're left with a pretty fun core. The action sequences are pure eye-candy, and while it isn't anything that viewers of the TV show haven't seen before in concept, it's exactly as exciting as I expected to see them in full-CG, live action, on the silver screen. I also, to be honest, enjoyed the narrative. For all of his faults, Shyamalan is a decent storyteller, and he manages to take the raw elements of the Book of Water and bend them into something that I hadn't seen before. This core is the one story in the movie that he tells well, and I wish he'd had the freedom or courage to cut away everything that didn't support it. In contrast to this, I've seen movies (a recent Persian escapade comes to mind) that tell one story, but it's a story so bland and lifeless that I simply didn't care. In addition, while Shyamalan's wooden, subdued style can be grating, it plays well into the later portions of the movie, in which the characters wrestle with powerful emotions but (due to the Buddhist undertones of the ""bender"" spirituality) those emotions would be inappropriate to show.Avatar is an extremely adequate martial arts movie with a bit of (possibly fake, over-Europeanized) Eastern spirituality thrown in. It's not Great American Art, and it's not as good as entertaining or as thoughtful as the television series that spawned it. It is, however, worth the price of admission. It's ""I, Robot""-fun. That's all I ask of Hollywood summer fair.",The Last Airbender

It was certainly worth taking out my family to see. We are all fans of the cartoon - my daughter and I watched the entire series; it's one of her favorites.It is rated PG because it's targeted for families. It's not terribly intense or dark (like Potter) - but yes, it IS darker than the toon... Expect to be entertained and expect your children to pretend to be water benders for a while. This is great.You won't laugh too much, you probably won't cry. You probably won't hold your breath or sit on the edge of your seat.

The kids in the movie did fine for their first job as actors. The ending is what really got me. The emotional pull that you feel when aang is trying to get over the guilt and sorrow he feels from losing everything he ever loved and knew was very well displayed. I also enjoy how clean the movie is. I can let my kids watch it without any fear of bad content. It seemed a bit rushed but that would make sense with how much material was crammed into it from the cartoon series. I don't see why the reviews have been so bad. If you wanna see a really bad movie go watch the Horrors of Monster Spider Island. That movie is really bad. The Last Airbender is a masterpiece compared to that one.,The Last Airbender
1244,kelleyjeffwood,Awful!,1,12 July 2010,"I must admit, I started watching the animated series a few months ago with my 3 year old son, and his father and I became just as engrossed with this series as he did. It was fun, sweet, had likable characters and an easy to follow plot (despite being fairly complex in subject matter.) As much as we enjoyed the animated show, we were equally disappointed in the live action movie. My son fell asleep about 30 minutes in, and if I could have gotten more comfortable, I would have, too. I was tempted to just leave and spare myself the agony. The script was bad. The acting was bad. The visuals were OK. The 3-D was better in the previews. I threw my hands up when they mispronounced Aang and Sokka and even AVATAR!!!! The ""bending"" was clumsy and over-complicated. They used poor dialog to explain what was happening. It reminded me of my son's Christmas play (except not as cute.) Some of the scenes were so poorly acted, I was physically uncomfortable. The only one of us that thought the movie was good, was my three year old, and like I said, he slept through most of it, so I can only assume he had a nice dream. M. Night has made a complete mockery of the beloved cartoon. The characters retained none of their intended charms. Aang was brooding and intense. When he did smile, it seemed forced and well, false. Sokka looked frightened and uneasy and lost all of his humor. And the fire-benders (with the exception of Iroh) could not create fire??? It was just SOOOO bad. I've never bothered reviewing a movie before, but I was so PO'ed by this one, that my first thought was to write a scathing letter to Mr. Shyamalan demanding my money back!

1248,Invictus67,It was GREAT!,8,13 July 2010,"I am a big fan of the cartoon. I have read some the other reviews before seeing this movie and I delayed going to see it. Don't listen to them! I have not a clue what the bad reviewer were talking about. OK there were some minor differences in the pronunciation of the names. Big Deal! One reviewer said his son told him it was the worst movie he ever saw??? WHAT? ""Tank Girl"" as the worst movie I ever saw. What I did notice is that it did move quickly so some of the dialog was underdeveloped. If you never saw the cartoon then you were left with some questions like, ""What is Aba?"", ""Why do they have to do all these Karate and Tia-chi moves to bend the elements?"", and ""How does his sister fit into the picture?"" These questions can be answered in the cartoon. I think that the director did an awesome job of translating the cartoon into a PG movie. I applaud him for making the Avatar a little more believable. The Avatar in the cartoon was a Kid who did not embrace his responsibility. And to me, he was a little annoying, because most kids are always trying to prove how adult they are. They often want to make decisions on their own and resent being treated like children. The concept of responsibility was reiterated throughout the movie. I think it solidified the story better and was more of a fable than the cartoon. Overall, I think it was entertaining and exciting. This move was not supposed to be an exact replica of the cartoon. If that were the case, it would have been made my Pixar and rated 'G'.",The Last Airbender

That is, unless that someone is Shyamalan. Seriously Bub, your own movies are bad enough, but how did you manage to screw up someone else's story; something you didn't even write? Shyamalan seemed more interested in hooking up his Bombay/Middle Eastern cronies with lead roles; than in actually filling those roles with people whom could act, or at least resemble the characters they were portraying.And what? Did you film this entire movie in one take? It looked more like a bad 80s soap opera than the epic saga of good versus evil it was meant to emulate.You really spent $150M on this steaming pile of dog crap? On what? The screenplay and filmography looked like something my son's elementary school could have put together; and the ""special effects"" looked like they were photoshop'd in.Shyamalan has clearly been blinded by his own semi-success, and needs to either go back to film school or quit making films entirely.

1252,Sydneyshop123,"Wow, whats with all the hate? I LOVED THIS MOVIE!",10,14 July 2010,"Listen, My brother and I were flailing and squealing after this movie it was SOOO GOOD! I am a huge HUGE fan of Avatar the last air bender, and I have seen every episode at least three times, I think M. Night did a SPECTACULAR job on this film, I can see the point of view from the critics, he did have to speed along, but you can't fit 10 hours of TV show into a hour and forty minute movie. People, Its like doing a movie based on a book, IT WONT BE THE SAME! And I liked how they portrayed the characters, I did not like Katara in the series for I found her to be a whiny baby, but the movie fixed this, and Sokka is more serious, I LOVE the characters more in this movie, and I think (Aung) Aang is a BEAUTIFUL way of saying his name, so much better then AANG, And I LOOOOVEED Zhao so much more, and I liked Iroh and Zuko better. This movie is a real treat also too Zutara fans, I being one of them :D This is a great movie and I pray for a second one, But I only have one complaint, Lets make Sokka a Bit funnier, But we can't expect this movie to be the same as the show, its a different take on the TV series. and so far I am feeling M. Night is fixing the mistakes that were on the TV series I PRAY FOR ANOTHER ONE!!Thank you M. Night for ANOTHER amazing movie!",The Last Airbender
1253,sakaitrio,In comparison to cartoon and characters.....eh it was alright.,4,14 July 2010,"When you go into a movie based on a cartoon or video game you are already at viewers own risk. There are a lot of negative reviews on this so I will try to shine a little light on some positive things first. Starting off the graphics were great and I liked how the introduction started off like the animated series. I've watched all the seasons of Avatar with my wife and two girls, so it was refreshing to see it start off like the cartoon. Appa the air bison looked great and the graphics for the different nations attacks looked pretty good. My only complaint on those action sequences were the slow pace. Aang's moves were to complicated. He twirled his staff way too much to perform one basic attack.In the cartoon Aang could preform moves easily and lightly by barely moving. The attacks were all really slow. And only started to pick up in the end. And the fire nation acted like Zuko's uncle was the only one who could make fire straight from his hand. They all had to use fire in their surrounding area to do anything.Moving on to the acting. They all acted out of character. Katara did okay and Zuko was almost on point. I'll even give a little credit to Zuko's uncle who at least sounded like the character from the series. But everyone else was stiff. I hated Sokka...with emphasis. He was to big and bulky and his acting was stiff and boring. He barely ever joked and took everything to serious. He seemed like someone out of a military movie. Topher Grace could have done a better job. He needed to be skinny and funny to pull off that character, both of which he was not. Now Aang, Aang did okay but he was way to serious too. The Aang I know was lighthearted and childlike. Did a lot of things spontaneously and acted on emotion. This Aang did not. While he did show some emotion for the loss of his fellow people he clearly failed to personify the innocence of the character. Even the Appa and Momo barely acted like themselves. The most entertaining thing Appa did was let some children play with him in the beginning. That was about it, you couldn't even tell Aang and Appa had a close relationship. And Momo did not show his curiosity enough, but he was cute and Appa was beautifully animated. Zuko did a great job. The only thing was, he was played the role a little more confused and whiny than angry. I would like to have seen him a little more passionate about his anger. And the burn scar on his face could have been better and a covered a little more area. Looked more like he had been punched then burnt. Now I'm not trying to pull a race card because i'm Asian American but I thought they could have at least looked a little like their character. A little bit less white and slightly more islander or Asian. Sokka and Katara looked nothing like the series. They were way to pale skinned. Aang looked okay. He is very light-skinned anyway. The fire nation was the only people who looked the part. The plot pretty much stuck to the series which i did like a lot. It took a lot from the episodes and put it into the movie. Overall. I love the series so I would still get the movie when it comes out. But if your child likes just the idea of Avatar being a movie and disregards the way the characters act then I would say give it a fair chance it was still a pretty good movie. P.S. Just to note, the most annoying thing about this movie was the way the mispronounced Aang, Avatar, and Sokka. It irritated me the whole movie almost as much as Sokka's acting.",The Last Airbender

Apparently no one can pronounce any of the names. No comedy, wit, cleverness, or moral to the movie. It was like watching a sideshow, the scenes went by so fast. I was expecting bad, and it was worse. The movie ticket should come with a warning sign on it saying, ""WARNING – boredom guaranteed""I tell you right now that you are not going to enjoy the movie. It would have been a good movie if it was a parody of the last air-bender, but no it wasn't and therefore it was simply BAD and I swear to you that even if you are going to watch the movie for free it is not going to be worth it.",The Last Airbender

But that's not enough no character development rushed plot and wrong character placement just to name a few.

They really kidding the real story that's OK, but is the role of the Aang just dancing puppet of the director. He is the real hero of the Avatar. The direction, he is rushed to finish the first book that's all.

I enjoyed it but then I had not seen the ""cartoon"" or read any of the books. Therefore I was not bothered by how the names were pronounced or what race the character was. I have since seen the ""cartoon"" and still don't see why everyone is so upset. Hollywood rarely follows the book which is why they write a screenplay and use the term based on. I have seen Hercule Poirot played by a number of actors who were neither 5' tall or Belgian and still enjoyed the movie.

1258,jdbst21,Best Live Action Movie based on Anime I seen,10,15 July 2010,"OK, I know lots of people don't like it. However, it is not for the general. Most people I know that watched the cartoon liked it or loved it. Plus it isn't even finished yet!Also the comments of the acting being stiff are a little bias. That is they way they acted in the cartoon too. They were trying to hold true to the original and i think they did a wonderful job doing that fact. It is that fact that makes it wonderful. So many times have I seen them take good cartoon or foreign film scripts and murder them just to have action or compress the story. Also it is a nick movie... meaning it isn't going to have sex or blood. If these are the things you are looking for than you will not find them. As for 3d goes. i am not a big fan of 3d in anything but everything is going that way so I can't really say if it is good or bad. Also, I don't think a movie should be judge on just how good its 3d work was done.",The Last Airbender
1259,zegerius,Avatar,4,16 July 2010,"Avatar was supposed to be the best movie for me in 2010, because I love the animated series, As do millions more. Then I heard that M. Night Shyamalan was going to direct this movie and my fear was born. I could not believe that Paramount Pictures would let such an unsuccessful director, direct such a great story. This could have been such a great success, but he f*cked it up badly.When I saw the movie I was sooo disappointed, None of the the characters are convincing and totally different than the animated series. Sokka and Katara are Eskimo's (Inuit), and most of the rest are oriental, in stead M. Night Shyamalan used Caucasian, Iranian, Indian, African American and New Zealand actors. Where are the Asians?, but not only the skincolour is different, the personalities are different as well. For example: the very joyful/playful Aang (in the animated version) is a very sad/frightened boy in the motion picture.Lets be honest, Which movie M. Night Shyamalan directed was a success.....? There you go; None Maybe he is a good writer, but making movies? he should let someone else do that.So thank you M. Night Shyamalan for destroying another great movie/story.Marcus Z. The Netherlands.",The Last Airbender
1260,vinoy-vishnu,unusual film,4,16 July 2010,"Shyamalan really got out of line on this one. He can't even excuse himself on saying that he used a different way of telling a story. when we saw the original avatar season 1, it started silently then came with a boom when aang proves he's the avatar. The whirlwind and the massive wave proved his amazing abilities and showed us he was the avatar. in ""the last airbender"" everything was still, nobody got that boom that they were looking for. why? the actors were actually good apart from the one that played kitara, but the direction and script was lame(meaning it sounded like a kindergarten teacher was reading a story for the kids). Perhaps the movie was aimed for a younger audience, but any kid could see that there was barely any effort put in for the last airbender. Nicola Peltz was not a good choice for kitara. Kitara is supposed to be the mother figure for the boys, she need to be older. Ways to improve the second movie would be, change kitara, make sokka more funny(i only laughed once throughout the movie and that was when sokka kicked some soldiers in the balls) and the most important is get a better script. Things in avatar moved too fast, aang skipped through to the earth region in just 10-15 minutes. Basically it seems like M Night watched avatar once and decided to tell the story in his own way, which was unpleasant for the fanboys(the only people who would even think about watching the film)",The Last Airbender
1261,joebryan1982,This movie sucks,1,16 July 2010,"How old are you people that liked this? It was a god awful blight on film-making. When it was over I felt like I had been in the theater for 5 hours having my eyes and ears plucked and prodded with hot pokers, and I like the cartoon. This was so bad it is incredible, only a 5 year old with a low comprehension of the English language would enjoy the acting and dialog in this movie. M Night Shyma-HAMalan is the new Ed Wood. The 8 year old's review from earlier in the IMDb user reviews was an exactly spot on perfect capture of what this movie was, if you are considering taking children to see this go back and read the review, its in the first ten pages or so... It also made me feel really bad for any child who was a fan of this show that had to watch this movie. The movie destroyed every moral about tolerance, non violence and acceptance. The Tai Chi that replaced the Kung-Fu from the original was awful. The 3d is non existent. Nickelodeon should have to publicly apologize and the studio should refund the difference to anyone whom paid the extra money to see the film in ""3d"". After the Earth, fire, water, air, red background silhouettes at the very beginning of the movie, this film lost any relationship it should have maintained with the original choosing instead to tell the story through terrible narratives and awful and long, poorly conceived (visually and rhythmically) cgi filled montages. The only real similarity the movie shares with the show are some rare visuals M. Night stole form the show, like the large Ice Globe Ang is discovered in, the fire nation boats, Kitara's necklace, Yue's hair and the Fish making a Yin Yang, otherwise this holds over none of the feeling of the original, which is what every good recreation of a fan based product generally does, but Shymahymhamyhmama would rather try and keep the same arch of a whole season and try to cram every event into 90 minutes than tell a cohesive story which any child with a 3rd grade knowledge of story telling would realize will never work. A perfect example of Shymahamalahahas terrible decision making skills was the decision to make the spirit guide to Ang a huge, nonsensical, speaking dragon with bland observations about what his options are to restore balance(strangest of all was the decision to make the dragon look like a really expensive red cloud with dragon eyes out of a Disney film), rather than the former Avatars.The dialog and acting are terrible, but that is expected with most child actors. Lets face it, M. Night which must stand for Moron, got lucky to find Hailey Joel when casting the 6th sense, what really happened was Hailey gave a strong enough performance to carry what was really a boring movie with an obvious twist in it, in the late nineties and now the kid is an odd looking young adult so there is no chance for Masochist(if you've seen the Last Airbender that is the only explanation for how he could stand behind this movie, and honestly say he enjoys watching it) Night Shymahalallahalaam to ever make a descent movie again.",The Last Airbender

I will just say that in spite of those littler things I could have over looked, that I could not over look the piece of crap that was the script for this movie. It could have been amazing - the story was there for the taking! I cannot fathom how Paramount allowed this to pass for writing. Such a waste. The horrendous writing was the nail in this films coffin.I hope that if Paramount allows a second film that they fire M. Night altogether, and hire a new writer and director. Then they need to have the creators and head writer from the original series oversee that writing!",The Last Airbender
1264,littlegrim,Wasted Time,1,16 July 2010,I was very disappointed in this movie I guess I had the expectation that it was going to be like the cartoon which I love and it wasn't instead I was sitting in a theater trying to decide if I should sit through the entire movie and get my moneys worth just by sitting in an air conditioned building or to leave the theater after twenty minutes in. The acting was mediocre and the any movements that they made seemed over embellished. Not to mention the fact that if you are going to pronounce a name one way in a cartoon pronounce it the same way in the movie. Overall the movie was boring and a waste of time and in my opinion not even worth renting instead stick to watching the cartoon on nickelodeon its a much better use of your time if you are thinking of wasting money to see this.,The Last Airbender
1265,melkik,Yeah kids can't act well but it's still GREAT MOVIE,8,16 July 2010,"It seems as majority of all negative comments come from the actual cartoon fans. I have not seen the cartoon series and I LOVE the movie. As a matter of fact I went to see it twice and I'm planning to buy the DVD as well. I wish people were not getting so hung up on name pronunciation and silly things like that. You can't expect the director to make the movie exactly like the cartoon. The soundtrack is beautiful, the effects are great, and overall the movie has a wonderful message. I do admit that the dialogs are not the most elaborate, but the movie is still very enjoyable. None of the kids deliver an Oscar worthy role, but then again they are just kids! You can't expect Meryl Streep or John Malkovich type of performance from some teenagers. I think the guys in Chronicles of Narnia were worst and even annoying at times. Also, I can't believe that people criticize the movie for things which, in my opinion, are its assets – mysticism, sacredness, and ancient supernatural beliefs. The bending sequences look like tai-chi and are very respectful to the nature. Unfortunately it seems like some of the agitators complain of bending scenes being too slow and I guess expected massive mudslides and Niagara-like waterfalls to happen with the flip of fingers.I certainly do hope Shyamalan makes sequels to the first movie as it was great. The music from the last water scene is absolutely hunting ('Flow like Water'). I listen to it on my ipod and I can see that scene instantly. It brings tears to my eyes every time. I wish people just stopped looking for every little thing that it may be imperfect with this movie and just enjoy the beautiful story of human nature; story about pride, strive for power, but also unconditional loving kindness and how it can change people. Very simple but yet so powerful. THAT's the message of the film NOT the fact that Aang is not bratty enough, or his name is pronounced differently, or there's not enough violence in the movie.",The Last Airbender

The entire theater was full at the beginning and midway through the movie there was only 8 people left. I felt so bad for my boyfriend because i had talked him into going. He said it made his eyes bleed.Please don't waste your money. It is a disgrace to the cartoon. I would be ashamed to have even released this piece of junk to the public. M. Night Shyamalan never needs to make another movie ever. Either he needed a quick buck or he really has just lost his touch. They butchered the names like Aang. They kept saying oong. I don't think any of them have actually even seen the cartoon series. The actors were suppose to be darker. And at least be able to act. The poor girl who played Katara has no acting skills whatsoever. And the boy who played Aang is horrible. It was so boring that my boyfriend kept falling asleep. And by the way we saw it in 3D.

I am surprised at all the negative reviews, but I think most people just want to bash M. Night Shyamalan. Some of his movies are good, some not as good. This is no different from any other director. Sometimes Spielberg and Lucas make bad/mediocre movies too. But I digress.This movie was wonderful. I liked the fact that each nation was represented by a different race. I thought this brought diversity to the movie. I also liked the tone of the movie. It's darkness was what attracted me, like the later Harry Potter movies and books, I saw this as a way to attract older fans without ruining a kids movie.I thought the effects were great. They weren't overblown or disgustingly obvious, they all seemed natural. The dialogue was good as well. It was not stiff like some reviews are saying.Overall, I thought this was one of Shyamalan's best works. I believe he put a lot of thought and effort into this script, ass much thought and effort as in the Sixth Sense. I am glad I ignored all the negativity and saw this movie anyway. It's turned me back on to Shyamalan's movies.",The Last Airbender
1269,Lugzx1,what can be done to fix the next one?,1,19 July 2010,"I love Avatar, I have watched it with my son since it began and it was always fun to watch. Hell we even love the reruns, however this movie is another story. We know how bad it was now lets see what can be done to fix it.1. First FIRE M. Night Shyamalan - sorry to say this but I had high hopes from him, after seeing some of the footage I thought ""He might actually do a great job on this."" man i couldn't be more wrong. Changing the pronouncations of names and words to suit your own ego, come on man seriously? and what was up with all those crappy zooms to Aang's eyes nose and mouth? I'm not sure what expression you were hoping to capture but you failed something fierce. and having the water tribe that dress in a nice water blue and white changed over to dark blue to battle against fire nation army in dark red nice touch I know I couldn't tell at all who the hell was who in that huge fight scene, a real waste of good fighting opportunity there.2. Mix races up- if your gonna have 3-4 people to represent an area don't have everyone there from one ethnic group and just 1 or 2 that look completely out of place, that's just asinine. Ether all of the same race or make them a mix group of people.3. Martial Arts moves that work- While the Katas were nice to look at they were to long and not functional. in martial arts Katas serve a purpose. They teach you a form and you can then develop technic from that form. In a Kata there are defensive moves as well as offensive moves but when attacking you don't need to make a defensive posture and in fact don't look very good. in the animated series they noticed it and shortened the moves to ether offensive katas or defensive katas something your people failed to tell notice. Some Katas were no longer then 1-3 moves in the animated series and this helped the flow of the fights, how ever in the movie the moves were like 5-10 making each technic ridiculous and a waste of time because while they were taking that much time just to launch one attack they could have already been struck 3-5 times.4. When it comes to Child actors it comes with the territory that they won't always be very good but would it kill you to try to cast the characters a little more like the real characters? Iroh, Zuko's uncle did not look nor act anything like him, to me he was one of the best characters because he said some of the deepest things and was one of the funniest there, sure he had power to back him up but it was his more softer and charming side that made him so endearing to Zuko. You can't change a person's life with half-hearted feelings and that's all I seen coming out of the movie.5. Don't be cheap!- this is a long series, don't try to rush it so damn hard! This is a story that is on par with lord of the rings and should be due its proper screen time. if you want to fit in a whole season into a movie you damn well better be prepared to have a 3-4 hour film at the end. If you don't something went wrong, terribly terribly wrong.Follow that plan and then next one should do much better. By the way M. Night Shyamalan, my 10 year old son is getting a job to buy a ticket to your house just so he can beat your ass with a baseball bat or so he sez so I'd be careful if I were you. ^_^",The Last Airbender

Night Shyamalan was given creative lease over the movie, this is where the producers and Michael Dante DiMartino the director of the cartoon should be ashamed.

1272,yoosuf29,Cast/Script and Storyline problem - READ IT!,5,21 July 2010,"*Note - This review is opinion based.First of all, the movie is not bad as people make it sound. It wasn't awfully bad. Some people are just against M. Night. I can clearly see it by reading most of the reviews. But they were true at one point. The movie was NOT good as the series. I'm a big fan of the series, I have the entire series 2+ times.+PROS / CONS-Script: Not good! Not bad! It was OKAY! It some how kept the story going.-Timeline: Originally it was 90 Minutes long. I just want to know that if they can make the movie little longer. If the make it a 180 Minutes movie (like Lord of the Rings), they could done a better job on explaining the plot because Book 1, the first season is 400+ minutes long. They just rushed through the plot.-Storyline/Plot: This is the MAIN reason why some people hated the movie. As I said, they rushed through the plot. It was so compressed that there was no time to explain about the characters.-Cast: INTERESTING but MESSED up! This was my biggest concern of all. I noticed that every nation has its own race. Like Fire Nation is INDIANS, Earth Nation is Chinese, Southern Water Tribe is other Asian but why is it like that? Why not just mixed up, I mean, every nation should have mixed up characters.-Aang (Noah Ringer): 10/10 because he looks like him.-Katara (Nicola Peltz): 10/10, she was suitable.-Sokka (Jackson Rathbone): 10/10, good but you could have made him a little more humorous.-Zuko (Dev Patel): 10/10, he is a good actor and he got the part right!-Iroh (Shaun Toub): 10/10, he was good because its just an adaption.-Commander Zhao (Aasif Mandvi): 5/10, I'm giving 5 because his acting was good but he didn't look like him.-Fire Lord OZAI (Cliff Curtis): 3/10, YES, I give a 3 only because of his acting, but if he looked like a real fire lord, I would have gave him 10! But for some reason he looked innocent and doesn't look like a fire lord at ALL. Some one with long hair and a martial artist should be there. NEED A CHARACTER CHANGE HERE. AS I SAID, every nation should be MIXED UP, so people won't complain!-Bending: People had to do a lot of moves in order to bend. BUT GUESS WHAT, I felt like they were NOT connected to the movement of the element. In the series, when people bend, they move with the element, in the MOVIE, its opposite. Doesn't have flow but some parts were good.-Graphics/Camera: The best part of the movie and views were stunning! but could have worked better on 3D.*There is still a chance. Night can still change in the next movies. I'm not here to give tips to M. Night. These are all just my opinion on what I think and other people think.

Serious, how hard is it to say ""Ang"" and ""Avatar""? 2)If it takes 1 minute and 6 guys to summon a pebble and send it slowly flying, why doesn't ""Ung"" take a stick and beat everyone? Surely that would be 10 times faster than waiting for that slow-moving chunk of mud to hit you in the face...All in all, this movie is definitely not worth seeing. If you like the cartoon, avoid this movie at all costs. Even M. Night fans should steer clear of this movie, lest their loves be dashed right in front of their eyes. P.S. I personally believe the ""twist"" in the final movie will be that the ""Oventar"" will be Charlie Brown in a chemo-induced delusional state, running around punching random people in the hospital.",The Last Airbender

I am sure for something that M.Night Shyamalan haven't watch this cartoon series and just read the script. The most important character's name is pronounced wrong , how could this be possible for heaven's sake. the storyline of the cartoon and movie is completely different , there are no characterization and to make the movie in 2hr all parts are loose and jump one scene to another. Shyamalan didn't use the original story and he altered all crucial parts.Here are some examples:****WARNING SPOILER ALERT***uncle Iroh test the Aang whether he is avatar or not. He put a candle , stone and water in front of him. For heaven's sake did i miss that part in animated series. fire-benders need actually fire to bend , they cant start fire within themselves they only use the fires around them to bend. But at the end fire lord Ozai said to Azula when Sozin's comet come , our chi will become too strong so we can bend fire by ourselves. how can you add something to the series , have you ever seen a fire bender use the torch to bend the fire in cartoon series? so there are torches everywhere in the movie even in the water kingdom :S and finally please someone explain to me why there is a dragon spirit in this movie? i don't recall any dragon spirit talking to Aang , avatar Roku is actually talking to Aang and guide him in his journey. And dragon spirit said avatar cant harm anyone so Aang make a tsunami wave and all fire nation ships run away when they saw that. Is that the end in the book water in animated series? where is the ocean spirit to help Aang in avatar form to outcome all enemies.there are too many flaws about this movie , this is the worst adaptation i have ever seen and the movie itselfi want to give 0 in vote part there is not such a thing :(",The Last Airbender

There names were called in a way I started to laugh- I mean really, Avatar is now Ahvatar? Zuko is Indian (not to be mean or anything) which made me Kinda confused on what the Director was going at. Then it got worst as :spoilers: the one thing I awaited for- MoMo, was not yet called...ever in the movie. T^T Okay- I'm not a camera guy, but I am pretty sure that you are suppose to be able to see what is going on instead of blurring it-Cutting it off- and showing events that are not suppose to be in there. Let me save you all some money- and some dignity of the cartoon, and Don't waste your money on this movie. I gotta say, next to Dragon ball Z the movie, This is one of the worst I have seen.

1277,biochips,Katara is the highlight of this film (at least for me),7,26 July 2010,"Actually I can understand all the bad ratings of the latest Shyamalan film. The first thing I noticed was the unusual picture that reminded me more of a TV series than of a blockbuster film made for cinema. Also I can imagine a lot of viewers dislike Shyamalans way of directing, for his style is lacking dozens of cuts that other directors wouldn't want to miss in their films. But in fact that is all a matter of taste. Believe it or not, Shyamalan's films have attracted lots of fans over the years and given the strong fanbase supporting him it is utter nonsense calling him ""the worst director of our time"" as I had to read in other reviews.Another widely criticized aspect is the dialog which has been attributed words such as ""atrocious"" and ""laughable"". I cannot agree with that for two reasons. First of all this film was not made for an adult audience and therefore the spoken lines have to be understood by children. Would it be useful if the dialog was philosophical and ambiguous? Secondly this film does not pretend to be more than its source, which is an animated TV series. In my youth I used to love anime and so I know how characters in these shows talk. Although some would disagree with me for dubious reasons, I can assure you that the dialog in this film is no different from the dialog in an average anime series. Given this fact most criticisms regarding the script are simply misguided and not justified.I have given 4 stars for the above-mentioned and 3 for the character Katara, who is my personal highlight of the film. To put it mildly, I think she is adorable and hot.The major bad aspect about the film though is the truly incomprehensible plot, which leaves you confused and unsatisfied at the end.In a nutshell: This is definitely NOT one of the worst films ever made. If anything, it is one of the most average films and it is, of course, more or less a matter of taste. I believe most critics have made up their minds of how a film has to look like. But film-making as well as film-watching belongs to the section of art and should not be distorted by the ""school of Hollywood"" with its unwritten guidelines for action, romance or comedy. M. Night Shyamalan tries to be one of the few artists in modern film, but sadly enough is not honored for that.",The Last Airbender
1278,nobumoto97,Poor adaptation of TV series,3,27 July 2010,"Typically TV shows are converted to big picture in a reasonable manner, albeit with some shortcuts due to time constraints. But this sub par effort came up short by completely omitting the general feel and character interactions of the TV show. Having recently viewed the episodes that this movie was supposed to be based upon, I am not so certain that M. Night Shyamalan watched the same episodes or was attempting to emulate it. The only reasons for the 3 stars were the excellent CGI and fight scenes. Hopefully a fan of the series will direct the next effort (and one is made) as the show is one of the better animated series written this generation.",The Last Airbender

Some of the unforgivable issues are ghastly casting, corruption of a fascinating story line,lousy 3D, stiff acting, unspectacular special effects, ridiculous changes in character traits and names...to the point that the film has NO redeeming qualities. if you go, don't expect to be entertained. It's hard to make a 10 worst list but this is #3 all time worst. Only because a review must contain ten lines of text I'll spend a bit more of my life venting here.

1280,orin_05,Not worth watching in the theaters,3,28 July 2010,"There are worse movies out there, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed this one. The story failed in so many ways. I'm a fan of movies, and a fan of the cartoon series. This was just an overall disappointment.Why did bending look like a bunch of fancy wasted movement? Because it was. It looked like they made up any kind of movement to portray bending because they didn't know what it should have looked like. Those that performed some kind of bending didn't act well enough to make it look real.Why do you leave feeling like you know little about each character? Because there wasn't enough development. Katara is supposed to be Aang's love interest, but all she does is practice Tai Chi with him. Sokka hardly has any part in the movie, so I'm not even sure why he's there. Appa is supposed to be Aang's best friend, but he's portrayed as nothing more than a big flying carpet.Where was the climax? There was no climax, because there was no struggle. I think I felt more tension watching Man VS. Food than Aang VS. the fire nation. There was no struggle with the hero, and so, no climax.Save yourself some money and avoid watching this in the theaters. There are some movies worth watching on the big screen, but this is not one of them. Wait for it to show up in the dollar vending machine. I saw it on the big screen for free, but somehow I feel like I was robbed.",The Last Airbender

I don't know.Sure, the computer graphics was a bit much, but there were great landscapes to be found between scenes, and interesting characters throughout. I feel compelled to find out more about these characters, and only hope that in this case a sequel is made.Perhaps fanatics of the cartoon and overly-critical adults may not like it, but for anyone who would enjoy a good story and adventure, this might be a good movie to check out.

Okay, the characters didn't all look the same as the cartoon and their names were pronounced differently, but that's really a small detail, they all acted the part well. What I think some people are forgetting is that the movie tries to wrap up an entire season in an 1 1/2 hours... c'mon, they hit the key points and switched some stuff to make it fit. It is one person's interpretation and it was well done. Maybe this airbender is not that same as the cartoon, but it is still a very good airbender none the less. To those of you who haven't seen it yet... see it already! As a last minute anecdote, does anybody remember when the matrix came out?

I knew the film wasn't gonna be spectacular based on a number of negative reviews but Shyamalan took the term ""Mediocre"" to a whole new level.The original series was embraced by a lot of fans (including me) and Shyamalan simply turned it into a nightmare for every fan. It was horrible ; plain and simple. The acting lacked substance. The cast were like a bunch of lifeless puppets acting while void of emotions. The special effects weren't anything special as well.If you wanna enjoy seeing your favorite characters come alive and amaze you with sophisticated bending complete with amazing special effects then this is not the movie for you.

I know its a kids series and therefore a kids movie, but come on! I'm sure kids enthusiastic about the series would sit through the whole thing! In addition to the fact that the actors casted were all the wrong race, Shyamalan felt the need to change the pronunciation of the character's names. The lines, acting, and special effects were mediocre at best and just felt ""cheap."" The only person in the entire world who I would entrust bringing this epic to life is Peter Jackson. If you don't know who he is, just google him and it will come very apparent. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU LIKED THE SERIES EVEN A LITTLE BIT!

Or Ang with his naivety, playfulness and childishness, but I was upset to find the movie did not capture the characters personalities at all. Instead we had a very serious, sensible Ang and a boring, depressing Sakka who never once tried to cheer up the group. I felt Zuko's character was in place with the animation. Overall this pulled my rating down, other then this It was an enjoyable film, it briefly followed the story, I know its hard to fit so many chapters into a movie.

The opening words were terrible and bending sequence were badly filmed which put me in an irritated mood. from there, the film didn't get much better. Names weren't pronounced as they were in the series. The actors were not at all great at their parts and the characters' personalities had little resemblance to the their animated counterparts. Part of that was due to the badly written script and director, both roles done by the same person! I understand that it's impossible to fit over 8 hours from the cartoon into a 2 hour movie but Shyamalan should have never tried to fit from start to finish into it. In doing so, major parts were rushed or skimmed or even missed completely and not-so-major parts dragged. The plot and story in the film was just messed up. nothing would make sense to someone who never watched the series. It would have been better if it started half way through the book and made references to the events before hand. The visual effects were okay at some points but most of the time, it just sucked. The colours and shapes all blended and there was no clear edge to anything that was CG. The lighting was bad, even at the water tribes that snow didn't look bright or even white at that. The Bending was terrible. Doing loads of movement before anything happened.

1291,thomas70378,"Completely Terrible, gave the show much shame...",3,8 August 2010,"This movie was terrible. Watching it made me so mad. I, myself, am a huge fan of the cartoon series on Nickelodeon, and basically the whole movie just besmirched the legendary show. For once thing, the movie was completely rushed. A whole season scrunched in a few hours? Thats horse feathers! The director's way of ""revising"" the movie with his ""vision"" was a huge reason this movie sunk. For example, in the show Aang demonstrates his airbending to the south pole village for fun. He flew around in his glider for a bit and humorously crashed into a snow tower. In the movie, all he did was get up from his sleep in the tent after being found by a fire nation soldier to be immediately turned in as a prisoner. Where's the excitement in that? There has to be some kind of struggle to make it more riveting and make the viewers want to know what happens next. All that happened is the main character gets captured. Wow.. Total excitement there? Watching paint dry is more exciting! What also ""irked"" me was the pronunciation of the names of the characters. Who gets names wrong that terribly? The show WAS made my American producers, that should make it easy to copy. But apparently, its better to sound like one doesn't know how to read than being making the movie actually based on its predecessor. Some examples of these mispronunciations would be: Aang(Or: Eng, Movie:Ung), Iroh(I-row, Movie:E-row) Was the director having fun changing vowels around? I mean seriously, to mispronunciate a name of a minor character is one thing, but to mispronunciate the name of the main character? That's just disgraceful. Also, the actors/actresses were terrible at their jobs. It seems like they were reading off a white board during school. It didn't feel like they were trying at all to put any kind of emotion towards their words. More like acting just to waste time. Well, they're right. They did waste time. Wasted my time and everyone else who watched it. Terrible overall. If any directors read this, please, I'm begging you, make a reboot of this movie!",The Last Airbender
1292,fallonroberson15,The worst...,1,11 August 2010,"I don't even know where to begin. I was really excited to see Avatar: Last Airbender because the series was just amazing. So when I heard the movie was coming out I saved the date and had to go see it. Well someone should have told me not to waste my time to see this movie. With the budget M. Night given I expected better quality. I expected better writing, acting, and a better story line. I make better movies in my dream than this one, Nickelodeon could have dropped $1 million dollars on my pillow and I would have created a movie ABSOLUTELY better than what Mr. Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamala has presented to us. I feel disrespected because he has taken what is known to the fans as a great, not even great, an extraordinary cartoon series and just crapped all over it. To me it doesn't even seem like he took the time to watch the series completely to get the story plot. Sorry, the gang was not suppose to start a rebellion throughout the nations, the mission is to get AANG, not Aung, prepared to fight fire lord. You see that there is no relationship developing between Katara and Aang like it does in the series. It is like everyone is just there, the language is horrible, like I said the plot is all over the place, there is no structure at all. I'm glad that I've seen the series before because those who have not seen it missed out on a series that connects and draws the fans in while they watch; this movie did not do that. It left me wondering after the first minute when this movie was going to end. Also, we spent our time in Book One and now he's talking about doing two other movies to focus on Book 2 and Book 3. I understand that you cannot reduce three seasons into an hour and a half movie but if you plan on breaking it down put in the effort to produce better quality rather than focus on the quantity. Eff that, I REFUSE to sit and watch another Avatar movie if he's behind it. Does he think that his directing skills will become better as he directs more movies.

1293,acorok,"Shame about the acting, but I can forgive it for a fantastic attempt.",9,12 August 2010,"I am the biggest fan of the Avatar series and was looking forward to this greatly. Although it disappointed in some ways, it was still based on such a strong storyline I couldn't not find this entertaining, especially compared to such a duff as Sorceror's Apprentice? Yes, the 3 MCs were truly dreadful, but the Texan kid who played Aang was clearly hired for his fighting skills and he had his moments of emotion, unlike the two I have to assume more experienced Water Tribe kids. Re-cast them and it would've been an entirely different movie. It can't compare to the series, because a film doesn't have the luxury of cliffhangers, but it still contained a hell of a lot of detail from an incredible action packed series. They've captured what had to be shown well and ignored the rest, which is rare from a TV to big screen conversion. I'd even forgotten some parts from the show that were in this movie, like the Blue Spirit an the assassination attempt on Zuko. Yes, the annoying Katara's voice-over was irritating, lacklustre and with more tell than show, and the dialogue was tired, but then there was so much in this film they had to pace it quickly, so I can forgive this. Later, there's so much action going on that you barely notice the bad acting anymore and that's this film's strength. It ends on a high.The important thing for me was my favourite characters, the Fire Nation guys, were great. I was dreading Zuko and Iroh's casting, as they weren't anything like they're portrayed in the cartoon, but they really worked, and were the best actors/characters in it, making the best of a bad script. They were different, but captured the essence of the characters; Zuko was almost immediately likable as a secondary protagonist and Iroh was even more gentle than his TV counterpart, with the movie not having the luxury to build up their complex characters.The 3D was a waste of time, as it only highlights the scenery, but that did add to the fantasy. The special effects were inspiring (much better than Sorceror's Apprentice), especially the animals which were unusually flawless (although Appa did have a weird, scary face). The fights scenes were impeccable, with the slow-mo scenes unusually good highlighting every amazing Avatar act.This film's going to be hated by most because of its major flaws and, although I see what won't be liked, I'm such an Avatar fan I can see this film for its merits. I'm going to see this again and again, and I think it'll get even better. I can't wait for the other 2 films.

But if you want a sure-fire reason to not watch the movie, or want to know how bad the film is, read on. It's not like you'll miss much if you don't watch the cruddy garbage... --I've been a long time lover of AtLA, and what that M.Night dumb-bell did to the series with this crap!film made me balk at first and angry enough to turn the movie off after the 15-20 minutes of it. But then I watched it with my friend and that made the thing an iota better. But my opinion of the movie stays mostly the same.As a film itself there was not enough energy. The acting was wooden and actors themselves(like SOKKA) were Out-Of-Character(he wasn't idiotic enough and was not funny at all, aside from when Appa got him with his tail). Not only that but the actors and actresses- most EVERYONE looked wrong for their parts. Katara and Sokka weren't supposed to be white, and Zuko and the whole bleeping Fire Nation was NOT supposed to look Hindu. I'm not racist just because when I went to watch the movie I expected the actors to resemble who their roles were. I did NOT want to see Shyamalan's inaccurate and crap-take on the series.Aang's actor was cute at least and kind of childish enough. Katara's voice over at the beginning was bland and needlessly changed, Sokka's lines sucked monkey balls, and I wanted to maim Zuko's actor. And not in the good way. His scar was stupid looking. But his acting was better than Sokka and Katara's.Iroh was cool though. I missed the fat jolly uncle from the TV series, but Shyamalan's dread-lock wearing Iroh was pretty okay. He just wasn't old enough though...Oh! And they MISPRONOUNCED AANG AND SOKKA'S BLEEPING NAMES. Every time I heard 'Ahng' and 'Soke-a' I wanted to smack something. Like a certain terrible director. They pronounced Katara's name perfectly, but NO, not the other main characters.It's only saving grace, which isn't anything much, were the special effects. The water looked amazing. The fire was stupid though, because in the SERIES they can make their own fire. Appa looked... eh. Momo looked like Zaboomafoo, and that made me smile so Momo is my favourite part in the film. The excessive hand and arm movements was annoying to watch, because Aang's air-bending was much more faster than that, the same with Katara's water-bending. And the earth-bending was... lame. Very lame.If Shyamalan fudges up Toph he shouldn't be allowed to touch the film industry ever again.One other note: Shyamalan, you should not be allowed to make another movie without proper supervision.

1296,FinnD-818-826257,Cartoon turned film - not a good idea,4,14 August 2010,"Settling down with a large popcorn, waiting in anticipation for the movie to start, then finding myself nonchalantly sipping my coke and glancing around to see if others were as confused as I was. What was this? This was almost a terrible mime of the real series. The actors were so...bland. Where was Sokkas sarcasm? Where was Kataras slight stress levels? Aang - what happened to Aang - were was the cheeky boy known so well from the cartoon. Our lovable characters - so serious, so very very bland. Yet although the action was in abundance, this movie almost a skim over the real genuine episodes. Things such as Zuko not having a scar. And, the sad obviousness of sequels after sequel. So, if you have seen the episodes then I have to say, this will be a disappointment. But if the cartoon is new to you - you might find this fresh and exciting. Might. Be warned- this is not a film for everyone. I would say, it may be a slight shock for some.Written by Finn.D",The Last Airbender
1297,vajravisions,"Heartfelt Condolences for ""Avatar The Last Airbender""",2,15 August 2010,"Extending my heartfelt condolences to Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, on the tragic murder of their creation, ""Avatar The Last Airbender"", Aang and his companions, by M. Night Shyamalan via his feature film adaptation ""The Last Airbender"".I had high hopes for this film since first hearing about production rumors, and at first was encouraged that M. Night Shyamalan was set to direct the feature film. I waited 2yrs to see this movie, and saw it opening weekend... I had planned to bring my children (they're 8 & 3, we love to watch the animated series together) the following weekend, but after seeing the premier, I cringe to imagine how bored they'd be to see the feature film... when I finally broke the news to them last week that it was bad, it felt like I was telling them the dog died. That's pretty sad.I am hugely disappointed... this is an epic failure and easily Shyamalan's worst film to date. The movie is so bad that I'm afraid it might turn people away from the masterpiece animated series ""Avatar The Last Airbender"" (3 seasons so far, which ran from 2005-2008).I felt awkward as I sat through the film, stunned and hoping that it might redeem itself, incredulous that it could be so bad with such great source material -- but Shyamalan managed to make me feel embarrassed to be a fan, and for wasting my time/money at a movie theater. The only saving graces of ""The Last Airbender"" are costumes, sets, & special effects -- superficial appearances that make great trailers, but not enough to save this soul-less film... considering the excellence of the animated series, it should be easy to make a great film adaptation, but the plot hobbles along, tripped up by poor editing (the whole movie felt like ""did I just miss something""?), flat acting performances (from actors that were trying to get it but were confused) in uninspired scenes -- that's the directors' lack of vision: Shyamalan stripped the characters of their personality, there was no humor at all, it was like watching a mediocre junior high stage play of ""The Last Airbender"", only with a big budget.I'm usually not a harsh critic, but this film deeply disappointed me. I don't hate Shyamalan (I love ""The 6th Sense"", ""Unbreakable"", ""The Village"", ""Signs""), but this was easily his worst film. I can't imagine the film studios going through with previous plans to make ""The Last Airbender"" a trilogy... which would only be worth the effort if they reboot the film with a different director, writer, choreographer and possibly a different cast...? The silver lining in this cloud: at least there is hope for the animated series, Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko are working on a follow up called ""Avatar The Legend of Korra"", set to air for Autumn 2011.Sincerely, Dennis Mace",The Last Airbender
1298,jinn_drk,What a disappointment!,1,16 August 2010,"I was looking forward to this movie since March...I watched the 3 animated seasons and fell in love with the characters, the setting and the whole idea. The movie just did not get close to capturing the essence of the main characters... The fun, prank-loving Aang, the sarcastic Sokka, the fiery, preachy Kitara... It felt like a complete re-write of the basics. The casting was also quite poor; I think most fans of the animation would agree that Aang and the Airbenders are generally perceived as Chinese Monks, Zuko and the Fire Nation were most certainly not meant to be Indian! As well as all that, the movie tried to cram 22 episodes of story-telling into 100 minutes! I felt like there was so much missing from the story and many memorable and important scenes completely left out, this movie must be a shallow and confusing nightmare for anyone who hasn't seen the animation and even more torturous for those who have! I know how much time, and money goes into making a movie and I apologise for being so harsh but this movie really is not an accurate or enjoyable adaptation of the animated series. Effects aside, I can't think of anything good to say about it.",The Last Airbender

The concept, the storyline and the visual experience i found very good, but then again i am the sort of person who absolutely adores magic, fantasy & the ability to control the elements. If you are like me then i reckon you might enjoy the film, despite the poor acting and script.

But damn this film was crap.Without their costumes I never recognized anyone as their series counterparts.They ""killed"" Sokka, their was nothing of its typical clumsiness. Kataras mother instinct was like it never existed. Aang was just a boring with guy with some stupid tribals on his head. Where are Zukos Scars gone? Shaun Toub was the best actor in this film but totally miscast for Iroh, to slim and missing Irohs calmness and wisdom, more appearing like someone who makes his own plans. And not to forget, totally pushing Momo aside.Seeing Ozai in Book I: Water was the next mistake.As Zuko appeared as blue ghost I waited to see his mastery of the sword, I waited forgiven.I paid extra to get the 3D-Experience and the trailer of Despicable Me showed how much fun this could be. But while watching the main movie I wasn't sure that I still wear my glasses.If anyone f the producers or M. Night Shyamalan himself ever read this, give the money this movie brings in to someone whit talent who tries it again. What is for sure after this disaster I won't ever spent a cent for a Shyamalan film, seeing a 10 Euro note burn would be a better entertainment.The only good point about MY experience with this film seems to be that I got the German dub and and was untroubled of Ovatar Ung.",The Last Airbender
1302,yariedekanarie,"The world is a safer place, thank you Shyamalan",3,22 August 2010,"Avatar: the Last Airbender is truly one of the worst movies ever made by mankind. Although I have fun looking at all the bad reviews and all the people paying top-dollar to see this poor excuse for a movie, it still shouldn't have been made. When I first learned the TV series would be made into a movie I knew it was going to be bad, but this is beyond what I expected. I never knew a movie could suck this much. I work in a movie theater and have sold a lot off tickets for this joke and each time I did I felt like saying: ""I'm sorry you're doing this to yourself. You'll be screaming 'I want my life back!' before the end."" Something that sadly is not in my job description. What is in there is that I am not there as a movie critic but to sell the movies shown, which means I have to say have fun even when I know it's in vain and will end up in a horde of angry people who want at least part of their money back. One of those people came very close to hitting me when I said I couldn't, so I thank you Shyamalan for making my life so safe and peaceful. The Last Airbender should definitely be the last. Not only did Shyamalan forget to use actors and simply chose people who were willing to look into the camera and read off a screen what to say and what to do. It looked like the whole movie was rushed and unscripted. Secondly, apart from the poor acting no-one could even pronounce the names right. It's not like it's that hard. If all the actors had bothered to watch the anime they would have known what people want to hear. Furthermore there are some key-characters missing, Shyamalan was in such a hurry that he forgot that the movie was supposed to be about what Aang learned and him being a kid. The traveling part was could also have been done a bit better. On account of the missing characters the main ones couldn't develop so the entire movie became about ridiculous action scenes all done in semi-slow-motion or just slow-motion. If all that had been done faster and less there would have been more time for an actual storyline. Then there is a final scene, which should draw the story to it's conclusion and give you a feeling of rightness. there should be some follow trough. So not just the thread of being crushed, but some actual crushing to get the message trough. It's not a movie epic but an epic fail. If you like 3D I urge you not to go see this movie because more then half the movie can be watched without the glasses. Something that will not get you to pay less, unfortunately. To conclude I would like to say that this is the poorest excuse for a movie produced in a summer that already has so few enjoyable movies to start with. Luckily none so bad as The Last Airbender. The acting, 3D, storyline, action and pronunciation could all have been done a little better. Only M. Night Shyamalan could have done this bad a job.",The Last Airbender
1303,slobodanvuc,This is a bad kids' movie,3,23 August 2010,"Last night I went to the cinema with my family to see this movie despite knowing it had a poor IMDb rating, expecting at least the action part to be good. However, this was not only a clichéd, unconvincing piece-of-crap Hollywood movie, but worse.Great trailer creates a completely false impression of the movie's tone. It is in fact aimed at the target audience of around 7 years of age and the fighting sequences are really not that exciting (or even plentiful). Now I'm not usually the one to dissect the technicalities if I remotely liked the movie, rather leaving the impression to form in my mind on its own (so I would possibly like what's good about it, even if it was mediocre). However, this was a textbook example of miserable script, acting and directing, definitely not a feel-good movie. To give you an idea of what the bulk of this movie's dialogue feels like - think prepubescent boys yelling and stuttering with their feeble, annoying voices 5 inches away from your face. The movie has but trace amounts of palpable pace so even the predictable plot twists will be the least of your concerns. As for the visuals, well, the bending effects are cute and occasionally nice to look at but don't expect to be wowed. The scenography and costumes are below average.What made me think of giving this movie a 4 was the total absence of gore, brutality, sex scenes and foul language - the general striving to send a positive message of kindness, friendship and benevolence. This could be a plus for those parents who just wanna take their kids to a simple movie and relax without worrying they might have to cover their eyes, do some premature explaining about how human body/life works and later regret ever going. But I seriously don't think even the youngsters would overlook the movie's many flaws and say they had a great time. To wrap this review up - the trailer is a lie.",The Last Airbender
1304,paulhemmens,"Disappointing, but still love it!",4,25 August 2010,"Without spoiling anything ill just write a quick review.Good Points:Graphics were impressive: Love the graphics, the graphics really made it seem like this world actually exists.Fighting style and element bending: The fighting was impressive. The actors used proper fighting techniques. I also liked the way you could see when the actor was bending air, water, earth and fire by how they moved.Bad Points:Acting was horrific!: As an actor your supposed to make the viewer feel like you are there in the film and whats happening around you is real. None of the main actors did a great job of that, some of the older actors were good though.Bad 3D: If a film is to be seen in 3D you expect things shooting out toward you (eg. a fire ball), in this film I saw nothing like that. May as well have watched it on a normal cinema screen.Little Humor: In the cartoon version of this film there is a lot of humor between the main actors, a lot of fun bits that makes the last airbender adventure more enjoyable and entertaining to watch. This film had very little.The story was cut very short: I know that the cartoon version lasts way more that 103 minutes, but if you can't fit a story into one movie without rushing through it then just split it up into two movies.. no point making a bad rushed movie when you could split it into 2 and make a better job of it. There are a lot of scenes left out, some which are important to the story in the next few books.Movie title: I have to add that the movie title 'The Last Airbender' doesn't work well, this could mean that they put the full adventure into one movie (all four books). They should have added a subtitle with 'Book 1: Water' on the posters and all the other things with the movie title on it.I know that there are far more bad than good points but I still enjoyed watching the movie and look forward to the next one.

And the reasoning behind him pronouncing them wrong made me want to punch him even more. What you were mad about people pronouncing your name wrong...pronounce Lynia. And on top of that mister Shyamalan you pronounce their names wrong! You made a crap movie out of a great anime and should apologize to the fans. And trying to make it more diverse it was already diverse putting white people in the film doesn't make anymore diverse.

1306,blazeXe,Blaze Review: The Last Airbender,3,30 August 2010,"M. Night Shyamalan's career has been in a downward spiral for the last few years, from the very disappointing ""Lady In The Water"" to the uncomfortably bad ""The Happening"". A decade ago, Shyamalan seemed to be at the top of Hollywood's rising talents list, but alas, he did not shine any further than ""The Sixth Sense"". Now he returns, not with an original idea, but rather a live adaptation of the popular Nickalodeon television show, ""The Last Airbender"".The Story: There is a world ruled by four nations, each trained to master the elements of nature; air, water, earth, and fire, and to manipulate them to extraordinary measures. Each generation, an 'avatar' is born who possesses the power to bend all four elements. The avatar has been reincarnated for many centuries, until finally passed along to Aang, a young airbender. While on a fishing trip, siblings Sokka and Katara of the Southern water tribe stumble across a sealed ice block, and inside it Aang and his flying bicen, Appa almost a century had passed since Aang's disappearance, and things have changed tremendously since then.The Good: Shyamalan's persistence to write his own scripts lead to rather poor final products. However, now he was adapting existing material, so he couldn't possibly ruin or change anything, right? Well, we'll get to that in a second. If anything good can be said about ""The Last Airbender"", is James Newton Howard's great score, as always the case with every Shyamalan movie. It may not rank as his best composition, but certainly helps to elevate the mood for plenty of dreary, brain-dead moments (and trust me, this movie is jam-packed with them).The visual effects are above average, and provide a few good CGI-driven fights, especially with the waterbending. Another 'good' point may go to Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire), who chances the role of the hot-headed Prince Zuko to pleasing results. However, you could argue that more could've been done to increase the emotional and psychological aspects of the character (ironically by a filmmaker whose past films were practically driven by emotion).The Bad: Man, oh man, where do I begin?... I could go on forever on what makes ""The Last Airbender"" absolutely painful to watch the cheesy, poorly written script, the complete lack of emotion, the 3D gimmick which serves as a major distraction (as usual), the terrible acting, the pronounciation of the names may displease those who watched the English dub, the unlikeable, annoying characters Let's just say that it moved at such a rapid pace, there was hardly enough time to soak in all the details, unless you watched the TV show before-hand. But even if you did, you would still be completely lost. Here you had a show that had so much potential to become something truly epic. Unfortunately, the production design on ""The Last Airbender"" makes StarGate look like a James Cameron film.Everything that made the characters likable has been thrown to the side and replaced with a depression-expression Katara, a vampire-eyed Sokka, and Noah Ringer, who jumps into the role of Aang like an elementery school boy in a play. Even the all-mighty Fire Nation, who were supposed to be ruthless warheads, have been downgraded to men in terrible costumes pretending to be concerned at what was going on.Shyamalan tackles the visual aspect of the show with closed eyes. You would expect the world of the Four Nations to be grand and adventurous (like Middle-Earth), but you only get the occasional ""oohhh"" moment in the sky proceeded by a trip to the dodgy Southern Air Temple, which oddly resembles the Forbidden Woods from ""The Village"" (I was half expecting a blind Bryce Dallas Howard to stroll by). The entire final battle at the Northern Water Temple was amateur and predictable, with the only highlight being Aang's gigantic tidal wave, which basically did nothing other than provide some eye-candy.The movie finally ends with a cliffhanger (not a twist) as did the first season, which introduces Princess Azula. A sequel is inevitable *sigh* The Verdict: Lacking imagination and likable characters, ""The Last Airbender"" only puts itself a hair ahead of ""Dragonball Evolution"" thanks to some decent special effects and a good score. Other than that, you're better off watching the television show again or watching a wall dry. The latter is more fun.3/10",The Last Airbender
1307,astropath2003,A case of disappointed fan syndrome? I know I'm susceptible...,8,30 August 2010,"First, let me say that I'm a big fan of the series, and usually that kind of thing doesn't bode well for somebody's acceptance of a redo in a different medium.However, I saw the movie twice in the cinema. The first time, my negative impression was quite strong, though I had already lowered my expectations substantially from my initial enthusiasm at seeing the trailers. My main complains were (or so I thought) poor structure in places, odd dialog lines, casting that sat at odds with images formed in the series, and bending fights that seemed poorly timed (at least in comparison to the lightning-fast animation in the series). The 3d also is, I feel, poorly done, and the film does not gain anything from it (it doesn't harm it, either, so it's only the producers' loss, I feel).The second time I saw the movie, which was today, I could watch it with even fewer preconceptions, and I found I liked it a lot better. The bending fights were better timed than I thought first, and the same went for the dialog and lines. Even as a big fan I've got to admit that the Water book feels less stringent than the other two, and the movie needed a lot of streamlining for that reason alone (I was saddened to see some Earth Kingdom characters go, but I can see the reasons, and agree with the writers' choice). In my second viewing I also felt the lines and scenes meshed a lot better than I first thought, and lines suddenly looked a lot less stilted when I realized the context they were in (something that escaped me the first time round).So, all in all, I'm quite happy with the movie as it is once I get over my personal (and unjustified) disappointments as a fan. It does not have the scope of the series, but that is impossible in a movie. And as a movie I feel it is enjoyable, and tries to stay very faithful to the series. It's not perfect - what could be, at that? - and the casting is a bit of a sore issue (I do not mind the much-complained about choice of ethnicities here, but Iroh, for example, doesn't have quite the grandfatherly aura he has in the series - in the trailer, I actually thought at first he was supposed to be Ozai).",The Last Airbender
1308,liooness2000-832-683383,"It Could be better, but not as terrible as everyone seems to think",6,31 August 2010,"I went in with low expectations, as many true fans did, and looked at the film critically, understanding it was different and an AU, or alternate universe, since the creators of the cartoons did not make this movie. The movie was extremely fast, it was an all out run till the very end, with mis-pronunciations of names, but the fight scenes, special effects, and yes, even most of the acting was wonderful.For those putting down the poor kids' acting, I have to remind them that there is more dialog in a commercial than there was in the movie. And with the movie moving so fast, the kids didn't get much of a chance to truly act. Also the director makes the final cut, and may have cut out the good scenes and replaced them with the mediocre acting scene because the lighting was better for that one. I've worked on films and in TV, and it is often done for that reason. As many were first time actors, or given pretty serious and difficult roles, I believe the kids did a good job and most of the adults did as well.A few could have been much better, and I believe the film would have been fine with another 40 minutes to an hour added onto it to help everything run smoother and be explained better. The movie was far too short, shorter than many films these days which are sometimes worse. Just because it's a 'kid' movie doesn't mean it can't be longer to help it be better. Kids sat through all the way through star wars and lord of the rings, didn't they? I am disappointed with M. Night. Supposedly a fan, he ran through this wonderful story far too fast, skipping many scenes and characters I loved from the series. He also focused far too much on the villain, Fire Lord Ozai, who we didn't even get to see until the third book in the cartoon. If more time was spent on the real characters, and just leaving Ozai a mystery, it would have run better. I do slightly understand the speed; putting 21 half hour TV episodes into one movie can be daunting, but it could have been made better. I want to own this DVD, and see the trilogy finished, but not by M. Night. My support is for the actors and everyone else who worked on the film. Many actors do need to improve, but I also believe some of that was do to the editing by the director.",The Last Airbender
1309,mbulley86,Can't say bad enough things without being banned I reckon!,1,2 September 2010,"I am dumb-founded that anyone can say this movie was in any sense 'amazing' or even 'good'.This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a very long time (mostly out of choice but this being Avatar I decided to chance it and failed).Yes I may be biased having watched the anime series but some serious basic points:The acting is terrible, I could not feel for any of these characters; even the Harry Potter kids were better (when they were young) and they weren't exactly the best at the timeThe story now doesn't make sense because it has been changed so much. This includes the lack of explanation (other than 'oh but aren't...', 'yeah but didn't this happen...' and 'well yeah but you do remember...') of major plot points and character development. I believe my highlight (in the most ironic sense possible) is after Aang has been unconscious due to being in the spirit world with Zuko, waking up, starting to run away and then turning back to say (as a blatant after-thought) ""We could have been friends you know"", I mean COME ON tacked on or what!And to agree but not overstate this: This is nothing like the anime in any sense and the way the pronunciations of names has been changed and the character's appearances (not the ethnicity but actual appearances) such as Iroh (yes I not E) not being 'jolly' (i.e. fat) actually takes away from their characters. And yes the bending for any of the elements is atrocious, to take 6 or 7 earth benders to lift a tiny rock would mean that fire benders would have needed 100 years just to take over one tiny village let alone destroy an entire clan.In conclusion this is badly acted, terribly adapted and far too dark to even make it a badly-acted-terribly-adapted children's movie.1 star, wish I could give it less.",The Last Airbender

I wouldn't know, but if true, that's very sad.I will admit that most of the acting was atrocious and the characters were boring (except for Zuko and his uncle, whom I liked very much) The movie felt a bit short (at least shorter than most ""epic films"" nowadays), and maybe an extra half hour could easily have been added on to give a little more character development or elaborate on the culture of this ""world"".Overall, I'd say the movie was fun, but it didn't even come close to living up to its amazing potential.",The Last Airbender
1314,smith_t42,Your choice: a disposable kids cartoon or the birth of a movie legend?,8,19 September 2010,"If you love the cartoon to bits, please don't waste your time reading this review. But go away with this one thought though; in five to ten years time no one on the planet will be watching the original cartoon series (except maybe retro freaks downloading it for nothing on the year 2020 version of YOUTUBE). On the other hand, people will still be talking about this astonishing re-imagining of the story. Or to put it another way, they'll raise the name of the original series purely as a footnote and as a sketch of how a cinema legend was created.M. Night had to fit in a hell of a lot of story into a couple of hours. He does it by doing some brave things. Another word for brave is visionary. Gone are all the dumb comedy sub plots and incidents that have characters walking into things and saying dumb things in episode after episode. Great for a kids show, but this is bigger than a kids movie.Aang is no longer is an on-again off-again Avatar who is about as heroic as a bowl of Corn Flakes. The Katara puppy love sub plot is jettisoned too - and instead you get a strangely tormented little boy who is unsure of his destiny, but sure of the power of goodness. At the opposite extreme you get Fire Lord Zuko, who is anything but the one dimensional bully of the original series. In M. Night's hands he's turned into that rarest of things; a heroic villain. There is a dignity to his hatred and determination.No doubt many of the characters could have used more development, but they're always going to look underdeveloped compared to a lengthy TV Series. The special effects are not only mind blowing - they're balanced. Half the screen doesn't have to explode just because a character is scratching his head.And finally, there's been a lot of talk about the racial casting of the movie. Which is a euphemism for ""why did he change the racial types?"". Put it this way, the next time I see a white guy in a starring role in an Indian or Chinese epic - i'll see your point. And more to the point - the end result is as an incredibly manifold cultural portrait as can be imagined. This movie is about worlds within a world.And as for the acting. Yet again Night effortlessly brings out the most jaw dropping performance from children. I have no idea how. Watch this movie and pray he makes more in the series - but also finds time to give us more of his original masterpieces.",The Last Airbender
1315,javier_gudino,Great Movie,9,30 September 2010,"I have no idea why people are bashing this movie.I have watched all the cartoons in the series and can tell you this is finally the best adaptation a cartoon has ever had. The detail of the movie is just astounding. This is an exact replica of what you saw on nickelodeon. I went to the theater with my girlfriend and I have to admit she was a bit confused about many plot holes but once I filled them she was amazed about the beauty and the cool action sequences. I love how some of the scenes are a replica of the cartoon, they were amazing. I saw it on 3D which was MEH since there in not much 3D cinematography but enjoyable non the less. The characters were also very cool and almost identical, I just have to complain about Aang being always too sad and quiet and the Uncle being slim and not funny but nothing else.This is a very enjoyable movie with lots of action and awesome SFX, my only recommendation is that you do watch the cartoon beforehand and I do agree that it was a bit rushed but overall I loved it and would watch it again many times.",The Last Airbender

I was sooooo exited to see the movie and was majorly happy with everything the effects were amazing. I thought the way the actors pronounced a few things was a bit annoying It is Aang not oong, but aside from that the acting was top notch. They could have made Jackson Rathbone a bit funnier though his character is a funny guy ! I thought the the elemental effects where very cool they actually looked very real and I think it was the Avatar state Aang went into made me gasp because it was cool on the cartoon show but on screen it was amazing.I really hope the continue to make then next 2 books because I would very much like to see there take on things. And really want to see Toph ! Out of 10 its totally a 10 best movie I've seen this year.",The Last Airbender
1317,enqma,What went wrong in one of my most expected titles,4,30 September 2010,"Like many people I waited Avatar the Last Airbender with great hope and enthusiasm. Simply because the animation scored 10 out of 10 in my personal opinion. All credits to the creators! Why? Im not a movie maker but according to me it had everything that a movie needs to capture you: Serious, bad, wise, funny, brave all kinds of personalities, Love and hate, war and peace and which is more and wasn't expected in such great amount in an animation wise and emotional lessons! What this movie lacks is well everything. Why? From a perfect storyline, the movie seemed like 'collage' of cut scenes. Its goes to fast, skipping from 1 event to another and while i understand a movie cant cover whole 24 episodes story it didn't manage to cover what is the most important. The FEELING. You cant feel what is to be the Avatar is. When they assumed the Aang is the Avatar it was just like saying that he is a 12 years old boy - Nothing unusual and interesting. To be honest you cant get the feeling of any of the characters, simply because there aren't any emotional and get-to-know scenes, but just the 'important' ones. While action scenes are needed, those boring 'secondary' scenes where nothing happens but characters discuss and talk are as important. Or your action scenes are worthless just as they are in this movie. You cant get the impact of an action scene when you don't actually care whats going on. Saying the movie totally lacks both order and emotion I can as well add it lacks background. For example what is that flying bison, why does avatar's eyes go white, what is to be a bender etc. I won't comment the actors I'll put this part in poor screenplay.I'm still amazed how this great story can be screened so badly. And i think even I could make it pay off better.What i hope is IF they do the second book, they take people's reviews into mind and clear their current ' disaster ' title. P.S. Make sequence to the animation series. in future times for example, that would be 100 times more worth it.",The Last Airbender

They've succeed in being true to the anime in most aspects, fan of the series will definitely feel at home in this movie.This is the second time only that I've felt this way about an anime turned into a movie. The first time was with X-men which was well executed and well received.I think what turns off the audience is the Director who has not received good reviews in a long time. Also the fact that another movie previously released had the word Avatar confuses people if the Airbender had been released first I'm sure it would've been a very different story at the box office.A definite must see for any fan of the series...",The Last Airbender
1319,roro-md,Kung fu meets CGI = good entertainment for me,7,1 October 2010,"I have read a few reviews here on IMDb about the Last Airbender. Most people are blasting this movie with poor ratings which I don't think is fair.First, let me say I have never read or seen or heard about the Avatar series before so I had no expectations of the movie. So I watched the movie with no expectations other than seeing some fancy CGI kung fu trailer.The only conclusion I can come to is that most reviewers had certain expectations about this movie and as a result they gave it poor ratings. When expectations do not meet reality -- problems happen! Expectation #1: Reviewers expected the movie to be like the books or animated series and thus gave it a poor rating. Fact: Generally speaking most books are better than films! This was an adaptation of the book or I should say loosely based on the books.Expectation #2: People are expecting another next Sixth Sense. Fact: Just like Michael Jackson had the Thriller album, M. Night Shyamalanhad the Sixth Sense. There will never be another Thriller album, and there will there be another Sixth Sense. So if you can't wrap your head around the idea that there will never be another Sixth Sense (or Thriller for that matter) don't bother watching any other M. Night Shyamalan movies. Onto my review: I thought the story line was a bit cheesy and dialogue between the characters was not so great. Thinking back to this movie, a possible reason for the poor or direct dialogue could be to keep the younger audience informed of what is happening. Characters either narrate or speak to each other telling you explicitly what is happening and for what reason it is happening. In most other other movies, adults can think for themselves and fill in the blanks in their mind, and put together missing dialogue or scenes. On the same note, Star Wars has a certain cheese factor and poor dialogue... but is greatly entertaining.I would have liked to see more elements of Buddhism or ""wise man"" type quotes in this movie -- perhaps the Dragon Spirit could bestowed a quote that Master Yoda (from Star Wars) would have said like ""Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering."" I thought the blend of kung fu and CGI effects were great match which made for entertaining fight scenes. When I was watching it, I felt like I was watching the Terminator 2 liquid metal effect or The Matrix's dodging bullets. The ""bending"" of the elements was executed very well. Bottom line: If you like kung fu and don't have the expectations that I've stated in the above -- you will like this movie! Overall I was satisfied with this movie experience. Rent it or buy it.",The Last Airbender
1320,iron_duck-860-770166,I cant believe it...,4,2 October 2010,"I just watched the Movie and i cant believe that it really turned out as Bad as People told me before.First off i watched it in German and i have to start with voice acting. Since the Original cartoon is also available in German dubbed it wouldn't be hard to gather at least a few original voice actors. But they didn't and it turned out terrible. Its sounds like people were reading out of a book and swollen.Now the Movie. I can understand, i really can, that you cant put everything Important from the series into a Movie. But the choice was weird to say the least. As many already stated it felt like putting clips together. I don't think someone who hasn't watched the series know whats going on at all, it was confusing.The acting was terrible, no the cast was. Katara and Aang somehow managed to felt somehow right and i also could slightly agree with the Acting for the Acting of uncle Iroh (visually not but the the character was OK). But Zuko and Sokka were terrible and the Princess from the Northern Water tribe was completely lost. Even at the end when they showed Zukos sister I face palmed.The only reason how I rated it 4 is because some of the Action scenes weren't so bad, while others looked cheap. Overall i would say average and cant compete with other Movies this year.I feel sorry because i really hoped that it would turn out great and that i could look forward for the great end fight in the third book between Aang and King of the Fire Nation.I would say if you want to compare it with anything then take Eragon, its the same level.",The Last Airbender
1321,jonathanzcook,I liked it quite a bit.,8,2 October 2010,"I took my children to see this who were fans of the series. I had absolutely NO idea what it was about. But it was an opportunity to have a bit of a doze, so off I went. I must admit to having very low expectations (which is the key to everything by the way) and hoped it would not last too long.But I found myself, after about 10 mins, sitting up and taking an interest. Then 10 mins after that, I was really enjoying myself - and was hooked.I thought the martial arts and choreography, scenery, sets, effects, music, and production quality were really impressive. The cast was pretty good,although script was a bit weak - but it was a kids film, so I can let that point slide. I did think that the 3D was unnecessary and not really noticeable anyway.I think that having no preconceptions (and very low expectations) was a blessing. But overall I was really pleased and hope to see the sequel and in the mean time will look out for the series on the telly :-)",The Last Airbender
1322,sagamark11,worst film this year,1,3 October 2010,"First of all this is my first review of a movie ever and second before i really get started on the review i am eager to know who voted 10/10 for this movie i mean who in their right mind voted 10/10 (2,493 13.6%) i really want to know please explain it to me. There is only two explanations that i can think of 1. it is a big joke that 2,493 people came up with 2. (2,493 people) ummmm sounds like the whole crew of the movie but that is just my opinion. yes i am going to list why;, you shouldn't watch it , why people watch's it anyway, like i did, why you shouldn't support the movie , if your new to the story and curious how could the series be so successful just watch the cartoon show i recommend it you wont be disappointed. why the director M. Night Shyamalan should get the boot and get the worst movie director award. he single handed killed the avatar within 103minWhat pisses me off enough to make me want to write a review is the director M. Night Shyamalan role , just about every avatar fans know of him or about him by now. Now i am fully aware the many harsh comment made towards him, does he deserve it? that's no brainier which is yes! why do i hate him so much? lets see he is arrogant he said on an interview that he is happy and proud of what he ""archive"" as he called it ignoring all the critics including the the many fans so yeah pretty much everyone. can you believe he said he ""cant wait to make the sequel"" F*** yep he said that those words.this is one of the reasons why i hate him pure arrogance and lack of respect to the audience. One of the biggest mistake M. Night Shyamalan was taking the series and basically changing it trying to make it his own (by the way for those that are new to avatar he did not wrote this masterpiece, his suppose to direct the original story plot not to create alternated characters and lose the plot what gives him the right! F****. The names changes e.g the original Aang to oung why did he do this? because apparently in Asian Chinese culture it is pronounce this way because wait for it his Asian , that's F*** stupid i mean i have some Chinese heritage mixed with Hispanic , the first time i watched and got hook to this series it was Aang not oung if it was originally oung then changes Aang all a sudden it would be the same scenario i would be still upset with the changes. it would be like changing the name of James bond to James band , Luke skywalker to Micheal moonwalker. its how it is its not racist when other culture pronounce words with the same meaning for example ""mark"" in English is ""marcos"" Spanish which ever culture started it the other just adopted it.i know i said i was going write the film review i couldn't be bothered anyway since everyone already wrote about it there is really nothing much left to write about it everyone pretty much covered how bad it was. so overall worst movie this year for avatar sake not the worst ever, but the expectations by many fans were very low it is hard to believe it is lower than this. worst than dragonball evolution maybe equal.",The Last Airbender

People need to understand that really, you cannot squeeze hundreds of pages of detailed events from a book in a 2 hour movie. Don't get me wrong, i don't watch the cartoon or read any books about it, but I'm pretty sure i have got an idea of what the story is about. I was never lost in the movie, there was plenty of wowing effects and good fighting scenes. I didn't actually want to watch another one of those cartoons made into a movie, but this one i couldn't take my eyes off. I cant wait till the next one comes out.

One scene, one fire nation soldier tried to bend fire, he kicked to the air (a very cheesy kick), do a very, and I say very cheap act of kungfu, and there goes fire spit from one of the torch, it sucks!

Yeah the acting could be better but that comes with time. By the second movie they should improve and by the third it should be spot on. The effects and settings were great, no argument there. Obviously all the negative comments and reviews were a load of crap because everyone went to see the movie anyways and it did great in the box office. I'm glad the movie was successful in the box office because now there will be a sequel. Any open minded person would know this movie wasn't all bad and deserves a chance and it's getting that chance. It's very under appreciated and once people stop trying to compare it to the series and view it as a movie that stands on its own feet with only borrowed aspects from the series, they would learn to enjoy the live action film more.

1326,schnabel45,Tear Jerker,1,9 October 2010,"This movie was a true tear jerker, but in the worst way possible. I was saddened by the amount of depth that had been removed from the characters. Characters that play an important part in the series (such as Appa) were merely there so that their names weren't mentioned randomly. Also a lot of plot development was removed from the original story line. One of the worst things that they did was remove when Aang went to the spirit world and talked one on one with Roku. Then when Aang was defeating the fire nation at the northern water tribe he did not do it with a large water man, but instead with a huge wave. I am ashamed of this movie and cannot express how much it comes short of the series. So much was changed, which made the movie shallow. It has brought shame to the series.

The film doesn't do the original series any justice. The actors were bad, story did not flow, the characters had DIFFERENT personalities from the series and worst of all, M Night changed ALL the characters race backgrounds.Why oh Why oh Why would you change the the race of all the characters in a movie? It's just disrespectful! I read an interview that M.Night did, and he tried to explain that those changes were made as he just wanted to concentrate on getting good actors rather than average actors who were from the right ethnic background, yet in the end The actors couldn't have been worse! I believe the different ethnic backgrounds was part of what made the original series what it was.Sokkas' character was such a funny, and lively one from the series and yet M Night has changed him to be the total opposite in the Movie...

The rest was shocking. The story was skimmed over with the less important bits focused on and the important bits glossed over, The characters portrayed completely wrong (I don't think Aang cracked a smile the entire movie, instead being depressed and angry!?) the infuriating pronunciation of characters names (e.g Ung instead of Aang???), The shocking acting, making the people of the different nations separate ethnicity's....Everything about this was poorly done and I can't believe how anyone can so completely destroy basically everything about a much loved series.

That's just how irresponsible I find him to be.For all the people that said the visual effects were good... making the elements dance on the screen is not good visual effects...

Now i know a lot of you out there will say hey thats a lot but when it comes down to it a movie that needs/has as much CGI work and marketing as this one does that is chump change for the movie to be any better than what was produced. I mean come on everyone knew this movie would need as much CGI work as possible to please fans in a purely visual sense. I mean almost everything was represented graphically to near exact precision barring the character of course, which probably took near 1/3 of the budget alone. and on top of that the marketing cost paramount 130 million so don't complain about the plot and the acting when most of the money went to the graphics and marketing people.2) The Fan ExpectationsEveryone who has ever seen the animated series was going to hate this movie regardless for one reason or another. if it followed the book and TV series exactly and acting was superb, the graphics would suffer tremendously and fans would be disappointed. if the graphics were spotless, as they were i add, everything else would suffer and the fans would be disappointed by acting and depth of the film(as many are). You all know it to be just that simple, so End of that discussion.Now the movie itself was a disappointment mainly because of option 2 but only because reason 1 exists. if the budget were twice what it was everyone would have been praising the film period. YOu know this I know this and M. Night Shyamalan knows this. As for me I'm willing to look past the lack of depth in the plot and storyline as well as the actors lack of portrayal precision because of the graphics, although acting and storyline still hurt my overall vote. I guess my bottom line is that this movie is for those who love graphics and continuity is not an issue.

1333,jarydp,Utter Disappointment,1,11 November 2010,"I watched this movie before I even touched the cartoon series, as the series itself never really caught my attention at the age that I was.Once I saw this film's teaser trailer I decided that I had to see it for its visual effects. However, I was met with total disappointment! Whilst yes set decoration and visual effects could blow the viewer's minds the fact still remains that those are not the only elements to a great film.A while after I watched this movie I decided to purchase the cartoon series, and boy was I actually blown away at how brilliant this series was. I felt like such a fool for not noticing it sooner, the further I progressed with the series more and more was revealed about how bad the film adaptation was.The series was by far more emotionally driven as well as actually having a purpose in its life. This film may have touched on only 1 or 2 crucial moments during 'Book 1'. The Southern Air Temple does not really count in the film, as this key moment felt completely disjointed and also felt like it didn't progress the film at all.The actors were absolutely atrocious, not capturing my interest at all, not keeping my eyes glued to the screen, where was the director on set? Was he even there? I must have lost concentration countless times whilst watching this film, they also never showed much of character progression such as Aang receiving water bending lessons from Katara, before reaching the Northern Water Tribe.I was totally lost when Aang began his speech to the Earth benders. (I mean wasn't this a huge prison scene on a sort of oil rig in the middle of the ocean? Preventing the Earth benders from bending anything? I mean come on if you wanted to prove that you were taking the benders as your prisoners surely you would remove any aspect to prevent an uprising/rebellion?) Telling them to fight back and defend themselves for the dialog just fell apart (Not to mention it was Katara that was actually suppose to give this speech). And during the montage I must have fallen asleep due to boredom as I barely remember anything happening.Though the siege that happened with the Northern Water Tribe, they touched on some important aspects but the fact that when Prince Zuko abducted Aang he did not take him to the outskirts of the kingdom, he instead hid within the it, that right there barely makes sense on its own. And the time when Aang made the invasion retreat, ""oh wow big tidal wave, lets turn around and run!"" (sarcasm). Aang was actually suppose to perform acts of utter destruction in his Avatar state, when he was binded with a spirit.If there are to be sequels so this film I shall not be attending them if M. Night Shyamalan is involved in anyway, and I would suggest the same to all others who don't want to end up wasting their money and replacing all high expectations with nothing but disappointment.",The Last Airbender

The only characters that were even close to the series were Katara and Princess Uay and their acting wasn't what it should have been. The characters didn't have any of the personality that the ones in the series had. They were all so serious and sad the whole time that it was almost depressing. Not at all exciting and thrilling like it should have been. This could have been such a great movie but was a total flop in my book. My kids hated it. If they allow another to be made by and with the same people who did this one we won't even watch it! I think they should redo this one (producer, actors and all) and make it more like the series even if it has to be a 2 part movie and put more of the adventure back in it before they even think about trying to make one for the next chapter! Avatar fans deserved better than this! If this was the best they could come up with they should have stayed with the animated version and made a movie to complete the cliffhangers left in the last episode! I actually wandered if any of these people had watched all of the episodes in the series, because if they had surely they could have done better than they did.

Yes, of course, it didn't follow the series to the letter. Guess what, I haven't seen a movie that followed a series or a book entirely and usually you should allow some room for disappointment as your 'favorite' scenes are left from the book or series from the movie.Example, all of you complaining about Avatar: The Last Airbender, I think they did a decent job (yes I've seen the series) and I actually enjoyed the movie a lot even though I enjoyed the series a lot too. They weren't necessarily in the same league, but I liked the movie for the movie it was. You should look at the more unfortunate movies stemmed from anime. Look at DBZ (which I am a long time fan of) it took them how many years to make? Like 7 or 10? Look what a horrible flippin' job they did on it. IT was a disgrace and they changed the entire concept and some of the key characters and plot points. That would be something to complain about. (Even then, the DBZ film was at least amusing to watch even though it disgraced the series)I actually went and saw Airbender with my mother, who had never seen the series, and she understood the concept well, and learned a lot, and LOVED the movie. So, instead of looking at the small things they did wrong (and a few action scenes they varied, such as the wave at the end instead of the fish).

1341,swervnervn,This movie will make you wish you had your 2 hours back from your life,1,19 November 2010,"This movie is so horrible that I made an account on here just to say this.First thing to talk about is the main protagonist. Instead of keeping the name of the character the same as the show, the characters in the movie call him Ong. The tattoo on his back is a cross instead of a straight line like in the show. I'm thinking, hey M.Night is trying to advertise his religion. That one annoyed me but I was willing to look over the cross on the back if the movie was at least okay. It was not even okay. I thought It was so horrible that I might throw up if I keep watching it. I didn't throw up (I did feel it though).Second thing to talk about are the other protagonist in the movie. Everyone of the ""Good Guys"" are white! Every single last one of them. This just like messing up the main character also annoyed me to the point where I was yelling at my T.V. First the Cross on Ong(Fake Aang's)Back, now this. At this point I start jumping around my place yelling saying WTF M.Night.Third thing to talk about are the antagonist. Everyone of the ""Bad Guys"" look like they are from the middle east. At this point I'm jumping, yelling, and laughing at why I even attempt to watch this movie. The Fourth thing to talk about are the side characters. They all look like Asians, and all of them are weak prisoners or citizens. that have lost their ways. Also none of the characters had emotion.To put this all together. M. Night Shyamalan put the Heroes as White people, Enemies as Middle Easterns, The Weak as Asians, and a Cross on the Main Characters Back. I'm not gonna complain about the Asians right now, but White versus Middle Easterns in a story that suppose to take place in an almost all Asian Fictional Surrounding.What's going on at the time that this movie was made?The war on terrorist in middle east across sea's.What about the Cross on Ongs Back?Might be the perceived superior religions symbol in America in M.Night's mind. Other than the stuff written in this review, the only other thing I can say is that if you watched the commercials for this movie thats pretty much the story. Not worth the money.",The Last Airbender
1342,fthhoplove,I loved this movie...,10,19 November 2010,"but I have to admit, I've never seen any of the animated series or read any books (if there even are any books.) I went to the theater to see this movie not knowing anything about it. And I absolutely loved it! I can see where it might be a complete let down to those who have a knowledge of the cartoon (like the Harry Potter movies for me) but as someone who was introduced to the characters and the story line in this movie I found it to be amazing. I left the theater that day saying I wanted to purchase this movie when it comes out on DVD and I did just that. I bought it in the Blu-Ray, DVD, & Digital Copy combo pack on Tuesday, Nov. 16th, the day it was released. I went home and watched it that night...and I still love this movie! The martial arts and graphics were great. The characters were believable and I felt like I could understand what they were experiencing and going through. The five elements (Air, Water, Fire, Earth, Metal) were briefly touched upon and I can't wait to see how they are explained in future movies.I'm sorry it's such a disappointment for others but I sincerely hope they continue to make the sequels because I can't wait to see how the characters develop and how the story ends.",The Last Airbender
1343,takeoutboxpro,Cut This Film Some Slack!,7,19 November 2010,"After watching this movie, I didn't know what to say. Because of hearing so many negative reviews on M. Night Shyamalan's latest film, I was expecting this movie to be a crappy piece of work that didn't deserve a place in theaters. After actually sitting through the whole movie, though, I was proved wrong by my assumptions.I fail to fathom why this movie was so hated. Sure, the original series off which the movie was based is much better, but The Last Airbender is very entertaining in more ways than expected. No doubt, the graphics were visually stunning. And after taking a closer look beneath the pretty cover-up of CGI that masked the whole of the movie, it was easy to find more in store. For the most part, the characters were great, especially Jackson Rathbone playing the role of Sokka. The dialogue was stale in places, but those scenes quickly progressed and moved on deeper into the storyline.I was amazed at how much storyline Shyamalan was able to squeeze into one film. The Last Airbender did an excellent job containing and taming the vast amount of story that was taken from season one of the series. Another element that caught my attention was the beautifully choreographed battle scenes. Around every corner, the characters faced foes that could only be fended off by using the power to bend elements, creating stunning moments of action that never got boring.I am interested to see how a sequel would turn out. This movie was in no way terrible, but because of how many brickloads of negativity Shyamalan was pounded with, it is highly doubted that a sequel would dare be released.The overall thing is, people don't seem to like change. One of the main reasons this movie is so loathed is because it is different than the Avatar cartoon series. Not bad, just different; and difference is a concept most people don't enjoy coping with. But if we'd all just take a moment to step out of our shell and look deeper into something different, we might just end up liking what we see.",The Last Airbender

1345,ajbjork,The only reason I would watch this movie again is to understand exactly how BAD this Movie is.,2,21 November 2010,"OK. . . So I am clear. . . The M Night Shyamalan that directed this movie is the same M Night Shyamalan that directed the 6th Sense and Unbreakable? If so, has he suffered any major head injuries? I mean ""Lady in the Water"" and the ""Village"" were certainly not his finest hours but the ""Last Airbender"" is on another level of unholy crap. If his movies were paintings on a wall, ""6th Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" would be like Picaso's; the ""Village"", would be similar to a high school art teacher's; and the Last ""Airbender"" would be a framed piece of used toilet paper. The CG was completely Hackneyed, ""How to Train Your Dragon"" had more convincing CG. I understand that this movie was based on a Cartoon Series, not familiar with the series but the movie reminded me of a 2 hour long ESPN Highlight reel. Story progression flowed like chunky peanut butter. By the time I got half way through the movie I was completely lost. As for the acting? Where the hell did he get his cast from? A Middle School Drama Club? Maybe years down the line after M Night has gone the way of the cassette tape this movie will be looked on as a stoner cult classic, like ""Dude Where's My Car"" Thats why I gave it a 2, somewhere down the line someone might find something redeeming about the 103 minute long live action Dora the Explorer",The Last Airbender
1346,redd2922,"Please, Please PETER JACKSON finish directing this movie series!",1,21 November 2010,"I am a huge fan of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" even though it is a children's show, I watched the series with me son and husband religiously. I have waited eagerly for the movie to come out. I have rented it today and could not wait until the scene with the Northern Water Tribe and see Aang use his avatar state. I was very disappointed to see M. Night Shyamalan change this scene among others, but mostly this scene for it was always me family's favorite in the series! Sadly there were many things wrong with HIS version. The mask that the fire prince wore did not even have hair around it. The movie alone was in scenes it seemed, as if hitting the skip button on a DVD remote. Key scenes were left out in regards to building the characters and how they came to be. Katara's brother was not even correct on how his character was. He was always against going to places and was always whining and wanting food. On the movie it was the opposite until the princess was deciding on giving her life away. Not to mention when Momo was first introduced in the series if I am not mistaken Sokka was the one who first came across Momo because something pertaining to food and they fought over it, in fact I believe Aang stopped him from killing Momo. Let me ask you M. Night Shyamalan, how did Prince Zoku get his scar on his face? Aye you had Prince Zoku ask a child if he knew about the prince and the story unfolded but that was not part of the bloody animated series! If you are going to create a movie based on a series at least follow the bloody thing!! I understand timing is important but PETER JACKSON did NOT take away from Tolkien's writings of ""The Lord of the Ring"". Why should the fans of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" be treated any better in regards to their favorite series? No instead you chop it up and speed through it just as David SLADE had done with the movie Eclipse. Just as was done with Eclipse M. Night Shyalaman should be replaced with another director, in fact I believe PETER JACKSON would do an excellent job on the series just as he had done on Tolkien's stories. And if you are going to make a movie after a series make sure to follow how the characters appearance is on the series and that they match in your movie. Ozai, Prince Zuko's father had facial hair and a pony tail in the series, he did not have either in the bloody movie. And Aang is not pronounced (Ong) it is (A-ng) with a long ""a"" sound. Learn how to say the names for crying out loud. Study the series! I am so disappointed with this film I am jumping from topic to topic. Please do not waste your money on this film if you are a true fan of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" and if you are not a fan please watch the series instead it explains everything and is so much more fulfilling! M.Night Shyamalan YOU need to quit directing! The only decent movie you had was ""Signs"" in 2002. Please, please I beg you STOP wasting our (the audience) time and your time!",The Last Airbender
1347,byangelsdeath,Epic Fail (Spoiler Alert),1,22 November 2010,"the movie was a jumbled mess it didn't make any sense and was practically a whole new story with the same names and key points of all the major battles which is LAME! the fact that Firelord Ozai had as big a part as he did in this film was a joke he should have had little to do with it or nothing at all. the portrayal of the characters were both physically disappointing as well as over dramatic and were not even the same people personality wise. in my opinion this whole series(all 3 books) should have been broken up into 6 to 8 movies which could have done it some justice not 3 which is what it looks to be set up as. another thing that was poorly done is the fact that they butchered every and all name. animation was good aside from creature animation both Appa and Momo looked off in way i cant really back up with words it just something you have to see for yourself. the overall tone of the movie was just like any other M. Night Shyamalan movie which is a more depressing and an emotionally unattached movie. when in fact the show was probably the exact opposite. another thing is that key background information which helps attach a viewer to the characters of this intricate good vs evil story were thrown in there as if they were just another line in the script as if had no emotional feeling behind it or importance to the story. i recommend all fans of Avatar: The Last Airbender refrain from seeing this movie and stick with the show(here is the big spoiler)to all fans of the show there is a new section to the avatar series Avatar:The Legend Of Korra, and plenty of other Sections of it as far as i read. so that yes it is true that the section of ""The Last Airbender"" is over the story does not stop there",The Last Airbender

1349,smoker_the_joker,103 wasted minutes of my life which I will never get back!,3,30 November 2010,"Oké, I want to start with telling that I've seen the Series. I'm 21 years old and still enjoy it. So I was pretty excited when I heard there was a movie of The Last Airbender. I didn't have time to see it at the cinema's so I had to wait for it to be released on DVD. I rented it, watched it, and brought it back within 3 hours. There's a couple of things that are just WRONG with this movie. Here's a list of what I have to say about this movie. They may not all be in right order but I do not care much about order anyway.1. There is too much compassion from Ozai towards his son! 2. No vague comments and obsession for tea from Iroh. Not to mention he's nowhere near fat! 3. No mothering from Katara. 4. No silly remarks and jokes from Sokka, which btw made me had quiet a few laughs when I watched the series. 5. No naive childish 'fun' from Aang. 6. The actors look nothing like the characters from the series. 7. The level of acting is very low and the bending looks like sh*t... also, firebenders should be able to create fire from their fingertips... not use existing fire! 8. No interaction with Appa and between Appa and Momo. 9. Zhao isn't half as ruthless, brutal and arrogant as in the series. 10. The movie went to the 'Northern Watertribe' part way too fast. There is no track about what happened where and when. 11. The music sucked, they should've at least used some music from the series as that music creates much excitement. 12. Mostly Indian people playing the characters?! 13. Aangs love for Katara isn't showing AT ALL! 14. No traditional armors are showing. I really liked the firenation designs with the white masks. 15. And last but not least, there story is well off. There are a lot of things happening out of context and make the movie hard to follow. I know how the story goes as I've seen all the episodes like 10 times.",The Last Airbender

Look there are two things wrong, Ang is called Ong, and I was teased they would go through all the books, but like the cartoon its never enough and I want the sequels to be out now. If your a fan remember through the first book we need to set up the story, even though its awesome when ang goes beastmode in here, we want more. That's because we know how spectacular the avatar is when he's blue and masters all the elements, money well spent.

If you take the time I know this may seem diverse to watch the cartoon from NicK, you may actually get the plot and understand how difficult this has been to accomplish.The Time to read Wiki regarding this film I believe the job has been well executed to the point of interest in the story line Granted all things can be done differently but I feel the capturing of such an epic and iconic animation into this direction should be appreciated.If your looking for the film, lets hope the next two are actually completed as this will redeem all the negative critics as the best is yet to come Its not over and I hope in the end you all enjoy this circle as this has the potential in the end",The Last Airbender
1352,andy-hermans2-913-364000,Worst adaptation ever seen,1,2 December 2010,I finally got round to watch this movie since I like to give the children of my sister movies as Christmas presents. This movie however was a bust since I happened to have seen the series as well. As I expected they tried to cram the entire first season together in 90 minutes which I knew from the start was impossible. The director left out some key moments in Aangs development and some key characters from the first season. It would have been better if they had adapted into a series of films. If you would cut out some episodes which aren't really that necessary you 'd still end up with 18 hours of film. So what were they thinking???,The Last Airbender
1353,jaggillarintegulahus,Worst piece of sh** ever,1,2 December 2010,"Wow... I LOVED the last air bender series, and this movie... It wasn't even worth watching. They even f***** up his tattoos? Not that I enjoyed those blue things very much but they sure as h*** were prettier than those f***** up signs.The actors were horrible, with few exceptions. The girl playing Katara was ugly and couldn't act for sh**. Aang had like a whole different personality, his facial expressions and his behavior reminded me of some crazy serial killer I saw in a movie once. And oh, how they f***** up the story. Halfway through the movie I honestly felt like crying out of disappointment. And I actually considered paying to watch this movie in 3D. That would have been like flushing my money down the toilet and I really would have cried halfway through when I realized it wasn't gonna get better. And btw, am I the only one who noticed that some of the water benders were wearing really ugly hats/hoods? Although I must admit that the movie was funny from time to time. Even made me laugh. Like when terrible actors were trying to be dramatic. Or when I noticed the ugly hats. When the water bending master screamed before the war started. What was that about? Not really an inspiring scream, it was kinda feminine. And when I saw that Zuko was... a Turkish man? Not that I have anything against Turkish men, just that... In the series Katara and Soccah are brown but in the movie they were both white. As were everyone else in their village. I was expecting a white Zuko so I was a bit shocked. Actually, I was expecting everyone to be white since I'd read it was an American movie.The fact that they didn't shoot fire out of their fists but had to bend it from another source was very annoying. I liked it better when they shot fire out of their fists. More badass that way. Also, the fire moved in slow mo. And what was with all that moving around without bending? I mean, Aang had to dance for a few seconds before he could bend anything? To sum it up: Aang was an ugly, annoying serial killer kid, Katara was an annoying, emotional, whining b**** with some of the worst acting skills I've ever seen, the story was f***** up and horrible, many important and great scenes were left out and everything was changed for the worse. And Zuko was a Turkish man.Also a few things I thought about; Whose floor did Zuko pop out of in the north pole? Very thin floor. Why did Zuko ask a random kid (with +++++ acting skills) about the fire prince? I'm not sure I got that. I sort of got it, but if I understood it correctly that was the most retarded scene ever. The water benders were supposed to be prepared for the fire nations attack so why did civilians run around in panic in the middle of the battlefield when the they invaded? Or were those warriors?If I wasn't too busy watching anime and being a nerd, I'd totally send the director anthrax, or whatever you can send by mail that will ensure a painful death. Turning awesomeness into PURE SH** like he did should be against the law.",The Last Airbender
1354,keenym,Don't know the series but HATED the movie,1,9 December 2010,"First off I have read many of the reviews concerning this movie, and most make note that they loved the series and was severely disappointed. I for one have never seen even one episode of the animated series (will however change this in the near future since I would love to see all that this awful movie could have been but was not) I saw the trailers for Airbender, and despite very negative reviews still decided to see it as I felt I would be unbiased never having watched the series, what a big mistake. Look the sets were epic and some of the visuals were very beautiful (I did not see it in 3D)but I was completely LOST, I did not understand the motivation for most of the characters actions, and I won't even say anything with regards to the acting, since you just can't complain about something that was not there. (An exception to this was Dev Patel) All in all I was very very very disappointed and really would not recommend this movie to anyone whether you know the back story or not.",The Last Airbender
1355,bhaines91,Absolute disgrace,1,9 December 2010,"I am a huge fan of the original series Avatar: The Last Airbender. I was introduced to it by my good friend right after it ended, and after wards I made it my mission to watch every episode in the series, I absolutely loved it. Than word came that a live-action movie was coming out by M. Night Shyamalan, and I couldn't have been more excited. I only saw The Sixth Sense and Signs, and not his later movies, so I really had no concerns. So after two or so years of high anticipation, the movie is finally released in theaters, but before I see it I look at the reviews, and I balked because of how terrible the reception was. But I still wanted to see it, and so I did, and within the time span of 10 minutes in, I already made this conclusion M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender is one of the worst movies to have ever been made, and is an absolute disgrace of an abortion and an absolute waste of film.There are so many problems with this movie, It would take the length of a book to even talk about them all. The acting is atrocious pretty much across the board, (Dev Patel as Zuko and Shaun Toub as Iroh are okay) with stiff and/or awkward delivery, and the writing of this movie...I'll just say this, do you think the following line, ""We need to show them we belief in our beliefs just as much as they belief in theirs"" is a natural, human thing to say? Because this movie is chalk full of terrible lines like this. They're even up on IMDb's quote page if you want a sample.The story is rushed to the point of absurdity. Important characters, plot points, and even character development from the original series is either glossed over, or forgotten entirely. There is always going to be someone that says it's impossible to fit an entire TV season into one movie, but with such a hackneyed effort as this, this shouldn't even be considered an effort.The personalities of the characters are butchered so badly, that they might as well be different characters entirely. Instead of the happy optimistic, yet strong character of Aang, we have a humorless, sad over-dramatic character named Oong, instead of a strong motherly character that Katara originally was, we have a whiny crying little girl in her place. Don't even get me started on Sokka (or Soakka as he was called in the movie) changing a sarcastic comedic character into a stiff over serious one is never a good idea, the list goes on and on. The names of a handful of characters aren't even correct, Aang is now Oong, Sokka is now Soakka, Iroh is now Eroh, and even terms like Avatar are now Ahvatar, and Agni Kai is now Agni Key, so this supports my different character theory even more. The end result is the equivalent of a collection of cardboard cutouts that all have a frowning or sad face that don't even look like the original characters.Overall, The Last Airbender is a movie that I would not recommend to anyone for any reason, other than to laugh at. My friend who introduced me to the series hasn't seen the movie since he's in the Navy, but when we meet up together again, I'm going to show him just how terrible this movie is, and we are just going to laugh at it. To sum this movie up, I need to borrow a quote from Uncle Iroh (the fat, tea loving one, not the over serious, slim one)...disgraceful.",The Last Airbender
1356,Jimi-t2012,Excellent entertainment for the whole family.,10,12 December 2010,"I simply had to sign up to IMDb just to write this review after seeing the highly inappropriate 4.5 stars out of ten it currently receives as it's overall score. Without going into too much detail, the film is aimed at the younger viewer so it's a given that certain details and plot points that don't quite add up must be allowed some leeway. What other fantasy films don't rely on imagination?My partner and I were captivated and entertained and wholly impressed by this film and rate it much, much higher than many other films we have seen on IMDb with much higher user ratings (such as The Town for example which I saw last night, receiving a user score of around 7 out of 10. While being a good film was no where near as good as the Last Airbender for sheer entertainment value, which is what I use as the main factor when rating a film.)Ignore the low rating and undue moaning and take a look at this film, you will not be disappointed.",The Last Airbender

The casting is ridiculous, the depiction of the four nations is totally askew, and for a real Avatar fan: TOTAL disappointment. There is nothing great about the movie at all. If he was gonna butcher the story, mispronounce the names, change the races of the nations who are all clearly of Asian decent, cast some never heard of them kids who look nothing like their cartoon counterparts, then they should have at least just created a whole new idea instead of labeling this Avatar: The Last Airbender.

I recommend 'Plan 9 from outer space'. It's a definite contender for the worst movie ever made but at least you get a laugh out of it. 'The last airbender' just makes me sad...granted, I did not make it past the twentieth minute (and that only because I was stoned when watching it and couldn't find the remote), so don't take my opinion at face value!

I haven't watched a lot of the cartoons maybe one or two of them but I enjoyed it and ""got"" the storyline. My kids have watched a lot of the cartoon episodes and loved watching the story in ""real"" - not a single comment about it being boring or poorly done whatsoever. I have read a lot of reviews of this movie and most of them have given the movie a poor rating - this puzzles me a lot. To me it seems like everyone decided they don't like the instructor (M. Night Shyamalan) and therefore don't like the movie.Conclusion: If you have kids and want to watch a flick with them - this one is a good choice. (afterwards they will jump around making martial combos like crazy ;) )",The Last Airbender
1363,sumansouth,Really unjustified rating!,8,25 December 2010,"Just saw this movie and was shocked at the amount of 1 out of 10 reviews on the site here...sure its not a cinematic masterpiece and there are things that could be improved but its definitely not awful! i have never seen the original cartoon so perhaps that is the reason for the differing opinion but saw this with the family and thought it was very enjoyable, story line not to boring at all and the special effects amazing.sure the acting was not Oscar wining, and some of the casting is odd but all the visuals definitely make up for that.a lot of fans sound disappointed at the fact the movie didn't follow the cartoon series, i wouldn't know not having seen it, so if you haven't seen the cartoon and are simply after an entertaining kids movie with the family with awesome visuals and good action sequences i would strongly recommend!",The Last Airbender
1364,bdelman1,Was the movie really a disaster? Or just a different interpretation?,5,25 December 2010,"Honestly, i gave the movie a 5. The whole thing about it is...if your going to turn a series into a movie stick with the plot and stick with the story line. Its just like movies they make from books, if they keep it the same they do great, when things are changed its a huge flop. It didn't have to be changed that is why the cartoon got awards and the movie, nothing. I honestly don't care if M. knight shamalan (spelled incorrectly on purpose) thinks the names are not pronounced correctly, it wasn't your cartoon! Things need to be kept the same, like the old saying. if its not broke, don't fix it.Now granted the movie was simplified for viewers who haven't seen the cartoon, but you did those viewers a great dis-justice. The cartoon was amazing! and the movie could have been as well. The way i see it. You have a puzzle thats completed, your break it into pieces because you want to put it together again, but your dog eats a couple of the puzzle pieces, so you create your own pieces. Guess what! the puzzle is still ruined.Great Job M. Knight!!!!",The Last Airbender
1365,MovieNerd95,What a disappointment!,3,28 December 2010,"I am a huge fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, so when I heard that there was gonna be a movie I was so excited. I saw it with my brother who is also a fan of the TV show and wow, just WOW! What the hell M.Night Shyamalan?! First off, the names were pronounced differently?! Okay, that's just a small complaint, but it was really annoying. Second, the acting, everyone except Dev Patel and Shaun Toub sucked. Now onto the positive things......um......the effects were decent, the sets were nice, and the fighting was kinda cool. I recommend that no one should see this movie, except if you're a fan of Avatar: the Last Airbender, because it'll remind you just how great the show was!",The Last Airbender
1366,jenn-935-554512,An Epic Disappointment (Though worth a second glance),5,28 December 2010,"To start, I will say that this movie is an epic disappointment. I am, as many are who have seen this movie, a large fan of the series. I held off seeing the movie till it came out on On-Demand. I had heard so many bad reviews, I wanted to give time for the dust to settle. I am glad I did. Much less upset for losing a couple of bucks from ordering it than what I could have dropped to see this on the big screen. Having said that I have watched the movie more than once and I do intend to watch it again. Why oh why would I want to revisit such a horrendous nightmare? Why would I want to see a movie that did more damage to the original tale than a nuke would do to downtown London? Why would I want to watch beloved characters be stripped of their very essence and re- molded into some monopoly cutout that could be fit into most any other story? Why I would I even want to hear them give their own personal ""spin"" to the pronunciation of the characters names?Why? Because it is good. Oh god, shoot me now. I have to admit it is a good movie. You will have to see if several times to even consider this point of view. Why? Because you have to get passed the fact they butchered what was a wonderful story. If you take it at its raw base, the Avatar ran away, was gone 100 years and then comes back to find the Fire Benders have had PMS for a century and moves to make it right, you might be able to find a semi decent movie among all the trash. (Though I still hope they don't try to make the second book.)",The Last Airbender
1367,rjturpin,Seemed great to my child as well as myself.,10,28 December 2010,"I am a regular guy with a twelve year old son (and yeah, been married happily 13+ yrs.) My son liked the cartoon enough to get me to buy all the DVD box sets. I watched a few with him and it seemed a decent enough cartoon. The movie was pretty good and seemed to please my son. It was a children's series and the movie should have had a primary fan-base of young people and those adults who view with their children. You can tell if your child likes a movie if the conversation was more excited coming out than going in. My son was already talking about part 2 as we exited the theater and said the movie was great. I read some of the negative reviews, seems no one takes into account the director having to cram 20+/- episodes into a movie time frame. Looks like he did a good job to me as well as I believe the reviews would have been better if the movie had the content to rate a PG13 or R rating. To make a PG movie that does remotely well in the box office is a minor miracle in itself. So I will take the boy to see part 2, even if it is rated PG.",The Last Airbender
1368,palenight,Extremely disappointing..,2,25 February 2011,"I love Avatar: The Last Airbender the show. I own the DVDs and like to re-watch them all the time. It's a really fun and interesting series. But the movie.. Jeez.. Let's just say that if you're also a big fan of the animated series, don't watch this movie. You'll just be mad and irritated the whole time like I was. Many of the actors look way too different from their animated selves. Zuko, for example, is extremely pale in the series, as with most of the Fire Nation people, but in the movie all Fire Nation people are way more dark skinned.. Many details are wrong in the movie. In the series, all firebenders can create fire out of thin air, but in the movie, only Iroh can do this and it tends to freak out whoever he's fighting. All the ""omg he made his own fire""s are very annoying to anyone who watches the series. Last, and this is probably the most annoying thing, is that almost all of the main character's names in the movie are pronounced differently than in the series! How hard would it have been just to say the names correctly? Again, very annoying movie to any big fan of the series.",The Last Airbender
1369,weezhr,Excellent family movie!!!,9,2 January 2011,"My children(ages 5, 7 & 10) and I have watched all three books in the cartoon series. At first I was a bit skeptical after seeing previews for the movie and reading some of the reviews. But to my surprise, I like the casted characters for the movie. My husband had not seen the cartoons, so the children explained different aspects to him. Knowing the storyline from the cartoon did not ruin the movie for us. I think that we all felt we could connect with the characters in many ways. My children were out playing The Last Airbender in the snow shortly after watching the move for the 4th or 7th time today(me 4th, my eldest 7th) The movie is even appropriate for my 5 year old who is very sensitive to suspense and violence.We feel the director caught the true spirit of the story. We like how the Avatar - Book 1 story line was changed to be more realistic. Though I missed Sokka's humor, I appreciate the screenwriter's sensitivity to the tragedy of the plot and the realistic adaptation of the character. The director of this movie had a huge job bringing Book 1 to the screen.Each time we see the movie we see and appreciate new elements unnoticed previously. We feel the director did a wonderful job! My family all hope there will be movies for Book 2 and Book 3!",The Last Airbender
1370,megael-hunt,This was just Horrible,1,5 January 2011,"As a nanny, i had seen every single episode of this show a number of times--and i absolutely adored it. so when i heard they were making a live action version of the movie i was ecstatic! A few of my friends went to go see it opening night and ended up leaving within the first hour of the movie: They said it was horrible and that M. Night butchered the storyline and the characters and that the acting was horrible and what not--so i ended up not going to see it. until i downloaded.My first problem with the movie was that M. Night butchered the characters names Oong?? Soak-ah??? Ovatar?? and then (usually i don't pull the race card) but Sokka and Katara where white??? i mean they were clearly brown skinned of some sort(i totally agreed with the other races and whatnot. The next problem was how dark the movie was for it to be geared towards kids. I understand that there were some dark elements to the story, but to make them paramount as they were in the movie was just wrong. The acting was horrendous!! my GOD! those kids cant act to save their lives. I know that they are just kids and what not but i am pretty sure that there were better suited kid actors for the movie. And then the bending. I felt as if in the cartoon there was a lot more fluid motion when they were bending, as if (especially Aang) it came natural to them--effortless. I felt that the bending in the movie was like they were trying really hard it didn't have that effortless aspect that it did in the cartoon.Back to the storyline. in the movie, the fire nation had to have fire present to be able to bend it. I remember one of the things that made the fire nation so powerful against the other benders was that they drew their power from the sun and that they could take the earth and water benders out of their natural element.Overall i would advise against seeing this movie. Especially if you watched the cartoon. it is just horrible and not worth the time.",The Last Airbender
1371,gcvegie,Its not that bad,7,8 January 2011,"After reading all the reviews I thought I was in for a disaster, but decided I would watch it anyway. It was not that bad. I would even say enjoyable. Maybe because I don't read the comic or have any other knowledge of this storyline. For an afternoon watch this was quite OK. I also allowed my 3 year old to watch it with me. He has a short attention span but this movie kept him OK. Lots of action but designed well enough to still be kid friendly. I hope that the poor reviews of this film does not discourage a reasonable attempt to make a good follow up to this movie. I am quite happy for this movie to continue. A lot of negative comments about the cast but I also had no real problem here.",The Last Airbender
1372,bballeralbino33,Tremendously Disappointing Letdown,1,9 January 2011,"To begin with my anticipation for this film was overwhelming. I watched every trailer and read tons of pre-release material. When entering the theater I felt as though I was standing on the threshold of beginning a journey into a fantastic new series, like the Lord of the Rings or Star Wars. Instead, I was immediately disappointed at the rate at which the plot developed. Rather than slowly building toward major climactic events, the movie happens abruptly and predictably. The graphics are awful and the casting is terrible. The personalities of the characters are not like those of the characters in the anime series. In fact, the characters have little to no personality at all. Aang is supposed to be hyperactive and fun, not melodramatic and downtrodden like he is the movie. The action sequences didn't do it for me. The characters made way too many movements before any action happened, the bystanders seem to be indifferent to the actions taking place in front of them, and there is no blood, gore or savagery that would lead me to believe that the people being blown around are feeling any more pain than a bombardment of marshmallows. In conclusion, this movie stinks; why did Shyamalan have to ruin such a fantastic story? Why couldn't Spielburg or James Cameron have taken this one?",The Last Airbender
1373,Candyce_Amy,This is NOT a bad movie!,9,18 January 2011,"I honestly cannot figure out why people hated this movie so much. I am a huge fan of the cartoon series and of course, the movie wasn't as good as the show but I think they did an excellent job of condensing the first season into an hour and forty-five minutes, give or take. It is a given that some things would be left out or even changed minutely to fit the big screen and time restrictions better but overall, the movie stuck with the storyline of the show very well. It does help to be familiar with the series before watching the movie but it is not a necessity. I will be severely disappointed if the sequels don't get made just because some the critics were harsh about it. I would like to hear the names pronounced as they are in the series if the sequels are made though. It was a bit confusing to have it changed for apparently no reason, even if the movie pronunciations are the ""correct"" way to pronounce the names. The only other thing that I think could have been better was if there was some more humor integrated into the dialogue but without the leisure of the often-hilarious side quests like are found in the series, I can understand why it was hard to make the rather serious plot funny.",The Last Airbender

Equally strong, for a long time there was peace.But the avatar who controls and ensures the balance of these four powers, disappeared some time ago, and war is between the four powers. This first part of the movie tells the story of two water benders and a mysterious young but very powerful child they found, and the line of events afterward.The movie uses the full range of special effects, the characters are interesting to watch, landscapes and items in this movie are also interesting.

1376,elizadavies,Bend it like Shyamalan,4,19 January 2011,"A Movie that absolutely wreaked ""POTENTIAL"" credited to fantastic role casting & an inspiring theme.Elemental EFFECTS that shattered the mind at an enthralling SNAILS PACE. PLOT that SKIMMED more water than any rock. A tediously CLICHÉ strangled strings SOUNDTRACK ""with feeling"". DIALOGUE flailed, struggling to evoke any personality or CHARACTER. DRAMA which required more SUBSTANCE and CHEESE to convince a tear.Consequently, I stumbled away with a remorseful dissatisfaction, not dissimilar to feeling like you've been eating Vegan for the last hour and a half.Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon meets Harry Potter but gets stuck in Narnia.A movie for the kids.Detailed Critique: M. Night Shymalan's ""The Last Airbender"" was, to say the least, disappointing. This select genre and chronicle proves to be challenging, and perhaps executed with the wrong intent in mind. Although this movie is aimed at younger audiences, especially preteens, it still fails to provoke basic film premise. Perhaps aimed at a younger generation, seemingly one that demands instant gratification, this film places importance upon action and shallow stereotypes. Due to the movie's nature, it lacked in many areas yet was full of adorning promise.As I've no knowledge of the cartoon series, I can only take for granted what this film presents. The realm the story visits is a vast and amazing landscape, a vivid palette, impressively presented and executed. Set design and costuming worked well in conjunction. However the Characters themselves tended to meld into monotypic figures, seemingly removed from personality and expression. Quite often an Actor's portrayal of events was unconvincing, sounding more like read dialogue, ruining the intended ambiance. The movie does save face when we are presented with notable scenes containing Prince Zuko and Uncle Iroh. These two characters' interplay develop a great amount of depth lacking from many of the other characters. I often found empathy watching Prince Zuko and Iroh, almost cheering for these typecast underdogs. In fact the ONLY connection I made with Aang, the Avatar, was his typecast Hero role. Many scenes and sequences seemed to play out too quickly in something resembling roughly cut and pasted montages, which tended to leave the imagination unimmersed. If in an attempt to skim to the action, drama often was underplayed, and characters were often underdeveloped. The overall impact of this technique thwarted any attempt at trying to make a personal connection to the lead role: the Avatar and his offsiders. After the first encounter with the Avatar, you begin to realize this movie is skilfully withholding many of the brilliantly choreographed action scenes. Forget the uninspiring ""bending"" special effects, the black belted experts wildly whip up an amazing array of action. This is the highlight for the movie, without it even children would find this movie boring. During these action scenes or pivotal moments in the movie, I was gravely disappointed to listen to an orchestral soundtrack playing over. A movie so rich with atmosphere and specifically strong fantasy theme, was often drowned in a standard orchestral arrangement that was not fitting of the genre. I often imagined earthy tones, windy pulses, scorching sounds and flowing melodies coinciding a vivid soundscape. It only seemed fitting with the movie content.Overall I think Shyamalan has misdirected his efforts into uninspiring parts of the film. Time spent developing character and setting a personable mood in more important scenes would have helped serve the plot (and viewers)far better. If this is to be a series of movies, I can only hope that they will remaster the failings part one has brought us.ElizaD",The Last Airbender
1377,djgt-963-159757,150$ million dollar fail.,2,29 January 2011,"First, let me get few things straight. If you've watched the animated series of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"", and if you're a fan of the series, then I recommend you to miss this movie. The original storyline/plot is butchered to no recognition. Apparently, Southern air temple is located on top of Kyoshi Island. If you've never seen the animated series, then go ahead... watch this movie, and you might like it.Furthermore, the acting in this movie was TERRIBLE! You can expect the same performance at your nearest home town theater. Now, I'm wondering, where did all those 150$ million dollars go? In effects? nah... Let's talk about actors now. I don't want to sound racist, but what's up with all the Hindi people in the movie? Apparently all the fire nation is Hindi! With names, like Zhao, Zuko etc. If the writer/director is Hindi, then he really doesn't have to make 80% of the WHOLE MOVIE Hindi. Jesus holy Christ! Oh look, Hindi Roman cloth fire benders! Yeppii. Although, the effects were OK, and the fighting scenes were bearable too. But that's not the point here... my point, is that this movie had a HUGE potential.

They do not even pronounce the name of the main character (Aang) right.Even the screen writer probably has not seen the show since there are a lot of unnecessary scenes that were not in the actual show and does not add to the story at all. If I was spending 150m on a animated series adaptation I would have required everyone working on the movie to actually watch it.This probably is the worst movie adaptation of any animated series I have ever seen.

Where is silly, sarcastic Sokka & Katara is not even close either. & Uncle is enormously tall & doesn't seem at all old or wise, just like a cocky father-figure for Zuko. In the series, he is a tiny little, wisdom-filled, cheery old man!! Why is Prince Zuko played by the boy from Slumdog Millionaire? Why is almost every single fire nation character an Indian? They don't even look like the characters at all, they do not act like them, they portray them pathetically & whoever did the casting for this should just be fired. Immediately.

Really disappointed about the lack of ethnicity in the movie. None of the main characters had the slightest hint of Asian or American Indian in them.

This is not acting school, this is a real movie being rated, payed for, and all that. Especially from Noah Ringer, Aang. Aang is a happy, optimist, vegetarian, and reluctant hero. He avoids violence and is just a really..happy kid. However Noah Ringer showed off the TOTAL opposite of Aang. He's a depressed, probably meat eater, and willing hero. Now I can't watch Slumdog Millionaire just because of Dev Patel which is kinda sad.

He was awesome in Slumdog but now I would watch him in anything.Negatives: 1. Some of the more established actors were stifled by some of the dialogue which was, at times, crappy. Yes. 2. Some of the younger actors would have benefited from more practiced choreography and more character direction from Mr. Shyamalan. 3. They crammed in too much that was unnecessary and not enough of what was important/endearing about the original TV series. 4. There was action in the beginning but it was filmed too slow. This could have been fixed in editing but it wasn't.Positives: 1. Awesome visual effects. Really cool! 2. Followed the Book One season pretty closely (or at least as closely as you possibly can when cramming 30 episodes into 1.5 hours.) 3. Dev Patel is really a saving grace. He adds a lot of depth to his character. 4. The action and story really ramps up at the end and becomes what the whole movie should have been.",The Last Airbender
1391,Ethanegerter,Overall the movie was great!,6,18 April 2011,"M. Night Shyamalan wasn't the best director and writer for ""The Last Airbender"" but he did a good job. The part i didn't like the most is when Aang wasn't that happy. In the series Aang is happy fun loving person but in the movie he was bearly even happy. Sokka wasn't that clumsy like in the series and Katara what up with her hair? There are no loopy strings in it like the series. And why did Appa and MoMo sound different? Dee Bradley Baker (same voice in the series)did the voice for them in the movies but they sounded different. Nickelodeon should've chose someone unknown the direct ""The Last Airbender"" someone who people have barley heard of. But overall M. Night Shyamalan did a great job bringing the series to the big screen. :)",The Last Airbender

Considering that is an adaptation of the first 20 episodes, is an excellent work. The director has managed to keep the main story without getting lost. Good balance between the characters, storyline and special effects, was really an amazing job. The actors was trained by true martial artists, and the result was very beautiful. The perfect movements and fluid action keep the public attention all the time. A few words I can say about prince Zuko, is the good performance of Dev Patel inside the character. Deep acting and very similar with the animated series character, could not be done better.",The Last Airbender

Book One has been castrated from the actual series. I am not going to ruin anything for those who have not seen this movie, but please keep in mind that the animated series is absolutely amazing in every detail: script, artwork, dialogue...a must see! The only reason why this movie grossed what it did is because of the amazing animated series...and I hope this movie does not destroy the possibility of someone watching the original animated series. I thought that Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series was destroyed with its pathetic TV series...this is a very close second. Companies like Nickelodeon should feel ashamed for letting Avatar fans waste their money for such trash! Pathetic!

I thought that it would be spectacular! But it was hard to keep up with. I have been a fan of the series since it first came out.....and after seeing them jump from book one to some things from the second book I was sort of confused. And the characters themselves didn't seem authentic! Don't get me wrong the acting was OK, BUT for this story I felt as though none of them had seen an episode of Avatar before. I recommend that those who don't know the story to go see the movie, because most of the people (that I know) who actually liked the movie were people who don't know the story-line. I just hope that if they are making another Avatar movie, to sit down and discuss the story-line. If the story-line is good then the actors might have something to go off of......oh! and Dev Patel was a great in Slumdog Millionaire, but for this movie....I don't know what to say really....he was OK, but it could be better. I think he is OK for Prince Zuko but every time I see him I think of how gentle and sweet he was in Slumdog Millionaire....maybe I am the only one who thinks this. But in all I have to unfortunately give this movie an 1 out of 10. :(",The Last Airbender

Absolutely disgraceful script, acting, plot and the idea that the director (who's career is still intact through some sort of miracle) had not been informed or even had the sensibility to pick up on the word 'bender' being somewhat of an insult in many English speaking countries just baffles me. In my opinion any evidence of this film ever being created should be burnt, exorcized by a local priest, re-burnt, locked into a very secure safe, then dropped to such a depth in the Atlantic sea so as to never be found again, then maybe having whoever dropped said safe into the ocean to have their mind wiped or to take an obligatory frontal lobotomy in the name of all things good and holy.ps. don't watch",The Last Airbender

Am not going to add spoilers but the film is in the typical style of many Asian films and it probably wont be appreciated by many. Superb effects are backed up by a strong storyline. As other people have said the dialogue is unfamiliar to western audiences which only makes it more appealing to the true martial arts film fans. Many real moves are expertly performed to ""control the elements"".

1401,wrpetersen88,Nothing like the series.,1,25 June 2011,"GAH! I just got done watching this movie and now I gotta rant about it. Sorry for the spoilers if they appear but I don't believe I wrote any but I'm clicking the spoiler anyway..K? This movie was supposed to be based off a very well written cartoon TV series on Nickelodeon. I love the series. It's so cute, funny, adorable, blah blah blah. I could go on. However, I HATE THIS MOVIE!!! Usually it takes a lot for me to hate a movie but this isn't true. The movie is nothing like the series has a couple keys leading up to the final battle in the Northern Water Tribe but other then that it sucks. The pronunciations of 80% of the names are wrong. As well as the people chosen to portray some of the characters is way WAY off. On another note, those of you who are upset about there being no Asian cast members, I would like to point out that no where in the TV series does it say that it was based in Asia and that the four nations are in Asia. Although the similarities between the tribes and people of different origins in Asia is profound, it's not set in Asia. I would also like to ask about the giant water monster Aang is supposed to attack with. What happened to that. M.Knight Shamylan (or however you spell his name) did a horrific job on writing the screenplay. It sucks more than I could ever imagine. Two things I'd like to point out. Aang is supposed to be cheerful, airy, excited...not calm, apprehensive, and sorta boring. Sokka is supposed to be really goofy, kinda dimbwitted, and all around smart just doesn't act like it... Hell I can't even describe how I think he's portrayed in the movie. and for my favorite character from the series... General Iro he's a happy, fat, tea loving, pervert. He is not happy, fat, tea loving, or pervy in this movie. For Christ sake he only mentions tea once.",The Last Airbender

1403,taotao92,Absolutely a waste of my time watching.,1,19 July 2011,"All I can say is wow... I just finished watching the Avatar series and decided to watch the movie. The special effects look like they're from a twenty year old movie. The acting was terrible. The leading roles were unconvincing, and the characters were shallow. The series had complex character development, the movie had nothing.Right when the movie started I knew it was going to be bad. Obviously, in the series, everyone is Asian. So, why are all the main actors not Asian??? Everything was unconvincing. The least they could have done was cast more suitable actors.Also, why can't Katara pronounce anything correctly??? I cringed every time she said ""Avatar"" and ""Sokka."" She kept saying ah-vatar and soak-a. -face palm- Overall, I give this movie two thumbs down and negative 10 stars. M. Night Shyamalan was foolish thinking he could turn this anime series into a live-action film. The movie was destined to fail.Don't waste an hour and a half of your life watching this movie.

Yeah, plot and character development were given short shrift, but how much do you think you can cram into it?I hope they make the second and third installments. My family enjoyed watching this, and I think the characters were identifiable if you are even passingly familiar with the cartoon series. If you are familiar with the cartoon series, why whine about the back story here? You know it already.Honestly, to do the series justice would require umpteen movies, and a pace that would start to wear on viewers nerves.

1406,tehtigre,"Thank you, M.Night! ♥ I am an AVID fan of the anime and I *LOVED* this movie! I don't get the problem everyone seems to have...",10,5 July 2010,"I have to say that I am an AVID fan of the animated series and did not expect to truly like the film and I had NOT read the reviews ahead of time. I saw it the first day it came out. But usually, I don't think these things translate well to screen. But I was wrong. :) I don't get why so many are bad-mouthing the movie and I wonder how many even saw it and how many are just jumping on the bandwagon.First of all, it is simply book one so many folks are looking for things that do not happen until later in the series.Second, even with it being just book one there was a TON of content to condense into just 100 minutes or so of movie. M. Night and the original writers (Mike & Bryan) had to pick and choose the best bits to make the story happen for the big screen. They had to make it work as well for people who had never seen the anime before. Quite a task.Thirdly, the actors are young and some are inexperienced. But so are the characters they portray so it worked out fine. I don't get why people say that Sokka is not written properly. Sure, some of his humor isn't there but again, it is condensed. He isn't a fool, he is a protective big brother.Lastly, the people who are griping about the name pronunciations are just xenophobic. The way they are done in the movie are the correct way. M. Night is Asian himself and he wanted he names pronounced correctly.***possible spoilers below***I did miss the Kyoshi warriors, but they were filmed and cut so hopefully we will see them on a director's cut someday. I also am looking forward to how the whole 'Avatars aren't allowed to have a family' idea works out seeing that we all know that Roku had one (ie Zuko). But the Air Nomads were monks anyway, right? They don't have families to begin with. Perhaps that is the angle. I don't know. But that is one thing I hope they don't mess up. Aang/Katara romance is a big deal.Personally I cannot wait for the next installment and I look forward to seeing Toph. I also adore Mai and Ty Lee and I hope they make it in. I know we were teased with Jet already, so we will see.As others have said, if you like Avatar already...go see it with an open mind. It is NOT exactly the same and I am not sure how anyone could expect it to be. But it is the ""spirit"" of Avatar and the story with amazing effects and scenery and I thoroughly enjoyed it. And I am actually a pretty tough critic. I am one of the few who hate Twilight! LOL... However, I do love Jackson Rathbone now!""Airbender"" is the second best movie I have seen in a LONG time (The Blind Side is first, BTW) and for once there is an action adventure that everyone can go see. No language, no sexual situations, no gory violence and yet it is suspenseful enough to capture you.

Watch the actors' and actress' facial expression is way better than Clash the Titans, quite details and I should give them at least a B+ on acting. The Chinese Kung Fu thing is quite impressive and somewhat convincing. I should say the preparation is really good. I am a Chinese and watched over 100 Kung Fu movies) (isn't that good enough?).

1408,katia-berghs,I just felt like crying now.,3,16 August 2012,"I can use one word to describe this film: horrible. I am a huge fan of the nickelodeon series and was so excited for this movie. But when I finally sow the movie I just felt like crying. They made a total disaster out of it. Things I hated about this movie: 1.CAST awful cast, I couldn't imagine a worse cast than this. Zuko -> Dev Patel : I was like: oh my God, go back to India. His acting was a fail and he didn't looked a anything like the Zuko from the original series. Katara -> Nicola Peltz : worst Katara ever. Same commentary as Dev Patel. Aang -> Noah Ringer : oh my God, is this a joke?! He played the part terrible. And he doesn't even look like Aang, I couldn't stand his face. And these are just an example. The only actor who I think was great, was Jackson Rathbone. He could actually act, he was a great Sokka. He really did remind me of him. And by the way what a terrible Ihro also! He didn't had a beard? The same for the fire lord: where did his long hair go? 2. BENDING I must admit that the special effects were great, but what's with the dance before the bending? Why does a fire bender have to dance before the fire actually start moving? I know that the director would like to make it spectacular but the bending was just exorbitant. The only good element was Air I thought. But fire was for sure the WORST. 3. THE STORY Why the hell did everything had to go that fast?! Like many critics here say, if you didn't watch the original series, you wouldn't, no excuse me, you COULDN'T understand what's going on, what the story is about, why the fire nation did start the war in the first place? It was just random shots put together in a movie. Puh. 4. WHY 3D? It wasn't even spectacular 3D, no it was just add later, probably to drawn more people to go watch this movie. Poor things. Totally UNNECESSARY.My advice: DON'T GO SEE THE MOVIE. YOU'LL JUST FEEL LIKE CRYING.Well, mister Shyamalan, shame on u for making this great story, these wonderful characters, the things that made the Legend of Aang so good, into a horrible, disappointing movie.",The Last Airbender
1409,johnuey1,good action good storyline however poor stitching of scenes.,9,26 August 2013,The story-line of this movie is good because it already has a basis within the anime series. i believe it has an accurate portrayal of how the forms of bending would look like. The actors of the main characters including the main fire nation characters were played well however mostly they did not capture the essence of the character as seen within the anime. while this movie is aesthetically and visually appealing the clips were not stitched together well and often cut to a scene unrelated to the previous scene. this movie is receiving a 9/10 rating because it is based on an already established season and it complimented it well despite the production drawbacks. i recommend this movie to anyone who wishes to get a new spin on the hit anime by nickelodeon.,The Last Airbender
1410,carmen-was-here,Worst movie ever.,2,3 November 2011,"What a flop. As an avid fan of the Nickelodeon series, Avatar: The Last Air Bender I have to say that this movie was a joke and an insult to the original series. When I watched this, I wondered did they even watch the series before they made it?The clear mispronunciation and butchering of the names clearly gave it away that they didn't. Who in god's name is Sowka? I was just gritting my teeth every time they ever said Aang and even the word Avatar somehow managed to get butchered.I mean, sure movies change some things around so that it runs quicker and you can fit it all into one movie but this...This just seemed to skip over everything that was important in the movie. There was no heart to any of the characters. The characters that we all grew to love and empathise with in the series just were flat as a pancake. They had no depth to them. Casting didn't help it either.None of the actors suited any of their characters. For one, I'm pretty sure the Fire Nation aren't Indian. Not being racist or anything but is it me or is it ridiculous having an Indian man named Zhou. Oh and now that we mention Zhou, his character was as threatening as a pair of fluffy bunny slippers. Their uniforms and architecture is also clearly eastern Asian. There are plenty of talented Eastern Asian actors out there. I mean how hard is it to find a few of them out of the 1 billion on this planet?and Katara and Sokka. So everyone else in their water tribe is tan and been casted correctly according to the series but then there's these two random white kids? Doesn't it look out of place to you? They were so set on having everyone from the Fire Nation casted as Indians that they forgot to keep it uniform for the rest of the tribes. and if you did have to cast two white kids, couldn't they have been better actors? Noah could've been replaced with a robot as far as I was concerned. He delivered his lines basically like he was reading them off a sheet. And now one of the most stupidest things that happened in the movie. The Fire Benders. When did they ever need to draw fire from a source? So you say that is their artistic licence but where the hell was the fire coming from when Zuko was trapped underwater and melting the ice and when he was frozen into a block? Just more inconsistencies there that should've easily been spotted when writing the screen play.This movie was a complete and utter let down. I hope to god that no one wastes another couple of millions of dollars on a flop like this.P.S the graphics were good though.",The Last Airbender
1411,alex-hall4063,Shyamalanadingdong strikes back!,1,9 September 2012,"When will movie studios learn that you cannot butcher the lore of an animated TV series. They ruined the entire Dragonball universe with Evolution, but I didn't need to see it because the reviews said it all: terrible, awful flick. Now, M. Night Shyamalan brings us The Last Airbender. First off, I will state that I am a beloved fan of the animated Nickelodeon series Avatar: The Last Airbender. I thought that it had a great concept and all the characters were likable to some degree. When I heard that it was being developed into a live-action movie, I only had one thought in my mind: WOOHOO! I was stoked to also learn that the creators were going to be executive producers on this endeavor. I was so interested in this film. What could possibly make this worse? That's when I saw the director's name: M. Night Shyamalan. At that point, I was like WHAT!I mean the director of stupid suspenseful films of last decade, like Lady in the Water and The Happening, to write and direct the adaptation of a popular kids show. I just couldn't see it happening. So I saw the teaser, and it looked promising. I was thinking that maybe Shyamalan might just score with this film. And oh my goodness, did this flick suck! This film failed on so many levels. But let me break it down like this: acting, script, special effects.First off the acting. Once again, they pick white actors to play Asian characters. They picked Jasper from Twilight as Sokka or Soaka as they say it in the film. The acting is atrocious. It has no redeeming factor, The actors act so serious and have no comedic parts in it, which was one of the best part of the series for me. Noah Ringer should never act again. I feel bad saying that, because I try to give young actors a chance, but not this time.Next, the script. It is also bad. It is very rushed and it takes some of the parts that were great in the TV show and skipped over it. Shyamalan does a disastrous job directing this film. Finally, the special effects. Shyamalan converted this film to 3D, and I am glad I didn't see this in 3D. It was horrible. The effects had a sort of 300 slow motion effects which was a total ripoff.This film is a truly piece of atrocious garbage. It is a marvel to see such a bad film. I know how the Dragonball fans felt when they saw Evolution. I am ashamed of Shyamalanadingdong now. I cannot recommend this.",The Last Airbender

1414,joelloyd15,"Good in places, but still a let down",4,1 March 2015,"The beginning is a little slow, however it sets the scene and plot of the film quite well. The costumes and themes are consistent and accurate throughout. Each faction has its own set of themed outfits as well as appropriate colour schemes from scene to scene. As the film progresses and transitions between locations and factions, the colour schemes shift accordingly. The Fire nation has a strong theme of red and black. As well as fire nation locations. The water tribe has a tranquil theme of whites and blues. The Earth Kingdom have themes of browns and greens. These would represent the individuality of each nation. One aspect I didn't like about the film is that Fire Prince Zuko, has a scar on the left side of his face. However you can barely see it. Furthermore. The characters, except for a few, were unconvincing in their roles and could have done a little more in terms of staying true to the characters in the original series. The only character that stays true to their original is General Iroh. The compassionate, respectful (tea loving) fire nation general that breaks the stereotype of the fire nation. An aspect I did like however, were the wide angle shots of certain locations. The best part of the film (by far) is the music. It strongly carries the film's poor line up of acting in most cases and (in some areas) bad lighting. The music is powerful and transitions along with each major part of the film. The special effects are reasonable when it comes to Aangs flying bison companion, but I believe that the bending effects could do with a little bit more work. The choreography could be better with regards to the bending of the elements but the actual non-bending fight scenes are reasonably well done. Good use of locations carried the film along well. This also assists with the colour scheme of each faction's environment. This really emphasises the division of each faction in a war that has consumed the world for over a century. The final scenes carry quite a bit of weight with regards to the plot and character development. This is when the true power of the avatar is realised and he can finally accept his destiny after 100 years of isolation. This, accompanied by the power of the music makes for potentially the best scene of the film. The message the film is trying to put across is that of hope. That you should always have hope, courage and determination in all that you do. The reason M. Night Shyamalan will think twice about even considering on making the second instalment of the three part series is because the amount of detail that was missed throughout the film is because the original series contains twenty episodes, each lasting half an hour in length. As opposed to one film of an hour and a half. The pronunciation is quite frankly, insulting to any and all fans of the series. They will never be able to get the detail that they need to carry an effective and convincing story line.",The Last Airbender
1415,pagoss915,Unwatchable,1,29 January 2012,"I gave this movie one star simply because there was no option to give it no stars. My children got me into the Avatar series on T.V. and I loved it. When I heard that a movie was being made of the show my first thoughts were ""That could be really awesome, or really bad"". Regrettably it is really bad, and even worse than I could have possibly imagined.My excitement quickly turned to disgust when I learned that Shamalan(I really don't care that I have misspelled his name) decided that he should change everyones name to sound more like they should in the west. Whether it was more correct or not, who is he to change them up. He had to know that his decision would be met with resistance. For that reason alone I refused to spend any money to see it.While I could understand wanting to make a movie that stands on it's own, nothing is the same. The show was chock full of little moments that made you laugh as much for their timing as for their content. The movie misses at least four of these moments before it makes it's first attempt and the delivery is so lame that it wasn't even worth the film it was printed on.The acting just seemed off. I don't know how to explain it other than that. The characters were simply uninteresting.Again I understand he was trying to condense an entire season of ""The Avatar"" in the movie, but Shamalan just cuts too much out to have anything else make any sense at all.In the end I got 20 minutes into the movie before the inconsistencies and the poor acting were unbearable. I truly pity the people who's job it was to sit through this movie in order to objectively review it. What is even more sad is that they still intend to make another movie.",The Last Airbender

I thought it was great, my son put it on and I wasn't going to watch it and totally got sucked in. Now I have seen it like 3 times, and I have even talked to other people who don't have kids that liked it as well. I think it has a good plot and enough action to keep anyone of any age engaged. I hope this movie does not go the way of Eragon and give us a great first movie and not follow up with a sequel. My daughter loves this movie as well, I think it was very well done and age appropriate for almost anyone. Please, please make the other 2 sequels!!

1417,cooltwin2286,"Not perfect, but decent adaptation still",6,11 July 2010,"MINOR SPOILERS BELOW First off, I believe most people are reviewing this movie so poorly is because they are upset that it is not exactly what they wanted, which was a carbon copy of the show; but it is understandable why it couldn't be that way.Two of the primary complaints about this film are the changes Shayamalan made. One being the pronunciation of the names and the other being how quick the movie goes. The names being pronounced differently didn't bother me at all. They sound more authentic; more realistic. The story obviously had to move faster since you can't squeeze 6 hours of episodes into a 90 minute movie. Just understand this and you will not react so harshly to the movie. It is an adaptation...based upon the story of the show, just like any other movie based off of a book or game or TV show. Only the main storyline is used because It would be a convoluted story if all the side stories from the shows episodes were in it. I know for a fact Shayamalan filmed about 10 hours of footage for this movie, but obviously the movie studio didn't even let him make a 2 hour movie, forcing him to cut a lot out.I am a huge fan, I've seen every episode multiple times, and I give the movie 6 out of 10. The actors did a pretty decent job especially for many of them being brand new or relatively new actors. I'm looking forward to Book 2: Earth and very much want to see how Shamalayan handles it, hopefully he can have more liberties with the length of the movie.",The Last Airbender
1418,matthew-lavers,A sloppy and haphazard telling of an epic tale,2,11 December 2012,"A fantastic story butchered on the cutting room floor. This film should have been epic. Instead, it was abysmal.The Story: No flow. No development. The story jumps from place to place without giving the audience time to invest themselves. This screenplay, as it has been portrayed, would have been better suited to a live stage, in a series of acts. A story told in film must engage the audience, and leave them eager to see what happens next. This story has no ""next"". It has a sporadic progression of ""later"".The Effects: Interesting and believable. The visuals look realistic.The Acting: Great that the lead (Noah Ringer) was picked from an open casting call, but it showed. The others of the main trio (Nicola Peltz, Jackson Rathbone) had enough experience to make their performances reasonable, and should have been able to help their co-star shine. Unfortunately, something didn't transfer, and they all came off as amateurs playing for a camcorder. Dev Patel needed to bring more intensity and frustration/anger to the screen to fit the role that he was cast for. Shaun Toub gave the best performance, but didn't see enough screen time for the audience to connect.The Fighting: Labored, slow, and repetitive. The fighting styles of the different benders should have been very obviously unique, even as the four elements are unique. But everyone uses the same moves.The Bending: Over acted. Every breath of wind, every drop of water, every ball of fire takes 5 to 10 forms to create, let alone manipulate. The only redeeming feature is that it matches the labored fighting.",The Last Airbender
1419,sumit1,Loved the movie,9,6 August 2012,"I watched the movie with my daughter who is 9 at the time. We had no expectation going into the movie, nor had we read the books. We just loved the movie and the sets. The sets are great and all the magic of air bending, fire bending and water bending were novel elements to us. The ice world, the water world were beautiful sets. The ending is all we had hoped for with amazing sets. The main characters acted their parts to our satisfaction. We loved the action scenes. Some of the characters like the flying animal and the details of the water fountains were spectacular. I just wished this movie would have been done in 3D. Thanks Knight for another great movie.",The Last Airbender
1420,thenightaflame,Really?,5,22 February 2012,"Look, I utterly despise M. Night Shyamalan's films. I believe him to be a plague on the film industry that is more dangerous and insidious than even the dark pact that allows Uwe Boll to continue making movies. I also love the Avatar series. These two reasons combine to the reason I have not bothered to get around to this movie until last night.Firstly, the movie is nowhere near as bad as many of these reviews indicate. I'm not claiming it is by any means excellent or a great translation to film, but it's also not terrible. As a matter of fact, it's rather mediocre in quite a few ways, but is still entertaining.I believe part of the problem with this film was that it was the Cliff Notes version of around 11 hours worth of story from the first season. There simply was too much meat there for it all to be compressed in a satisfactory manner for everyone to movie length. The events of your favorite episode have a decent chance of not making it or being glossed over. There is no way this could have been done and kept all of the more hardcore fans of the series happy. I honestly believe it would have been a wiser decision to not attempt to be nearly as faithful to the source, giving us a different version of the story much like the many, many retellings of Batman's origin story. However, that's not the choice they went with. Pacing of the movie was...interesting. It's really difficult to be able to say how someone new to the storyline would have taken it, because to me it was choppy, but that's because I know that the 20 second scene I just saw moved through 30 to 60 minutes of the series. This made it feel choppy to me, but it was survivable. This did harm, but not completely destroy character development. Prince Zuko is a decent example of this. We see his transformation much, much more quickly over the course of the movie than the series, just as a result of time constraints. I can see how this would be unsatisfying to some, but in the end gets the same job done of presenting him as a conflicted character. Princess Yue I believe suffers the most from this, and I figure Sokka being goofy didn't get quite enough screen time to be satisfying for many as well.As far as the performances themselves go, for the most part they were all serviceable. The only two depictions that overly struck me as hammy were Ozai and Zhao. tl;dr: The movie is not terrible, but not amazing either. If you go into it expecting a decent action movie with a decent story you won't be terribly disappointed. If you have higher expectations than that, then you probably won't be happy.",The Last Airbender
1421,rjgnyc1,Underrated,8,29 December 2013,"The reviews kept me away from this film; however, my son is now old enough that he wanted to see it (he watches the original series as well as the follow-on ""Legend of Korra""). So I watched it on cable tonight.It was very entertaining. OK, so child actors are not all at the level of John Gielgud, and some of the dialogue clunked; but this isn't meant to replace high drama. It's a bit silly to expect Shakespearean depth (whether plot, character, dialogue or theme) in a story about a kid with super powers who rides around with his pals on the back of a flying buffalo.This film? It successfully evoked an exotic culture, set up a nice imaginary world and played reasonably well with special effects. It told a good yarn. It entertained me and my son.We're both disappointed that there has been no sequel.",The Last Airbender

This movie has horrible acting with each line pretty much trying to sum up an entire episode of the cartoon. Due to this, the movie goes too fast and too much happens without the viewer really understanding why. There's no emotional connection made with the characters because of this speed.Shyamalan ruined what could have been a great trilogy. Just seeing his name on a movie pretty much guarantees it's gonna suck. Save yourself the pain and watch the cartoon.",The Last Airbender

I'll try to name them all.1) Aang was not funny, comedy was a huge part of Aang's character, in the movie he was not. 2) The fire nation was India? Every fire nation guy was Indian, what's with that? 3) Mistakes like the fire benders bending fire from containers and torches, in the anime it came out of their body. 4) Sokka was not funny. 5) Too mixed up. 6) Fighting was stiff and not interesting. (Card board fighting)There are many more, it was a horrible movie and there should never be a sequel ever. (Unless they fix all that's above.)",The Last Airbender
1424,juanzecena-342-559674,M. Night Shyamalan is a joke,1,27 February 2016,"Shyamalan clearly did not watch a single episode of Avatar: The Last Airbender. A lot of things were incorrect in this movie, from the characters themselves to certain aspects of abilities. Names were pronounced incorrectly and the characters personalities were just awful. Aang was a negative nancy, Sokka acted WAY too mature, Uncle Iroh was skinny and not as wise as he should have been, and we saw way too much of Fire Lord Ozai. The movie rushed through the whole Book One and barely had any character development. Those who did not watch the animated series, or who weren't familiar with the story, were lost. If you are a Avatar fan, I suggest you do not watch this terrible movie.",The Last Airbender
1425,prateek-shankar,An insult to the original series. Don't bother watching.,1,11 July 2012,"The Last Airbender is a painful insult to the original series. Watching it was thoroughly agonizing, the torture beginning at the very start with the director's mockery of all their names. Aaang? Really? Shoot yourself, Shyamalan.Furthermore, unnecessary emphasis is given to unimportant aspects of Book 1 and rather important scenes are left out. The casting is horribly inaccurate, almost all of them possessing complete mutations, in terms of both physical appearance and behavior, of the characters portrayed in the TV Series. Only commendable areas of the movie would be the decent special effects and Dev Patel's performance as Prince Zuko, though the loss of Zuko's trademark ponytail is an eye-burner.As someone who spent months looking forward to this movie, I am thoroughly disappointed and hurt at the way the director has destroyed a potentially amazing movie. Don't bother watching.",The Last Airbender
1426,brady0413,Where do I start with this unholy pile of crap?,1,2 July 2013,"There are no amount of words, no amount of f@#$%# words I can think of to describe how much I hate this movie. I guess the obvious ones come to mind. Terrible, waste of time, boring, mind numbing, rage inducing, painful, dreadful, etc. the list goes on. All those words describe M. Night Shamallayn's terrible film adaptation of the beloved Nicktoon Avatar the Last Airbender. For those who have never seen the animated series the story is about a world where there are four nations based on the four basic elements air, water, earth and fire. Each nation has people in it that can manipulate their element through a martial art called ""bending"". There is one though that can bend all four elements and is tasked with keeping balance and peace in the world and that person is the Avatar. The world was peaceful until the fire nation attacked and plunged the world into war. The world waited for the Avatar to stop them but for some mysterious reason he vanished. 100 years passed and the fire nation is nearly victorious. The Avatar thought to have never been reborn into the next nation in the Avatar cycle Air, was thought to never come back until two water tribe siblings Katara who is a waterbender and Sokka her non bending brother accidentally break open an iceberg one day while fishing (through a rather hilarious scene involving Katara's waterbending). Inside they find Aang an airbender and his flying bison Appa. Quickly they discover that he is the next Avatar and that he needs to master the other three elements and stop the current head of the fire nation Firelord Ozai in order to save the world. So they set off on their journey while being chased by the banished Prince Zuko the son of the Firelord who is trying to capture the Avatar to regain his honor. The concept sounds simple but what the creators and writers do with it is astounding. The mythology and world they create is fascinating and filled with tons of Asian influences. The characters are extremely likable and relatable and the story is very well told and executed. The writing, voice acting, and animation is all top notch including very VERY good action sequences. And does this film capture any of the magic of the series. The short answer is NO!!! Now this is a terrible film by film standards. Its terribly directed, poorly acted, lazily written and despite its large budget has special effects that range from mediocre to downright crap (especially the creature effects for Appa the flying bison and Momo the flying lemur my God what have they done to you guys). But where this film truly fails in my opinion is as an adaptation of the wonderful animated series. This movie is truly the double ganger of the series. Everything that the series did so well the movie does so poorly as a fan of the series it will make you (as it did me) bang your head against the wall in frustration. The characters (both main and side) who were so fleshed out, likable and relatable in the series are completely gutted of any emotion and are lifeless cardboard cutouts posing as the characters from the series. The villains who were menacing in the series are either lame or downright laughable. The humor and lightheartedness which was hilarious and charming in the series is completely sucked out of this film leaving it absolutely boring and lifeless. The depth and complexity of the Avatar world is poorly realized and explained. The excellent and witty character dialouge from the series is replaced with expositionary dialogue especially from Katara that is so monotone, cringe worthy and boring it makes one want to grind their teeth in frustration. The story which is VERY loosely based on the first season of the show is so choppy and rushed it lacks any of the interest the first season had. There are so many unnecessary changes to the mythos of the show that add no value to the film and just serve to tick fans off (Why the heck did M. Night take away the firebenders ability to make their own fire). The action sequences which were visually stunning and thrilling displays of martial arts mixed with the elements in the cartoon are downright terrible and in some cases laughable (seriously it took six earthbenders to throw a tiny rock at a slow speed). Everything about this film is wrong. Its one of a few films I have seen where I can find nothing right with it no matter how hard I dig. My advice watch the animated series or its sequel series The Legend of Korra. Avatar the Last Airbender is one of greatest pieces of American television I've ever seen. It currently ranks 11th on IMDb's top 100 shows of all time and as a 22 year old college student I am proud to say I am a fan of it. Even Doug Walker aka The Nostalgia Critic has become a huge fan of it. Don't waist your time with this pile of garbage film especially if your a fan as you will not only be waisting your time but your braincells as well.",The Last Airbender

Or I would have if it weren't for the minimum limit being ten lines. Why? This filthy piece of lard doesn't have the rights to get anything better than that first line, so just read that over and over again, stop reading this useless, boring text. Still three more lines.

1429,curlyq97,Redo! Error! Redo!,1,17 June 2012,"I am a teenager and love the TV series. I began watching them on Netflix when I heard that there was a movie coming out. I fell in love with Aang and all the other characters and had high expectations for the movie. What I saw shocked and disturbed me. Not only was the movie a great disappointment, but the script sounded like something I would have written, and I'm a child! This guy, the writer and director, is a full grown man! He should be able to at least come up with a functioning script, and not a self destructing one like he did. Aside from the script, the acting was terrible. I don't think I've ever seen anyone act so badly as the lead characters did. With the exception of Zuko. He was a highly accomplished actor, and I think he fit the part. Thats more than can be said of his uncle Iro. Iro is supposed to be a humorous old fat man with a deep warrior side, and this guy looked like he just got home from the gym! And Aang couldn't act at all! (actually, thats a lie. Kristen Stewert cant act. He did better then she does). The whole characterization of this movie was wrong and so sad. The characters had no depth to them. I enjoyed the series and I was so lost. They don't act like they are supposed to! And did they tell the kids to pronounce the characters names wrong? I heard somewhere that it was to make the thing sound more Asian, but they must have thought about the reaction that this move would get if they did that. Or maybe they did what they did throughout the whole movie and NOT THINK! Now, I'm not going to say anything about cutting important things out, even though they did. This was the first whole season of the Airbender series and while the script still sucked and didn't include the right parts, that portion of the movie must have been difficult and could be overlooked. Probably the only relatively OK thing about this was, as Sokka would say, is, ""The effects were decent."" I liked the fighting scenes accept that there was to much movement. What I suggest is a redo. Remake the whole thing with a different, well, everything! Replace the director, the actors, (aside from Zuko) the script and everything else to make it at least a fully functioning movie. It can be done, right? Please say that it can be done! If done right, which this was not, this could be a fantastic movie. Put someone like David Yates at the wheel. Just redo the whole thing. And No Sequel! At least not to this one. My advice, save your money or your space on your Xbox and don't watch this movie. Watch the series over again, or maybe the Legend of Korra. That's a good series, although its sad that everyone like Toph and Aang died :(. Please don't watch this movie. You won't regret it.",The Last Airbender

I guess being a fan of the series helped us to understand what was happening. We own all 3 seasons on DVD and have watched them multiple times. We've watched some of the interviews with Shyamalan, so we knew that the name pronunciations were changed, and that it was impossible to put all 20 chapters into one film. You have to change the story when you condense it, and I thought he maintained the spirit of the original story. Yes, this movie is darker than the series, but they did have some humor and showed Aang's more playful side.

1431,robomunkster5008,Absolutely Horrible.,1,25 June 2012,"I have to say this was a major disappointment and I'm immensely glad I did not pay to see this movie when it was in the theaters.They couldn't pronounce the names correctly to save their life. As well as the graphics and effects were, they could have been way better, without making the animals or other things that were animated look goofy and unrealistic.Aang was way to serious and did not act like a child at all. The only time I saw him even close to acting like a happy young boy was when they first got back to the southern water tribe before the fire nation attacked. Sokka wasn't even remotely close to the way he was portrait in animated series. He was not sarcastic, or witty, or funny, he had the emotions of s brick as did all the other actors in the movie. They took out important parts of the movie and just strung the scenes together in an attempt to make sense.If the director was a ""fan"" of the animated series like he said he was than the movie would have depicted a lot more of the characteristics that the show did. The fact that the fire nation needed fire near them to actually fire bend was not in the original series therefore it should not have been in the movie. And where are the Kyoshi warriors? The director said they would have been distracting because the movie is not about them. Well as little as they were showed in the animated series in the first book they still played a role later in the series. If they do so happen to appear in the second movie (god forbid they actually are stupid enough to make one) then it won't make sense if they just randomly appear. Also the fact that Aang has basically complete control over his Avatar state at the end of the movie doesn't make sense. He hasn't mastered all the other elements or even attempted to learn them. If he's a master at water bending at the end of the film then yippee-Skippy, but he shouldn't go into the Avatar state to be able to use his full potential as a water bender. The actors used in the movie didn't exactly depict the role they were trying to uphold from the series. I know that they real actors aren't going to look like the anime original characters, but they could have at least attempted to make the actors look like their characters. At first I was confused about Zuko's character. He barely even had a burn mark on his eye and he had both his eyebrows. Uncle Iroh wasn't old enough and was too skinny. And what was wrong with Aang's tattoo's? Is it really that hard to put a blue arrow on the actors body?If the second and possible third movie do go into action I just hope they actually stick to the original series and don't make it as terrible as the first one.",The Last Airbender

However, I was honestly disturbed at just how terrible this movie was. I had to force myself to finish it, in hopes that it would get better. It never got better. The characterization was terrible, the plot was vague, and I don't even know what happened at the end because I couldn't comprehend the horrid story progression. The only good thing about this movie was the setting details, as the location shots were quite true to the originals. That's not enough to redeem this movie, in my eyes.

No one depicted the characters from the cartoon except for the movie's Aang, though he was less of a pacifist than the original Aang. Name pronunciations were 'interpreted' by the director. The different martial arts associated with the different elements were not demonstrated well, and the kid who knows martial arts is playing as the pacifist! Not that he wasn't a good Aang, I just think that they could have had at least zuko and/or Katara use the right martial art techniques that were associated with their elements in the cartoon. The humor was sucked dry out of Sokka in this movie, as well. The movie showed that the director himself either wasn't interested in Avatar The Last Airbender, did not care about the fans, or simply didn't care in general. SPOILEROne example of inaccurate directing is the fact that Zuko didn't look like he had a scar in the movie, he was less of a hard-head, he was more of a softy. After capturing Aang, he brought him to a building. In the cartoon, Zuko brought Aang to a cave during a snow storm. Also, there was no black snow!

1439,thavish-perera,"Horrible Acting, Bland Speech and Senseless Wrinting",1,26 August 2014,"M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender is horrible movie filled with bad acting, terrible casting, monotone reading of lines and just plain horrible writing. First of all the characters. In the original cartoon, Sokka is a light-hearted joker that loves humor, the first thing he does when Aang wakes up from the ice is poke him. In the movie he is a lifeless shell that is always speaking in monotone and doesn't even stop between sentences. Or Aang. In the cartoon he is a happy kid that can never be brought down. In the movie he looks like he could burst into tears any second. Also, the pronunciation. In the movie many names and pronounced wrong/differently from cartoon. For example Sokka (pronounced Sock-a) gets pronounced Soaka. You could argue that it's an adaptation and Shyamalan can change them, but in an interview he was asked why he changed the pronunciation of so many names and words. He answered ""I wanted to stay true to the source material"", which makes no sense because in the cartoon (the source material) the names and words aren't pronounced the way they are in the movie. Another thing is that Appa looks like a creature from Where the Wild Things Are!My third beef is the casting choices. The Fire Lord is supposed to be a super intimidating but the actor for him looked like a gentle old man. Last but not least, the bending techniques make no sense. When a bender bends what they do and what happens are completely different. At one point a fire bender pulls his hands toward himself and a fireball goes the opposite way. Another time, earth benders do a ten second dance routine and a rock the size of ten year old head just slowly floats along. All in all, Shyamalan's The Last Airbender is an atrocity of a movie and a pure insult to anyone who watched the original series.",The Last Airbender

The role needed a kid with a spark, which, like everything else in the movie, was lacking.There was no character development, which was essential to the series. The movie didn't spend time on the developing the relationship between Aang, Sokka, Katara, Aapa, etc. This would have been fine for a sequel, but for the first in the series, the character development is crucial.The dialogues were awful. Really basic. Where are Sokka's jokes? Iroh is supposed to be fat, funny and wise. This one is just wise. The list can go on. Nicola Peltz does well as Katara. Dev Patel does OK, and gets better as movie goes. The movie doesn't do any justice to the awesome animation series.

1442,s-d-dawson85,Definitely worth a watch (If your new to the Story),9,20 May 2015,"Have never commented before but thought I'd make an effort where since this movie has received so much hate. It must be a problem when movies are made from books? I found with Harry Potter series that I never liked the films that I read first. This may be what has happened for this movie? From an outsider who is ignorant of the story though, I thought this was an all round good film. The CGI and settings where beautiful, I could help but glance away from the characters from time to time to see where they where. The story kept a good pace and was easy to follow, It kept my attention and the ending was worth the wait. The characters where a bit too familiar with each other too fast. In the kind of way Disney characters instantly become friends/enemies/lovers. Though I assume this is done to speed the story along (and being a child friendly film). Was surprised at the dislike. Though I may agree if I had read the books or watched the series first. Overall I enjoyed this film and I'm sure I'l watch again some day. Look forward to the sequel.

I tried, i seriously tried.. but at one point, I just wanted to gouge my eyes out.I wasn't expecting much from the previews back in 2010... and I was right. This movie is seriously awful. I didn't think anything would be as bad as Bangkok Dangerous (which I also couldn't finish), but it was. The optimist inside me was hoping it would be like the typical Chinese fighting movie, sword fights, acrobatic air stunts, etc... like a crappier version of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Unfortunately it's none of that. The good: I like the background/scenery. The bad: The casting - its either the wrong age or the wrong race. The acting -- I wasn't expecting much, but I figured why else would they have chosen those actors if not for their acting? It's definitely not because they looked the part... I was wrong. Both were dismal. Avatar the Last Airbender has a really great plot with rich characters and an intriguing plot line. It has a lot of potential with the right director. I recommend Ang Lee :)",The Last Airbender
1445,kyleevan1,Not worth the effort to watch,1,20 December 2012,"Normally, I am not a movie critic, i go to movies to escape life and to enjoy a story. With this movie i felt like i had simply spent money to sit in a dark room with many other hopefuls and have my hopes dashed against a large rock.As a fan of the animated franchise, this movie was horribly painful to even look at. The casting was terribly off, the actors were not even close to the appearance of the animated characters. The personalities of the characters were changed to where each of the main characters had the same dead and serious personality. The names were pronounced differently, and last but not least the bending was terrible, it is meant to be derived from the martial arts and to flow but the bending in the movie was clunky and had the feel of a novice five year old attempting karate for the first time even when the character was supposed to be a master level bender.For those lucky enough to watch the movie and to not have been a fan of the franchise, the movie is in itself still the worst Hollywood adaption of a series ever made. The acting for the movie was terrible, the plot was twisted and if you had not seen the series you would not have known what was going on. The way the movie was presented was just confusing and hard to follow, and to top it all off, the special effects for this movie was the best thing about this entire disaster, which sad to say says very little about the movie since the special effects looked outdated and completely fake. The only bending this movie did was to bend my mind as to how such a beloved series could be so utterly ruined by a director when all the elements for greatness were given to him. I give this a one star only for the reason that i cannot give it no stars at all, for I am a very frugal person and don't like to waste money, and for me to have walked out of the theater the first time i saw it within the first thirty minutes is a testament to how bad a movie this is.",The Last Airbender
1446,tcrumpet,The Last Airbender was pretty awful.,3,22 December 2012,"I downloaded the cartoon and loved it. I watched the whole three seasons about 18-20 hours in 2 weekends (totally ridiculous). I faintly remembered seeing the movie a while back and hearing it wasn't very good, at the time that didn't bother me I really wanted to see it. It said it was 3-D so I thought that would make it even better.It was horrific, after I saw the first few scenes I felt so disappointed. After seeing 20mins I would've happily turned it off but I watched it through. Even with such an addictive, enjoyable, amazingly written storyline the film could come out so badly.I liked the sets and the special effects were fun, the costumes also came out pretty good. I think the writing was sloppy, the direction and casting were beyond bad bad. M. Night Shyamalan wrote and directed this so it was mainly his fault. The characters were so one dimensional that you feel no sympathy or anything for it but then for the script to work you he to feel sympathetic.After seeing the first five scenes I was bored. I think the next two books could have a lot of potential with such a good storyline. The latest Batman movies were popular where as the old ones were awful so why can't Avatar be the same.I hope a better Avatar film gets made.",The Last Airbender

ATLA was my favorite childhood TV show of ALL time, and you most certainly DEFILED it with this movie. It's not just bad, it's disgusting. I hope he knows that, and I hope he never gets to direct another movie ever again. First of all, I don't know why the creators of the show even gave him the right to direct this movie because everyone knows that he is an incompetent movie director, as seen in his other works which are just as bad, if not worse. You wanna know what's wrong with this movie? EVERYTHING. Every single freaking thing sucks in this movie. He obviously does not know how to cast characters, how to portray a good action scene, how to FOLLOW THE ACTUAL PLOT IN THE STORY, and for goodness sake, he doesn't even pronounce the characters' names right. He says he mispronounced them ""on purpose"" because he thinks it's the actual ""Asian"" pronunciation. First of all, these names aren't even real Asian words, so there is no ""Asian"" pronunciation. Stick to the darn names the way they're pronounced in the show, freaking Shyamalan. This entire movie may as well be called ""The Bald Little Emo Boy and His Emo Friends who show no emotion and are boring as hell on an adventure to accomplish nothing but be sad all the time and have awkward conversations"". This entire movie was NOTHING, I repeat, NOTHING like the actual cartoon. I don't care if Shyamalan watched the series with his kids and ""loved"" it. As far as I can tell, he didn't watch the show at all and most definitely SHOULD NOT be allowed to make a movie out of it! Honestly, I don't know why the movie currently has a rating of 4.5/10 on IMDb right now, because it seriously doesn't even deserve that high of a mark. It deserves a 0/10. This movie is a complete waste of time to watch. You'd think a movie with a $150 million budget would turn out to be something great. Heck, even the Lord of the Rings movies had a smaller budget than that, and look how great those movies turned out! And they were made back in the early 2000's! Here we are, YEARS later, with improved technology, improved workmanship, and an improved budget, and yet, we get a piece of crap movie that pretty much caused a part of me to die inside. Get Shyamalan off the movie industry already. I've seen people on Youtube who are more talented than he is, and I'm not even kidding. Even Mike and Bryan, the creators of Avatar, agree that this movie was a disgrace to their masterpiece. Avatar is an AMAZING show with AMAZING characters and an AMAZING storyline, and it's just extremely disappointing to see it all get flushed down by this disgraceful movie.Please, don't make any more movies and stop ruining childhoods, Shyamalan.

1448,HighlyComplex,Worst Movie Ever.,1,1 July 2010,"I don't think I need to expand on all the other reviews here because it really is that bad. The film misses out a good 89% of what makes up the amazing Nickelodeon series and misrepresents the other 11%.I feel that no one in this movie bothered to watch a single episode. The best thing about this movie is the sets and costume design but maybe thats because I was too busy wishing the characters weren't there. The only two characters who made any development at all were the mispronounced Iroh and not scarred enough Zuko. Unless you count the moment Aang blatantly told Zuko they could be friends...Yeah.My recommendation would be not to waste your money on this abysmal movie or any sequels (please no!) but purchase the original box sets instead, they are a much better investment.",The Last Airbender

I couldn't even watch it because I was saying what was wrong during the WHOLE movie. They couldn't even their names right, the only they got right was Katara. And their probably going to make a second one, because they stopped right at Azula. This was probably one of the worst movie's I've ever watched.

1452,gurur-593-505948,Biggest mistake of my life,1,12 April 2013,"Watching this movie is the biggest mistake of my life and I made a lot of mistakes. When I first heard there would be a movie based on child cartoon series i felt happy about it because i have watched every single episode and can remember every last detail about The Avatar: Last Airbender. But when i started watching this so called movie nothing seemed right. First of all at the very beginning of the movie was wrong. Katara and Sokka(typed it the way i always heard) went on fishing and both were on a water-tribe boat. Every time Katara started bending water Sokka was the one who ended up getting wet and complained about it. They get on piece of ice so Sokka can squeeze the water from his clothes and complain about Katara's water bending ability. While he complains Katara bends water without knowing and destroys an iceberg. Then they both wonder what is in the iceberg and go to iceberg to check it out. They both get close it while thinking this might be a trap and then Katara notices someone inside the iceberg and that person is still alive. She grabs Sokka's weapon and starts hitting the iceberg while Sokka tells her not to. Then iceberg breaks with loud noises and then the story of Avatar Aang begins. Story starts like this they don't find the avatar and find a way to north-pole. Freeing the earth-nation villages had minor importance in the story but they shoved it in the water books.In short if you were saving up some money to see a movie pick something else to watch or just throw the money into sewers. That would save you from torture and waste of time.Characters were a big disaster. Zuko: Acted like The Avatar was no big deal and he did not need to capture him. Iroh: Supposed to be wise, old and fat. Should of been guiding Zuko to the right way not stepping out from the way he is on. Aang: An Avatar huh? Seemed like he is the king of sorrows. No hope no happiness left. Supposed to turn into a big water based lizard looking monster when he was at north-pole. And he had no problems with offensive bending. Sokka: Our meat lover, who has no bending ability or capability of planning a route to north-pole. Turned into what? Plan making, taking charge and very smart person? This has to be nightmare. Katara: She was supposed to learn together with Aang and sharing the same master. Master Paku was not even close to what i was hoping to see and at first he was refused to teach Katara. And banished Aang from his class just because he was teaching Katara. Commander Jao: That person supposed to be Zuko's tail and whenever he gets the chance he was trying to surpass him.Instead of shoving some parts of the books all-together they should of tried to make something good but i guess this will be all we can get. My biggest mistake on my life was watching this movie. Do not make the same mistake if you still haven't seen it",The Last Airbender

It has no character development and is like a hash of scenes that don't make any sense put together. I wouldn't give it any stars, but I have to give 1, so there it is.

1456,bladeburner98,An awful representation of a legendary series. An hour and 44 minutes you will never get back.,1,7 February 2013,"As a die-hard Avatar fan I wanted to like this movie, trust me I did, but there were just way to many terrible aspects about the film to even give it anything more than 1 star. I can't say I liked much of anything in this film and if I was going to give a list of what I did like, my review would be extremely short. What ruined the movie for me was the following:-Barely any of the Actors represented there actual characters from the cartoon in any way.-Zuko's Scar given to him by his father was barely noticeable and was a significant symbol throughout the entire series. -Deviation from the original story line:--Aang was discovered by Sokka and Katara differently than in the original series. --The Southern Water Tribe was depicted completely differently. The Fire Nation Raid on the Southern Water Tribe was different. --The way Aang was tested to see if he was the avatar was dull and very uncreative. --The way Aang escaped from Prince Zuko the first time was dulled down from The way it happened in the series. --The Earth Kingdom where Haru and his father were kept prisoner was completely wrong as in the series the earth benders were kept away from earth which served a major purpose to the entire Series. --Kyoshi Island and Suki were completely overlooked and forgotten about and this was a major deviation from the series and a big mistake because it was very important. --Jeong Jeong was not mentioned in the film and Aang's firebending was never brushed upon. --Aang did not make contact with Avatar Roku or Avatar Kyoshi at anytime during the movie. THIS WAS A HUGE MISTAKE. --When Aang and Katara were training in the Northern Water Tribe, Master Paku did not originally turn Katara away. --There was no fight between Master Paku and Katara There was no reference to Sokka becoming a warrior in the movie to fight with the warriors of the Northern Water Tribe. --Princess Yue was not engaged. --The fight between Zuko and Katara at the Spirit Oasis was a very Insipid and was also dulled down. --When Aang was kidnapped by Zuko He was take to a room in the Northern Water Tribe and was not taken away.This was another terrible mistake. --When the spirit of the moon was killed, it was killed by knife instead of fire. --When Yue sacrificed herself to save the moon spirit, it was done in a poor fashion which lacked creativity and deviated from the original storyline. --*MOST NOTABLY*, Aang did not create the Water Monster to defeat the fire nation and instead created a wave. This was one of the worst deviations out of all the aforementioned. -The ridiculous fact that Firebenders could not bend fire on their own and needed a source of fire was both wrong and was an extreme and disrespectful deviation from the original series. -Aang's Airbending Arrow was very different than it was in the series. -Mispronunciation of the characters names (e.g. Aang, Sokka, Iroh) -Misrepresentation of the characters outfits (most notably Aang's outfit)The poor storyline as well as the numerous deviations from the original series were much to apparent and made for an awful story as well as an awful movie. As a True Avatar fan the movie was an extreme disappointment. In order to preserve the original memories and depictions of the original series, I would not recommend watching this movie and I have no intentions of seeing the next movie, if it even comes out. The only thing this movie accomplished was that it exposed some of Hollywood's awful acting, producing, and special effects. As for the acting, producing and special effects, the acting was, for the most part, atrocious, the production and script was some of the worst I've seen in a movie and the special effects could have been much better than they were. The only thing this movie is good for is wasting 1 hour and 44 minutes of time and creating a bad representation of Book 1: Water as well as the entire series.",The Last Airbender
1457,phamurabi,This better be the LAST Airbender movie,1,1 July 2010,"I remember when i first saw previews for Avatar on Nickelodeon and my excitement was born. I remember watching the premiere and the excitement grew. I remember following the series and having loved every moment of it. I remember watching the series finale and believing it to be the most epic and beautiful ending I've ever seen, TV, movie or otherwise. Then came the announcement that they were making a live action movie and everything went downhill from there. I was skeptical that such perfection could be replicated or even if it needed to be attempted. When M. Night was announced as the director and writer, the skepticism continued. It was great that he was a fan boy and I felt that he could give the rest of us fans what we were looking for, but M. Night? Seriously, he had never really done a movie like this before (and not to mention his other movies aren't the greatest to begin with.) Then the cast was announced and the set photos began to emerge. It all became clear that he was taking the story in a very different and dark atmosphere. Lost was the fun, light hearted nature of the series. Gone were the goofiness of Sokka, the incurable prankster persona of Aang, the jovial wisdom of Iroh, the confused soul of Zuko. Everything had become one-dimensional and very serious. I didn't like the direction M Night had taken this. But when the first teaser came out, and I bought into it. This could work, I thought. He is trying to appeal to a wider audience and if that means forgetting the roots of this children's cartoon and transforming it into an all out epic trilogy about warfare in a fantasy world with magic, so be it. This is no longer my beloved Avatar, but it could still be visually striking and entertaining. With each successive trailer, I gradually lost all expectations and prepared myself for a heartless reproduction of a timeless masterpiece. But it looked DAMN good, that's what kept my hope alive. The bending looked spot on, the fights were nicely choreographed, the battles felt grand, and the first time I saw Appa, I was speechless. I honestly felt I could endure this movie just for the visuals. I was wrong. Fastforward to midnight June 30th, the months of anticipation came to a close. I refused to check reviews because I did not want to come into the theater biased (I had heard rumors of a very low rating, but no real confirmation.) Not even ten minutes in, I handed down my verdict: this movie is absolute garbage. First impression was the outdated photography, did they hire the guy that made the Conan movies in the 80s? The movie looked like a high school project that abused an overblown budget. Costumes were second rate, set pieces are generic, locales are bland, and computer graphics are no were near current standards to name a few faults. Secondly, the acting was laughable. Jackson Rathbone and Nicola Peltz are flat, lifeless cadavers. Third, and this was after I got over their horrendous delivery, was the writing. Reading an essay between two people does not qualify as dialog. Every sentence and every line was a simple description of what was happening on screen, there was nothing natural about any of it. And that leads to another fault: there was no structure to the story. If M Night intended to merely condense 6 hours of season one into a 2 hour movie, randomly choosing and cutting certain scenes is not a viable formula. He had already done enough to offend fans knowledgeable of the show, there was no reason to alienate any newcomers with such a jumbled sequence of events. I bit my lip and drank from my flask, just wait for the action, that will be the savior of this movie, I tried to convince myself. Needless to say, when I saw a rock slowly float across the screen masquerading as a sorry excuse for earthbending, I immediately got up out of my seat and left. I had never walked out of any movie before (not even The Golden Compass) but I could no longer stomach this travesty. I love Avatar: The Last Airbender the series and I refuse to let this regurgitation from M Night's ego ruin it for me. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!

The dialogue and the tone is completely over-dramatic too. I mean the show had funny and likable characters. Even the villains were awesome.

The story is not there, the characters names are misspelled, and the casting and acting are unforgiving to the viewer, as they don't respect the identity of the series and are simply plain boring as are the dialogues and the special effects and camera panoramas in continuity. Seriously hoping that this becomes like the Hulk movie where they simply remade a new one after they realized how messed up and shitty the first one was. M. Night Shyamalan just blew this big time, they should have given it to Ang Lee. I rated it 1 star on IMDb, but wished there was a sub-level of stars because this,is a minus 10. What a CRAP",The Last Airbender
1464,gabrielle-mcanulty,Does not do the show any justice,1,25 April 2013,"They mispronounce the names of Sokka Aang and Iryo. The acting is terrible, the effects are terrible, and you don't learn anything about the characters.M.Night should be ashamed of himself for letting this movie pass. It is not a film , it's garbage. If you want to watch Avatar watch the show you get the full story and Nickelodeon did a great job with it. How they let the movie go through though I will never know. This is just an example of a show that should have been left alone. Katara is not nearly as cool or independent, Aang is not fun loving at all he is just serious and depressing. I just hope they never make a second one because this was just a sad excuse of a movie.",The Last Airbender
1465,Xeno_phon,Face Palm,1,1 May 2013,"Watching this movie was painful. With the poor cast choice's and bad acting I thought but with what I saw in the animated series the potential for great special effects is huge.... but then we were let down again. the bending was so laughable it was like cheep magic tricks that had almost no combat power at all. And Ang or whatever they called him in the movie so depressing and not a fun loving boy with a joy of life.One phrase there was ""NO AIR SCOOTER"" Ang used this to great effect in combat and was a key part to his style. I was more then disappointed at this movie I was angry.I was so mad I told my friends that we could not leave and we went back in to watch the Karate Kid.",The Last Airbender
1466,btd3553,Waste of my life!!!,1,7 May 2013,"Where to begin? If you have not seen the animated series of Avatar, your opinion means nothing so just go away. This movie is based of from the cartoon and should somewhat be similar. When you change 80 percent of the events, names, characteristics, and personalities from the source of inspiration, you have ruined everything you set out to do. What's the point of doing something if your intent is to completely screw it up? For those who claim the effects are so great, I'd love for you to see that sending a fireball or using a waterwhip takes a total of a half a second, not 5 seconds and 12 hand twirls accompanied by 15 steps in every direction. Plus, a sandstorm is a flipping sandstorm, not someone throwing a handful of sand. I wonder if M Night knew that the Avatar's name was Aang, not Oong. It's pretty sad that the fire nation actors from the series were made to portray the characters better then the movie director did. I have so much more to say but have already been struggling to watch my language while describing this disaster of a movie. So, I will just end with this...What the F did I just watch and how do I unwatch it? I think I need to take a dump to try and get this $hit it off my system.",The Last Airbender
1467,girlhappy2008,The Last Time I See An M. Night Film,2,4 March 2014,"Unlike the critically-acclaimed TV show The Last Air bender disappoints on many levels. The acting is terrible, the directing is poor, and the 3- D visual effects are cheap and amateurish. The Last Air bender is a theatrical reincarnation of the hit TV show in which the protagonist Aang has to bring balance to the four nations which consisted of fire, water, earth, and air. His two partners, Saka and Katara, are supposed to be smart, courage's and funny. However there is no intelligent chemistry between them. Their acting is poor and no smart dialogue between them. The poor directional quality of this film is obviously no M. Night's best work at all. With messy 3-D and weak visual effects. To add insult to injury the choreography was tasteless and unnecessary. Fans of the TV show and M. Night's films will be deeply disappointed with this film.",The Last Airbender
1468,aumbrellavioleta,Upsetting to fans of the original...,1,30 July 2014,"I love the series now, and forever. It is a children's show filled with morals and lessons that I agree with and would love for my children to watch and enjoy as well. I was extremely excited when I heard they were making a movie of it, I knew it would take multiple movies because of how long the series was, but was still excited to see it on screen. It would clearly end up missing a LOT of details that are really what make you love the characters but I figured it would have to be good because I just love this so much. Sadly this was not so. They said the names wrong, and that is an easily forgiven mistake. Something I found to be not forgivable, the character Iroh, there are others I found to be warped, but Iroh in the beginning was a fat and happy character. In this he was skinny and appeared to be in good physical shape. It is a big deal to me because Iroh is the first fire nation person you meet in the series that you don't hate. The bending was also annoying, as in the show fire benders could make fire, but in this they had to have fire to bend. If you haven't seen the show you might like this, but that doesn't mean that the people who have, have no right to complain about the many mistakes that make the series so great. When something is adapted, it is expected to have parts of the original, to keep the existing fans. Things get lost and changed in adaptation, but anyone that has seen the show all the way through this is really an abomination. If you haven't seen the show, please watch it, this is a world that is rich and vast and Id like to think that fans of this movie that haven't seen the show would enjoy getting the whole story and falling in love with in all over again. My advice for this, is to watch it all the way through once, and give it a chance, just because I don't like it doesn't mean someone else won't either.",The Last Airbender
1469,avalon4pagans,not as bad as the fan rage says it is.,4,4 July 2010,"To be up front with it this movies is bad but not nearly as bad as other adaptation films, the first Hulk film and X-men 3 are still worse films. The big problems with ""The Last Airbender"" are the stilted flat acting from all of the major character and the film's rushed pace. Those are the only real crimes the movie commits, but that is bad enough to make this a terrible movie.A vast number of fan have had huge complaints with the changes M. Night and the AVATAR THE LAST AIRBENDER creators made to the characters and the bending system. However these complaints are fans nitpicking, and really some of these changes make sense. For example Firebenders needing a source of flame to bend... all of the other elements do, why not them. Having watched Fullmetal Alchemist before seeing this film the idea of ""you can't make something out of nothing"" was ground into my brain, so that was a nice fix, its called a balanced magic system people! The mortal combat like combos to bend, its about the manipulation of ki to effect the element, ever watch a shaolin monk channel their ki, they kinda combo it. The ""butchered"" pronouncement of character names, they weren't, The Last Airbender is in a Chinese style at least the show was, with every indication that the Airbenders were like Tibetan monks, I happen to speak Mandarin Chinese and A-a-n-g does sound like Uhng. Avatar is a Hindi word so the Indian actors are pronouncing it right, honestly they were making the film less Americanized and more culturally aware. Fans complain about white-washing but when something American that was wrong with the show was removed, you are up in arms. The film is about 1/8 the length of the first season, so things will be cut, altered and changed it's a fact of film. The cutting wasn't handle well because it threw off the pace and limited character growth, not because Bumi was cut or there were no Kyoshi Warriors, they were pretty minor to the plot of the first season. Be worried if they don't get added back in the second film, where they do play a big role.All in all, was this film good... no... was it the worse film ever no. Will worse films be made...most likely. Honestly fans need to take a step back and think, no adaptation is perfect, things will be changed, and in this case some of the changes were much needed others were not. Was this film worth the 8$ I paid to see it nope, but if it wasn't 3D it was worth the 5$ I would have paid. Don't go see it in theaters wait for the DVD and get it on Netflix. It is not unwatchable.",The Last Airbender
1470,rchea5,Terrible adaptation!,2,30 July 2013,"WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!!I want to say first and foremost that The Last Airbender was on of the greatest cartoon series that I have seen on Nickelodeon for a while. I was happy that I saw that they were gonna see that they were gonna make a live action version of it, but was utterly disappointed to see M Night S was gonna direct it. And he did not disappoint in making a bad adaptation of the beloved cartoon series.Lets start with the small things, he changed the name pronunciation of most of the characters just because he thought it sounded more exotic. How idiotic does that sound, changing Aang's name to sound more like Aung. So annoying. Another problem was not adding the Kyoshi in the entire movie. The Kyoshi were iconic characters that have help out Aang in a number of ways and added a love interest for Sokka. But no, M Night says he loved them too much that he couldn't add them to he film. WHAT!? Im sorry, but that sounds retarded when he say that. My biggest complaint would be the martial art application in the film and the downsizing of the Fire nation. The reason the fire nation was such a strong force to begin with was that they draw their power from the sun, not because there was a fire source near them. If this was true, they would've been considered the weakest tribe, because you can easily put out a flame to shut their bending down. And the fact that the earth nation look so weak when their spirits were lifted to something so disappointing, it was laughable. Also it seems that in the live action version you needed to perform a series of movements before anything could happen with your element. Stupid decisions were made all around and thats why we're not gonna see another Airbender movie, until years later when someone can reboot or continue it right. But that most likely wont happen. However, i will give where credit is due. The world they created for the movie was very well down an the costumes were awesome. So definitely props to the Art department.",The Last Airbender

I have signed up to this site specifically to give this movie a little of the credit it deserves. I watched a few of the cartoons and enjoyed them and I thought this movie summed it all up beautifully. I love everything about it, the scenery and cinematography were spectacular, the plot was fine, the characters and the acting, granted some of them could have had a smidge more experience but I was astounded at the mastery of movement by the young boy and girl. Costuming - gorgeous, and effects flawless. I was completely engrossed in this fantastical world and these beautiful concepts.

So, I knew the movie wouldn't necessarily be fantastic, but I had some hope. However, it turned out to be a massive disappointment. I guess the worst part (besides the poor acting, writing, casting, and major plot changes) was the fact that they couldn't even pronounce Aang correctly. It's not like they were making a movie based on a book where the pronunciation is debatable. It was based off a popular TV show. To, in effect,change the main character's name is ridiculous, annoying, and pointless. Overall, this movie was a waste of time at best, and I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone.",The Last Airbender

I watched it in 2D (brighter clearer better) on home cinema and it really showed my system off. The sets and scenery alone should get the film a decent rating and the child actors didn't let themselves down at all. Add to that some pretty special effects and a nice old fashioned good vs evil plot and the whole thing didn't waste my evening. To read some of the reviews it feels like I must have watched a different film. I'm not familiar with the story's roots and I can only imagine that fans of the original material wanted to see something different. It is very hard to keep fans happy. The only down side to watching this film was explaining to my 12 year old why a sequel, and the resolution to the story, was very unlikely to be made. I imagine the child actors will be too old to make it. Hmm, I seem to remember having the same conversation with her after watching Eragon.

It explained too much at parts that didn't need explaining and not enough explaining on other parts that needed it. M. Night Shyamalan should be banned from ever writing, directing, and making films.

And also, he has to pay ALL the money he got from the movie's box office sales to everybody from the cast of that movie PLUS the anime, for vandalizing that Mona Lisa of a show and making it into a pile of feces covered in negatives. The only good thing in my book is the fact that all fire-benders except Iroh(who is known as the""Dragon of the East, or West, I'm not sure,"" for his special ability to breathe fire like a dragon) need a source of fire (fireball, torch, etc.) to bend out of it.

1479,nicest_t,Piece of trash,1,27 November 2013,"Katara and her brother Soka are fishing in the South Pole when they accidentally break an iceberg containing a human and a huge bison. They quickly realize that an air bender by the name of Aang and his flying bison Apa were frozen in there. The two siblings quickly show Aang to their water tribe village, where an elderly woman claims they have found the last air bender, the avatar. Aang just learns about the war which has been going on for over 100 years with the Fire Nation, thus he realizes that he was frozen for that long. Katara and Soka reassure him and tell him that he can end the war, but he needs to master all elements to defeat the fire lord. As they travel to the northern Water Tribe for aang to learn waterbending, they learn that a banished Fire Nation prince, Zuko, dedicates his life to capture Aang as it is the only way he can restore his honor. They stop at the air temple, and aang discovers of the genocide that took place and killed all of his friends. Devastated, he pledges to end the war. As the group get to the northern Water Tribe, they discover the Fire Nation sent a huge fleet to obliterate the tribe. Trapped and outnumbered, the big battle begins.This movie is nothing but terrible. M Knight Shyamalan has quite a reputation to make terrible movies, so why would he be chosen to handle such a delicate project? It is unknown what the producers were thinking. After seeing the movie, fans of the original show really question whether or not the direction has bothered to watch the original: the names aren't pronounced correctly, and the personality of the characters are not recognizable. The actors chosen don't even come close to what they looked like in the show, which is expected with these adaptations. Fire Nation citizens are influenced by ancient Chinese citizens, yet in the movie they adopt Indian culture. Katara is Inuit in the show but looks nothing like that in the movie. It's necessary to stick with the descriptions of the original when making a movie like this. The special effects are despicable. Using special effects from 1980 on a 2011 production is an insult to cinema, and is an unforgivable mistake. If you don't have the required funds to make amazing effects needed for such a movie, then don't make it! The acting is rotten. You're better off going to your child's elementary school play then looking as this garbage. I have rarely seen acting that was so unnatural; Shyamalan said he picked the best of the best, which makes us wonder what he had done prior to the auditions to think such an absurd thought. Nicola Peltz (katara) has a lot to learn regarding sadness. In the first scene, she gets angry at Soka (Jackson Rathbone), yet she doesn't use facial or body expressions to do so, making it look so fake. I try to like this movie. I am a huge fan of the original show and I really went in the cinema with nothing but optimism and a smile on my face. They messed up, badly. It's always challenging to adapt a show to a movie, so I am usually flexible and allow these productions to be mediocre, but there is still a line. The first season was too long to be crammed into a 90 minute film. The actors are terrible, the direction is inexistent and the artistic team was chosen out of kindergarten.

When I heard they were making the series into a movie I was excited. I know when a series is made into a movie things are going to differ in a way. BUT WOW!!! The differences in this movie are unnecessary and completely ruin the integrity of the cartoon series. Here are a few:1. Pronunciation of the characters names; They wanted use the Asian pronunciation, Why? All it did was leave series fans correcting every name out loud throughout the movie.2. The bending; you need to wait for the charters to do a 20 second martial arts demonstration before any bending starts, which makes the fight scenes seem slow and weak.3. Missing important (and some of my favorite) scenes from the series; I understand you cant fit a 10 hour series into a 1.5 hour movie, but I would have much preferred 2 movies to cover the first book then to miss critical information.4. The Avatar battling the fire nation scene; this is the first time you see how much power Avatar has and start to believe he has a chance to save the world. The writers butchered this! All the Avatar does in the movie is make a big wave and bye bye fire nation, it doesn't portray the real power the Avatar holds.5. Characters; there was no character building and the writers/actors didn't stay to the series. The series was such a success that it was made in a movie, why fix something that wasn't broken?This movie was such a disappointment that I felt the need to write this review and warn you not to watch this movie if you are Avatar: The Last Airbender series fan. You may enjoy this movie if you are not a series fan as you don't know the differences, but all in all VERY BAD MOVIE!!!!I think this review is justified with the IMDb 4.4 rating, no intentions from Nickelodeon to make the 2 other seasons into movies, no nominations for the 2011 Kids Choice Awards and the movie won 5 of the Razzie Awards it was nominated for; including Worst Picture of the year.",The Last Airbender

I haven't watched the whole movie because I was so infuriated by the way they laid everything out, but the way they end the movie makes me cringe. I mean seriously I don't know if they didn't want to make the whole series into one movie or just snip-its of the first 3 chapters. I can't believe at the end it was as if i went back to the first chapter! Did they even introduce Toph? With the actors, There acting was OK and all but they way they were supposed to resemble avatar characters set me off. I mean Zuko looked nothing like Zuko same with Iroh and Sokka.

Right from the beginning, the names were generally anything but correct and it drove me insane the entire time. It seemed almost as if M. Night Shyamalan was given a general idea of what went on in the series and kind of just branched out from there. At several parts that were supposed to be serious my theater just began laughing because the movie really just became a joke, especially when the Blue Spirit came around. It was just ridiculous and I'm upset that I went to the midnight showing of this movie. This movie, more than anything frustrated me and is being broken into 3 separate movies that I'm not sure will make it through everything that I saw in this movie.I should have waited until it came to our $2 theater.

Condensed, dumbed-down, racially profiled and missing most of the components which made the series important and endearing are only a tiny fraction of the remarks I would need to make. I think this one was ""called in"" by everyone involved with it, starting with Shyamalan. It was condescending and nearly incoherent, and I assure you, from the point of view of a professional writer, it is quite a feat to provide both these levels of incompetence simultaneously.After having watched the series, and also having seen the amazing job Peter Jackson did with Lord of the Rings, not to mention the sensitivity to diverse cultural values which was evident in the movie ""Avatar"", all I can say is, it is a redundancy to point out how much better this film could have been, and how low was the bar that, notwithstanding, it failed to clear.

It was a series of matter of fact vignettes narrated blandly: ""We went here...then we went there..."" The movie's source- a Nickelodeon cartoon- could give director M. Night Shyamalan a few lessons about character development, building dramatic tension and cohesive story telling. Seriously this movie is crap.

I went to see it with another friend who's a big fan of Avatar, and my brother who has never once seen the show. All three of us LOVED it. During every fight scene, every hair-raising martial art move, we all leaned forward in our seats and muttered ""awesome"". The martial arts were great. The CGI was great. The settings were FANTASTIC. The acting? Well... kid actors can be expected to be mediocre, but they weren't terrible. It reminded me of the first Harry Potter movie--young kid actors who are just getting used to their roles. I've heard a lot of whining about the pace of the movie. This whining is from disgruntled Airbender fans who expected to see an 8-hour live- action mimic of the cartoon series. OBVIOUSLY stuffing 20 episodes into an hour and 43 minute movie is going to leave some things out you dopes, yet I was still pleasantly surprised to see as much as I did!All in all, this movie copied the show very, very well. I'm frustrated the review counter only has this movie at about 5 stars. It deserves much higher. I have become a renewed fan of M.

The story is interesting and the effects are good, there is the time to understand the nature of each character and the features of the world that is introduced. Speaking shortly, when watching this movie, I smoothly became part of its reality, so I was really interested to the happenings and never bored. It is a fantastic world and, comparing it with other fantastic worlds with young heroes, in my opinion is between The ""Lord of ring"" and the first Narnia if we want to classify how much is near to a fairy tale.

He also killed the moon spirit with fire bending.The ocean spirit never took of Aang to defeat the fire nation. They mispronounced like half the characters names. They didn't get a SINGLE THING RIGHT IN THIS STUPID MOVIE. Save your time and prevent cancer by not watching this movie!!!!",The Last Airbender

Yet I was proved wrong, the film featured countless plot holes and poor editing not to mention that it missed out some vital story lines from the first season there was no mention of the events at the Air Temples a vital part of the story as well as the complete over look of characters such as Suki and Avatar Roku two key characters. Fight scenes such as that between Katara and Master Pakku in the deleted scenes could have been much more elaborate and longer or even better PUT IN TO THE MOVIE! There virtually no bending in the film and when Aang entered the Avatar State there was no mention to what it was despite have two opportunities. The only good thing was James Newton Howards amazing scores and the wave scene at the end. As a fan I am ashamed of this film and disappointed that for those who haven't watched or heard of the show this is what they are presented with.

I didn't want to read any reviews that could spoil it so I dove right in.The chaos, lack of direction and unwillingness to be true to the series was just too much to tolerate. The film had too much dialog, no comic relief and no character development. I actually wanted all the main characters dead at one point to put them out of their misery. Even my 12-year-old niece could make it past the first ten minutes. Smart girl!

Character development was terrible, along with every other aspect of the movie. The fact that they (spoilers) didn't even get the names right is awful.

I found his portrayal of Aang to be engaging and refreshing.The movie was not filled with filthy language and sexual situations as so many people deem entertaining and acceptable social behavior.Although there is violence, there is no more than was in the animated version or what other is portrayed in Saturday morning cartoons. I would take someone of any age to see this movie. I have enjoyed many of M. Night Shyamalan's movies and felt that although this was not his usual genre it still was good.

When it got announced that a live action was being made I was quite enthusiastic, but the movie turned out to be a huge let down and it did not live up to the expectations that many of us held. There was such a huge potential for this live action to be great, and it wasn't due to the fact I may have been young when I watched the series and I might have forgotten how bad it really is, as I have re-watched it in the last couple of years and still love it the same, probably even more now as I appreciate it much more due to the film.",The Last Airbender

I've never thought I would be able to dehumanize and hate people with such intensity that I may as well be a guard at a Nazi concentration camp.Watching this movie has taught me that all hope for humanity is futile. That IMDb is at least half frequented by sub-human morons. It has taught me that grotesqueness is all we deserve and all we will get out of life.

1501,starcrossedpoet,This film does not deserve the level of disrespect it's receiving.,7,5 July 2010,"Look, this is not the worst film ever produced as some on here would wish you to believe. It is, however, exactly what you would expect from an adaptation. That is the key word in all this. Adaptation. The name pronunciation changes were logical and actually more accurate than those in the show. The inability for lower fire benders to just invent fire was another logical change, and allows the audience to appreciate the power of the masters that actually CAN produce fire internally.Consequently, you can not possibly adapt 7 hours of a cartoon into a 2 hour movie without some changes being made. Some parts were cut out, yes. Just like they couldn't fit everything from the Harry Potter books in the films. They couldn't fit everything from the Lord of the Rings into the films. This happens with many adaptations, whether it be from a television series or books. The Last Airbender maintained the general plot of the show as well as the personalities of the characters. In no way did it change things as much as Dragonball: Evolution, as some have said. In no way is this film on the tragically horrible level of Uwe Boll movies. If you want to see poor film-making, watch some of the trash on ""SyFy"" or direct to video horror movies from Lionsgate.Is this the best television to movie adaptation ever? Absolutely not. Is it the worst? Absolutely not. I think it is actually a step UP for Mr. Shyamalan's Lady in the Water and The Happening. Don't believe the negative hype. This film is enjoyable to those that aren't anal retentive and realize that no adaptation is perfect, but some can still make for entertaining films.",The Last Airbender

You get the feeling of how did we get here from there moments? Dialogue was vanilla. No drama, no intrigue, no character development. This was painful, just painful. We even felt ripped off with matinée prices. There just seemed to be no emotions from most of the cast. The exception being the Prince, who seemed to be having fits of rage mixed with calm at various and disjointed time frames. When you watch a teenager whose hormones are raging and they go from Suzie Sunshine to ""I hate you all and hope you die die die""? That would be the Prince. It had all the elements of a success, but there just seemed to be a missing heart. There were points in the movie where I felt like the cast just decided to phone it in.

1508,ninag305,Worst movie ever!,1,23 December 2014,"*Contains spoilers of the show for those who haven't seen it.This movie was truly awful. I was excited to see this movie, but after the first few minutes I couldn't watch anymore due to how bad it was.First of all, why is it taking a bunch of moves to do one bit of bending? The point of bending is that the element, in a way, becomes a part of you. One move should already make it move.Xmen: imagine Jean Grey and Magneto doing a bunch of moves just to levitate one object or bend one bit of metal.Another thing that killed the movie was Aang revealing his identity. He steps out of the iceberg and simply reveals himself to be the Avatar. Plus, he shows no emotion at all.About revealing his identity: the whole reason why Aang was in an iceberg is because he didn't want to be the Avatar. When the monks told him he's the Avatar he got scared and ran away. He and Appa got caught in a bad storm, and Aang went to the Avatar state and froze himself in an iceberg.As for his emotions when he reveals his identity, is he an actor or a robot?This was simply the worst movie ever.",The Last Airbender

1510,spcdud,Pretty Good,9,19 July 2011,"I have never seen the animated series and I knew absolutely nothing about this film's plot or characters or anything when I got into it. I have to disagree with the majority of the people on here and say that it was actually a good movie. I really enjoyed it. As I said, I didn't have any experience at all with the story/characters going into it and I didn't have any trouble at all understanding the plot. I understood WHY the fire nation was waging war against the others without needing the animated series to explain it. To be perfectly honest, I don't understand why people dislike this movie so much. It's really not that bad, guys! Don't take it so seriously. You're getting riled up over nothing. Like Twilight fans who quibble over the slightest detail deviations from book to movie. It's just a movie! And not a bad one at that. I'm sure that the movie was always supposed to be LOOSELY based on the animated series, not a word-for-word adaptation. Seriously, stop dissecting and start enjoying the good things in the movie.1. The acting -- I actually thought it was pretty good. The lead (Noah) wasn't wooden at all. He's actually very expressive, especially his face. All of the actors were expressive that way (even Jackson).2. The special effects were pretty cool, in 2-D at least. I didn't see it in 3-D.3. The story was actually pretty easy to understand, if your mind isn't clogged up with analyzing each and every little difference from the animated series. The plot in the film is pretty straight-forward. No need to see the animated series first to understand what's happening. The plot isn't boring (and not too hackneyed). I found it quite interesting.Anyway, I think that those three things make the film worth seeing. Just don't compare it to the animated series so much, and the movie will be really enjoyable.",The Last Airbender

The good parts were the moves they used to bend. Avatar state was awesome to. But I really think they need to remake this. Dev peteal did not have to shave his head, the scar is not visible enough to know it is even there. No one except Noah was right for the part. Nobody looked like the characters. The script was awful made everyone in the show look grumpy or dumb. I think M. Night was not right for the part of directing this. I don't think he even watched the show, because if he did the movie might of made sense. Everything is just wrong with the movie.

Could they have butchered the names anymore than they did? Worse, the entire movie felt like a string of clips put together for an hour and a half and not like a movie at all. All the major parts of the Book of Water were skimmed over, while things like the freeing of the earth nation village (while important) were given screen time that could have been given to major events like the southern air temple.The actors were dismal, with the exception of Dev Patel as Zuko and to a lesser extent Shaun Toub as Iroh, who wasn't an accurate portrayal of Iroh visually but at least captured the character's wisdom much better than many of the other actors on board for the movie. He however failed to provide many of the aspects of Iroh that made him endearing in the series.I will give that the northern water kingdom was gorgeous, but that's about all I have to say kindly about this movie.If you love Avatar: The Last Airbender as the series, I recommend giving this movie a miss. It's heartbreaking how they butchered something that had such fantastic and barely needing change source material.",The Last Airbender

1514,magong802,"Seriously, guys, give it a break!",7,1 July 2010,"Many fans of Avatar: The Last Airbender are disappointed by this movie. While I understand, I really think that some fans are being a tad too nitpicky. I adore the series, and I definitely think that the movie could have been better, but I think also believe M. Night Shamalan squeezed 10 hours of television into a two hour movie as best as a director such as himself could have done. While there are some details that bugged me, I certainly wouldn't give the movie one or two stars, as many have done. I feel that a rating that low is pretty harsh.Lots of people are ticked off at the fact that Aang, Sokka, and Iroh are pronounced differently. I wonder if these folks know the reason that this was done. The way these names are pronounced in the series is actually the ""Americanization"" of Eastern names. Even Shaun Toub, an Iranian actor who plays Iroh, commented on this. Why put so much effort into preserving the Eastern influences within the series and allow the mispronunciation of Asian names? While I found the name change irksome at first, I decided to focus on the PLOT of the movie rather than dwell on something that I knew was a correction necessary for authenticity. As for the acting, I believe the actors did the very best with what they were given. Dev Patel mastered Zuko's agnsty-ness, and Shaun Toub ROCKED IT as the gentle, deeply spiritual Iroh. Nicola Peltz was a satisfactory Katara; in the series, the character is just as maternal and protective as she is in the movie. Noah Ringer did great, considering this was his first acting role ever, and I thought the moment of Aang discovering the genocide of the Airbenders was fittingly devastating. Jackson Rathbone...did what he could. My main beef with this movie is that the Sokka I know and love was a different person, but that has nothing to do with Jackson's acting.To put it simply, the movie does not have enough joyful moments or humor. People who have never seen the series would never know how silly Aang can be, and how hilarious Sokka is. This is the reason I did not enjoy this movie more. If there had been more laugh-out-loud moments, I certainly would have given this movie an 8, 9, or maybe even a 10. However, I also believe that the other aspects of the movie were true to the spirit of the series. I will still see the second movie, especially to see Toph and Azula in action. To people who haven't seen the movie yet: give it a chance. It's not perfect, but it's not horrible, either. See it and judge for yourself. It's a realistic, albeit more serious, adaptation of a great series.",The Last Airbender

Slow and unsatisfying action sequences and terrible acting all around. My biggest complaint is the complete lack of detail with everything. From the clothes to the fact that everyone is Indian! Look, I'm mixed, so believe me I'm not racist. But the die hard fan in me is furious. The show has a strong Asian influence specifically Chinese. They couldn't even get the main characters ethnicity right! Come on! Even the way they pronounce his name is wrong. I disapprove of this movie so much!

I'm also writing spoilers on purpose so people can see I have actually seen the movie and am not just a troll.First off I'm a fan of the TV series :) I also already had low expectations going into the movie seeing it was made by M night....The is NOTHING like the TV series, the characters have ZERO development in it. Ang is someone I didn't even like the entire movie or any of the other characters. The script is so flat without any humor at all that made the movie so endearing. There was basically no plot, and the acting...I know they needed a martial arts kid, but wow I have never seen such a poor acting job by every single person that was in the ENTIRE movie besides for the uncle.The visual effects were so cheesy and over the top and the movie was filled with so many ridiculous slo-mo moments that you couldn't help but laugh. There was absolutely no dramatic scene at all, even the ships all raining fire on Ang wasn't shown as it was in the trailer...I blame the director. For instance on the end battle scene the commander of the fire army and a bunch of his men just simply walks up to the moon/dragon spirits to kill them with NOBODY trying to stop them besides for the princess and the useless brother. During the battle scene which is the WORST I have ever seen, they have just had Ang captured, and the characters calmly STROLL around in the MIDDLE of the battle with nobody touching them. Calmy saying Oh no Ang is gone we have to find him. With zero emotion or distress in her voice.THe last time I've seen such a poor quality film was Meet the Spartans...and it pretty much doesn't get worse than that.

I never saw it when it came out though. I had heard it wasn't that great. I eventually forgot about it until one day, a couple years ago, I was looking for something to watch on Netflix and found it. I was having a good day until I saw this movie. It was hard to watch. I don't know if it's normal to be embarrassed for someone else, but I was embarrassed by the acting. It was awful. I'm not trying to be mean, I promise. Those in the movie might be great actors, I don't know. They were just not good in this movie. Also, they all, for some reason, pronounced Aang's name like ahng, instead of ayng. It got on my nerves to be honest. The special effects were questionable to say the least. I was surprised that the directing of M. Night Shyamalan, who has directed movies like Signs and The Sixth Sense, was so care free and loose. It may be a bit unfair to blame the director for the movie's failure but directors do coordinate ever aspect of the movie. Though this movie was atrocious, I gave it the benefit of the doubt and gave it two stars instead of one. My reasoning behind this was that it at least kept to the original story and wasn't changed too much. I've seen this movie twice and I am confused why I watched it a second time. If you haven't seen this movie yet and are thinking about seeing it, do not. If you do you'll probably stop watching towards the beginning. I guess they knew it was bad too considering they never made the next one. This movie leaves A LOT to be desired.",The Last Airbender

It has no action, acting, and the special effects are just a sad byproduct of over talented animators shlepping around Hollywood having to take orders from idiot directors that only get work because of personal connections and a ""Hey I remember you"" mentality for talent rather than competitive skill or measurable quality. Shyamalan only gets work because he accidentally made some good movies and the producers with the money are to old, lazy, and out of touch to notice that any random TV director will probably do a better job simply because they are smart enough to TRY rather than assume their own talent.Shyamalan's talent has been dead the whole time.

Second, the actors didn't really match the characters. Third. What director in their right minds puts all three seasons in one movie? He could have done so much more by making three movies out of the three books. That way each movie could actually follow what the series made it out to be. As an avid ATLA viewer and a living fan, I'm insulted by the lack of respect to make this movie what it could have been. It should have followed the series to the T. It was all mapped out for him and he messed it up. It could have been amazing. It could have made the fan base proud. But it didn't. It should be burned. This movie is a disgrace. You failed, M.

Is this a joke to them? - Are these actors from a middle school play? - Avatar Kyoshi was a man???? - The avatar can have a family, just ask Avatar Ruko, dumb kids. - Aang had no trouble learning water-bending, he had trouble learning earth-bending. - Dat acting doh. - Apparently water-bending is just dancing on a river. - Zuko was challenged to an agni-KEY. - The Northern Air Temple scene makes no sense. - Where are all of Sokka's jokes? - Everyone figures out Zuko is the Blue Spirit. - What happened to Omashu, Koh, and Suki?",The Last Airbender

My only wish is that they would have made the last fight scene longer and made the movie as a whole more gruesome and bloody. If you are into the medieval fantasy genre then this is definitely a must see. Great fight scenes and it's awesome watching the Avatar kick-butt. It is sort of like a martial arts film on magical steroids. I loved the last scene with the tidal wave but I wish he would have used it to crush a few bad guys and push them back. I guess I can't stress enough that if they made the movie more bloody and gruesome then it would have attracted a lot more fans, especially adult ones. Seeing the Avatar actually kill a few bad guys and get in some more big fights would have been cool. I think fans wanted to see him use his powers to kill dudes and get in some more big fights and it never happened. I think the sequels should show off his powers more. But it was a good intro and start of the three part trilogy. The last big fight scene of the movie was really cool.",The Last Airbender

Problem solved!As for fictional movies the best part for me is seeing the new technology used in film making. One example that I always allude to when evaluating how believable a situation is, is in the movie ""The Final Countdown - 1980"". Here we have a bunch of modern sophisticated weapons technological F-16's going up against the Japanese Zero's. But they are not allowed to engage because the TIME WARP PHENOMENON is re-occurring. So they are all called back.Now throughout this movie the audience is cheering emphatically because of what is about to occur. From a military stand point when you enlist you are pretty much making a PACT that you will give up your life for your country. So why not engage the enemy and let the chips fall where they may. Even if the pilot of one Zero survived and reported back what he saw decimate the other Zero's it might have caused Japan to rethink their position. Remember the Emperor of Japan only thought of himself. He allowed two nuclear devices to be detonated with the threat of a third the only deterrent from continuing the war. As the treaty was signed it was on the condition that the Emperor maintain his Status Quo.And as long as we are on the subject. After World War I the French and English countries were assigned the duties of monitoring Germany's industrial and political entities. When Germany stopped making Volkswagen and Mercedes Benz vehicles and instead were pumping out Panzer tanks and Messerschmidt aircraft and especially when Germany invaded Poland, these two countries should have known that something was up and put an immediate end to it.

Avatar the Last Airbender is one of my favorite TV shows ever, and to see such an atrocious movie advertising as if it is close to the series will not suit me whatsoever.This movie was garbage. This movie was worse than garbage. M Night Shyamalan truly is one of the worst directors of the modern era. It was so bad, that not even the NAMES were pronounced correctly. Aang, the MAIN CHARACTER was mispronounced, AVATAR was pronounced incorrectly. The bending in this movie was embarrassing, for example in Add terrible special effects, acting, direction, and everything in the movie and you will get The Last Airbender. I hope no one judges the show based off the movie because this movie is the polar opposite of the show. The show is absolutely amazing, and will always be one of my favorites.

1532,davidbarker-00317,"Horrible, unbearable abomination of a film",2,19 February 2016,"Never before have I seen a film squander its source material worse than The Last Airbender. What is probably one of the greatest animated series of all time was adapted horrendously by the hands of M. Night Shamylan. The film fails in almost every way imaginable, but primarily fails in two particular aspects: it falls flat of faithfully adapting its source material, as well as being a poorly made stand alone movie with terrible acting, directing and story telling.Much of this is because Shamylan tried fitting the entire first season of the show into a movie that's not even two hours long. The Last Airbender is basically the first two episodes and the last two episodes of the first season, with bits and pieces of other episodes thrown in between to fill in the gaps. As a whole, the movie shows maybe a quarter of the events from the first season at the most. As a result, the story feels rushed, being unable to explain everything properly enough to create a story thats even remotely interesting. There were also lot of interesting story arcs from the first season that were avoided that would have added life to the plot, and not make the story feel like it is dragging on. Ultimately, the whole story felt rushed and made it feel like explaining a plot in a single run on sentence.Even if the movie was longer, the acting and characters in this would not have saved it. With the exception of Dev Patel and Shaun Toub, the acting in this movie came across as stale and unemotional. There is almost no emotion to the characters in this movie. The movie cares more about explaining what is happening, and not why it is happening. The movie would rather try and explain everything that is happening instead of creating characters that the audience can get behind and support. As a whole, the movie fails to adapt the popular source material that it is based on, and also to make a movie that can stand by itself, and instead make this horrible and unbearable abomination of a film.Do not let this film be a representation of the TV show. It is an incredible series with a perfectly paced story, amazing characters and breathtaking action sequences. Highly recommend the TV series if you have not seen it already.",The Last Airbender

Teaching to respect the elements of the world and using them in an interesting and revolutionary way was a breath of fresh air in cinema. The movie had a lot of action and special effects that looked great. I really want them to come out with a second one. I liked how they were able to show character development and romance without any nudity or sexism. This is a movie that children and adults can enjoy for years to come.

The CGI is amazing and looks so realistic, blending right in with the real world but through fantastic elemental magic. It doesn't look fake at all. I never saw the TV version but feel the ideas are very original. It is action-packed and I really got into the story line. I like how it incorporates ideas from the Dalai Lama and legends from other cultures. PLEASE keep the series going no matter what the critics think!

1538,axl5000_7,Makes Dragonball: Evolution Look Good,1,8 July 2010,"Personally I think they need to find a new writer and director, The effects were weak, the story was weaker and the pronunciations of the names just grated on my nerves unendingly to where I had to force myself not to walk out. I'll start with the effects, because in the show, yes there was flourish to the moves but not so much it took 5 minutes to raise a few droplets of water. The story was just terrible, leaving every important bit of information out such as the kyoshi warriors and kyoshi being an island, the firebenders suddenly can no longer create fire themselves (except Iroh). The acting and dialogue were absolutely atrocious and the pronunciations of the names was pathetic, these are established characters in a grand story and the director decided to put his own spin on them. It makes me wonder if M. Night Shaymalan ever watched the show, if he did he obviously didn't pay attention and was in this only for the money. If I were the creators I would fire Shaymalan and get someone new to salvage the whole thing. May I also add WTF was with turning everything (especially the fire nation) into India, One look at the fire nation in the cartoon and you can see that everything is distinctly Japanese. This is probably the worst adaptation of a cartoon, anime, etc I have had the misfortune to see, even Dragonball: Evolution wasn't this bad and thats saying a lot!

So when I found the film in my Easter basket, I was ecstatic. I put into our DVD player and watched as my ecstasy turned into grim horror. I wasn't expecting a perfect adaptation of the series, but at least something close. And I didn't get that. What I got was a bunch of sloppy characters and dialogue and statues. The characters were statues. I never saw one of them smile. Forget the race changing. There was so much stuff that didn't make sense. At the Earthbender prison (Which in the show was a metal ship while in the film it's nothing more than a closed off area of land) Oong (or Aang) says, ""There is earth right beneath your feet!"" Seriously. You'd think M. Night would have picked up on it. And what really bothered me was the fact that the film was the first season of the series, so I had expectations higher than normal. I wanted the film to be really close to the series, and it wasn't. Honestly, I think maybe the film would have done better if it had branched out (maybe discuss the adventures of Avatar Roku or something). At least then I could look at it and say, ""Hey. It was an effort."" Instead it was like taking a puzzle already completed, destroying it, then trying to put it back together and fail. And M. Night's a decent director.

However, acting was mediocre, and it just felt...rushed through. There were parts that were talked about too long, and others not long enough. It felt like important parts in the anime were either skipped over, or not given enough screen time. The names, they were absolutely butchered. There were so many moments in the movie that I just wanted to stop watching. I think, if you are very curious, go ahead and watch it, it's not absolutely awful, however, if you truly love the anime/cartoon and want to keep it that way, do not watch this movie.",The Last Airbender

If anything, it deserves more. I find it quite aggravating that their are people who can give this film a 10/10, without understanding or rebutting any of the issues with this film or explaining why they believe it's perfect.I find it baffling how Shyamalan can claim he wanted to make this film, because he loved the source material. If he truly loved the Avatar series, he wouldn't have even tried to condense approximately 8.5 hours of excellent storytelling into a movie that just hits 100 minutes. The CGI is deserving of the award 'Worst Eye-Gouging Mis-Use of 3D' (which it won). The action/choreography is abysmal, especially when compared to that of the series. Excellent characters and stories are wasted. The never-before-seen actors are that for a reason. Many times logic is just plain missing from the film. And if you're going to ripoff someone else's work, at least try and pronounce the character's names correctly.",The Last Airbender
1544,scotters1964,Great,10,3 December 2010,"I waited to rent the movie and watch it at home. Reason being, I did not trust Night to give me a movie that I would not find crushingly bad. He's had few hits, a few near misses, but mostly disasters when it came to film making. So I had no faith in him as a director. I also think it would have done better box office without Night's name on it.However, this movie was brilliant and I watched it with a HUGE fan of the Avatar franchise who had a somewhat different perspective. BUT, I really enjoyed it and hope to see the other two stories made into film with the same quality.The kid playing Aang was an absolute delight and a really fresh face, unique, and played like the part was all his. He really delivered and I am intrigued to follow this film franchise if it develops.My concern is that Night's ego and his reputation will ruin a future of the next two potential films. I do not know Knight personally, but I can only imagine this movie being made so well with a tight leash around his neck.Its a long road since ""I see dead people"" and Unbreakable which are the only 2 films I liked by Night.

They changed too much stuff from the book and anime which led to their downfall. Also the casting is really and I mean really bad.

1548,johanolovpersson,Equal to pure suffering,1,22 December 2016,"Lets say you one day stumble across a really good and popular cartoon. The cartoon is actually brilliant, it takes place in a fantasy world deeply inspired by Asian culture but in a way so people from everywhere can fully enjoy and embrace it. The characters are great and have a special dynamic between them, they are both in their own way very deep but also very comedic. The plot is easy but daring for a simple cartoon, with characters who develop and and change in directions that are actually pretty interesting. Now imagine a bunch of suits sitting down basically saying: ""Eyy yo Steve, seen this neat Ill cartoon? Well it is pretty popular so making a live action movie of it would surely earn us a lot of cash, so lets hire a terrible director, some horrible writers, the worst god damn actors you have ever seen and make the worst adaptation of anything ever! Thats the movie. To sum up the experience: If you have watched the show you will be furious of the complete missing of the point with the series. Everything sucked, they drained all the fun out of it and didn't bother making anything actually better or different. It was worse in every single aspect. If you haven't watched the show you will be confused and probably not get what the hell is going on. Nothing is explained really, it just happens and you are supposed to get it from the start. If you haven't watched the show it is just... Nonsense. There is a reason it was an animated show and not an animated movie, the whole point of it was the traveling and the fact that each and everyone of their adventures had about as much value. I would never hire the people behind this movie, it just suck. When I watched this movie I was like empty for a whole week. No kidding I was seriously thinking, what the hell was that? Then I got angry because this actually hurt the brand of Aavatar, which is one of the best animated shows I have ever seen, maybe even the best. The director should be sent to GULAG and all people involved should have to swear an oath on never doing films and movies again. Seriously thou, this is not okay. I am insulted and so should you.

1549,danakay68,Why so serious? Let down.,4,1 July 2010,"Just got home from seeing it with two 9Yos. I've been looking forward to this for about 2 years now, huge fan of the series. I was a tough customer to disappoint in that I didn't care what race the actors were (really, I wasn't expecting any kind of ""accuracy"" to an imaginary cartoon world) and I was totally open to however the story would be handled. I just wanted to see my beloved characters in live action.The costumes, scenery, effects, music were GREAT. It was fun to see this in live action, everything looked and felt right to me. The bending looked fantastic; Appa and Momo were great.Despite having EVERYTHING to work with, MKS blew it: big let down. The source material was moron-proof--how could you mess it up? Characters and Dialogue. The characters were totally flat, I don't think Aang cracked a smile the whole time, no fun (and no air scooter). Jackson Rathbone as Sokka seemed to be playing the same character as his vampire in Twilight (don't know who's to blame for that). No fun ""buddy"" relationship between the kids. The relationship between Iroh and Zuko was not clear. All he had to do was bring the series to life. That's it. He didn't have to attempt a serious epic here. Flop.I don't know who would love this flick. It's a kid's story, but I wouldn't take a kid younger than 7 to see it, too dry and intense. It's not strong enough as an epic to draw in adults. Without the humor, it doesn't have a clear niche. I am curious to see how a non-series fan would view this flick. See it at matinée price and Save your money on the 3-D, pretty underwhelming. The 9YOs went home to watch the series on DVD and are now laughing their goofy little heads off.

1550,brkam,A disgrace to an amazing series,1,30 May 2020,"When I first heard that nickelodeon was going to release a movie based on the Avatar series, I was beyond excited and thought, what could go wrong? However, when I found out that M. Night Shyamalan was writing and directing this movie by himself, I became skeptical due to his inconsistency with past movies he has directed. As it turns out, I was right, because this film is appalling and truly an insult to the original cartoon.It is clear that Shyamalan wanted to make changes to the movie because his directing style usually involves twists and turns. However, the changes made in this movie were downright unnecessary and took away from the movie's overall connection to the series. First off, they pronounce many of the characters' names wrong in the movie, which just felt unnatural and pointless. This is only the least of the many problems with this film, however. Another huge problem was the acting and writing. It seems as if Shyamalan took the worst actors he could find, directed them to deliver their lines in the cringiest way possible, and gave them lines that a 5 year old could have written. Sokka being the prime example, as he was gloomy and bland, delivering no clever lines, as opposed to sarcastically charming in the show.Perhaps the biggest problem with this film is that there is no depth and emotion, which was what made the show so great in the first place. Throughout the entire movie, there are instances that set up what could be an emotional scene, like when Princess Yue sacrifices her life to save the moon spirit, or when Aang visits the air temple and sees all his past relatives. However, these moments just result in more explaining of the story with no charm or emotion to be found.Finally, the special effects were atrocious. For a high budget movie involving bending of the elements of Earth, it should be guaranteed that it has top tier special effects. But that is not the case. The special effects are very lazily done to the point where the water doesn't even look remotely real. The worst part however, is the Earth bending. The cartoon showcased how powerful Earth benders can be, moving large quantities of rock in an epic fashion. However, there is a scene in the movie where 6 Earth benders attack by throwing one, yes ONE rock.This movie is a huge disappointment and it's a shame that this is the last that fans of the series received when a season 4 could've been made.",The Last Airbender
1551,bobby_joe222,This. Movie. Was. Bad,2,19 September 2010,"After watching the cartoon multiple times I was looking forward to this movie. After seeing previews I started to think it looked like a pretty good movie. I couldn't have been more wrong.About the only thing I did like was some of the special effects for the 4 elements. The script was terrible, (did they even pronounce any of the names right) It was like they never watched an episode of the cartoon before. I feel they dived into the action much too fast and did not build up the characters at the beginning of the film. Many of the little things annoyed me, such as Aang being kidnapped before they knew he was the Avatar. Sokka and Katara just decide to go save some random kid from the Fire nation when they know nothing about him? At least in the cartoon they knew who he was (And how did they make Appa fly without know what to say)Sokka's character seemed like a different person than the cartoon, I don't think I heard him make any sarcastic comments or jokes about meat/food. Aang didn't seem as 'childish' and play around. I know that had to leave things out due to time restrictions but it's the characters personalities that made the cartoon so amazing.Oh and did they even mention the Kyoshi Warriors? I mean they play a pretty important part in the story but I didn't see them mentioned once. The ending was completely different?!?! A giant wave?! Where was the epic monster beating everyone up.Can't say I will be watching this movie again any time soon.",The Last Airbender

Dev Patel's Zuko is one dimensional and never gets any better. It just seems that they were all just fulfilling the contract.The dialog was just terrible and I don't think it needed all the background exposition. I was impressed with the overall look of the film, though. The Fire Nation ships were menacing and the special effects were fair. Scenes of other nations were short and childish, giving no real idea as to their culture except as looking backward as compared to the Fire Nation. Mr. Shyamalan seems to attempt to follow the formula that technology is bad and naturalism is good. A concept the Mr.s Spielberg and Lucas presented in the Return of the Jedi in a much better format. Battle scenes show no blood and few deaths could be seen among the soldiers. Which makes me wonder about what age group this movie is geared toward. Noah Ringer's martial arts moves were exceptionally graceful as was Nicola Peltz's. Everyone else's seemed to just have come from old Shaw Brothers films. The score is magnificent!

The scenes with Zuko are incredibly boring since it was him mostly on a ship. The best parts of the movie I could say were the princess she was absolutely beautiful. The moving water effect could've looked a bit more realistic and nicer. The arrow on Aangs head were like dots and poorly done.

1560,Citoyen,"Bad as an adaptation, bad as a film",1,1 July 2010,"Shyamalan takes a stunningly sophisticated cartoon and reduces it to one of the most insultingly dumb films I've seen in years. From the script to the visuals, the directing, the acting, there is absolutely nothing that did well, either as an adaptation or as a film in its own right.Characters who were once powerful and spitfire (Katara) or entertainingly sarcastic (Sokka) are now bland and exist solely for the purpose of exposition. In fact, the entire film comes off as exposition, far too much of the dialog serving as ""by the way"" explanations, never allowing the plot or characters to really take form. The scenes seem episodic and unconnected, and the film never comfortably establishes its universe, always retreading with an ""as you know"" or ""aren't you that guy who..."" to establish (often unnecessary) continuity.The style, too, is disappointing, capturing none of the magic of the series. Most noticeable was the ""bending""--while the series took its martial arts seriously, carefully aligning real-world arts with elements and making the benders' movements coincide with those of their elements, the film gives us characters flailing in generic martial arts forms for a few minutes, only to effect one splash, boulder, or blast of fire. In the series, every movement had a meaning; in the film, only about one in ten does.Many fans of the series who were angry at the ""whitewashing"" of the cast hoped that it had at least resulted in the best actors for the parts. However, the acting was at best uninspired, and at worst painfully awkward, though part of this can be attributed to a truly atrocious script. Dialog is stilted and unnatural, certain phrases are repeated needlessly throughout (""great library,"" anyone?), and in all the only chance the script stands of being remembered is through memetic appreciation of its unintentional, awkward hilarity.Not even the collective will of a devoted fanbase wanting so much for this film to be good could make it even remotely watchable.",The Last Airbender

The movie has no character development and the story jumps from one part to another. If you don't know the series then you won't understand the movie completely.

1564,AndrewMcDoge,Awwwwwwww Geez,2,8 July 2017,"Long ago, M. Night Shyamalan films and I lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the film known The Village attacked. Only the script to Unbreakable 2, sequel to his last really good film, can stop his flurry of bad movies, but when his career needed it the most, it was put on hold until 2016. A couple years- no. I'm done. If you wanted a clever snark, you shouldn't have bastardized one of my favorite show growing up and to this day. Like even as the dumb kid i was back in 2010, i knew this film was garbage. Only after multiple watches can i look at more of the flaws that the film presents, which by the way, it presents a lot of problems. This film, while not the worst film by M Night, is one of the worst films i have ever had the displeasure to experience. Not to watch, to experience. Even if i wasn't a fan of the source material, this would still be a terrible movie. Like it boggles my mind on how this was acceptable, and oh my i haven't even started yet. Yeah, i haven't even gotten to my problems with this film.One of the biggest problems with this film is the way this film looks and feels. Right off the bat, the CGI is terrible. Fake looking environments and special effects are in your face. Effects for the creatures in this film make it look like it was a 3-D rendition of the 2-D variant from the show. The bending sequences are the worst part of this movie. Which is kinda a big problem in a film about bending elements. Ugh.The acting is a problem as well. The acting is laughable. Like i can laugh at how bad it is. When characters try to act serious I'm cracking up on how they delivery the lines. Yet when the actors try to say a comedic line, I'm dead silent. Yet the delivery of lines isn't the only thing that mad me unintentionally laugh. The term ""Fight Choreography"" is a term used to act out scenes with combat with them. They really meant the choreography part of the term. Notably when the characters are using bending, it looks like these people are about to breakout into a dance number. They do these combinations, these overdone moves, just to move a small amount of fire. There is a scene in the film where a group of people are in sync and aggressively move, just to only move a small rock. This is the only redeeming quality. This film falls so flat on its face that it's actually kinda funny. It even has such small details that they do wrong. They even mess up the opening narration. The iconic opening narration. This film is so bad, yet you should check it out. If you can watch this film for free (Borrowing, renting, library), try to make it through this atrocity. All in all, i'm giving this film a 2 out of 10.",The Last Airbender
1565,h_clairvoyant,For people who have never seen the show:,7,19 July 2010,"I had never seen the show before I went to see this movie; I had however read reviews and discussions posted here on IMDb. I went in expecting an absolutely terrible bore, but was pleasantly surprised.My review is unburdened by the high expectations of fans, nor do I care about the pronunciation of names (yea, really...). I went in with a clean slate and came out with a head full of fantastic thoughts spawned by the beautiful world in this movie. It may not be up to par with the cartoon, I don't know, but I do know that what was created here was impressive and thoroughly entertaining.I am a huge fan of digital effects and The Last Airbender did not skimp out at all. The graphics were undeniably noteworthy and entirely pleasing. The fight scenes were exciting and CLEAR (which cannot be said for 95% of films being released nowadays).Although there were lines that were less than impressive, and actors that are as drab as the majority of child stars out there, I feel the script was sufficient. I felt that, though everything was unfamiliar, I understood everything that was going on, nothing felt out of place or unexplained.For those unsure of what to make of the enticing previews for this flick, I say go see it. There are a large handful of fans out there that hated it, probably because it didn't meet their expectations.

1566,dishwasherdood,What can be said that already hasn't,1,29 May 2020,"I avoided this movie like the plague for two reasons.1) loved the animated series and knew the movie was going to be like many movies based on a series. Not as great.2) the trailers just did not interest me enough to get me to change my mind about seeing it.I finally decided to give the movie a chance and in my opinion I was right to avoid this movie. I didn't even finish it before I had stopped it. I have only never finished a movie one other time so doing that was a sign to me to write a review.Now I read many reviews on here and just about everything was said that could be said. The movie isn't even a shadow of what the series is and that would not necessarily be a bad thing if the movie had anything going for it.I understand the difficulties of taking a 20 episode season of a show and trying to adapt that into a 2 hour( in this case 1 hr 40 min) film; however, this movie proves that it is much easier to mess that up than to perfect it. I believe that if Shyamalan's version was done with more passion for the source material it would have stranded a greater chance with fans. It still would be critized by fans but it may have been more in the we know it sucks but it is not garbage spot instead of where it is now.I know i would have preferred if the shows creators had been the ones to write and call the shots we would have gotten a much better end product and even may have gotten the other 2 movies made.I read some reviews that blame Paramount for the movoe being so bad and yes because they wanted to rush and get the movie out we got a way worse version but if you have seen the movie or like me even a fraction of the movie you could tell that Shyamalan's version would have still been bad.Hopefully Netflix does a better job but to be honest the bar is set real low so any new live action avatar series/movie stands a chance",The Last Airbender
1567,psychodiver,Was this a joke ? My daughter is still upset,1,21 September 2017,"Can there be any Spoilers after 7 Years ? I guess til today everyone know what kind of horrible horrible horrible attempt this movie was. And yes, yesterday evening i watched it together with my husband, our daughter and two of our neighbor families. Few days before our daughter finished watching Aangs and Korras series. And was thrilled like hell. Even begged her Dads to order her the continuation of Legend of Korra Turf Wars. Well, she gets it (when finally her room is going to be cleaned).First summary: The kids left the room after approximately 20 minutes (and we all could understand the reason). The magic from the shows was missing, total. I mean it's a story for kids with jokes, powerful characters and a great told story. None, absolutely none can be found it that, what we saw yesterday. Well, maybe one joke was great, but not intentionally. The prison of the earth benders located ON EARTH. We laughed a lot about this scene. And even more when they fought. I mean SIX Bender....for crying out loud...SIX of them and the result is one tiny rock. According to the comic series six would be able to move a small hill. Well, short after that we finished the movie and watched a few of the Korra episodes (even the kids came back). Second and the real summary: This movie has nothing to do with the magic of the two shows from TV. It's a complete waste of money and time. And i was impressed that the creators even got Legend of Korra out, two years after this monumental failure. An hour before i read the rumor the creators didn't take part in creating the movie. Maybe they had some kind of suspicion. Maybe, after 7 years, it's time for a new attempt. Maybe as a new trial for the topic of Aangs story or a movie about Korra (I mean, just take the story about Korra & Amon, a good director AND (!!!!) the show creators and i don't think there might be anything to go wrong.",The Last Airbender

I'm an avid van of the series, and I can only wonder what kind of director is so terrible that he can't manage to pronounce names right. That's understandable with a book, but a TV series? Come on. The characters said their names every episode. Also, I understand you have a lot to cram into an hour and a half, but they left out what was in my opinion one of the most important aspects of the series--Aang's past lives. Roku is nowhere to be found. Would it really have been that much harder to have Roku instead of this mysterious dragon? All the charm of the cartoon series was lost. I tried to watch this movie as someone who didn't know what anything meant, and it was still a terrible movie. The acting was bad, there was no character development. Katara speaks like 10 times during the entire movie, Sokka's not even funny, and it's like Appa isn't even there. The only character that I felt they did almost a decent job on was Iroh. Part of his core character was at least there. It's my stern opinion that M. Night Shalaman needs to get out of the movie industry. This is what, his sixth flop in a row?

1575,jizzyjman,Such a below satisfactory film,1,13 March 2018,"The cartoon this movie is based off of was one of Nickelodeon's most successful cartoons. How the script ever landed in Shymalan's lap is beyond me, but what he did with it is still cringing this day. This movie was flawed from the ground up from the actors portraying them, to the special effects. The man had a complete road map of exactly every detail necessary to make that movie everything fans expected it to be. The main character in the show ""Aang,"" was a kid who was joyful and hopeful even though he literally had the weight of the world on his shoulders.Did Shaymalan even ever once watched the show? Because the actor portraying as Aang was more just the complete opposite of just that. The feeling of depression crept up from a combination of the portrayal of acting and the disappointment of every expectation that was had going down the drain. It was like the film was meant to destroy the shows reputation on purpose by getting 90% of the shows detail wrong. With that being said, fire benders DO NOT need fire to be around an already lit fire to bend it. If it were suppose to be more realistic and not an adaptation of an already made cartoon, then it would be more acceptable. However, its already based on an existing fantasy.
The special effects were D grade at best, what made it worse was that it was also made for 3-D. No need to go any further than that. If someone someone ever recommends this movie to you please admit them to the nearest psych ward.",The Last Airbender

I would say that Noah Ringer does a good Aang impression, and his kung fu is tight. Seychelle Gabriel was good, if a little Lady Gaga, as Yue.Aasif Mandvi? Really? I keep expecting John Stewart to jump out of a corner with a hilarious punny graphic. A skinny uncle Iroh? In the last season, his weight loss in prison is kind of a plot point, no? It isn't that Dev Patel is so bad, it's that he's not... enough of a force of personality. Say what you will about the character, but Zuko is a hormonal, emotional mess, and honestly, a young Emilio Estevez would have pulled off that kind of mania well.I have absolutely nothing nice to say about Nicola Peltz whatsoever in this role. Awful-- painful to watch and to listen to. It makes me nervous for Toph.The worst part, however, is not the botched casting, or the crappy makeup, or even the cheesy, 2nd-rate-looking special effects with that awful retrofitted 3D.The worst part is the directing. Turning this picaresque tale of learning, development, maturing, and making mistakes but persevering, into a typical, hackneyed, wandering-samurai flick of the 1950's guts the core of the story. The point, as I always saw it, was to transcend the focus on the martial arts, and use them as a backdrop to the tensions of personal desire, courage, and responsibility. Instead, Shyamalan dials in stilted acting, a b.s. Golden Harvest cast-off time-line, and being pointlessly bad.My explanation? M. Night Shyamalan hates Avatar: The Last Airbender. Further, he's such a spiteful, mean person, he'd invest the time and effort in making a move so spectacularly, secretly bad, that it would ruin it for the kids who have seen the cartoon, and keep those who have only seen the movie to never want to watch the animation.That's just cold.",The Last Airbender

I was very very wrong. The flaws in this film are so numerous that I alternated between moments of boredom, disappointment, and laughing at the ridiculousness of what I was seeing on screen. First the good stuff.The special effects and ""bending"" is very convincing and well done. The sets, backgrounds, and costuming are also quite impressive. The martial arts aspects of the fight choreography are also very entertaining to watch. Overall,this is a visually impressive film. The score is also quite good. Unfortunately, everything else that makes for a great movie experience is lacking.The film briefly touches on only the most key elements of the series which makes for a very disjointed film. The character development is next to nil and the pacing is jarring at times. Key plot elements are only briefly explained (if at all) and some of it just makes no sense at all, such as why no character's names are pronounced correctly except for Katara, Zuko, and Ozai. What were they thinking??? The acting is also pretty wooden with little emotion expressed throughout except for Dev Patel and Shaun Toub. Noah Ringer is barely passable as Aang. Everyone, and I do mean everyone else in this movie gives very stifled, unemotional, wooden performances. It all feels very forced. The action was decently well choreographed, but I felt that there were far too many slow-mo shots. At least it wasn't a series of quick cuts like so many action films these days.This film left me feeling ripped off and disappointed.

Never have i ever felt so wrong about my initial impression of anything in my life. Needless to say, twice was more than enough. It doesn't respect the serie's world rules, it's bluntly oversimplified to a matter of good vs evil and not even the acting is redeemable. Do yourself a favor and watch the animated masterpiece instead.",The Last Airbender

I will have to say that I watched maybe ten episodes of the TV animation. My three nephews had watched all of the episodes and really enjoyed the movie. One of my nephews stated ""its already over?!"" I sat through the movie watching another nephew sitting on the edge of his seat waiting for the story to unfold. And he watched all the episodes so he should know what is going to happen! I really enjoyed watching him get so involved in the movie. This is probably not an Oscar movie, but the kids deserve to enjoy it without such negativity. I will say we did see it in 2D. I can't compare it to the 3D, but with the reviews everyone says the 3D was not worth it. Why I am giving this movie such a high score is due to the fact that it was an action movie. I knew it when I went to the movie that it was going to be action packed. I was excited to go with my nephews, they held out to see it so that I could go with them. And yes Roger Ebert this is not a Miyazaki movie. I truly loved Howl's Moving Castle and I thought the animation was great. But this movie was about animation turned into live action. The animation series is cheesy for adults and maybe Shyamalan kept that for the kids since it is a Nickelodeon production it was meant for the kids. I understand that adults want to be entertained just as much as kids need to be entertained. This was really enjoyable and can't wait for the next one. And would love to enjoy it with a bunch of kids again.",The Last Airbender
1587,monkeymanallen,Big budget and an original sci-fi story. What's not to like?,8,30 December 2018,"Big budget and an original sci-fi story. What's not to like? I haven't seen the animated series so can't comment if this betrays fans of the series in any way (From the reviews, clearly it does!!). The story is easy enough to follow even for a newcomer, visuals are stunning and despite a few misguided lines in the script, the film is action packed and fun to watch. I would much rather watch a movie like this than anything by Peter Jackson for example (Too much CGI and terrible pacing, eeek). I was genuinely surprised by the negative reviews surrounding The Last Airbender and it's a real shame that any chance of a sequel has probably been smashed because of the nerd backlash. If you're a casual movie goer and not a diehard fan of tge animated series, give it watch, you might be pleasantly surprised.",The Last Airbender
1588,stefan765,Don't believe the haters. It's not that bad!,8,4 July 2010,"Let's not forget that the producers of this movie had to compress 20 episodes of an outstanding cartoon series into 90 minutes of live footage, so of course there is going to be a lot missing! I applaud M. Night for keeping so close to the series for everything that did make it into the movie. I think Book 1 of the series should have been broken into two separate movies, and each movie should have running times of two hours. Compressing 10 episodes into 120 minutes would have served the plot and character development much better. The worst part about the movie is that there is very little humor, which made Aang much less likable. I believe M. Night cast him for his martial arts ability and his uncanny resemblance to the cartoon series Aang; not for his acting ability.",The Last Airbender
1589,charliebfranklin-63025,I actually liked it,7,17 June 2020,"I thought it was a good movie, I liked the cartoons but am not a diehard fan! Sure with hindsight they could have done better but I'm disappointed they never made anymore - just like the Percy Jackson movies, wish they kept on going with them. Same as books 2 and 3 of His Dark Materials. Why start something if you're not going to follow through? Very much like the men in my life 🙄 as for the Chronicles of Narnia, I was actually disappointed by the ending in the book but is frustrating when they don't finish a series of movies. I could quite happily life without anymore Dan Brown movies, the books are absolute drivel.
Anyways feel like I've gone off topic!
To sum up The Last Airbender in my opinion was a good movie but was doomed from the get go due to the cultural following of the cartoon. It was never going to live up to their expectations",The Last Airbender
