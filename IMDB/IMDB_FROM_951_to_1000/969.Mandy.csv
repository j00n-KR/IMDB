0,Leofwine_draca,Juvenile,3,4 January 2020,"MANDY is a rock 'n' roll horror flick that also so happens to be a slice of juvenile nonsense. I was once into this kind of silly stuff, especially when it came from the 1980s, but it leaves me increasingly cold and wishing for proper scripting and story development. Instead, this film offers pretty colours and visuals, some shocking scenes of carnage, and lots of gore. On the downside, it has a weak story stretched out to breaking point; a lack of narrative cohesion so that it feels more like a series of set-pieces strung together; and the collected talents of Cage, Linus Roache, Richard Brake, etc. wasted on a sophomoric script. I rate the whole thing a waste of time.",Mandy
1,SnoopyStyle,uniquely Panos,7,21 September 2018,"It's 1983. Red Miller (Nicolas Cage) and his beloved Mandy Bloom live in a remote house in the woods. She's generally a recluse due to a facial disfigurement. They are taken prisoner by a cult led by Jeremiah Sand. When she laughs at his naked body, they burn her alive. Red manages to survive and seeks bloody revenge.The start is generally slow artistry. Anyone familiar with Panos Cosmatos would know his style. It's visual, it's experimental, and it's usually slow. The tension is ratcheted up after the couple is taken by the cult. I like the psychedelics and I love her laughter. The revenge second half is fine but lacks intensity. It's a series of stylized face-offs. There is no investigating or searching. There is a metal pouring of a ridiculous axe. It's all very nightmarish and over-the-top. It's fascinating and unique. It's very much Panos.",Mandy
2,nogodnomasters,I didn't know they were in season.,7,13 October 2018,"At the bottom of it all, this is a murder-revenge film....on acid. No literally, everyone in the film has taken face-melting acid. Jerimiah (Linus Roache ) is a cult leader of ""Children of the Dawn"" who desires lumberjack Red Miller's partner Mandy Bloom (Andrea Riseborough). Mandy has a plain unadorned yet haunting look. Red (Nicolas Cage) goes Bronson all over them. The movie takes place on The Shadow Mountain in 1983 near Crystal Lake. The film takes a good hour to develop with a lot of slow scenes that were weak at building character. Afterward, the production takes off in cultish grindhouse fashion with lots of blood and the Horn of Abraxas. Not to give too much away, but there is a rather awkward chainsaw battle not as good as the one in ""Motel Hell"" but what can top a man wearing a Hog's head? Guide: F-word. Sex on TV. Male and cartoon nudity.",Mandy
3,kosmasp,Color me --- Dead,8,29 January 2019,"Nicolas Cage is very well known for going all out. There are memes out there depicting this. And you would be excused for thinking he is like that in real life. But if you watch his interviews you realize he is different. Soft spoken and so different from what he portrays. Seems like he gets it out of his system, when he plays those characters.But back to the movie, that will split people and their perception of it (someone wrote a review saying that you'll either love it or hate - half the people agree and ... well you get the point). The coloring is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing too. And the movie is ultra violent and quite vivid when it comes to the depiction of it. Not for the squeamish then ... And quite crazy overall",Mandy
4,Tweekums,A brilliantly bonkers trippy revenge horror,9,8 April 2019,"Red Miller and his girlfriend Mandy Bloom have a peaceful life in America's Pacific Northwest until a strange cult arrives in the area. Mandy catches the eye of the cults Mansonesque leader, Jeremiah, and he has her and Red kidnapped by the Black Skulls; a biker gang on acid with a penchant for human blood! Needless to say bad things happen. Red is left by their tormentors and the next day he sets off on his personal mission of revenge. This will involve a crossbow, battle axe and a chainsaw fight before he ultimately faces Jeremiah again.This is a distinctly strange film but very effective. Once the bad things start to happen the violence is intense and quite disturbing. As Red sought his revenge many things that happened I couldn't help thinking of the quote from Friedrich Nietzsche 'He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster'... Red certainly does some monstrous things. There is something very surreal about what is happening; almost as if it were meant to be viewed as a nightmare or a bad hallucination rather than real events. Nicolas Cage is on top form as Red; his performance is more than a little crazed but that is what the role demanded. Andrea Riseborough and Linus Roache also impress as Mandy and Jeremiah. This clearly won't be for everybody but I'd recommend it to horror fans who enjoy the weird as well as the gory.",Mandy
5,BA_Harrison,Arthouse horror with chainsaws.,3,20 September 2018,"I'm going to lay my cards on the table: I love revenge movies, the bloodier the better; I believe that Nic Cage can make most films watchable (notable exception: Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance); but I generally loathe arthouse movies.As I suspected, I enjoyed the revenge aspect of Mandy, and Cage delivered the craziness, but director Panos Cosmatos's arthouse approach seriously ruined what might have otherwise been a very enjoyable movie.Cosmatos really lays it on thick, his trippy visuals, slow as molasses storytelling and languorous performances making the first hour a total bore. Things pick up a tad once Cage gets wild-eyed and reminds us of why we love him so much, but there is still the pretentious aesthetic to contend with, everything in this film swathed in bright red light, with the occasional totally incomprehensible moment to draw one out of the film (those crappy animated sequences being the worst).With cenobite-style bikers on acid, a bizarre cult, and Cage wielding a variety of weapons (including an outlandish home-made axe, a crossbow and a chainsaw), Mandy should have been a bonkers blood-drenched blast, but instead we get a film that only occasionally satisfies.Watch if you enjoyed the likes of Under the Skin, Annihilation, The Witch or Only God Forgives, but if, like me, you find that style of film-making annoying, avoid this one like the plague.",Mandy
6,paul_haakonsen,Stay away from this one...,2,4 October 2019,"I finally got around to watching the 2018 movie ""Mandy"" from director Panos Cosmatos, and I had been hearing lots of good things about it.Imagine my disappointment when I managed to endure 44 minutes of the abysmal ordeal that is known as ""Mandy"". This movie was an artsy heap of stinking rubbish. The storyline made no sense and it was just downright idiotic and boring. And the constant red and purple lighting to the movie made it annoying.Plus I can't really say that I found anything of any interest in the characters in the movie, despite the fact that the movie had Richard Brake on the cast list.""Mandy"" is a movie that I will never be returning to finish watching. I was tempted to turn it off 25 minutes into the ordeal, but decided to keep with it, because of all the nice things I had heard. But no such things came to fruition and the movie was so far from what I had been lead to believe it to be.This was a massive swing and a miss of a movie in terms of me liking it, and it was in fact one of the most boring movies that I have had the misfortune of suffering through - well, partially through, as I called it quits 44 minutes into the downward spiral.No. Just no.""Mandy"" scores a low two out of ten stars from me.",Mandy
7,BandSAboutMovies,Everything I want in a movie,10,14 September 2018,"""It didn't make any sense. They were bikers and gnarly psychos and...crazy evil."" That's a line from one of Nicholas Cage's many breakdowns in Mandy and there's no better line to describe this to those not ready to behold its majesty.This movie is pure heavy metal. Not the pablum that passes for metal today, trying in vain to frighten old people inside dying malls from shiny black plastic fake Hot Topic environs, but the kind of metal that envelopes you within its darkness. From the opening strains of King Crimson's ""Starless"" to the slow, druggy doom drone that each scene in the first hour or so makes you feel to the actual bravura moment that the title of the film appears 75 minutes into the picture and transforms into a black metal spiral of roots and trees and black infinity, this isn't a movie influenced by metal or referencing it. It has become pure heavy metal. This is a t-shirt with holes in it that the kid in the back of the class wears. This is staring at the details on the cover painting of ""Somewhere in Time."" This is slowly losing your mind as you stare at a blacklight poster and that thudding slow bass and wait for the riff to slow down enough for the screaming to begin.Let's get one thing straight: Nicholas Cage is the only person who could be in this movie. One of my friends has often scoffed that no actor has squandered their promise more than Cage, following his Best Actor Oscar win for Leaving Las Vegas with Face/Off. I disagree. This is the actor who has referred to himself as the ""California Klaus Kinski."" Someone who has inspired impressions that refer to the Cage Rage. No one else could bring such a feral intensity to films that probably don't deserve it. I would argue that true art is the kind found in the gutter; if that is true, then Cage has imbued films like Con Air with a heart and bloody soul that a lesser actor would just see as dollar signs.At heart, Mandy is a simple story. In 1983, logger Red Miller (Cage) has settled into a quiet life in the woods with his soulmate, an artist named Mandy (Andrea Riseborough, Birdman). A gang of ""homicidal Jesus freaks"" kidnaps her when their leader, Jeremiah (Linus Roache, Thomas Wayne from Nolan's Batman Begins), falls for her. When she rebuffs his advances and has the gall to laugh at his music, the gang unleashes its fury by torturing Red and setting his love ablaze.As her ashes fall through his fingers, we're treated to Cage doing what he does best -- pure raw emotion, screaming and sobbing as he washes blood and pain away with a bottle of vodka, shrieking in a 70's style bathroom clad only on tighty whities and a t-shirt with a tiger's face on it. If you watched this scene and any other actor attempted to essay it, it would derail the film, forcing it into parody or low pathos. But this is Nicholas Cage, an actor who you can't avoid or look away from. You are forced to see Red's pain as he marshalls his energies and begins to rebuild.Oh -- did I mention that the gang isn't all human and that there are demon bikers among their number? Or that Cage responds by grabbing a crossbow and hammering boiling hot metal into a gigantic scythe?Beyond metal, Mandy also draws inspiration from the artwork you'd shouting at you from 1970's science fiction and horror paperbacks, with title cards torn directly from those pulpy pageturners.This is the kind of work that only emerges when an artist has pure control of his vision. Here, that artist is Panos Cosmatos, who bestowed on us the truly touched film Beyond the Black Rainbow. The inherent promise of that film is realized here. Forget pundits blabbing about how horror must be elevated so that the stigma of the genre title doesn't impact art. This is a movie that recognizes that the only difference between the arthouse and the grindhouse is the neighborhood your film plays in.I always wonder if films can still surprise me after all of the craziness that I've witnessed. I'm happy to report that Mandy has shown me -- in one scene -- that I am not jaded. Not yet. Have you ever seen a movie where the hero comes upon one of the villains doing coke and watching scummy looking 1970's porn, only to attack said hero with a demonic sword phallus? And what if the hero slices open the villain and laughs like a lunatic while blood sprays all over his face and in his mouth? And then that hero decides to do some of that leftover coke? Until you see this one, you haven't seen anything yet.Beyond Cage, there are also great performances here from Richard Brake (the only good part of Rob Zombie's 31) as The Chemist whose drugs have set the Children of the New Dawn cult on a path they may never walk away from; Bill Duke (Predator) in a brief role as Caruthers; and the aforementioned Riseborough and Roache. And the music by the late Jóhann Jóhannsson (who scored Prisoners and mother!) is a drone masterpiece, echoing the sounds of bands like Sleep.I have so many questions. In the end, does Red become Kali, the destroyer of worlds, as he hacks off head after head in his quest for vengeance? Part of me thinks this is true, with his distorted voice saying lines like, ""I'm your god now."" How amazing is that shot of Cage's face while his truck speeds through the night his face awash in blood, dreaming of his dead love with big eyes and a maniacal look on his face? And how frightening is that scene of Ronald Regan's disembodied voice on the radio, reminding us of the uncertainty and terror that 1983 had, the year that both this film and Beyond the Black Rainbow share? How rad is the artwork that Boris Vallejo's collaborator and wife Julie Bell created for the film?Honestly, this is the best movie I've seen all year. It may be the best movie I'll see for a couple of years. It's as if I asked Cosmatos to include everything that I want to see in one film: demon bikers, chainsaw battles, animated sequences that echo Heavy Metal, commercial parodies where goblins vomit cereal, tigers roaring against a dayglo night sky and geysers of gore. And after all that noise, the credits roll to total silence. I often remark that certain movies are better with various substances. Mandy needs no other stimulants. It is a powerful and transformative hallucinogen all its own.",Mandy
8,Coventry,"I never realized how psycho you made me, oh Mandy.",6,1 November 2018,"Five days after watching ""Mandy"" at a charming little genre festival in my home country, I only established one thing so far: that it's a damn difficult movie to review! Admittedly I also didn't watch ""Mandy"" the way it is 'supposed to' be watched. All I ever read about this film is how it's an experimental, abstract, trippy and even artistic masterwork, but yours truly simply and desperately wanted to see a straightforward and outrageously violent revenge flick with a completely derailed Nicolas Cage in one of the best roles of his career.And thus, I did! Throughout the entire second half, ""Mandy"" is a fantastically absurd, blood-soaked, blackly comical and bizarrely intense horror delight, and that's what I primarily want to remember! This means, of course, that I found the first hour often tedious (with incomprehensibly muttered lines by Andrea Riseborough), pretentious (most notably the animated sequences) and surreal just for the sake of being surreal. Quite frankly, I didn't understand one iota about where those Cenobite bikers came from or what was the significance of that Seraph with his tiger. What I did understand, and loved, was that Cage's manly and robust lumberjack character goes bonkers when a clique of Jesus freaks kidnap and kill his beloved muse Mandy, so he manufactures himself a giant shiny axe and heads out for a massacre! The violence is masterfully choreographed and delightfully explicit, Cage unleashes his acting demons for 200% and the Jóhannsson soundtrack is truly unique.",Mandy
9,michaelRokeefe,How revenge relates to Hell,8,8 December 2018,"Living in rural Pacific Northwest, Red Miller (Nicolas Cage) is leading a loving and peaceful life with his girlfriend Mandy Bloom (Andrea Riseborough), when a blissful existence is savagely destroyed, when a sadistic cult leader Jeremiah Sand (Linus Roache) has Mandy kidnapped. Red's devotion sends him on a relentless and unstoppable quest to exact bloody revenge. Cage pulls out all the stops and turns in one of his greatest performances in a very long time.

10,searchanddestroy-1,Among Nicolas Cage best performances....,8,15 April 2020,"Yes this film confirms what I have always said. Nicolas Cage is a very good, and gifted actor, one among the best of his generation, but unfortunately with big, major money issues, debts or alimony...So that put s him in a position where he has to work, work, all year long, five movies per year, anything but work, work, work, to feed his bank account, no matter the quality...;Such a shame; He can not afford to choose the best part for him....But YES, YES, YEs he is a wonderful actor. This film proves it. rememeber him in PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED, LEAVING LAS VEGAS, where he was outstanding in a role very close to Ray Milland in LOST WEEK END, JOE....What a shame for such a waste of talent.",Mandy
11,grantss,Much worse than expected and I set my expectations very low,1,2 January 2020,"Red is a lumberjack and lives with Mandy in an isolated cabin. Their peaceful existence is shattered by the appearance of an insane cult leader, his followers and a supernatural creature. When they kidnap Mandy, Red goes on the warpath.I had low expectations for this, figuring it would be largely a common-or-garden horror movie. However, some aspects of the plot intrigued me and, at the very least, it would be a fun watch.Unfortunately, this was even worse than I expected. Writer-director Panos Cosmatos delivers a movie that is pretentious and pointless in the extreme. Drawn-out scenes filled with empty dialogue, imagery that just serves to make the film look arty, religious/supernatural themes that go nowhere - the movie couldn't be more pretentious and dull.It's not even fun: the entire film is shot in very dark light (another attempt by Cosmatos to make the film appear arty), so you can hardly see what is going on most of the time. The action scenes are quite basic and clichéd too.Watching this is a massive waste of time. Avoid like the plague.",Mandy
12,george.schmidt,Nic Cage Goes To Hell,9,20 September 2018,"MANDY (2018) ***1/2 Nicolas Cage, Andrea Riseborough, Linus Roache, Ned Dennehy, Olwen Fouere, Richard Brake, Bill Duke, Line Pillet, Clement Baronnet, Alexis Julemont, Stephan Fraser. ""Nicolas Cage Goes To Hell"" easily could have been the pitch for this outré and out-there vengeance horror freakshow with Cage as a logger in a middle-of-nowhere pacific northwest forest who faces the ultimate evil when a cult led by Roache (in a truly out-there turn) that kidnaps and ultimately murder his wife, leading him into a journey thru Hell (practically literally). Demon bikers (echoing the cenobites of HELLARISER), a crimson toned production design and look beautifully comprised by Hubert Pouille and cinematographer Benjamin Loeb bring an eerie, doomed and ultimately dark look to a truly uncompromising vision cooked up by filmmaker Panos Cosmatos and Aaron Stewart-Ahn with a barely reigned in gonzo turn by its star (does anyone do anguished rage like Cage? No; Thank Christ!) and has to be seen to be believed.",Mandy
13,evanston_dad,Aggressively Weird,3,25 September 2018,"The audience I saw ""Mandy"" with clearly came with the expectation that they would be whooping it up over a future cult classic, and that whether it was genuinely good or entertainingly bad didn't much matter as long as they got to see Nicolas Cage go whackadoodle. When it became quickly clear that the film was going to be a slow, ponderous slog, you could feel the anticipation deflating like a pricked balloon, and the audience only came alive a few times later in the film, all of them involving someone getting brutally killed.I generally avoid revenge movies, because they peddle in the basest instincts of mankind and appeal to the more juvenile demographic of movie audiences. Case in point -- some bozo sitting behind me in the theater thought it was his duty to keep us all entertained with his running commentary, so threw out all sorts of verbal editorials every time someone got an axe or arrow to the head 
or some other body part, or tried to make us all share his wonder at the film's aggressive weirdness. Because director Panos Cosmatos clearly wants us to be stunned by the weirdness of ""Mandy,"" which some audience members were, if the young man in the lobby afterwards who I heard say he's been thinking about this movie for the last two weeks (bless his heart) is any indication. But here's the thing....I've seen a LOT of movies in my time, a lot of them very weird, and weird in service of a higher purpose can be wonderful, but it isn't really sustainable as an aesthetic of its own, because it's so subjective. One person's weird can be very boring to someone else.The few moments where ""Mandy"" comes alive, I was pretty disgusted by why the audience was into it, but I mostly welcomed them because they were a break from the otherwise monotonous drone of the film. There are a handful of funny moments; I'm not sure whether intentionally funny or not, and I don't much care. All I know is that the film needed more of them. Instead, Cosmatos treats literally every shot as if it's dripping with portent. Good directors know that not every shot needs to be memorable. Sometimes you need shots and scenes that move the plot along or shuttle a character from point A to point B. Instead, this movie just trudges to a droning metal rock score and asks us to bask in its brilliance without doing anything to earn the title.Message to that dude in the theater: If you see ""Mandy"" and you're still thinking about it two weeks later, you need to see more movies. Grade: D",Mandy
14,bombersflyup,You're all seriously messed up.,1,5 February 2019,"Mandy is a ridiculous and foul film, offering absolutely nothing.Anybody who could like this film's a sicko. Nicholas Cage you're better than this, jeez.",Mandy
15,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Pretty overrated but still enjoyable enough,6,10 November 2018,"Living in a remote mountain cabin, a logger finds that his girlfriend has become targeted by a sadistic cult leader who summons a horde of demonic bikers to take her back to him, forcing a long, bloodthirsty trail back to the cult leader's hideout in a crazed attempt to get her back alive.This one ended up being a big disappointment even with some enjoyable elements. Those are mostly centered around the film's final half, where it turns itself into a full-on gore-soaked grindhouse style effort. This turns into a series of exciting, non-stop action scenes as he takes out the group one-by-one with a series of devastating tactics, including the crossbow out in the woods, the series of hand-to-hand brawls with the bikers in their lair or the absolutely thrilling chainsaw duel with the cult-member which offers up a reasonably graphic and over-the-top resolution. That carries over into the rest of the scenes of him disrupting and chasing the cult down for what happened to his girlfriend where it focuses on his over-the-top resolutions to the situation as the crazed psychedelic style featured throughout here makes it look even more psychotic tone. This is far more impressive than expected and goes for the jugular due to the effectively graphic work throughout for the kills. As some might appreciate the stylistic arthouse approach here, these are what hold it back over its flaws. A lot of what undermines this one is due to the excessive, overlong length. There's no reason for this one to last as long as it does, with the running time approaching two hours before the credits barely drag it over that mark which is completely unnecessary for this type of story. The early scenes of them waxing poetic on the dreams she was having, the bland dialog scenes that have no life or energy behind them or scenes that don't need to be there which are so detrimental in keeping this one from getting any kind of momentum going forward. The film takes forever to get going due to these scenes and it's not all that interesting to see how the cult's interest in her takes form as it's really not that clear why they would care about her based on the one lone interaction they have with her in the store. Likewise, the film's excessively stylized look and tone is an absolute disgrace to sit through, not only undermining the effects to see what's going on in the scene at the time but doing so simply because it could where it shoots scenes like her fantasies sparked by reading the novel, the neon-lit cult hovel or the distorted wave-effects accompanying psychedelic music in the background of the scene for no real reason other than it could while none of the animated interludes do anything other than simply disrupt the pacing. This is all highly distracting, disorienting in the worst way possible and utterly brings this down so much that it's one of the biggest detrimental factors of the film. The other big detrimental factor here is the lack of information given about the cult, which is central to the film's storyline. We know nothing about what they are, what they're after or why they chose her which really just makes this seem like an errant stream of gore-gags for the most part. There's so little about how they're able to summon the bikers, what they're for or anything remotely resembling an explanation for them which really leaves the film feeling empty. Overall, these here are what really drags this one down.Rated Unrated/R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Full Male Nudity and drug use.",Mandy
16,trashgang,strange movie,7,8 February 2019,"Nicolas Cage, so much is said about him, from a blockbuster actor towards the downfall into weird horrors. Do I mind, no because it's a typical Cage that we have here. But a weird one.It's is extremely slow with a lot of slo-mo which doesn't add towards the viewing of this flick. To make it more surrealistic, the colors used are almost red and lights used are fading in and out so over all it's a dark flick.Is it all that bad, yes and no, because clocking in around 2 hours makes it a hard one to watch. First hour is blah blah and some action, second part is the revenge part. It's there that Cage becomes notable. His eyes, his face, covered in blood makes it a must see for his fans. It's bloody in some parts, but not gory at all. The characters he come across are human, sickies and some weird people with masks.Horror, in some parts yes, arty, in some parts yes. So not for everyone but geeks out there knowing Cage from his latest flicks do know what to expect.

17,Mr-Fusion,A uniquely haunting nightmare,7,23 May 2019,"I was sold on ""Mandy"" on word-of-mouth alone, but still unprepared for what lay before me; a hellish trip into abject madness by way of a tender love story.Nicolas Cage and Andrea Riseborough live as one in the wilderness, evil visits upon them for senseless reasons, and devastating loss ensues. After that, it's all about revenge.And it's here that the movie fires on all cylinders, putting Cage's overacting to refreshing use as a man who's lost it all and prepares for war. I'm trying not to spoil anything here, but there's a particular scene in Cage's bathroom that encapsulates the entire movie. And it's nothing but screaming. Jesus, what a scene.That one-sheet image gives you an idea of what you're in for (especially when you see Cage's blood-caked face and know that there's a chainsaw fight involved). But the end result still threw me for a loop. The first 75 minutes are tranquil, meditative; that droning score is the only hint of coming violence. And then the movie shifts gears entirely and you're in for a nightmare. Kinda like Mad Max forges a mighty axe and wreaks vengeance as the ambient noise drones on. It's a torturous fever dream and I can't think of anything else like it.",Mandy
18,christopher-underwood,a film for kids,4,8 November 2018,"This, surely is a film for kids. It seems to be a retro reinvention of those poorly filmed and badly copied videos that burst upon an unsuspecting populous in the eighties. This is for those who lament the passing of those days and more importantly is for those who were too young to indulge at the time. Youngsters, probably not unlike those cruelly depicted in the film itself. The film has been created to look awful, with bleary images and lens reflections, and contrived to depict such scenes as is believed was the mainstay in those far off days. Violence for laughs is the order of the day (sex, perhaps not surprisingly, given the times, sidelined) and the movie seems made for those who relish a late night screening of unspeakable horrors throughout which they can laugh like drains.",Mandy
19,FeastMode,my notes,1,27 July 2019,"I don't understand anything about this movie. no idea what it's about or what anything means. excruciatingly boring with 10-15 minute scenes with no dialogue or story points. i couldn't finish it, but i did on super fast speed, sometimes as much as 7.0x and i could still see what was happening. all style and no substance. this movie could have been 12 minutes long but they decided to go with 2 hours. the only positive about this movie is that some of the scenes look nice with cool color tones. having said that, this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life (1 viewing)",Mandy
20,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Style over substance.,6,6 January 2019,"'Mandy (2018)' certainly is an experience. It's a slow-motion, hallucinatory fever-dream built upon unique, eye-catching visuals and impressively inventive formalistic filmmaking. Its story, however, is simple, to say the least. This is by design, yet it lacks the drive and depth required for a 'simple story' of its kind to really have an impact. It just takes ages to get going - I mean, what is, by all rights, the inciting incident occurs around an hour into the piece (followed by what's essentially the title-card, seventy-five minutes in). Even when it does kick into gear and become the movie it is, for all intents and purposes, advertised (and was conceived) as, it sticks to the same lax, surrealist, visual-favouring pacing as before, except this time it centres around a wild-eyed, 'Nic Cage'-esque Nic Cage performance and includes several distinct, almost vignette-like moments of grisly, gut-spilling gore. Cage himself is, in essence, largely absent from the first half of the film, which makes his sudden transformation into protagonist seem jarring and unearned. Plus, his zany take on the character doesn't really suit what we've seen before and feels strange considering that he acts this way even before he tastes the drug concoction that kicks him into full-on, homicidally crazy mode. The two-half feel is probably what hurts the overall experience the most but it isn't necessarily detrimental to its overall effect. It works more as a 'treat for the senses' than as a traditional narrative; as such, it's difficult to ever be bored. There are also some really inventive, free-flowing visuals and a couple of well choreographed fight sequences. Still, the movie is never all that compelling and a few strange choices do take you out of the experience. Everything just takes so long and is, ultimately, quite unfulfilling. When someone promises you Nic Cage delivering 'heavy metal vengeance', this isn't necessarily what jumps to mind. I guess it's up to you if that's a good thing. 6/10",Mandy
21,bowmanblue,Atmosphere over story,7,27 December 2018,"I'm a huge Nicolas Cage fan and with every one of his new movies (of which he seems to be releasing about four per year) I always hope that this will be the one which re-launches his career and puts him back on the 'A-list' where, in my opinion, he truly belongs (he did win a 'Best Actor' Oscar, remember that?!). However, most of his output goes straight to DVD (or popular online streaming service, which is beginning to feel like the same thing these days), so my hopes were high when I heard that 'Mandy' had received a standing ovation at its initial screening and even got a theatrical release in America.Now I've watched it I'm trying to work out whether I liked it or not. It's not the most inspired story... a couple (Cage as 'Red Miller' and Andrea Riseborough as his girlfriend 'Mandy') stay in a cabin in the woods that must be only a few dirt-tracks along from the one Bruce Campbell did in the 'Evil Dead' franchise and, like Ash, fall foul to the locals. In this case a cult of humans who want to bring about demons, or something. Anyway, it quickly turns into a 'revenge tale' where Cage has to go nuts (or 'the full Cage' as many of his fans like to refer to his performance as) and snuff out all those who've wronged our (initially) hapless heroes.So, nothing we haven't seen a hundred times before in terms of story. However, what it lacks in originality, it more than makes up for in 'visual flare.' Each shot is perfectly crafted to maximise the atmosphere and add to the horror through simply (and seemingly forgotten in these CGI times we live in) by lighting, set design and simple colour palettes. The director obviously hasn't got much of a budget to work with (I hear Cage can be hired for roughly the price of a Big Mac and fries) and so utilises every camera trick in the book to create a weird, neon-lit eighties vibe which puts the film almost more in the 'art house' category.I felt that the human villains were pretty nondescript, however the creatures they conjure up were akin to something out of 'Hellraiser.' Again, the budget obviously didn't allow huge monsters with tentacles, but the lighting and the fact that these things are actually quite hard to see at times, means we have to take our best guess as to what they look like - and they look pretty hideous. Again, showing that CGI isn't required to create horrific monsters.During the first half of the movie, I suddenly realised that I was watching a Nicolas Cage film which basically didn't have him in it. Seriously, he's hardly in the first 45 minutes. Thankfully, when he does come into it (properly), he does what he does best - go absolutely mental while covered in blood (again, Bruce Campbell could probably have done much of this!) while wielding various instruments of death. However, for all the film's prettiness, it doesn't really hide the lack of story. It's quite long for a 'slasher/horror/revenge' film, weighing in at nearly two hours. As visually epic as the film is to look at, you have over an hour where Nicolas Cage just walks up to one baddie. Kills him. Rinse and repeat.Overall, I'm glad I watched 'Mandy.' Cage is great (if you like his terms of bonkers acting). It was truly awesome to watch what could be done with simple camera techniques (think what David Lynch does, but more eighties-looking) and it certainly makes a change from watching a superhero flying around New York hitting armies of computer-generated villains. However, I just think the story could have been a little bit deeper (or edit a bit out of what there was) to make it tighter and generally less repetitive. Nevertheless, full credit to the director who was the true star of the show. I hope to see more of Panos Cosmatos' work in the future and would love to see his visual style applied to a more polished script.",Mandy
22,851222,You will either love it or hate it,5,12 March 2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.There are moments of brilliance in ""Mandy"" (2018). To be honest, one can surely find the whole movie as a brilliant, fresh, haunting and brutal experience which is as far away for a conventional revenge flick as possible - and i can totally understand that, because it is. Other might find this movie total crap - overstuffed with violence, boring story, bizarre images and to trying to be many things at the same time without simply being a good movie - those people i will also understand. I'm myself are more on those side who disliked this movie, but did not hate it. I think it has more bad thing then good, and i found this movie badly paced, but very solidly acted.Overall, ""Mandy"" (2018) is a very mixed bag, which for me did not worked at the end. I did admire this movie for that it definitely tried to be something totally different then an average revenge flick, and it succeeded, but its not for my taste.",Mandy

But this nonsense has overcome all that precede it. As if David Lynch on hallucinogenic drugs has tried to shoot slasher horror. The originality, imagination, interesting cinematographic solutions and good acting are wasted on the film dull and boring that it's barely watchable.

24,Platypuschow,Mandy: Certainly an experience,5,30 November 2018,"After watching the trailer I was hardly impressed and after watching it, my opinion hasn't changed a vast amount.A colourful psychedelic action movie starring Nicolas Cage which is incoherent, bizzare and plays out more like an arthouse film than Hollywood movie.At it's core once you strip away everything that makes it even remotely original Mandy is just a run of the mill revenge tale. Same as all the rest, just a tad more gore. I like revenge movies generally so this sat well with me, it's everything else that complicated things.The thing which stands out above all else with Mandy is the use of colour, it's remarkable and makes the film highly memorable. But does it work in its favour? Kind of. It presents a unique atmosphere, it sets a tone and again is certainly not something you'll forget. On the flipside however it's a distraction from how mundane the film is, again strip that away and how is Mandy any different than a thousand other movies of its type?Cage is on manic form here, embodying all the things folks love and hate about him. Folks say he's fallen from AAA actor to will do anything for the right price guy, and this certainly confirms the latter.I'm not saying Mandy is bad, but I have no idea why it's so critically acclaimed. The plot is basic, the background meanings are muddled and visually it's both a treat and a migraine waiting to happen.The Good:Very inventive visuals and use of colourCage is above usual formThe Bad:Not one for animal loversColours get old by the endConfusing and incoherentThings I Learnt From This Movie:Kids like being vomited onNicolas Cage in tightie whities is in keeping with the surreal vibeThere is a set hunting season for ""Jesus freaks""",Mandy
25,nairtejas,One-Line Review: Mandy (1 Star),1,4 November 2018,It takes more than an eternity for Panos Cosmatos's gory and ugly fantasy thriller Mandy to come to the point where a taciturn man (Nicolas Cage) seeks vengeance from a group of sadist hippie extremists currently on a streak of sacrificing human lives for the sake of a demi-god who seems to be a description of some of the real-life criminals we have around us in the world.

26,Thanos_Alfie,Overrated...,4,22 July 2020,"""Mandy"" is a Fantasy - Horror movie in which we watch a couple being brutally shattered by a cult. After the occurance some incidents the man starts to hunt them in order to get his revenge.I have to admit that I had high hopes for this movie but I was disappointed after watching it. I also believe that it's another overrated movie that wants to be considered faultily as a masterpiece. The direction which was made by Panos Cosmatos and Casper Kelly was very poor and I believe that they did not reach their potential because they wanted to create something so different that in the end they forgot what exactly they wanted to create. The interpretations of the cast and more specifically of Nicolas Cage who played as Red Miller and Andrea Riseborough who played as Mandy Bloom were below average and they did not reach their potential. Finally, I have to say that the interpretation of Nicolas Cage reminded me his interpretation in the movie ""The Wicker Man"" of 2006 which was another bad movie and I am sure that he wants to forget everything about it. If you want to watch this movie then better lower your standards and do not expect much from it because otherwise you are going to be disappointed as I was.",Mandy
27,eddie_baggins,A winning Crazy Cage horror,6,10 October 2018,"Crying out for more Crazy Cage in your life, then Mandy is here to save the day!One of the year's most talked about oddities and a film that is destined for a healthy life amongst the cult film circuit, Mandy is a fever dream like horror (comedy?) that further establishes the oddball charm of its leading man when given the right material for his sensibilities and also its director Panos Cosmatos, who follows up the trippy and much talked about Beyond the Black Rainbow with this 70's like throwback.Infused with a metal tinged heart that is championed by an ear drum smashing and memorable score from the late Jóhann Jóhannsson, Mandy is a bizarre journey into an otherworldly like version of Earth that see's Cage lumberjack turned revenge seeker/sword wielding Red Miller take on a band of religious cultists and drug crazed bikies that were responsible for the death of his beloved partner Mandy Bloom, played by Andrea Riseborough.In many ways it's a familiar story and the foundation for countless other revenge themed and exploitation horror's but thanks to Cosmatos and Cage's wide eyed and committed turn, Mandy never once feels like anything we've seen before, even if it never becomes a film that engages in a satisfactory manner outside of its bizarre and unforgettable eccentricities.Often coloured in a red hellish glow and broken up into specific chapters, Cosmatos blood filled and gore soaked experience takes its time getting anywhere, which will frustrate those viewers looking to get into the real crazy cage territory that doesn't kick into till around the half way mark and it is a problem for the film in many instances with scenes and seemingly unnecessarily long takes often becoming a little long in the tooth, even if an extended scene of Cage crying in a bathroom in his underwear will go down as one of the year's best.When things really ramp up in the final 30 or so minutes however, you begin to understand why Mandy has become one of the year's most talked about events, as Cage forges his weapon of choice and heads on a suicide like mission of revenge that features (I kid you not) a chainsaw duel that is worth the price of admission alone and truly inhabits its wild foundations that will ensure its place in the actors most memorable works (both good and bad).Final Say - Filled with some outstanding imagery, a speaker shattering soundtrack and a crazy fun Crazy Cage, Mandy is not for everyone and has its fair share of flaws but when things click into gear, this is a movie experience wholly unique and unforgettable, ensuring its status as a cult favourite for year's yet to come.3 chainsaw duels out of 5",Mandy
28,TheMovieDiorama,Mandy rocks out to psychedelic visuals whilst swinging a newly forged battle axe.,9,11 March 2019,"Welcome to the world of Panos Cosmatos. Is this your first trip too? Well, there are no exits available. Please. Sit back, consume an energy drink or five and watch the hallucinogenic visuals take over your mind. Warning! If you are prone to experiencing epilepsy, psychological trauma and the under appreciation of the ""Cage Rage"", then proceed with caution. It really is an unforgettable experience to say the least. Red and his artistic girlfriend Mandy live peacefully in a cabin near the Shadow Mountains. A cult of ""Jesus Freaks"" and a demonic biker gang intend to kidnap her but must go through Red first. Activate ""Cage Rage"" mode!So, with films like Cosmatos' Mandy, it is quite easy to categorise this as style over substance. But when the vivid style creates a new layer of substance, well that is something else entirely. Mandy is that something else. Mandy is utterly brilliant. Cosmatos imitates the cult classic vibrancy from the 80s, and in doing so has ensured a cult status for his own film. A simple tale of vengeance is transformed into a psychedelic canvas of dark fantasy. The mystical art that Mandy draws herself is replicated in the story, when many frames looking otherworldly. A lion roaring against the backdrop of a gas giant shrouded in red mist. A volcanic post-apocalyptic path forms as Red undergoes his quest for personal justice. The ever-changing landscape reflects Red's love and admiration for not just Mandy's work, but Mandy herself.Cosmatos' visual aesthetic can only be described as unique. The use of lighting, such as red during times of violence and blue for innocence, conveys a plethora of emotions and character motives. The flashing blue strobe lights symbolising the invasion of peace, the blood-soaked orange signifying the hellish embodiment that Red has adopted. The majestic filters used when characters are drugged reassures the intensity of LSD. The similarities between hallucinogenic drugs and the behaviour of devout religious cults are uncanny, and Cosmatos brings this idea forward. Spellbinding, and frequently entrancing. I found myself hypnotised during the simplest of scenes, particularly when Roache is directly looking at the camera spouting words about God. I couldn't look away. It held me. My eyes watering by the sheer beauty that was being shown. This is without mentioning the animated dream sequences which also complemented the experimental style of Cosmatos.However, what really impressed me was the utilisation of Cage. Everyone knows he overacts at the best of times, just look at 'The Wicker Man' or 'Vampire's Kiss'. But Cosmatos takes hold of that, and lets Cage loose. He was exceptional. One minute conveying palpable emotion, the next undergoing a chainsaw duel whilst screaming. Never has a role suited him more. Riseborough, who is incredibly underrated, exhumes elusiveness as Mandy. Beautiful yet psychologically damaged. Perfect casting. Roache as the leader of the ""Children of the New Dawn"" was tantalisingly unhinged. A noteworthy performance against Cage. The late Jóhannsson's score was bloody brilliant, and did not get enough credit. He mimicked a typical 80s score whilst intertwining it with metallic guitars, creating a fresh tone that complemented the visuals. Nearly every aspect to this film is perfect.However, I have two criticisms. The frequency of scene transitions, which simply faded to black, was high and made the narrative slightly disjointed. It was as if I was playing a video game and waiting for the loading time to complete. I also felt that by the third act the exhilarating pacing lost steam and the hallucinogenic effects were wearing off. Small criticisms, but needed to address them. Don't let that deter you away though. Mandy is effective. Mandy is psychedelic. Mandy is memorable. Watch it now and I'm sure you will not forget it!",Mandy
29,Tweetienator,Ghost Rider on Acid,8,16 September 2018,"This is Nicolas Cage's most daring and bloody movie (as far as I know) and for certain the best of his latest flicks. 
Mandy is Ghost Rider on acid. A B-trash-movie. A grindhouse movie. A horror experimental with some fine scenes of gore. A trip gone bad. Everyone in this movie is a freak, a mad hatter, and not one of the kind kind. Call Mandy how you it pleases you - it is a movie most people will just love or just hate.In this p.c.-burden times, where Hollywood delivers one lame attempt after another, Mandy is an exquisite one for the lovers of the unusual horror. But only for them, I guess - not a single piece of p.c.-infiltration and certainly not the kind of usual bulls*it labelled as horror nowadays.

34,Vartiainen,"Stylistic, almost artsy revenge film",6,20 April 2020,"Mandy, starring Nicolas Cage, was directed by Panos Cosmatos. It's a story about a lumberjack who loses his wife to a bunch of madmen, survives and swears revenge. Quite typical and clichéd as far as the bullet points go, but it's the execution here that sets this movie apart.First of all, Cosmatos clearly had a vision for this film. It quite frankly looks and sounds unlike anything I've ever seen. The colours are heavily saturated, often almost pitch black, dark blue or such an invasive colour of purple that it becomes uncomfortable, otherworldly even. The poster actually gives a good impression of that. The sound design is also brilliant, causing you to grind your teeth and have goosebumps.And it cannot be argued that Nicolas Cage isn't a captivating actor. I won't say he's perfect for the role, but there's this intensity to him that's unique to him. When he loses it, it's raw, wild and inimitable.All that being said, the story is clichéd. I don't really count it as a flaw because even a clichéd revenge story can be enjoyable to watch if its done correctly, which here it is, but it's still a bit odd that a film this unique-looking and -sounding doesn't have more of a voice of its own when it comes to storytelling. Although I did enjoy the fact that there was more buildup than is normal before the revenge part started.There's also the fact that the film is so aggressively shaded and colour corrected that it's almost impossible to watch if your room is even normally lit. Watch this in the darkest room you can.Still, a memorable film. Definitely a fine pick for the connoisseur of aesthetically pleasing violence.",Mandy

Roache (Batman Begins) plays Jeremiah, the leader of the cult. This is another weird Cage flick where he's eccentric as usual, there's bizarre cinematography, gruesome make-up and an eerie score.

With that said it is also one of the most unique films I've ever seen. Clear? When the credits began to roll I was left with a feeling of what the hell did I just watch? What is ultimately a reasonably straight-forward storyline is somehow turned into an overwhelming and bewildering experience. It really is a film that needs to be seen to be understood.The biggest thing for me though was that as the credits rolled I had to ask myself, did I even enjoy the film? I decided that I ultimately did, although I will quite happily never watch it again. The movie is visually stunning. I feel like this would be a very interesting film to watch under the influence of an illicit drug. I don't partake in the use of such drugs so will never know, but I feel like at the beginning of the movie the director would've liked to put forward a message saying ""please smoke up before viewing this film"".Nicolas Cage is certainly doing some interesting projects lately. They are all very uncommon type films with a point of difference. He seems to put his heart and soul into them too which is great to see. He certainly isn't phoning anything in. There are some great death and action scenes in the film. The violence is extreme in parts, be warned. I'm not really sure what else to say about the film. Some will love it, some will hate it.

It is tempting to say that the movie is therefore ""padded"" out to its full runtime, but that would require padding, which the movie doesn't provide. There are no superfluous scenes of action or dialogue. Rather, there are just long stretches of nothing happening. Characters stare into the distance. The ambient soundtrack swells.Then the movie gets violent. The violence is so fake as to have no effect other than to make you wonder what you are seeing.

40,jimbo-53-186511,No Mandy,3,18 December 2019,"A couple living in a secluded cabin in the woods find their world torn in half when the leader of a deranged hippie drug-addled cult becomes obsessed with the husband's wife. Things are never quite the same for the couple from this point on and a chain of events leads the husband seeking bloody vengeance against the crazy cult and the gang of demon biker henchman...Seeing the word 'psychedelic' in part of the summary for this film should have given me an indication of the sort of thing to expect from Mandy. However, even going in potentially knowing the sort of film I may have selected I honestly couldn't have possibility anticipated something this whacked out..The first hour is arguably where the film is at its worst; filled with lots of weird dream sequences and bizarre trippy happenings this section of the film is pretty tough going to say the least. If there is supposed to any sort of narrative progression at all on offer here then it was pretty much completely lost on me. Once we get to the second hour of the film then it does at least gain some momentum by creating an incident (in this case the kidnap). The second half of the picture is slightly more enjoyable if only because it has a bit more life to it (even though I felt that Cage managed to get the better of his adversaries a little too easily resulting in the film having little to no tension to it).As far as performances go then again it's a bit of a mixed bag; Riseborough does OK with what she has to work with (which isn't really a lot). Roache is lively, but is a bit too ridiculous and cartoonish to be taken seriously. Cage is the real surprise here after giving many rather lacklustre performances in the past he really throws himself into his role here and did look like he was enjoying himself - pity the script wasn't half as good as Cage.I think what really lets the film down is the way it's been directed; as a film Mandy is ridiculous and silly, but the problem with this film is that it's directed in such a serious way. If Director Panos Cosmatos would have paused for a minute and considered the flimsy material and wishy-washy themes then he may have been able to make light of the subject and thrown in some self-deprecating humour and throwaway jokes just to try and make the film a bit more palatable and fun. Yes it still would have been trashy, but it may have nudged the film into the 'just about watchable' category.I only wonder what a more accomplished comedy-horror director such as Edgar Wright could have done with this film? I guess we'll never know...",Mandy
41,kirbylee70-599-526179,TRIPPY BLOODBATH,8,1 November 2018,"Nicholas Cage has seen his fortunes and career careen from the utmost high to the lowest of lows. At one time he was considered the premiere actor in the world, won an Oscar and a Golden Globe and was on the covers of numerous magazines. Some erratic behavior, living beyond his means and trouble with the IRS resulted in his taking on numerous roles to pay off his debts. With more and more of these roles he seemed to get fewer and fewer of those that would allow him to reach the heights he once roamed. But among those numerous films there were still some gems, movies that continued to display his abilities. I'm not sure if this one falls into that category but I wouldn't place it among terrible films he's been making.MANDY takes place in 1988. Cage is Red Miller, a lumberjack who lives in a secluded forest home with the love of his life Mandy Bloom (Andrea Riseborough). Mandy is one of those ethereal beauties, not quite lovely in the standard sense but possessing her own look that is enchanting. Staying at home, working in a small local store, spending her days drawing and reading, she is the most harmless person you could meet.But walking home one day she's passed by a van containing a cult leader named Jeremiah Sand (Linus Roache) and his followers. Jeremiah is entranced by her and later that night mulls over this with two of his followers. He send out his right hand man Brother Swan (Ned Dennehy) to summon the Black Skulls, a group of bikers they use for dirty work, to kidnap Mandy and bring her to him.The Black Skulls are an unusual gang made up of miscreants who have abused the drugs provided to them by the Chemist, turning them into marauding instillers of pain with little concern for their own safety. Along with Brother Swan the capture Mandy and Red, tying Red to a tree with what appears to be wire. Jeremiah drugs Mandy with the LSD his group uses and preaches to her his mystic philosophy of being blessed with all things by a drug fueled God. When she begins laughing at him he flies into a rage.The enraged Jeremiah stabs Red still tied to the tree, hangs Mandy up in a sleeping bag nearby and lights her on fire while Red watches helplessly before leaving with his followers. Red later escapes his bonds, visits an old friend where he reclaims a crossbow he calls ""the reaper"", constructs a battle axe and sets out to claim revenge on the Black Skulls and Jeremiah and his followers.Don't get me wrong here as standard a revenge movie as this may sound it is far from it. Director/writer Panos Cosmatos has concocted a visually arresting movie that feels like you're watching a revenge film through drug fueled eyes from the opening moments through to the very end. He uses a stylistic approach to the film with various scenes shot in bright colored lights making it seem surreal and far from real while the violence that takes place is as real as one will find in a movie. This combination of art film esthetics and brutal post-apocalyptic styled brutality is an odd mix and yet seems to work well here. This is not a movie where you are likely to forget the visual appearance of the film.The film is incredibly slow to build steam and that may turn off a number of viewers. But if you can make it past the first half of the film (yes it actually takes that long) then the payoff for fans of violent revenge films will be paid off. That lengthy first half is done so to establish the difference between the two worlds, that of Mandy and Red in peaceful bliss in the mountains and the acid fueled carnage let lose by Jeremiah in his quest for mysticism. It's unlike most movies seen today but works in its own way.Cage is working at his peak here, subtle when called for a full on rage when his character lets lose near the end. To be able to carry off both extremes in the same movie is an achievement. Riseborough carries off the role of Mandy perfectly offering an innocence to the character placed in harm's way. And Roache comes off as incredibly creepy, a cult leader who can spin a few words around his flock and have them do his bidding.After all is said and done I'm still not sure if I enjoyed this movie or not. I honestly thought it could be trimmed down some from its 2 hour running time. Cosmatos has offered something different than I've ever seen before and I enjoyed parts and was bored by others. My recommendation is that if brutal violence is something you avoid steer clear. If you like Cage and great performances you may want to watch this. And if you like watching movies that attempt to do something other than the standard fare put out by Hollywood then by all means give it a watch. Odds are once you do it will be a movie you talk about for some time.",Mandy
42,lukem-52760,A MIND BLOWING TRIP INTO HELL & NICOLAS CAGE IS PHENOMENAL,8,15 August 2020,"Nicolas Cage is a fantastic actor FACT, yes he's made a tone of crappy low-budget straight-to-dvd flicks but he's nearly always watchable or interesting & I've been a fan since his 90's glory days & my all time favourite film & performance from Cage is the outstanding dark, yet underrated Thriller 8MM. His performance in 8MM is one of my favourite pieces of acting from all of Cinema & i rate is as one of my top 3 performances in movies, so i hold that performance very high as i do the incredibly dark Thriller 8MM. Here Cage gives the second best performance of his career as an ordinary hard working man who has to descent into Hell to seek brutal revenge for the sadistic murder of his girlfriend Mandy.
Cage is magnificent here as he screams & cries & growls with raw emotion. He acts how a real man would act with what he witnessed.
This extremely dark & savage Horror-Thriller is set in 1983 when weirdo hippies & Cults seemed to be all other America coming out of the almost Apocalyptic times of the 1970's. Cage plays Reed, a lumberjack Logger type of woodsman guy who comes home to his lovely big secluded lakeside house out in the forests of Crystal Lake!!! Things already feel weird & bizarre as his strange girlfriend seems very out there & one day is having a walk through the forest when a camper type van drives past her & the weirdo Cultists inside take a liking to her. This sets in motion a bizarre & terrifying series of events that include Mandy getting captured & Cage getting captured & tortured & a whole host of freaky & scary characters come into play including a team of demonic-gimp type Bikers!!!Mandy, is beautifully shot with surreal imagery & dreamlike & trippy visions & a gorgeous use of colour, just stunning cinematography. The film looks & feels so old & the film itself is like the type of violence drenched 70's or early 80's revenge Thriller you would find on a battered old vhs tape at a car-boot sale back in the day!!! So the movie captured exactly what it was going for!!! The violence is extremely bloody like an old Grindhouse flick & the film also feels like an adventure-fantasy too mixed with the darkness of a savage revenge Thriller about evil Cults. I loved this movie, it was even better than i thought It would be.
A future Cult Classic or even a MASTERPIECE as time goes on.
Mandy really felt like a long lost banned film from the early 80's that's just been rediscovered & that's the best compliment a film like this could have.",Mandy
43,kluseba,Psychedelic art house elements meet a sinister tale of vengeance,9,24 September 2018,"When news broke that Nicolas Cage would be the lead actor of a psychedelic art house horror movie, I was immediately intrigued. Despite everything he has accomplished, Nicolas Cage is often overtly criticized and not given enough credit for being one of Hollywood's most consistent contemporary actors. His performance in this film is brutal, emotional and twisted but it isn't the film's only strength.The cinematography is obviously inspired by horror movies of the seventies. While overrated contemporary genre flicks like It Follows only copy elements from the past, Mandy uses flashy colours, psychedelic music and vintage clothing to its advantage. The film follows a couple living relatively secluded in a forest. A fanatic sect kidnaps, torments and burns the woman to death while the agonized husband has to watch her helplessly. He is left behind and for dead but manages to survive and take his revenge.It isn't only the liberating carnage in strange settings or the psychedelic references to the seventies or eighties that make this film stand out but also the quite intriguing characters. Nicolas Cage and Andrea Riseborough credibly play a simple couple in love with each other and the nature around their cozy home. The members of the sect are all quite unique. Jeremiah Sand reminds of a mixture of mass murderer Charles Manson and Peoples Temple's religious leader Jim Jones. Brother Swan intrigues as obedient and resilient disciple. Mother Marlene is a sadist who enjoys seeing people suffer. Sister Lucy however shows a different side of the cult as she appears to be a victim stuck in the sect and not knowing how to get out. Every single character is present for a reason and even the Black Skulls, a mysterious biker gang with almost inhuman powers, is quite intriguing.The only negative element of the film is that the first third takes some time to unfold. Mandy carefully introduces us to the numerous characters which is a great idea but especially the presentation of the two lead characters Mandy Bloom and Red Miller overstays its welcome. The movie could have been shortened by at least fifteen minutes at that point while the rest is quite concise.Mandy provoked quite mixed reactions at the movie theater I went to. The men gave the film a standing ovation and were clearly enjoying themselves while most of the girlfriends they had brought along felt somewhat unsettled. Mandy has an artistic, psychedelic and referential side but it's still a slasher at heart and tells a sinister tale of vengeance. It's not as unsettling as I Saw the Devil but it still isn't for the faint-hearted. This isn't a movie for children.If you like art house cinema and horror movies, Mandy combines both very well and offers a psychedelic ride you won't forget anytime soon. If this film plays at a movie theater near you, go ahead and enjoy its magnificent images and sounds right there. Mandy might not reinvent the genre and has a few minor lengths but it's one of the most creative films released so far this year.",Mandy
44,Pairic,Devilishly Dark,8,20 October 2018,"Mandy: He's a lumberjack and he's ok! Well, the lumberjack is Red (Nicholas Cage) so he's unlikely to be ok or merely crossdress. He lives in a wonderful house set in in a forest, it's huge lit-up windows make it look like a carved pumpkin as he approaches it at night. His wife Mandy (Andrea Riseborough) is waiting, sketching images which seem to be influenced by William Blake. Colour is very important to this film, shot in hues of red, black, burnt umber, dark green and many shades of grey. Director Panos Cosmatos has developed the perfect partnership with cinematographer Benjamin Loeb. People move and are chased through misty temperate rain forests, Mandy's first encounter with the cult is literally shot in infra-red as are many of the fight scenes. Where participants actions and vision is affected by narcotics, there is a blurred quality to the the film.The cult leader Jeremiah (Linus Roache) decides that he must have Mandy and spurns his acolyte Mother Marlene (Olwen Fouéré) and tasks Brother Swan (Ned Dennehy) with abducting Mandy. Swan summons three bikers who look like Cenobites. At times it is difficult to discern whether strange happening or actions are due to drugs or supernatural activity. Indeed the bikers are allowed to have a human sacrifice as payment for their assistance in overpowering Red and Mandy. Mandy is drugged, including being stung with a black wasp wielded by Marlene, but just laughs at Jeremiah when he demands her subservience. An enraged Jeremiah strikes out savagely.A wounded Red sets out in pursuit of the cult (first he has to free himself from his barbed wire bonds and gag), armed with a tactical crossbow and a Klingonesque battle axe which he forges himself. Savage fights ensues resulting in beheadings, stabbings, burnings and deaths by arrow. There is even a chainsaw duel. Cage eats up the scenery, grinning as the blood of a slain enemy hits him in the mouth and lighting a cigarette from a burning head.The cult are nominally Christian but Satanic tropes and motifs permeate the film and their actions. The bikers look as if they were quite literally summoned from Hell. A Devilishly Dark work with strains of anarchic comedy. Not a film for the faint-hearted. 8/10.",Mandy

48,a_chinn,Cage's wild performance grounds director's Cosmatos' fevered nightmare film,8,17 September 2018,"Imperfect, but wildly original and engaging genre hybrid film is going to either delight viewers or become an endurance test. This is one of those films where there's no in-between. This story, such as it is, has Nic Cage and his wife living in the woods when a creepy cult leader takes a liking to Cage's wife and (SPOILER ALERT!) ends up killing her in a terrifying home invasion sequence. Cage is left for dead, but lives and then roars, rampages, and gets bloody satisfaction. What makes ""Mandy"" such a memorable film is it's hallucinatory fevered dream vision from director Panos Cosmatos. Set in 1983, the film's style can maybe be best described as ""Stranger Things"" meets 70s/80s surreal Euro Horror (ALA Dario Argent or Harry Kümel), but the film lovingly and endlessly references many other films, from obvious ones like Hellriaser's cenobites, retro animated sequences reminiscent of ""Heavy Metal,"" or a chainsaw duel similar to the one in TCM2, but also includes less obvious references to films like ""Near Dark,"" ""Phantasm,"" or ""Blue Sunshine."" But ""Mandy"" is much more than a love letter to arthouse horror films of the past. Cosmatos has crafted a film that is more dreamlike than any film I can recall in recent memory and takes it to a whole new extreme. Gaspar Noé ""Enter the Void"" or Cronenber's ""Naked Lunch"" are probably the closest I can think of, although the closest thing I can think of in terms of tone within the horror genre is the low-budget cult film 1973 film ""Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Supernatural."" On the David Lynch spectrum, this is much closer to ""Eraserhead"" than ""Mullholland Drive."" Cosmatos fills his screen with vivid reds, hallucinatory overlapping images, and surrounds it all with a haunting soundscape. Although the film is very much what it is thanks to Cosmatos, Nic Cage very nearly steals the film with one of his best wildman performances in ages, which is at once insanely over-the-top, but at the same time incredibly wrenching. Cage is amazing as he roars fighting a chainsaw-wielding leather-clad demonic biker (did I mention there are demonic bikers?), but he's also incredibly moving in emotionally wrought scenes, particularly one where he's in a bathroom, covered in blood, in his tidy whities, drinking vodka straight from the bottle, emoting in a way that's at once wildly ""Nic Cage"" and over-the-top, but is also quite emotional and effective (if I was still in college, that would be my Halloween costume this year). ""Mandy"" might simply have been an austere (and gory) arthouse exercise in horror kinematicss, but Cage commands the screen and connects viewers on an emotional level, which has the impact of viewers not only being drawn in by Cosmatos' visuals on an intellectual level, but also being drawn in by Cage on an emotionally resonant level. Besides Cage, I'm fascinated by the look of Andrea Riseborough as Mandy. Riseborough is an attractive actress, but Cosmatos gives her a look that recalls Shelley Duvall's oddball look in Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining."" I felt that most of the characters in the film had an analogue in genre films from the 70s and 80s. The cult leader seemed to be a part tailored for Richard Lynch. Other members of the cult reminded me of beefy Brian Thompson, another a short version of Julian Sands, another like Richard Jenkins, and even a Susan Tyrrell analogue. The film even features a bit part for actual 70/80s genre actor Bill Duke (who's a pretty solid director himself). Complimenting Cosmatos' nightmare soundscape is a wonderfully retro prog rock-like score by Jóhann Jóhannsson's, his final film score. There's even a uber cool theme song by King Crimson! If I do have a complaint about the film, it's that the first act establishing Mandy and Cage's relationship seemed a bit long and was less interesting than the film's revenge filled second half, although that second half may not have been as good without the character elements being established. Still, it's the film's surreal nightmare visions throughout that will stick with you (Jean Cocteau by way of Clive Barker), which for better or for worse will either delight or endlessly annoy viewers. Watch if you dare! FUN FACT! The Cheddar Goblin commercial was directed by Casper Kelly, who directed the Adult Swim short ""Too Many Cooks.""",Mandy
49,masonsaul,A film like no other,10,17 December 2018,Mandy is a visually gorgeous film that's like no other film. Panos Cosmatos' direction is incredible and the action sequences are great. Nicolas Cage gives an incredibly committed performance that's both emotional and unhinged when required. Andrea Riseborough and Linus Roache both give great supporting performances. The music by Johann Johannsson is fantastic.,Mandy
50,robertemerald,"Much like I Spit On Your Grave (2010), with trippy apocalypse colours",8,4 January 2020,"Mandy is a satisfying movie and deserves a solid 8 for entertainment., I certainly enjoyed it, the revenge was very satisfying indeed, meaning that the agonising events that lead to that revenge must have been well handled. You develop a hatred for the bad guys in many ways, and you root for Mr Cage. If you enjoyed Mad Max (1979) then you should enjoy this. There is a fair sized motorcycle component, complete with wacko apocalypse murderous misfits. In fact, I'm not sure why the writer didn't think this concept out a little further and put the whole piece in a post-apocalypse world. As it isn't, then you kind of view things scratching your head here and there. That isn't to say it's not entertaining, and one could note that wherever this movie is located, it is a backwater. The movie starts with some amazingly well considered imagery, some lovely frames and colours, but fails to keep up this standard in later stages, although the vision still shines through here and there. I guess it's a hard balance between blood red violence and imagery implying an intense or deeper visual experience. The locations were clever. Linas Roache is outstanding, and easily the best casting choice. He drips with outrageous and dangerous madness from the onset. Mandy is a little slow to begin, but that's when the imagery is at its most sincere, and so that's not such a problem. I don't think Mandy rises to the status of future cult classic, but it will be well-regarded and often referred to when discussing the revenge genre.",Mandy

52,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Mandy,5,29 September 2018,"""I'm you're God now!"" The bloodied flick I'm about to review is not ""Godlike"" as some critics have suggested. It's just style that begets style, symbolism that begets symbolism, and ferocity that begets ferocity. And yeah, there will be blood. Oh yes, there will be blood. Anyway, Thor: Ragnarok is what happens when self-indulgent art film, grandiose horror film, and dim-lighted action film combine. Oops, wrong vehicle. I'm talking about Mandy, a Nicolas Cage affair where Cage wears his caked face like Martin Sheen a la Apocalypse Now. As something that only takes place in the darkest hours, Mandy projects like a standard revenge tale that doesn't get going till the 70-minute mark. In truth, Mandy is a Roger Corman wet dream, a fantasy-ridden tale rudely set in 1983, and something where a chainsaw fight gives Captain Cage L. Willard a chance at a new, fresh kill. Somewhere Barry Manilow is fuming and is in maligned, faint mode. As far as fall releases go in 2018, Mandy has red and black colored hues and a penchant for medieval credit titles. It lives in its own, twisted world where entertainment value is necessitated and out of place aliens need to be identifiable. Heck, I couldn't recommend Mandy unless the Death Race crowd cornered me at a scheduled comic-con convention.Mandy chronicles Red Miller (played by Cage in subtle, Cage ""rage"" mode). Miller loses his girlfriend to a sadistic, religious cult and seeks vengeance on said cult. The moral of the story is don't mess with a man whose loving chick gets slaughtered by quote unquote, ""Jesus freaks"". You'll get the proverbial horns and the wrath of a silvery ax Cage-style.Mandy as intolerable reverie and improbable stoner pic, salutes Italian director Panos Cosmatos as a screw loose, visionary helmer. The problem is that is his vision is rooted in pretension, lost in viable storytelling modes, and deemed way too far out of left field. The audience might be bored and exhausted halfway through. Bottom line: I'm going with a rating of 2 stars.",Mandy
53,jellopuke,Original pastiche,8,30 September 2018,"Is it an oxymoron to call this an original pastiche? Maybe, but this is essentially a more visual style of genre mashup than Tarantino does verbally/narratively.

54,fntstcplnt,Mandy (2018),7,12 December 2019,"Directed by Panos Cosmatos. Starring Nicolas Cage, Linus Roache, Andrea Riseborough, Ned Dennehy, Bill Duke, Richard Brake, Olwen Fouéré, Clément Baronnet, Line Pillet. (R)Bizarre, surreal horror-phantasmagoria provides no short cuts or amendes honorable; either one resists, or one gives in. A deviant cult, working with (presumably) actual demon bikers, kidnaps Riseborough, sending her beau (Cage) on an anguished mission of blood-soaked revenge. A volcano of ultra-saturated colors (reds, mostly), lysergic acid-soaked celluloid, gonzo performances, extreme gore, madness and despair. At its best, hypnotic and visceral, an unforgettable vision quest like the most gorgeous of nightmares; at its worst, soporific navel-gazing to compete with the worst aspects of Nicolas Winding Refn. Obviously not for all tastes, but if the mood strikes just right, the rewards will linger long after. Numerous camera shots could easily be used as album cover art for progressive rock and/or death metal bands.72/100",Mandy
55,Foutainoflife,Most Honest Review I Can Offer,6,28 October 2018,"I'm on the fence with this one. To say it was different is a bit of an understatement. The plot of the story is simply that Nicolas Cage watches as a religious drug cult murders his wife. This sends him down a road of vengeance on her behalf that is full of rage.It wasn't a God awful film. It is watchable. It is weird though. The first half had me looking at the screen sideways. I just didn't get some of the stuff I was watching or why it would've been important to the plot. The second half of the film was a little more together but there were still moments that had me sideways so there is plenty to leave one wondering ""WTF is going on?"".The positives about this movie are that it is artistically done so it is really interesting to watch. The acting is creepy, which is something you want from a movie like this, and all the actors were convincing in the emotional aspects of their roles. This is a drug fueled film so there are a lot of REALLY trippy scenes.I've read where it is the opinion of most that you will either love this or hate it. I just don't know where I fall in these two categories. After having just watched it, I am just riding the fence. I didn't love it but I didn't hate it. This is one that I will have to think about. I would suggest that this is one you just have to watch and decide for yourself. You should keep an open mind though and I will offer one warning that I had not been given but so wish I would've got. There is proudly exposed shlong in this. It was awkward. You are warned.",Mandy

Nic Cage is fantastic, much (not quite all) of the film is visually striking, and I love the music, both the score and the excellent use of King Crimson during the opening.If I revisit it again in another few years, I'm sure I'll - once again - find myself liking it even more.",Mandy
57,gedikreverdi,A revenge tale on a bad batch of LSD,7,5 July 2021,"He's a lumberjack and lived with his wife Mandy in their cabin in the forest with their beautiful bedroom. The black skull bikers on a specially bad batch of LSD because the chemist didn't like them abducted his wife when their cult leader saw her on the road and when she acted up, they burned him in front of his husband and left. He got rid of the barbed wires in his mouth and around his wrists and touched the charred body of her which is still burning and smoking and pieces of her skull drifted away with the wind. After this point it was a bit predictable. He cast a shiny axe for himself and went on a hunt. 'It was my favorite T-shirt' was hilarious. He took whatever they're snorting and went full savage. He used a chainsaw on one of the men and thanks to the chemist with the tiger, he found their place thru the old mine tunnels. He built himself a pyramid with a cross and there was a tunnel on its floor. It led him to the old woman with his leader Jeremiah. He threw her severed head at his feet and squeezed his head until his eyes came out after his deranged preach about how he's destined to come to him and it was hard to listen to a fanatic even if it's only a film. I loved it , I hated it, i feel like I was being tormented by it with the light going on and off during the abduction scene.

63,spookyrat1,What! No Barry Manilow?,6,21 June 2020,"Yep, no Barry songs, but we do get a great soundtrack featuring King Crimson, combined with a great stylised, blended recording by the late Jóhann Jóhannsson, which pretty much fills every frame of this cross genre second feature from Panos Cosmatos. Had enough of jerky hand-held camera work accompanied by lightening quick edits? Mandy is the polar opposite. If you can imagine Michael Haneke directing a weirded out revenge action thriller, this might be the movie for you.Mandy is like an internalized double bill, with a clear demarcation point (indicated by the title credit) between features at just over the half-way point. The first half primarily focuses on the character, Mandy,who lives in the Shadow Mountains of California with her partner Red, a logger. They lead a quiet and reclusive life until Mandy attracts the attention of Jeremiah Sand, the leader of a deviant hippie cult. This precipitates a vicious, home invasion. The second half centres on Red and his response to the raiders of his home.There's some fine acting with Linus Roache the standout as Sand, the odious, Manson like leader of the Children of the New Dawn. Andrea Riseborough as the eponymous Mandy, ironically doesn't have a huge amount to do, except to frequently look somewhat half-way between languid and wild-eyed. Nic Cage, particularly in the second half, gives us the Nic Cage special (surely under direction). We get the bug-eyed, screaming rants, the belaboured physical movements and the excruciatingly pained expressions all in one, as justice is summarily dealt out, to those who have transgressed. Cage could never be accused of not bringing energy to the role.For me, in just about any sort of movie the storyline and pacing are of paramount importance. For a 2+ hour film, the narrative is pretty skinny to say the least and rather predictable. There aren't for instance, any real twists or surprisingly unexpected turns, apart from the various ways certain characters meet their fates.To say the pacing is torpid, is to almost do the film a favour. Besides scenes seeming almost static for minutes on end, believe it or not, characters' movements are often slowed down, as is their speech. Impactful, yes, pulsating, no!Mandy is a highly stylised creation, bordering on the pretentious, where everything feels stretched too long, To, me it has the feel of a work print, still not fully edited. Still it does have a fine soundtrack and some genuinely original ideas. But by the end of the film the ideas underpinning Mandy seem to me, to be far more entertaining than its actuality.",Mandy

Nicholas Cage's wife becomes their next victim while they have him tied up helpless to help her. Later he comes after the cult with revenge on his mind. That's the basic gist of the story.The other part of this film is the way it has been made. It is an Artsy and surreal film. The cinematography looks like LSD trip. Lots of Red and other psychedlic colors used used throughout the film with some overused lens flare. The cult is reminiscent of a Manson like cult and a cult leader has a Jesus Personality with a need to be loved by his cult followers.I gave it a 6 for visual originally.

I think the filmmakers had him in mind when they set out to cast this film because he fit the protagonist to a 'T.'My only gripe with the film was how slooooooooooooow a lot of it was. Really. They could have sped up some parts or chop the movie down by a half an hour and still retain its full ethereal effect. This movie was like a colorized version f ""Begotten,"", that artsy black and white horror film with no dialog, just intriguing images, some of which was hard to tell what was going on.

Their blissful life is destroyed when a hippy cult aided by demonic bikers torture him and inject them with LSD, eventually burning her to death in front of his eyes. He survives the ordeal and goes after them for brutal revenge.A cult horror film in which the viewer is unsure as to what is real, what is fantasy and what is a drug fuelled hallucination. What is clear is that this is a film with immense intensity with Cage drawing out his typical off the wall cult acting style as he grimaces directly at the camera. It taps into the dark part of an hallucinogenic trip and the seeking of revenge, while drawing on a whole back catalogue of other horror films from FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH franchise, WEREWOLVES ON WHEELS (1973), RACE WITH THE DEVIL (1975), NIGHTMARE BEACH (1980) or even the GHOST RIDER films which of course also starred Cage.

68,kjproulx,An Insane Viewing Experience,9,17 September 2018,"Films like Only God Forgives or The Human Centipede are bizarre or off-putting, simply to be that, offering nothing else. That's just my opinion, but movies like that can also be absolutely incredible in terms of how a story is told. You can have the most generic premise in history, but still manage to accomplish one of the most original films of the year. Mandy is absolutely for a niche audience, so if you're someone who can watch any movie, no matter how intense, gory, insane, or downright disgusting a film is, then Mandy might impress you, as it did myself. While I'm cautioning this review and stating that the majority of average moviegoers will probably rip this film apart or not even be able to finish it, here's why I believe Mandy is one of the better films of 2018.The plot of this film is a spoiler in itself, so I will keep this very brief, without ruining the experience for anyone. Mandy follows a couple in Red (Nicolas Cage) and Mandy (Andrea Riseborough) as they run their shop in the woods, exploring their love together. As a religious cult is looking around them, their future is not going to be bright together. Filled with gruesome violence, some of the most unique visuals of the year, and a story that gets turned on its head, this is definitely an experience that shouldn't be missed for hardcore film fans.This particular film is anchored by fantastic (although haunting) performances by the members of the religious cult, but the true standout of the film is Nicolas Cage. Yes, fans of his work will get their favourite freakout moments that he's become known for, but it really is a surprising turn for him as an actor. With one scene in particular, his performance brought me to literal tears, due to how committed to this character he was. Through all the wacky moments this character goes through, it was the subtlety in Cage's eyes that had me invested from start to finish. Even though I felt like certain scenes were weird, just to be weird, he helped keep this bizarre film grounded in some sort of reality.As I mentioned, this film is visually striking. Personally, I found some of the visuals to be slightly gimmicky, but the characters surrounding the film easily made up for that. By the time the second and third acts kick into gear, the bizarre visuals become sparse, which felt like a breath of fresh air. Director Panos Cosmatos clearly had a vision for this film and stuck to it from start to finish, which has to be at least admirable. That being said, the best part of this film, at least to me, was the score by Jóhann Jóhannsson. The way music is presented here is almost like it's a character in the film. Even if I may not have been buying into a certain element throughout the first act of this film, the score was pulse-pounding and it truly blew me away. These are pieces of music that are definitely award-worthy.In the end, Mandy is absolutely not for everyone. In fact, as I said, I can see the majority of viewers being turned off quite early, but it will work for those who are open-minded film lovers. I was riveted from start to finish, and aside from feeling like some of the visuals were weird just to be weird, everything else about this movie is terrific. It's very hard to recommend a movie like this, but if you can get into it, the story, violence, bizarre imagery, and downright gut-wrenching moments all add up to a fantastic and insane experience. Mandy is great!",Mandy
69,kuarinofu,A mixed bag (good stuff + wasted potential and pretentiousness),7,10 January 2020,"I saw Beyond the Black Rainbow so I kinda knew what to expect from Panos Cosmatos.As for this film, Mandy is a (mostly) good b-movie trash.It has its goods, like some visuals, Cage's overacting, production design, the demon gang, violence, blood and gore. It is enjoyable as a whole.But lots of things in this film seriously drag it down, like bad pretentious cinematography (when you can't really tell what you're looking at), 100% pointless dialogue, absence of characters, bloated run time and lack of a satisfying ending.This film could've been improved significantly if it was cut down to around 90-100 minutes (all those pointless x0.25 speed scenes), had at least Cage's character, Mandy and Jeremiah established, made much more grounded and realistic, and brought real emotions like grief, wrath and despair. Combine all that with great violence and 80's style visuals and you're good.In its current form this movie is an endurance test for most audiences and while I enjoyed it I felt like this could've been much better if they would drop all the pointless stuff and focus on the important things.",Mandy
70,AhmedSpielberg99,Mandy is one HELL of a movie!,8,18 December 2018,"TRIPPY, GROTESQUE, EPIC, DEVILISH, and BEAUTIFUL.Ingenious use of foreshadowing, and unique, yet excessive use of symbolism. Garish portraits, and frames dipped in eye-blindingly bright neon colors. Unearthly metallic score by the late Jóhann Jóhannsson. Mandy is a wild poem with a straightforward revenge story represented through hellish art.Every single actor/actress is flawless, most notably Nic ""Rage"". Andrea Riseborough's performance as the titular character is fantastic. Linus Roache, however, isn't flawless; because his freakishly incomparable performance surpasses this word. I can't imagine any actor who could give such an unnerving performance as the maniac cult leader, Jeremiah. Let alone his peerless bygone look. This is really one of the most perfect villain castings ever!Besides some ostentatious and unnecessary use of symbolism. I think the setup is overlong, and there is an inconsistency in the rhythm of the movie; especially, and strangely, at its wildest moments that caused some monotony. Other than that, I have nothing else against it. Also, the vivid and bizarre visual experience is more than enough to keep me quite engaged. The Clockwork Orange fan, Panos Cosmatos is going to be one of the greatest, and most idiosyncratic directors.(8.5/10)",Mandy

72,DarthVoorhees,"It's as if David Lynch made 'Evil Dead', all gooey gory pretentious style with nothing close to substance",5,26 October 2020,"'Mandy' seems to be a polarizing film. I've heard raves and passionate loathing. I see both sides of the coin and can't quite agree with either side. 'Mandy' is an experience but I don't think it's a profound one that leaves you with anything.The entire appeal of the film is it's heightened visual tone. It feels like a real nightmare, full of dark surprises that sometimes come out of nowhere. Director Panos Cosmatos meticulously sticks to his neon color palette with only the pools of blood adding another layer. You won't see another film look quite like 'Mandy'It's almost a neo-expressionist horror film. The characters and settings are so broad to the point where they are like a cartoon id.Unfortunately all the characters almost become boring because of the nonstop madness and it's a shame because this film has a brilliant cast. Nicolas Cage is the perfect choice to lead this film. He is at his most frenzied and is dialed up to the extreme from the very beginning. That's really the problem with 'Mandy' it is so out there that there is almost no where to go. I love Nic Cage, the more eccentric the better but a little Nic Cage goes a long way. In truth this isn't a showcase for any actor. 'Mandy' is all about the metal mood and ambiance and our cast has to rise to the challenge. Andrea Riseborough and Linus Roache are the two other lead characters and it's interesting seeing them try to match Cage.'Mandy' is destined to become a cult film and I can see why. It's two hour run time will take your breath away. I couldn't tell if I was in awe or annoyance, probably a bit of both.",Mandy
73,msbreviews,Rating: A-,8,1 October 2018,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Well, this one was unexpected. Who would have thought that Nicolas Cage still had it in him to deliver such a powerful and captivating performance in his craziest movie so far?! Mandy might be the return to form of Cage, though it brilliantly shines not only due to his performance but to the craft on display and the trippy screenplay.I'm not going to lie, this is not a film for everyone, and I don't mean it offensively. Both visuals and story are so confusing and complex that they genuinely might get some people either sick or incredibly bored. It has a lot of flashy lights and intense colors, so watch out for any people with epilepsy or any other disease related to this condition.Story-wise, it requires a post-watch time to think about it. In fact, it demands your attention from the first to the last second because this is not a lazy exposition festival. There is a tremendous focus on visual storytelling and the use of some jaw-dropping cinematography. The lighting on each background or on character's faces always means something and the way it elevates the movie is outstanding. Benjamin Loeb, sir, you are a man who really understands his art!Jóhann Jóhannsson produces the score, and he has been providing so many amazing soundtracks for each of his films (Arrival, Sicario, Prisoners...). Once again, his powerful sound is part of the story, and it beautifully accompanies Red's journey of bloody vengeance. Undoubtedly, a movie to be seen in the best theater you have at your disposal unless you have a high-quality sound system at home.Like I wrote above, it's a story that requires full concentration on what you're experiencing. Believe me, this whole film is a mind-blowing experience. Surely, it will leave you speechless. If it does in a good or bad way, that's up to each person's interpretation of the movie. Nevertheless, I have to say that if you don't have any knowledge of filmmaking, you will hardly understand the buzz around this film.It is a remarkably technical movie, and I now understand why it barely had any marketing or screenings here in Portugal. It wouldn't get any profit. It is not a blockbuster, and it is not an easygoing film, at all. It requires an audience who isn't brainless or close-minded. I can only imagine a tiny group of people who would truly enjoy Mandy for what it is, while the rest would say that it is the most boring and stupid thing they've ever watched.After some thinking, the plot is actually quite simple, but it's purposefully told in a confusing, trippy and crazy way so that we can experience what our protagonist is feeling. Panos Cosmatos and Aaron Stewart-Ahn deliver an astonishing example of visual storytelling, filled with clever dialogues and tons of long takes, with an extraordinarily short amount of cuts or no cuts at all.Obviously, Nicolas Cage is an absolute standout. He can be as crazy as the movie itself, and his performance shows a range of expressions and emotions that only the greatest actors can have. He literally demonstrates that range in a 3-min, uncut scene, which I will remember forever as one of his best moments as an actor. Andrea Riseborough is also fantastic as Mandy and Linus Roache brilliantly portrays Jeremiah Sand, but Cage definitely steals the show.As a vengeance story, it works not only due to the blood-heavy fights but especially because of its characters. Mandy and Red receive great development, and Jeremiah also gets an interesting yet horrible backstory. I love how Panos Cosmatos controls the tone of the film, by balancing the dark side with the warm, hopeful vibe that Red and Mandy emit from their loving relationship.As for flaws, the first half's pacing is indeed a slow-burn. While most of it might be on purpose to build-up the change of Red, it's still a very tough time to go through all of that. The ending feels a bit underwhelming since the big climax is weaker than previous moments in the third act, which leaves the impression that the movie could have ended stronger.I'm going to repeat this once again: this film is incredibly technical. If you don't have any knowledge of filmmaking, I doubt you will find this movie enjoyable. It is a seriously dark and heavy film, with not much dialogue and a lot of creepy and trippy visuals. It definitely packs a punch but I love productions like this, and Panos Cosmatos proved he is a director to put an eye on.In the end, Mandy is one of the most unexpected movies I've seen in years. Not only I was surprised by how outstanding Nicolas Cage is, but the technical attributes are also off the charts. Panos Cosmatos is one hell of a director, brilliantly controlling the film's tone and filming some intense uncut sequences. He and Aaron Stewart-Ahn wrote a fantastic script, filled with visual storytelling and some clever yet short dialogue. Astonishing cinematography, powerful score, amazing performances, mind-blowing visuals, and a bloody vengeance story. What can I write more? See it to believe it!",Mandy
74,anselmdaniel,A metal experience,8,24 April 2021,"This review contains spoilers.Mandy is a thriller movie that premiered in 2018. The movie centers around a character named Red Miller and his girlfriend Mandy Bloom that lives in the woods. Their two lives are upheaved when a passing cult takes an interest in Mandy.Mandy is an incredibly surreal movie. This movie was incredibly psychological as the movie sought to present ridiculous scenarios. These ridiculous scenarios are played up in the movie to great effect in its cinematography and the direction. These scenes are something else as the movie feels trippy. This is aided by the drug scenes of this movie. I felt that the movie displayed the strangeness of a trip incredibly well. These scenes are played up in its surreal nature and the audience has a full auditory and visual experience.This movie gets progressively stranger as the 121 minutes of running time continues. The story does try to explain this by Red taking psychedelic drugs that would explain his state of mind. There is a massive suspension of disbelief that is required for this movie to work. The movie requires this as it introduces an otherworldly biker gang that is seemingly known by Red Miller's associate. I could only explain this as the drug-like state that Red entered into. There are no solid answers for the visions that Red gets besides drugs.The story of the cult did not make much sense. The cult hires a supernatural biker gang to find and kidnap Mandy. However, it did not seem that this was necessary as the cult could easily have overpowered Mandy and Red. The story development made for an exciting third act as the movie had the supernatural biker gang become a formidable adversary for Red. There is even a chainsaw battle between Red and a member of the cult.Nicholas Cage is magnificent in the leading role. I enjoyed his performance as he has the high strung and high octane insanity that his movie requires. Nicholas Cage is perfect as Red Miller and his revenge quest and slipping sanity is portrayed well.I would recommend ""Mandy"", it is a mind-bending tale.Grade: B.",Mandy

That is always the location of a horror movie.Boy these cult members are stranger and stranger. They certainly don't believe in good haircuts.Tell this creep to close his mouth. He even rolls an electric window up and down creepily.No one is going to question where these creeps obtained a jar of blood.Aren't the demons a needless middleman?This could have been a bad short film instead of a bad full length feature.Is bland creep enjoying his tea?!They sure saved on something by repeating dialog repeatedly.Hey, the Predator didn't get him after all.""That was my favorite shirt""... one good line in the entire movie.I mean he's got to burn everything down as he goes right?The best thing I can say about this movie is it sucks.It is not worth to stop scanning through the dialog or the action scenes.The chain on that chainsaw is impractical.

78,MrDHWong,A hypnotic fever dream of nightmarish proportions propelled by a reliably crazy performance from Nicolas Cage,7,25 October 2018,"Mandy is an action horror film co-written and directed by Panos Cosmatos. Starring Nicolas Cage and Andrea Riseborough, it is a hypnotic fever dream of nightmarish proportions propelled by a reliably crazy performance from Cage.In 1983, reclusive couple Red (Nicolas Cage) and Mandy (Andrea Riseborough) live in seclusion in the Shadow Mountains of California. One day, Mandy inadvertently encounters the Children of the New Dawn, a deranged cult of hippies who take a liking to Mandy and later arrange for her to be kidnapped, sending Red into an unrelenting and sadistic rage.Brutal, shocking, and beautifully shot, Mandy unashamedly thrives on its unique premise from beginning to end. The film appears to have been heavily influenced by the work of David Lynch, with its surreal imagery and inventive cinematography, further emphasising the overall dream-like experience. Nicolas Cage is his usual over-the-top self and he demonstrates this several times during the film's second half. This is certainly not for everyone, but fans of surreal artsy films, graphic violence, and Nicolas Cage will find plenty to enjoy.I rate it 7/10",Mandy
79,jmbovan-47-160173,Psychedelic revenge only Nicolas Cage can bring,7,30 March 2020,"The director Panos Cosmatos brings a psychedelic era film into the world of violent bloody revenge. This film evokes a feeling rather than tells a story, and if you aren't of an open mind or strong of heart, this film will be difficult to watch let alone understand. Revenge is the common way of understanding the motivation for what should be seeped with love. Cage brings his wild self to the goriest of his protagonists. Wild, surreal, unbelievable, and heroic. Welcome to the new world via the visuals of Comatos and displayed by Cage.",Mandy
80,ronakkotian,A flawed trippy experience,7,19 June 2019,"Whilst watching Mandy, I felt confused and by the end I was very conflicted with how I felt towards this movie. After some thought, I came to the conclusion that this is a good movie. However, THIS MOVIE ISN'T MADE FOR EVERYONE!On a technical level this film is gorgeous. The colour palette of red, pink, purple and the occasional blue and green is amazing to look at and gives a drug-infused vibe to the movie creating a trippy atmosphere. Panos Cosmatos's directon is fantastic and to some extent the dialogue is symbolic and well thought out. The music is great as it brings an ominous tone and is very reminiscent of 80s horror. Nicolas Cage is excellent as Red as he conveys the pain and dread perfectly whilst also seeking vengeance. There are some comedic elements from Nic Cage's dialogue to help lighten the mood. It also suggests that the film shouldn't be taken as seriously.The main problems I have come from the first half. The first half of the movie comes across as very artsy whereas the second half is filled with bloodshed that's very exciting. Since the first half is more arthouse-like, the pacing is very slow. Personally, I felt quite bored during first half due to how slow it felt. Furthermore, I feel that the script didn't really do much for Cage's character. Not much was really mentioned about him so we don't get a complete idea of what his character is like unlike the cult which is very developed as we're given a clear idea of what they're like.Overall, Mandy does have its flaws with pacing and character but the outstanding visuals, use of colour, acting and direction make this film unique and stand out from the rest of the revenge and grindhouse related movies.",Mandy
81,Aylmer,Critics will love it... but you'll hate it!,6,24 January 2019,"Much like MOTHER from the previous year, this heavily biblically allegorical and stylized film will likely leave you simultaneously impressed, bewildered and bored. While much slower paced, this film boasts a lot more gore, 80's B-movie exploitation thrills and nostalgic charm but it's not as fun as it sounds. As an 80's kid and someone who plays a lot of ""Hotline Miami"" and listens to a lot of Synth Wave, you'd think I would be the primary target audience. Unfortunately, although I found the movie hypnotic at times with a lot of appreciable Tarkovsky and Herzogian overtones, it left me quite cold.Ironically (considering the director's pedigree) the action scenes come as the main letdown. Cosmatos comes off best sticking to the human drama and existential foreboding and seems out of his league when trying to choreograph chainsaw battles and demonic biker attacks. A lot of the cast of character actors bring their A-game but a couple (such as the obese sacrificial victim) ham things up considerably. It tries hard, but it never reaches the fever-dream levels of insanity it aims for, owing largely to a leaden pace and heavily cliche'd 3rd act.Certainly a memorable experience and something that's a little different, MANDY certainly has a lot for critics and stoners to talk about. I just can't say anyone sober and unpretentious will get much out of this opulent 80's rock metal fantasy with not enough metal and even less fantasy.",Mandy
82,mjsreg,Weird and brilliant,8,16 September 2018,"This is a refreshing change from the usual style of film we see coming out of major studios nowadays.It explores, it manipulates, it compels attention until the last frame.This is a film you get lost in and have to pay attention to.The production is brilliant and this is one of the best performances I have ever seen Nicolas Cage do - different and something that seems to have allowed him to explore his talent.Not much more to say without spoilers. But if you want to watch something different and challenging - this could well be for you.If all you are interested in is the tired 'teens in the woods' kind of story this probably won't appeal.",Mandy
83,PyroSikTh,Insane. Emotional. Visually Enrapturing. Johann Johannsson's Final Score. Yes.,9,31 October 2018,"Mandy is, in many ways, a lot like Panos Cosmatos previous film. It's slow and brooding, filled with enrapturing visuals that evoke the late 70s/early 80s, including film grain, image softening, and a broad pallet of primary colours, both driven by synthwave soundtracks, and both also filled with heavy drug use and hallucinations. And yet they're both really different movies. Mandy is more horror, leans heavier on the drug use, and is an altogether more emotionally-charged movie. It takes the crazy and runs with it through to not only its most bizarre, but also to its most humourous. In this way Nicholas Cage is just about the greatest casting choice this year.The story is, on the surface, simplistic. Red and Mandy enjoy a quiet life together in the woods, until a Manson-esque cult comes charging through, summons demonic bikers to abduct Mandy, drug her up, and then murder her in front of Red. Red then embarks on a drug-fuelled journey of revenge, forging his own battleaxe and going to town on anyone and everyone who was involved in the death of his beloved. This allows the movie to fixate more on moments, which can make it feel quite slow, especially during the first hour. It gets you invested in Red and Mandy's way of life, it lifts the curtain behind the mindset of the cult and its leader, and draws out the home invasion to the point it becomes uncomfortable and disturbing. These moments are also baked with tiny hints to something larger that are a little harder to pick up on, and turns it into a movie I'm already craving to watch again, so I can stitch it together and digest other ways of interpreting the film.Of course being a Cosmatos film, Mandy is filled to the brim with exquisite visuals that stick in the mind. So much so that barely five minutes into the film's runtime I had to turn off all the lights in the house to ensure I was getting the maximum effect. I wanted to drown in the imagery. The use of film grain and softening the imagery with LEDs shone directly at the cameras instantly teleport you back to the old films of the 70s and 80s. The use of colour is second-to-none, bathing almost half the film entirely in a bold red hue, evoking the bloodshed, emphasising the romance, and acting as a visual cue to Red, himself aptly named.But the film goes even further, putting a huge portion of its creativity into the visual medium. Much of the movie is depicted as part of multiple drug trips, and Cosmatos makes this abundantly clear by changing visual styles, adding unique camera effects in post-production, and putting the film's visual identity solely into a room by itself. Mandy's drug-induced state as she's introduced to Jeremiah Sand turns the whole movie red, and every movement trails back in blues and purples. The voices around her distort and contort. As Sand attempts to indoctrinate her into the cult, his face and hers seamlessly blend into one another so perfectly and subtly that it takes you a moment to realise it's even happening. Red's dreams are also animated, separating them even further from a reality that's already uncertain, and filled with symbolic imagery that'll take a few viewings to fully dissect.Johann Johannsson's final score is also fantastic. It's his usual brand of atmospheric synths mixed with heavy metal guitar drones, and it fits the film so perfectly. He manages to make the moments between Red and Mandy beautiful and whimsical, full of fantasy potential, but also brings it down to such a suffocating dark state during Red's rampage. I'm glad his final score was for Mandy, as it's a film custom made for some of his best work.Something I didn't quite expect from Mandy though was the sheer quality of the acting performances. Nicholas Cage and Linus Roache each knock it completely out of the park. Cage's performance is initially really subdued, but once Sand and his cult come in, he starts to let out his inner cage, with the psychotic smile and wide eyes, the vagrant cocaine-sniffing, the enthusiastic yells and shouts filled with passion, and almost cheesy one-liners. One scene in particular stands out as possible the best piece of acting I've ever seen from him. He staggers into the bathroom after Mandy's murder, grabs a bottle of vodka, and starts downing it, pouring it over his wounds, and shouting and shouting, each time changing fluidly between pain, anger, desperation, sadness, and grief. Red is a truly broken man, and this one moment of Cage's acting encapsulates it perfectly without saying a word.Likewise Linus Roache gives a fantastic performance as Jeremiah Sand. He's a truly narcissistic villain, obsessed with Mandy, and Roache gives him an edge bordering on psychosis. His monologuing as he attempts to indoctrinate Mandy is a damn fine example of what this man is capable of, and willing to do for his art. He bares everything he has, full frontal, flitting between charming and horrifying with a snap. He's so full of himself, in his belief that he is the messiah, and yet brought so low by Mandy herself he doubts himself just long enough for it to break him.If I had a criticism of Mandy, it's again the pacing was a little off, but only a little. I loved the long, drawn-out moments at the beginning. They just swarmed you with imagery and emotions to a point it's hard not to get invested, but once Red begins his killing spree, it just feels like it's all over a little too quickly. He goes from one perpetrator to the next, descending faster and faster into a darker state of being, at such a speed that the sense of moments is lost. He tracks down the bikers with no problem, goes straight to their LSD cook without any research required to find him, and then straight on to the Church of the New Dawn, where he carves his way through the cultists as if they were wrapping paper. I would've liked more insanity, more bloodshed, more impact with each killing. This really is only a small niggle though, and by no means ruined my enjoyment of the film.Mandy is yet another slam-dunk for Panos Cosmatos, and I really hope I don't have to wait another eight years for his third film. The use of colour, animation, post-processing effects, and camerawork is off the chain, creating a true feast for the eyes that's hard to forget. The music and sound design is hypnotic and like being drowned in a wave of sound. The story is simplistic and yet deeply symbolic and complex creating multiple layers of enjoyment. I can see me watching this movie fairly often just to digest over and over and lose myself in a whole other world or surreality. I give Mandy a mind-melting 9/10.",Mandy
84,namstonk,Really!!! Too many people talk twaddle,6,14 September 2018,"Ok, let's get this straight, it's a revenge horror film, nothing else.

Nicholas Cage i haven't never ever seen him like this in my life been that quiet and crazy full of cage of rage, i was surprised when this come out theater. this was fun experience in theater and strange experience as well. now in this film Nicholas Cage is scripted but not a lot he doesn't talk a lot in this movie he doesn't he gets maybe around 30 lines when he talks but rest of it, feels like watching a quiet place but in a gore, full on evil staff, full on violence. but he delivers his performance and what did to his character was fantastic. now i can say i like Nicholas Cage like Con Air, The Rock, Snake Eyes, Windtalkers, Gone in 60 Seconds REMAKE, Lord of War, Ghost Rider 1&2, Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, Drive Angry was the last movie i liked then after he has been doing garbage movies. but this film was so good i enjoyed it this was a lot fun, bloody, very unforgettable film you wanna watch over 50 times or more. believe this movie is great comeback from Nicholas cage.story follows simple plot Red Miller (Nicholas Cage) is a Red works as a logger Red appears to be a recovering alcoholic. his girlfriend Mandy (Andrea Riseborough) known for Shadow Dancer, Brighton Rock, Oblivion. Mandy works at has a day job as a cashier at a nearby gas station in the woods. they live in seclusion in the Shadow Mountains of California. She creates elaborate fantasy art. one day later Mandy walks past a van carrying the Children of the New Dawn, a deviant hippie cult led by Jeremiah Sand
(Linus Roache) known for Hart's War, The Chronicles of Riddick, Batman Begins, Non-Stop. i am not a fan of him but i think he is good actor but he is ok villain he is main villain of this movie his character is a a deviant hippie cult driving a hippie van full of children but they are psycho's Brother Swan, to kidnap Mandy encounters the Children of the New Dawn, a deranged cult of hippies who take a liking to Mandy now in scene what got me blind and bored when Linus Roache talking front of your face like in 10 minutes or something then he is breaking fourth fall starring at camera that what annoy's me. but after Mandy died Nicholas cage goes FULL ON RAGE MODE like he is in revenge mode to kill every single psycho's, he makes his own weapon his own AXE like it's badass looking battle axes Add Cocaine in because he lost his mind shrieks in agony, grief, and rage.you have scene of Caruthers (Bill Duke) know for Predator (1987), Commando, Exit Wounds, National Security, The Big Bang, Red fetches ""the reaper,"" his crossbow, Caruthers provides him with freshly crafted arrows and information on the Black Skulls. now Bill Duke isn't much in movie. then Red makes his own badass looking Battle Axe start going around killing black skulls and cult all of them he didn't even let ever single one of them alive. chainsaw scene was GREAT WELL DONE FILMING Brother Klopek in a chainsaw duel scene Nicholas cage got normal chainsaw but another guy got one massive long as chainsaw that showdown you won't ever forget. film director has put his first step to his door to this movie director Panos Cosmatos also he is screenwriter made one film Beyond the Black Rainbow now to this masterpiece as well he is son of Geroge Cosmatos who made Rambo First Blood Part II, Cobra, Tombstone, Leviathan. made great movies that i am fan of this is film is a masterpiece full on the horror the violence it's full on high strong R RATED STYLE OF FILM Really liked how this looked, sounded and felt. Visuals and colors just like in Only god forgives, Blade Runner 2049. Visuals and Colors are just outstanding and that was something that hooked me from the start, really trippy stuff in a good way. Music and sounds were pushing this dark overall sinister feel and worked perfectly. this should been a grindhouse movie rather then having Werewolf woman of SS, i mean this movie is a smart made looking backyard of John Carpenter films mixed with Sam Raimi Evil Dead. a masterful, dark, yet serene visualization through its entire run and despite the overwhelming plethora of techniques used to create such provoking imagery it is executed with such nuance that the intensity of its visuals are coupled with subtlety in a way I have never quite experience before.

86,socrates99,The most satisfying horror movie I've ever seen,9,15 December 2018,"I'm not a horror fan. When I do watch them I like movies like The Shining and and Hellraiser where there's an imaginative take on evil. This movie fits in very well in that group but on a level all its own. There's something very intelligent in the director's approach though I can't describe it well. Maybe students of cinema will have more to say about it. I do know it didn't have me feeling nervous or jumpy when it was done despite some truly harrowing scenes.The plot is not very complicated, Nicholas Cage, as a happily married man, finds himself and his wife the victims of some truly psychotic killers. He then proceeds to hunt them down. It's an old familiar story, but the director, Panos Cosmatos, makes it seem fresh again. The scenes with the bad guys are memorably intense. And though there's a touch of the supernatural here, it's clearly just a way of expressing the depravity being contemplated, and not really an element of the plot.I wondered for a second when it was done whether perhaps someone like Bruce Willis might not have been a better choice for Nicholas Cage's part, but after a brief moment I was sure Mr. Cage was the better choice for this part. He does a wonderful job. Kudos to him for being willing to do this movie, though it is reminiscent of Ghost Rider, it is far more emotionally engaging.",Mandy
87,maxglen,Just one of those films...,7,6 August 2020,"This film is not going to be for everyone, it's an extremely stylist, surreal and a fair amount of the time, disturbing film. but there's just something about it I kind of admire. I love the sort of otherworldly, lovecraftian vibe to the world and how it often feels like you're looking at an unfinished puzzle, very few things are ever fully explained and honestly I didn't feel like they needed to be. It is a very straight forward revenge tale, and it's through this simplicity at its core that allows it to take bold steps in different directions without ever completely losing you (unless this isn't your sort of film in which you'll be lost from the first few frames) but, If like me you are an open minded individual and or enjoy watching a man fight demons? With a chainsaw and a funky looking axe then you will probably like this movie. Also can I say that everyone gave 100% in this movie, the acting is crazy but everyone bounces off each other so well it just works and the visuals, the soundtrack... top notch stuff. I'm gonna give it a 7",Mandy
88,p-jonsson,"Weird, psychedelic and somewhat enjoyable.",6,30 March 2019,"This is one weird movie. I have to confess that I am quite a fan of Nicholas Cage. I know he has made more than his share of really crappy movies but I can not help myself. When I see a movie with him in the lead role I still have to watch it. This movie is one of those.There are definitely some interesting cinematic aspects to this movie. As a piece of cinematic art I would say that it is not bad at all. However, it is definitely weird and whoever wrote this script, well he was on drugs when he wrote it, there is no doubt in my mind about that.It is part a grindhouse movie in the spirit of Tarantino and Rodriguez and part a far out psychedelic visual experience. I do not regret watching it. It was a experience if nothing else. Was it a good movie in general? No, not really. The 3 out of 5 score from me is barely and it is largely due to the cinematics, a few cool (and violent) scenes and Nicholas Cage.The movie seems to focus on delivering one weird scene after another. There is not really any explanation to most things. I especially would have liked to know more about and get more of a conclusion on this (supernatural?) bike gang. But they just show up and then they kind of disappear from the story.The main bad-guy is an absolute nut-case but we never really get to understand what drives this weirdo. He has created some cult with a few followers but that is about it. His demise, although satisfactory, is just a show of insanity.In short the movie is a mix of heavy metal, horror, violence and psychedelic weirdness and I would say that the audience for this movie is a quite small group of people. I'm not really sure that I am in that group.",Mandy

You can't even see anything in the movie and really the director made scenes so long of nothing to keep it from being an after school 30 minutes flick! He'll probably could condense this into. 15 minute special. Worthless! Save the time and spend on something 1,000 times better!",Mandy
93,jamiedarlow-37510,'YOU RIPPED MY SHIRRRRT!!',7,18 February 2020,"In equal parts a good and frustrating watch. But the good outweighs the bad! The story follows couple Mandy (Andrea Riseborough) and Red (Nicolas Cage) who live in peace out in their very own remote cabin in the wilderness. All is well until Mandy is spotted out walking by a passing stranger who happens to be a psychotic cult leader and sends a group of menacing biker-monsters (awesomely resembling the cenobites from Hellraiser!) to capture her. Needless to say, it is certainly a unique film visually and I think there are certain camera shots which are absolute masterpieces in themselves (beautiful serene shot of Mandy and Red on a boat in the middle of the lake) the cinematography by Benjamin Loeb is mesmerising! The title cards in the film are also randomly brilliant; the opening credit appears half way through the film and as an awesome death metal logo! The performances are incredible too; Nicolas Cage provides one of his most delightfully crazy and emotional roles! The bathroom scene half way through is just wonderfully visceral, so rewatchable and might just be Cage's best acting to date; from angry, to distraught, all back to angry again in wonderful crazy Cage fashion! Andrea Riseborough is great and very cool as Mandy; there's a certain ethereal quality that projects from her when she's on screen and she portrays someone with a very troubled past extremely well. The soundtrack by the late great Johann Johannsson is also a highlight; great John Carpenter-esque vibe adding to its gritty but stylish 80s aesthetic. The kills that Red commits are wonderfully twisted and fun to watch! Unfortunately it's the story that feels quite plodding at certain points; particularly when spending time with the cult themselves who are very grating to watch and it does let the side down. It is an overlong film and I think with half an hour cut out it could have been much better! Nevertheless, worth a watch for the insane performances, beautiful imagery and a pretty trippy experience",Mandy
94,Med-Jasta,Contrived,1,5 August 2020,"Wow. Having heard about this movie for years I was prepared for something insane. But with the praise this received I thought this movie would be genuine. I was wrong. Oh and how wrong I was.Everything that happened was forced and tried to be weird. Nothing was natural. It felt like they ignored their instincts at every step just to be weird. Panos took all of the wrong notes during David Lynch movies. Not understanding why the surrealist style works. Only seeing that it was cool. Lynch uses it as an accent or when the story calls for it. Not the whole movie. Style only goes as far as the story or the talent that uses it.Every shot is held for too long and just when your expectations rise for something to happen, cut, and nothing happens. Another rookie mistake is that so many dialogue scenes are one shot so there is nothing to cut to after the movie is made and you are stuck with this take and can't create a pace to the movie.Title cards? Does that ever work? Frasier is about it. This movie is very self aware and dives right into it to create complete garage by a talentless hack that thinks he's the greatest director to ever stand behind a camera.I don't get people that like this. The movie is so slow and contrived. I think people will like anything that's different or anything that might be smarter than them. They don't want to say they didn't like it in fear of looking dumb by ""not getting it.""And why it it such a thing in movies these days to play source music instead of their own? Movies are popular because of their ability to make a good mix. I think people will like movies just because they play their favorite songs and subconsciously they like the movie.It seems like directors now are more interested in homaging pop culture then they are making something original. This movie really makes a lot of references to other movies and music for no good reason.You don't need to go far out to make a good movie you just have to do it well. And the style will come from that. Not the other way around.",Mandy

98,flicklover,A stunning expression of violent insanity.,9,1 December 2018,"I had seen so many great reviews of this film all year that I had really high expectations for it. The reviews were calling it brilliant, violent and unforgettable. After seeing it I can say that my expectations were mostly met. The film is mostly a marvel to look at. Director Panos Cosmatos has a very beautiful and haunting visual style that makes this film into a full on nightmare world.Even though it has a pretty thin storyline it manages to grab the viewer right away. The setup is simple, but the execution is not. It is a revenge story unlike any I've seen before. Nicolas Cage stars as Red a logger that lives in a secluded house in the woods with his girlfriend Mandy played by Andrea Riseborough. They lead a quiet life. There are signs that both of them have led troubled lives but they deeply love each other. One day when she is walking to work at a nearby gas station she passes by a van carrying a a deviant hippie cult led by Jeremiah. He sees Mandy and is struck by her beauty. He later orders on of his disciples to kidnap her. He enlists a demonic biker gang to help in taking Mandy. They enter the couple's house and abduct them. Once captured two cult female members drug Mandy before they take her to Jeremiah. Once they present her to him, Jeremiah starts to speak to speak to her in front of his followers, trying to seduce her by telling her that God had told him to take from the world anything he wanted. Also he puts on a record of music performed by him. he was a failed musician. She the starts laughing, ridiculing Jeremiah. This enrages him so much that he goes outside where Red is tied up and gagged and stabs him. He also has Mandy burned alive in front of him. Jeremiah and his followers leave Red tied up and drive off. Red is able to get loose. After seeing that there is nothing left of Mandy but ashes he goes home. After falling asleep he wakes up from a frightening dream he goes to the bathroom and takes out a bottle of vodka and drinks it while crying out in grief and rage. He goes to see a friend that has his crossbow. His friend knows that Red is going out for revenge and tells Red that he will most likely die. Red then forges a battle ax and goes out to find all of those involved in killing Mandy. What happens next is predictable, after all this is a revenge story. Red finds his prey one by one and kills them in increasingly violent fashion.What is different here is the way the story is presented. Cosmatos creates a world that is horrifying but beautiful. The film is like a nightmare hallucination. The story may be familiar but the stunning visuals are definitely unique. Nicolas Cage is perfect as Red. The actor has played very disturbing characters in the past, but this time he goes for broke in showing Red's grief and violent insanity. The other cast members are also very good, especially Linus Roache as Jeremiah. He is appropriately evil and egotistical in the role. Many have complained that the film is all about the style, with no substance. Though I have to agree that it isn't focused on character development and plot the world that is presented is so unique and insane that you can't take your eyes off of it. I'm sure that MANDY will be considered a cult classic very soon!",Mandy
99,ritera1,Extremely interesting and riveting.,9,31 May 2021,"I couldn't turn away. 10 out of 10 is essentially impossible but 9 is too low for this.Completely self-indulgent of the director, Panos Cosmatos, but it worked a vast majority of the time. Although extremely slow (to ALMOST where it was too much), each scene was riddled with electricity and tour-de-force acting. Broke every rule and that was just fine.Could have solidified Cage's love for Mandy much more early on, which would have then driven home the revenge. The whole thing left a lot of questions and speculation but was not bothered by it. Although the hero, Cage's character was left idle for over an hour. Some staple, seen-before character elements and revenge story but done this time exceedingly well. Far more a director's movie than an original story.(It was stupid for Cage's character to throw his cigarette into the forest twice.)Had heard of Panos Cosmatos' work but was startled that his resume is so short. Only 2 features 8 years apart. This is 3 years old and nothing coming up. Someone with this depth of talent should be working more.But, at the same time, I can see where the audience for this would be very limited. And the film business is a business. I've seen other examples of great work that didn't do well financially and the directors have hardly worked since or not worked again. Sad.",Mandy
100,Darkjak007,You rip my shirt!!,5,23 October 2021,"A Man named Red Miller(Nicolas Cage) who along with his girlfriend Mandy(Andrea Riseborough) lives out in the woods alone and happy. Until one day Mandy unintentionally grabs the attention of a hippie cult leader named Jeremiah and they break into their house and kidnap them both. I'm for anything that's has the cage man in it Regardless if it his worst or his best it's always entertaining. How I would describe this film is that it a metal music video on acid. To call it a movie doesn't really feel right yes it feature length over two hours. But for the most part it doesn't add anything really just feels like a geinune plot more occupied with the showing strange visuals and it kind of goes into somebody spoiler the first half hour of the movie is more focused on Mandy, the cult interest in in her and her and red. While they open with some nice scenery shots and get introduces the characters. It just feels slow and very boring how much is happening until about 35 minutes. Which is an action movie does pick up because ends up happening Mandy ends up dying then Red go on a murder spree of revenge hunting down these cultist. It's here where the movie has the best moments Nicolas Cage cage has famous freak out saints it is hands-down the best reason to watch this movie. The Cults weird but they don't have any identity outside of that. Mandy I can say honestly I didn't really feel much for when she is sacrificed because she doesn't leave much of an impact. She's just boring most memorable thing about her is her creepy stares which I don't know was probably intentional. Production design itself is very surreal and colorful the use of pink and red Is bold and Bounces off the bodies of the characters. The use of certain effects like motion blur in contrast to the color Does add a very psychedelic trippy vibe. However there is way too many Lens flares in this so strong to the point, it begins to be a strain not only on your eyes. It also makes it difficult to make out some of the scenery or the characters. But the gore and the metal music is great it just it really does lack in the story in favor of visuals.",Mandy

My favourite film of all time, Dead Man's Shoes, is a revenge thriller. I guess Mandy is also a revenge thriller - but you could not get two different films. Mandy is a psychedelic head-*uc* of a film from start to finish. But that's no bad thing. Andrea Risebrough is Nicholas Cage's wife. Through all the dream like sequences that may well have been lost on me, they're clearly very much in love. A bunch of bible bashing, highly halloucinegised travelling bikers come into town and things get somewhat out of hand. Suffice to say that Nicholas needs to take the law into his own hands, to often hilarious effect. Easily passed the 6 laugh test, whether it was meant to or not, and Nicholas Cage was on top form.

His stage play approach to movie acting fits perfectly. This surreal carnage movie might have been a bit better with Sam Raimi involved though. Nevermind. The whole story is simple, yet a bit off. Artistic somewhat, one could say. Entertaining if you're in a mood for such experience. Writer/director is pretty good with writing, yet direction of Mr. Cosmatos needs a bit work in order to achieve necessary refinement. The pace is uneven, for starters. So much space for dead pan humor, yet none in sight. I hope next movie will be ""the one"". No recommendation. This is a kind of movie for which a personal experience is a must.

107,itsbobr,"Very Bloody, NOT Entertaining",5,31 October 2018,"In 1983, in the Pacific Northwest, Lumberjack Red Miller (Nicolas Cage) and girl friend Mandy (Andrea Riseborough) are invaded by insane bikers (Called Jesus-freaks later by Red) led by Cult Leader Jeremiah Sand (Linus Roache) intent on kidnapping Mandy as he is obsessed with her, and later tortures Red. After healing somewhat, Red sees red (Ha, good one!) and goes after the Jesus-freak bikers and the rest of the movie is a bloody revengeful thriller.Maybe this is too bloody, but this is what we have. Seems the Hollywood know-it-alls are too intent on keeping up with teen bloody gore movies than normal ones mostly because those stories sell pretty good.The first 25-minutes of this seems like this will be a very artsy dreamlike world and one wonders where this will go. Then Mandy is kidnapped and later hanged and burned in front of Red. She is hanged because she laughed at Jerimiah when he exposed himself to her. This is 2-hours long.This is not an entertaining movie and is not recommended at all. When Red goes after Jeremiah and friends this becomes quite bloody not pleasant to watch.Red does make a weapon that looks something like the Klingons would be proud of and later uses it along with the Crossbow given to him by Caruthers (Bill Duke) who gives only one condition: that it be put to good use. Since Red is a Lumberjack, I kept waiting for Red to use a Chainsaw as a weapon and he does, but his opponent has a longer one. Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.All scenes are in darkness and the movie continues with that dreamlike quality and sometimes it's hard to see exactly what is going on, but you do get the idea. Have to admit, the cinematography is excellent regardless of the nature of the story. And, don't forget about the maddening whispering scenes with Mandy in the beginning. (wha she say?) No one knows.Truth be told, Nicolas Cage delivers an Oscar-Worthy performance even though we were not amused with the story. Let's see if he gets nominated. Cage's performance and the cinematography help get a better rating from me.Sadly, there is nothing here for the Nicolas Cage Impersonators to get a grip on. There are very few dialogues when Red goes after the bad guys, and that is okay since no one could make out what anyone says anyway. Sort of garbled banter like talking on the surface of water in a pool. (Hey, it can be done)Notables: Disciples of Jeremiah: Ned Dennehy as Brother Swan; Olwen Fouere as Mother Marlene; and Line Pillet as Sister Lucy.So now I have to be more careful of Nicolas Cage movies (Like you do for John Cusack movies, too?), but I still like hlm. Yeah Cusack, too. (5/10)Violence: Yes.
Sex: Yes, seen on a TV screen.
Nudity: Yes. And Full frontal of Jeremiah.
Humor: No.
Language: Yes.

108,TheVictoriousV,A methodical descent followed by fun madness (copied from my blog with my own permission),8,29 December 2018,"When I saw Mandy for the first time, I was completely alone in my folks' summer home in preparation for another bad movie marathon (Wiseau, Breen and ""shark films"" often feature during these) the following day. 'Twas a dark October night, I had been driving for nearly an hour through virtually nothing but forest, and once I had unpacked everything and lit a fire, I decided to put something on for myself. I could not have made a more perfect pick and the atmosphere could not have been a better complement.Mandy is thin on character and plot, but in terms of sheer style, it's one of the most thoroughly encapsulating nightmares ever dreamt by any director of horror. It begins with a slow and methodical descent into the pit (the shots are tinted with beautiful yet evil colors and bikers that look like Cenobites appear), until a woman (Andrea Riseborough) is sacrificed by a fanatical hippie cult, and Nicolas Cage is prompted to take gruesome revenge on monsters both human and... not so human. Strangely, chainsaw fencing and ""death by head-squeezing"" don't seem out-of-place.Mandy is a truly hellish voyage. The music by late Jóhann Jóhannsson, which mixes electronic sounds with those typical of the 1980's (be they ""synth"" or metal), enhances the experience greatly and its episodic structure is not the only reason it has been compared to an 80's metal album. It is shot on film too, so if you're into classic horror yet desire a one-of-a-kind trip, why are you still reading?",Mandy

111,Bertaut,Entertainingly insane,7,31 October 2018,"Equal parts psychotropic horror and grindhouse revenge thriller, Mandy is what you might get if David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, and Andrei Tarkovsky teamed up to remake Death Wish (1974) in the style of a Giallo. The second feature from director and co-writer Panos Cosmatos, after the interesting, but not entirely convincing Beyond the Black Rainbow (2010), Mandy is a psychedelic experience in pretty much every way, and as midnight-y as a midnight B-movie could possibly be. And although it would be impossible to recommend to everyone, there is an undeniable brilliance here. An insane brilliance. But a brilliance none-the-less. Although it could (somewhat legitimately) be accused of too much style and not enough substance, Cosmatos pitch-perfectly mixes an expressionist aesthetic with horror tropes, a generic revenge narrative, and comedy beats. But let's face it, the reason most people will see the film is for Nicolas Cage, and in that sense, Mandy joins the ranks of films such as Vampire's Kiss (1988), The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans (2009), and Mom and Dad (2017) in giving Cage an organic, narratively justified reason to go full-Cage, digging deep into his reservoir of utter insanity. And that's never a bad thing.Set in ""1983 A.D."", the film tells the story of Red Miller (Cage), and his girlfriend, aspiring fantasy artist Mandy Bloom (Andrea Riseborough), who live a simple secluded life in the Shadow Mountains, in a cabin on the banks of Crystal Lake. Hugely supportive of one another, it's hinted that Red may have been an alcoholic and/or drug addict in his youth, whilst Mandy has a significant facial scar, possibly the result of a troubled childhood, which she alludes to from time to time. All is calm in their life until Mandy is spotted by the Children of the New Dawn, a religious cult led by failed folk singer Jeremiah Sand (Linus Roache). Taken with Mandy's beauty, Sand tells his right-hand-man, Brother Swan (Ned Dennehy), that he wants Mandy, saying ""you know what to do."" Using the ""Horn of Abraxas"", Swan summons the Black Skulls, a trio of demonic bikers addicted to a highly potent form of LSD, and along with the Skulls, the Children invade Red and Mandy's cabin, tying Red up in barbed wire outside, and leaving him for dead. Meanwhile, two female Children, Mother Marlene (Olwen Fouéré) and Sister Lucy (Line Pillet), drug Mandy with LSD and venom from a giant wasp, before presenting her to Sand. Singing his own song, ""Amulet of the Weeping Maze"", Sand attempts to seduce Mandy, but things quickly go awry when he proves unable to get an erection. Unbeknownst to the Children, however, Red has survived and set out in pursuit of both the cult and the Skulls.One of the things that will jump out at you as you watch Mandy is that Cosmatos packs the narrative with an extraordinary amount of cultural references, some oblique, others more obvious. Prior to hearing any dialogue, there is an audio extract of President Ronald Reagan speaking about how the vast majority of Americans are disgusted by porn. Mandy's art is not dissimilar to the work of Roger Dean, whilst the film's animated sections (of which there are several) recall the kind of material found in Heavy Metal. Indeed, the general aesthetic of the film is equal parts Bat Out of Hell and Iron Maiden. The Children of the New Dawn cult is obviously inspired by the Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ and the Manson Family, with Sand himself part Jim Jones, part Charles Manson, and part Dan Fogelberg. The home invasion scene bears more than a passing resemblance to similar such scenes in The Last House on the Left (1972) and Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986), whilst the revenge narrative has something of the original Mad Max (1979) about it. The film also recalls Valhalla Rising (2009) in places. Sand's ""Amulet of the Weeping Maze"" is inspired by the work of The Carpenters (which he admits himself). Red is seen wearing a Mötley Crüe t-shirt, and tells an awesome Erik Estrada/CHiPs (1977) joke. During a discussion about which planet is their favourite, Mandy selects Jupiter, but Red argues for Galactus. The Black Skulls are obviously inspired by the Cenobites from Hellraiser (1987). The Children's A-frame chapel resembles the church in There Will Be Blood (2007). This is as culturally-literate a film as you're likely to see all year, and as much as the narrative exists in a kind of shattered-mirror version of reality, these references do help ground it, even if many of them are purposely anachronistic.Mandy gets off to a cracking start by using the old Universal logo, complete with scratches and dirt on the celluloid. It follows that up with the most pseudo-John Carpenter 80s music imaginable, composed by Jóhann Jóhannsson, in one of his last compositions prior to his untimely death, with guitar chords played by Stephen O'Malley of Sunn 0))). To give you an idea of the type of music featured throughout the film, there's an early shot moving across the forest scored to King Crimson's ""Starless"". Indeed, the score is almost another character entirely, and the film simply wouldn't work half as well if the music wasn't as good.Aside from the music, the most immediately attention-grabbing aspect of the film is the use of colour, with director of photography Benjamin Loeb's compositions bathed in deep purples, reds, indigos, yellows, greens, and oranges, with the occasional blue (primarily associated with Mandy herself). Often the colours are non-diegetic and unexplained (for example the Horn of Abraxas always appears in green light, irrespective of location). The cinematography also employs a plethora of subjective techniques, such as double lens flares, animation, slow-motion fades and dissolves, telephoto shots, what can only be described as psychedelic lighting, and a hell of a lot of dry ice.Very much a film of two halves, if the first brings us to the gates of hell, the second pushes us in and slams the gates shut behind us. The first half runs up until just prior to the beginning of Red's revenge, whilst the second depicts that revenge. The first half focuses primarily on Mandy, with Red very much a supporting character, whilst the second, obviously, focuses on him. However, it's not just in terms of narrative content in which the two halves differ, they are also aesthetically different, particularly the editing rhythms. The first is languid and dream-like, almost graceful, whilst the second is like something out of Dante Alighieri or William Blake, filtered through H.R. Giger on acid. The two halves are divided by an extraordinary single-shot 45-second scene of Red (wearing only underpants and a t-shirt) pouring vodka all over his wounds, drinking what's left, and screaming. It's a scene of extraordinarily raw emotion that works brilliantly, partly because scenes like it are so rare. You simply don't often see a male protagonist this vulnerable. This is Mandy's ""suit up"" scene, and here is Cage crying like a starving baby. It's a brave choice by both actor and director, and it works perfectly both as a stand-alone scene and as a transition from the first to the second half of the film. Indeed, it's not beyond the realms of possibility that one could read Mandy, at least in part, as a meditation on the destructive nature of profound grief, and if so, that interpretation begins right here. Yes, there is more than a hint of an archetypal dualistic cosmology underpinning Red's revenge, particularly Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism, but so too is it a deeply personalised quest.Especially in the second half of the film (and particularly in the last few minutes), Cosmatos strives to place us in Red's head, which has the effect of elevating the carnage beyond that of your standard ultra-violent revenge movie. As Red's mission progresses, and he becomes more and more unhinged, so too does the film become less and less interested in what we would refer to as reality, introducing such aspects as cannibalism, a bow named ""The Reaper"" and arrows which ""cut through bone like a fat kid through cake"", a chemist who can smell where the Black Skulls are, a stoned tiger, eels, a cigarette being lit via a flaming body part, choking via knife, (several) decapitations, a chainsaw duel, a church in the forest with secret underground passages, a skull crushing, hallucinations, even a cosmic event.There are some problems, however. For starters, it's kind of disappointing when you realise that for all its technical prowess and fascinating aesthetic gymnastics, when it comes down to it, Mandy is just a revenge flick, and at just over two hours, it tends to drag a little in places. The screenplay can also be too on the nose at times. For example, early in the film, Mandy tells a story about her father attempting to force her to kill a baby starling that proves tonally prophetic in the way only stories in films ever are. Additionally, the script (by Cosmatos and Aaron Stewart-Ahn) doesn't give Red a huge amount of depth.Is there an element of the emperor's new clothes about the entire endeavour? Yes, to a certain extent there is. And, yes, most of the best bits are in the trailer (or at least are spoiled by the trailer - the chainsaw duel would have been much funnier if I hadn't known it was coming). And yes, it's all kind of pointless. However, love it or loathe it, there's no denying that it's brilliantly assembled. As an audio-visual experience, it's unlike anything I've seen in a long time, and it's almost certainly destined for cult status.",Mandy
112,MJB784,"I found the movie visually well made, but boring and frustrating.",6,16 March 2019,I had trouble following it. What did the monster with claws have to do with it? Why did the cult burn his girlfriend. What was the reason for the chapter stops and animated scenes?,Mandy
113,dormesher-21565,Great movie experience and great Nicolas Cage performance,8,25 September 2018,"Watched Mandy last night and I really enjoyed it very good film and a great performance by Nicolas Cage the style of this movie was very interesting to see including animation scenes to tell the story and a very Gothic style for a movie and something different for Nicolas Cage.The acting by Nicolas Cage is brilliant and one of his best performance he managed to bring every emotion to the screen most of the time without even saying a word the scene that comes to mind is after his wife has been killed by the cult and he is at home drinking a full bottle of Vodka and he's screaming then getting angry showing pretty much all the forms of grieve in one scene without even saying a word moments like that are the reason I love this actor and have been a fan of him for ages.How he gets revenge is very brutal and amazing to watch and weapon he makes looks epic and definitely one of the coolest weapon's I've seen in a film.The only thing I don't like is the woman actor who plays his wife didn't really do it for me wasn't a fan of her acting it just seemed a bit off I don't know maybe I'm wrong but she just didn't crab me with her performance.
Also sometimes the main villain was a bit over top sometimes I understand he is supposed to be like that being in a cult and everything but sometimes it was a bit distracting to watch and stood out as something not that good in a very good movie.Verdict 8/10 great movie and a fantastic performance by Nicolas Cage. However the some over top moments from the villain seem out of place and the woman actress didn't crab me.",Mandy
114,baywoodarborist,7 for funny entertainment,8,24 September 2019,"For all those who really praise the film in a serious way, I have to smirk. I watched it with my adult son and we had a good time making fun of it. I'm an arborist and the VERY first scene screws up terribly. Nicholas is holding a chainsaw so very awkwardly. It obvious that was the first time he's had one in his hand. He's supposed be to dropping a tree. It's obvious that the saw is dull, there's no saw dust coming out, he's not cutting anything, the scene is SO fake, so I was laughing before the film even started. My favorite part of the film is when he sings ""you cut my shirt"". He talks about it in an interview how the signing was some art, whatever. I'm serious I hope Nicholas is ok because he was dead serious and that's mentally ill stuff right there. I'm not being flippant, I seriously hope he's doing ok. Anyway this movie was so bad it was Good.",Mandy
115,Saiph90,Can not think of one thing I liked.,1,18 March 2019,"Vengeance movies are as old as Westerns but this one had chainsaws. I realise this is a stylised film were the actors are encouraged to really over act, Nicholas Cage is not a quiet actor so I can see why he accepted the film. The story is simple a couple living a quiet life in the woods have their world shattered by a crazy gang with a leader who has a god complex, he is helped by some strange medically distorted biker gang. They burn her in front of him and he then spends the rest of the movie killing them in various gratuitous ways. At times the acting is laughable, Nicholas Cage in his y fronts drinking a bottle of alcohol while howling had us simply laughing. There is no script of note, we have an early barely comprehensible dialogue about planets, as Nicholas Cage does tend to mumble I struggled to understand what he was saying, as the film was so bad I was not that bothered. Over this weekend I also watched a really bad found footage and I am struggling to think what was worse. Awful film and how people can give it 10 must be down to drug intake.",Mandy
116,L_Copa,"Wow, didn't expect it so awful...",1,1 October 2018,"I love Cage but this is just for the money... And i don't blame him... The movie was terrible in directing, zero in scenario, zero in everything. It is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Nothing holds you there. Not even a good acting, because Cage doesn't play that much. I advise you not to see it and i believe that all those people that say it's a masterpiece are just crazy.",Mandy
117,d_m_s,6/10 pretty much purely for the aesthetics,6,10 June 2019,"From an aesthetics point of view, Mandy was an exceptional film. The visuals were great throughout and it's one to be viewed on as big a screen as possible, like other visually stunning films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Blade Runner. Mandy has lots of visually interesting references to other films, from the sublime (such as the two noted above) and all the way down to ultra low budget b-movies like Nightbeast.The scene where Cage's wife is drugged is equally mesmerising and horrendous to watch, as it induces such a nauseating yet compelling surreal experience.The music is also fantastic and reminded me somewhat of Blade Runner, as well as other soundtracks I couldn't quite put my finger on.So the visuals, music and atmosphere of the film are great but the storyline was lacking so I think a second viewing would be a struggle. I can imagine if I tried watching it again it would be for the visuals only, which would mean I could skip the first 30 mins or so before the good stuff kicks in and even then I would fast forward through bits.The reason I felt the story fell short is because it was just too basic and lacking in any kind of suspense or believability. The story plods along rather uneventfully and more importantly and most shamefully, Nic Cage is able to go on a revenge mission with little obstacle. He seems to know the right people, have access to the right weapons and/or tools to make new weapons, is an accomplished fighter (which we had no idea of beforehand so it's kind of like one of those daft things you see in films where someone suddenly becomes a ninja out of nowhere) and is able to pick off the bad guys one by one with no real challenge or threat to his mission. This means the conflict scenes are lacking in excitement and feel a bit pointless. Whether or not this was the intention (given the film is an obvious nod to revenge grindhouse films, which often don't concern themselves much with story) doesn't really matter to me, it still let the film down overall and, as mentioned, reduces the likelihood of a second viewing.",Mandy
118,scb_coldsteel,A psychedelic acid trip nightmare,8,1 October 2018,"So I just watched the new independent movie Mandy at the theater. I've really been looking forward to the film. I'm a big Nicolas Cage fan and I was interested to see how he would do in this insane role. This film comes from the same mind that brought us Beyond the Black rainbow so I was expecting a thick and weird psychedelic trip. I was not disappointed! This movie is destined to become a cult classic.The movies plot is actually really simple. A man sets of on a blood soaked quest for vengeance against a religious cult after the brutal murder of his wife. From there all hell literally breaks loose. The movie is a fine mix of shock horror, suspense, rich ambience, and a psychedelic acid nightmare all thrown into a blender. It's a lot of fun!The director did a great job capturing a thick atmosphere that left you unnerved and on the edge of your seat. The film constantly had a dream like quality about the way it was shot that really made you feel like you were in someone's nightmare. Combined with that is a sound track that is pure psychedelic Rock ripped from the pages of Pink Floyd's The Wall. All around the presentation really made this a unique viewing experience.I cannot say enough how great Nicolas Cage was in this role. He may catch some slack for his movie roles, but he is a great actor. His ability to emote on a grandioso level was the centerpiece of this movie. No one can go from calm and collected to screaming mad man, and finally blood-soaked sociopath the way Nicolas Cage can. He was born to play this role. You can tell he put everything into,
 this part and it really shows. So I loved the movie, but this is definitely not the kind of film everyone will enjoy. The level of weird is cranked up to 11 and at times you just have to throw rational thought out the window. The movie also had an unnecessarily slow beginning that should have been cut down to improve pacing. The level of hyper violence and gore will also be off-putting to some. I highly recommend the movie for the experience alone a 8.5 out of 10.",Mandy
119,Otkon,Homage overload.,7,17 September 2018,"And its influences are clear. The Death Wishes, Road Warrior, The Keep, anything Argento, Escape from New York, Altered States, Cronenberg's body horror, the Tangerine Dreamy soundscape. This movie has the slam-dancing bootprint of early 80s trope all over it. This was the time of the Satanic Panic. Disco was dead. Punk was yielding its crown to Metal. And the Devil's Music was coming for your wife and kids. However does Mandy succeed on its own despite borrowing anything and everything from 35 years ago? Heck, if this movie was made in 1983, the also-borrowed Nicolas Cage would have certainly been playing one of young tripped-out acolytes instead of the Charles Bronson character. The mere fact that he copies the silent, crazed avenging husband persona (albeit to an extreme) makes his portrayal an instant win for him and the audience. He is both over-the-top and restrained. Andrea Riseborough teaches us that she could star in any biopic from Grace Slick to Squeaky Fromme.The movie does spend a little too much time upfront on the setup. And I would have liked more time spent on the crafty killings to sweeten up retribution. But the movie is what it is. It does what it does and makes no claims to be anything else. It's an LSD revenge flick. If you can dig that and weird cinema from a third of a century ago, you'll find something in Mandy.",Mandy
120,boydpeters,Watch the trailer. Then...I dont know,7,23 September 2018,"To be honest. Do they intend viewers does some DMT or shrooms to really dig this. Aspects of this were 10/10. Like, incredibly 10/10. A lot was indulgent, some pointless, some a waste. And it did tail off and lose its coreFilm had tremendous potential. This director may make what becomes the greatest film ever made. This wasnt it. And it is not for many people. Watch Alone, with good sound, and be open minded. If someone gave it a 10 I'll agree. If another gave it a 1 I will too. Will I watch it again? Hmm, not sure. Probably. Maybe lots of tinesWill I tell most of my friends to watch it? Absolutely.

The pace is far too slow and left me wanting to fast forward to see if anything actually happened. The cinematography is totally amateur, something you'd expect a first year student to do. No, it was worse than that. 
The effects were absolutely 70's and the score was so dire I turned the sound right down several times. 
Utter waste of the 30 minutes I gave it, I simply had zero interest in what else might happen and was so annoyed by such rubbish that had, even though nothing had really happened.",Mandy
122,foxtografo,Goes from interesting complexity to dull ineffective slayer,4,21 April 2020,"I have to say, I enjoyed the psychedelic cinematography throughout.
The mood was set pretty quickly and I loved it.
Bizarre characters, weird behaviours, slow (maybe too slow at times) burning mystery filled up the first half and that far I liked it.
Then it became a mediocre slayer, if I don't say bad, it's only because of the cinematography. The ""action"" is so poorly choreographed that I felt embarrassed a few times. Even the gore was lame, I think it was trying to be over the top on purpose, but it was just bad, many opportunities for interesting scenes were wasted and it all just ended up being boring and very uninspired.
Ridiculous acting from Nicholas Cage (not the first badly overacted performance he gives) on a character that doesn't make any sense at any moment.
To make it short, it's a beautifully filmed movie, with psychedelic colours and effects, which I really enjoyed, but the writing is very bad and it totally misses what (I think) was trying to do, which is being gore and bizarre in a cool way.
Add up the terrible (main?) character that Cage plays.
Very disappointing.",Mandy

After being done wrong, Cage rages a one man war against a bizarre satanic sect. That's the plot. No need for anything else. It's all Cage, all the time. And it is glorious.Sometimes it's best to keep things simple, and that, this is. We all know what's coming, and it's coming like a red hot locomotive careening off the tracks, crazy eyes bulging, teeth grinding to powder, heavy metal music melting, primal screams a howling. This may be Cage's greatest achievement since he left Las Vegas, in an over the top, b-movie, trippy, one dimensional, kinda way.Nic is back, and everyone best stay clear.",Mandy

It has a very slow setup and the title character creeps me out beyond belief.Is she supposed to be sexy and beautiful, or it that a joke? I am just not sure. What I am sure about is Nic Cage's great second half performance. I found the look of the film with the constant colored filters quite annoying most of the time. If you want to make a low budget film look even more low budget shoot everything with read and yellow filters. Still I give the film an 8.

Shot in reddish-neon colors with a haunting bizarre soundtrack, it starts with logger Nicolas Cage as the most grounded and mellow he's been in years as he cuddles with his girl Mandy in a bedroom with floor-to-ceiling windows in the forest somewhere. When a skeevy cult leader lusts after and kidnaps Mandy after a random drive by, the inner ""Cage"" beast is released.To say this movie is bizarre is an understatement, The mood lighting, odd musical score, and half-crazed characters create an unsettling mix that provides the backdrop for Cage when he goes completely off the rails. If you are a fan of Cage when he gets in these fits, you'll love it. If not, then skip it, although you'll miss an epic chainsaw battle for the ages.",Mandy
128,PotassiumMan,"Looks brilliant early on, and then devolves into self-indulgent trash",2,24 September 2018,"A film that started off so strong and then became one of the worst films I had ever seen is hard to shake off. I only wish it could have gone in the other direction.In the beginning, the film actually felt Lynchian in how austere and disquieting it was. I'm not kidding. I was hooked. An astounding soundtrack and brilliant feel of wilderness aura sets the tone. A recovering alcoholic (Nicolas Cage) who works as a logger and lives with his artist girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough) in rural California has his life preyed upon by a vicious cult and biker demons. This could have been something truly superior. A couple of indescribable scenes still linger on. And what happens then?It starts to collapse when Nicolas Cage becomes, well, Nicolas Cage. His trademark histrionics and manic absurdity start to dominate the film and its artistic trappings are all but torn off. In one scene, in which a vehicle very briefly goes in slow-mo, I suddenly wondered if I was watching a Nicolas Cage blockbuster. The film is supremely violent but there isn't much closure or catharsis. It was aiming for highbrow art and instead becomes something very disposable and not all that remarkable. The film never becomes something of substance, but its style is something it has and then loses.Cage is the kind of actor who could be exceptional if he found a director who could simply reign him in; that rarely seems to happen. This is the first film in theaters that I've seen him in since ""The Weather Man"". It's my hope that he starts to seek out good material. I'll take this as a sign that he's at least trying again.I am dispirited at how a film that showed so much promise in the beginning went off the rails. Films very rarely ever gross me out. This one did. At the end of the day, it was so disgusting that I want a medal just for sitting through it. Not recommended.",Mandy

133,torrascotia,Its good...but its not great.,6,15 September 2018,"There are so many ten ratings on this movie which is never a good sign.
Having just watched Mandy I can say its a visually arresting movie with a fantastic score, if you like your analogue synths. 
Its a basic revenge movie in which Nicholas Cages' partner is murdered by a religious sect who are out of their minds on LSD. You know the rest....
There is alot to like about this movie in terms of the style, however where it falls short is the direction. 
They manage to convey the intimacy of the couple at the start of the movie very well, but this is a revenge movie and the revenge is kind of flat. 
The main issue is there doesn't seem to be any tension around any of the death scenes. The revenge murders are all over far too quickly and they don't seem to put up much of a fight. Its all far too easy and as a result the pay off from the deaths are just not that satisfying. 
Sure this has cult movie written all over it, but this is simply not a 10/10 movie. The violence is mainly predictable and doesn't really shock like it should. There are some fantastic scenes visually, but this is not a movie that will grip or thrill you at the visceral level. 
Its worth you time if you have a thing for good cinematography but its simply not in the same league as Dead Mans Shoes if its a revenge flick you are after.",Mandy
134,Condemned-Soul,Utterly insane but bloody awesome!,8,12 November 2018,"From the first frame to the startling final image, 'Mandy' is a work of art that has been laboriously crafted by a dedicated director with a distinct vision.
Panos Cosmatos melds abstract landscapes with dreamlike weaponry, crosses unorthodox genres of hallucinogenic romance with demonic fantasy, and creates a blood-red hellscape centred around Nicolas Cage's revenge-fuelled antihero.It's almost like a lost soul trapped in pain and isolated in hell trying to escape, but the further they go in, the deeper the descent into madness and the distance to recovery is further away; the mind is warped and a monster appears, and now they belong in this hell. This is a heady mindtrip of a description akin to Nicolas Cage's character who is propelled into acts of violence to fuel his desire for revenge when his girlfriend is murdered by a weird cult.The first half is slow and patient and perhaps would have benefited from meaner editing to create a leaner overall version, but its so expertly filmed with beautiful colour filters that give it such a phantasmagorical quality, that it hardly matters once the second half is ignited into gory life. It's a strange journey of stunning sights and sounds. Viewers are rewarded with an utterly unhinged Nic Cage performance and each revenge kill is satisfyingly staged with cool finesse.Overall, 'Mandy' is quite an experience. The dialogue is as surreal as its 80's inspired setting, and the violence is dialled up a notch and staggered with fantastical force. A chainsaw duel and a mesmerising shiny axe are just a couple of the treats in store for anyone who desires something different, and the director achieves his target of splattering the screen with volcanic excursions of brutality and framing the entire movie with uncommon magical grace.8/10",Mandy

140,TheMovieDoctorful,My Favorite Movie of 2018,10,3 November 2018,"Some films are an experience. They transcend the boundaries of entertainment and become something unforgettable. Something breathtaking. Something deeply personal. These films capture emotions deep inside you that you never thought mere entertainment could bring out. Mandy is one of those films. It's my favorite film of 2018 and everything about it touched and affected me on such a personal level.The revenge tale is nearly as old as history itself. As long as there have been stories and those to tell them, there have been legends of heroes avenging the loss of those they loved to violent ends. I haven't seen a film handle the theme of revenge with more complexity and detail than Mandy in a very long time. Mandy is a slow burn film, a film that takes its time to let us know Red's world, let us understand and share the weight and importance that his wife held in his life. These are the moments of calm before the storm, the moments of peace before wartime that provide both emotional comfort to our hero while also servicing to catch him off guard when everything goes to Hell. It takes its time in allowing us to share in Red's trauma, the bottomless loss of his entire life, his entire reason for existing. It lets us wallow in his mourning just long enough that when Red is ready to take his bloody and violent revenge at the hedonistic and soulless monsters who took everything from him, we're ready as an audience too.Nicolas Cage's acting in Mandy is the finest that I have seen since Leaving Las Vegas, the role that (rightfully) landed him an Academy Award. Cage is at his best when he can fully embody and externalize the pain and traumas of his characters that others in his position may have bottled up. He truly goes to a very dark and personal place in this film and by the time he goes for his signature mania, it's a moment that's more than earned emotionally. Red's screams of rage and anguish, his tortured facial expressions are like shotgun blasts of emotion. Cage's portrayal of a man who has lost everything he's ever loved, a man existing only for brutal and unforgiving vengeance, is something that left me floored and in tears. I absolutely felt every ounce of anger and hopelessness that Red suffered in this film. His performance is easily the best I have seen from an actor this year.The music has been praised by nearly everyone and for good reason. Mandy has easily the most atmospheric, haunting and moving musical score of any film this year. It's the perfect score; the kind that reaches you on every color of the emotional rainbow. The music of Mandy can be nostalgic, empowering, tragic, intense, terrifying...Sometimes several of these at once. This is the kind of trippy and unforgettable music that sucks me into a whole other world, a world simultaneously attractive and repulsive.The cinematography is gorgeous as well. The bright, vibrant color scheme of the movie gives it a very distinct dream-like quality. A dream that shifts from one of coziness, warmth and security that you never want to wake up from to a Hellish and violent nightmare you can't escape with pitch perfect pacing. It's truly fascinating how the movie is able to take colors on very close spectrum on the color wheel and give them such wildly different meaning, all while giving them such strong emotional weight. The oranges and the reds thrust us into our hero's rage and fury, the purples and pinks evoke such strong vibes of relaxation, peace and sensuality. The film is very light on dialogue, and the visuals will often tell us more about Mandy's characters than the dialogue ever will. Particularly interesting is Mandy's ending. Even after Red has dispatched of the entire cult who tortured him and slaughtered his wife, the lighting doesn't return to the more peaceful and serene pink and purple we saw at the beginning. It stays a violent and manic red, lingering on an image of a hysteric Nicolas Cage laughing in bloodlust. All the lives he's taken, all the retribution he's taken can't quell the suffering in his heart. His soul is still in a place of violence. Mandy takes the all-too grounded location of the Pacific Northwest and turns it into something fantastical and epic. Magical even. The tone of the film almost takes on that of an ancient myth, an epic battle between demigods and monsters. Mandy taking on the form of a Biblically reminiscent epic is almost ironic given how firmly anti-religion the movie is.One aspect of the film that is not nearly as praised as it should be is the action. Mandy features probably the best action of any film I've seen this decade. The action scenes of Mandy are based more on tactics and raw strength than finesse and speed; every axe swing, every chainsaw swipe, every fire of every crossbow bolt has an impact and a weight to it. This is a revenge flick about emotions, about feelings, and the raw, intense fight sequences of the film reflect those emotions wonderfully. There's nothing quick paced or cheap about it, every choreographed move feels personal. They don't make action like this anymore. They haven't for a very long time.Mandy rocks. It's an unforgettable masterpiece and its highlights are still fresh in my mind even months after first watching it. It's emotional, suspenseful, funny, intense...An absolutely unforgettable and mindbending experience. If you're not a Nicolas Cage fan, I can't recommend this film enough to sway you over.",Mandy
141,troy-daniel-bush,Didn't like it at first but now I do.,7,8 November 2021,"Feel free to skip the review below.1st Viewing
When I saw this movie for the first time I did not like it at all. Like a lot of people, I was fooled by the trailer into thinking that it was a hack and slash gory revenge flick with a crazy Nicolas Cage performance from beginning to end. I walked away from it thinking that the gory parts were very satisfying, the moments that were intended to be funny were hilarious, the cinematography was kind of beautiful, and the soundtrack was awesome! However, I did not think that any of those things were worth what came before them. On top of that, the movie felt meandering and it hurt my eyes for reasons that I don't think I have to explain. Again, like a lot of people. And I told myself I wouldn't watch it again.2nd Viewing
I found out the comedic, gory scenes, music, and cinematography were enough to bring me back to the movie. But by that time I had forgotten how mind numbing the first half is. But I suffered through it. They might be wondering why I decided to sit through the first half and didn't just skip to the second half. Because I wanted to like every aspect of the film.3rd Viewing
Aside from a few things that I will get to, I decided I really like the movie and I promptly bought it on Blu-Ray. ""Whoa! You like it now? Wow, I couldn't tell from your rating.""I will mention the things I haven't mentioned yet:
All of the performances were pretty great.You can tell that the movie doesn't take itself super seriously.The more times you watch it the more it feels like it flies by.Jeremiah is creepy.Red and Mandy seem like they're in love.You want to see Red succeed.The Black Skulls are fun.Overall the movie is simple but effective.And I really appreciate filmmakers like Panos because he goes out there and makes the movies he wants to make. He clearly has these crazy visions and he wants people to see them and hear people's reactions to them. That kind of ambition deserves respect and attention. Plus, he seems like an enjoyable person to be around and he clearly loves what he does. And it's always cool to see a fully realized vision with nobody getting in the way come to fruition. Whether it's good or not.",Mandy
142,By-TorX-1,Nicolas Cage vs. The Son of Ken Barlow,8,3 September 2020,"And that equals magnificence! Mandy is a marvellous revenge film that has a unique visual style (with strong reds throughout and groovy hallucinogenic visual motifs), great performances (with the most welcome return of 'crazy Cage'), and a very evocative soundtrack that mixes 80s synth tones with crashing metal drone sounds. Indeed, the 80sisms are great (Nightbeast!), with Mandy visually evoking Shelley Duvall, circa The Shining, at times. The film is engaging, splendidly violent and wonderfully otherworldly and unique. So, if you like creepy cults, a touching love story, monstrous bikers, and Nicolas Cage wielding a mediaeval-style sword and chainsaw, this film is strongly recommended.",Mandy
143,benjyboom,Pros and cons,8,30 October 2019,"Pros:
The most well built universe I've ever seen in a film, every character and setting and lore piece felt important
Good acting from most named characters
Controlled, hypnotic use of color, very effectiveCons:
Can drag a little
Some voices can be too distorted at key momentsBest part: Red using the restroom and consuming a bottle of liquor, the most direct representation of Red's feelings throughout
Worst part: the Chemist scene, least important plot wise, even though it introduces entertaining lore",Mandy
144,tkarlmann,Can someone tell me the timecode when the action starts?,1,28 January 2021,"I watched over thirty minutes of the dullest film I've ever had to watch -- before I started skipping around. This film was so boring that I had to poke myself to stay awake.The only thing I remember was a bag of baby Starlings being killed with a crowbar.Was that the high point of this film; or, by some miracle did it get better?What, exactly is everyone raving about. Are your lives so utterly joyful that you need to watch this meaningless tripe to bring you down?Well, I had the same feeling from watching this film as I did when Biden 'won' the fake-Election!",Mandy
145,rcolgan,If Nicolas Winding Refn and David Lynch had a baby...,8,13 October 2018,"If Nicolas Winding Refn and David Lynch had a baby, then that baby got really in to fantasy and heavy metal, Mandy is the film that baby would eventually make. It's a film of pure insanity, where a man can fight a demon, slit its throat open, snort cocaine, have his face melt off and that scene will still not even be the strangest part of the film. It starts of simply enough, with Red Miller (Nicolas Cage) and his girlfriend Mandy Bloom (Andrea Riseborough) living a peaceful life in the wilderness. But then one day Jeremiah Sand (Linus Roache), a Manson type leader of a crazed hippie cult, sees Mandy and decides to send his cult to kidnap her since he believes they are destined to be with each other. This propels Red to go on a bloody quest of vengeance using a crossbow, an axe and eventually a chainsaw. It's basically like your typical rom-com (just with a few more demon bikers). Overall it does have the same general set up to a classic revenge film like Death Wish, with a hero is wronged and decides to deliver his own brand of justice. The difference being that Mandy uses imagery that feels like it's been pulled from hell. Whenever evil appears, the screen fills up with a blood red glaze and gives a very primal feeling of dread. Then at other times the imagery feels like we're looking at the world through the eyes of a 80's heavy metal fan, full of imagery which feels like its been ripped from from classic album covers.Though at the core of this crazed ride is Nicolas Cage, who has always been known for his insane performances and may have found the perfect film to showcase his talents. Throughout the film he's able to go switch seamlessly between rage and misery, whilst somehow still embracing the more darkly comedic elements of the film. In one single take sequence, Cage delivers such a variety of emotions that it could be the fastest I've heard an audience go from laughter into shocked silence.Mandy is definitely not a film for everyone and it's unlikely to ever get any mainstream success. But with Cage finally finding the perfect film to match his crazed onscreen persona, it also seems destined to become a cult classic.",Mandy
146,Ziglet_mir,Half-Speed Acid Shenanigans Laced with Cocaine and LSD,10,23 September 2018,"I rarely go to the theater these days (and it's something I wish I could do more), so I pick and choose the very few I know I want to go out and see. Mandy was an amazing decision. There are few films out there I can recall that use bright powerful colors and put you in a trance (something that lighting folks of old-time theater use more frequently), and I always wonder why it isn't as frequented on the silver screen. A good example off the top of my head is Mann's Manhunter, that just exudes heavy blues, reds, purples, and greens. Cosmatos does an excellent job offering homage to Heavy Metal (in an odd way to manhunter) and all the other culty-80s classics that eminate with gore and unsettling sounds. Which offers a good small segue for Johan Johannsen's excellent soundtrack that fits Cosmatos direction like a glove. Enter Nic Cage. An actor that i have certainly questioned his actual skill, and whether I can legitmately take him seriously or laugh my ass off when he goes into a screaming fit. I can usually never know, and maybe that isn't a bad thing if you take Cage's own philosophy into account; Horror and comedy are much closer than folks realize, and he has no trouble riding that line. This brings me to one of the best scenes of Mandy that I can't go into without spoiling but finds Cage going through a rollercoaster of emotions--and I'll admit I found myself almost at a chuckle until just like that--I'm ready to cry for the guy. At times we think Cage is assuredly over-the-top when in reality I don't think he's very far feom the truth. It takes some convincing and it certainly reminds me that people look ugly and silly when they are at their worst. Out of context those momenrs can also look quite embarrassing. But in Cage's version of going all out, the only conclusion is to say it's as close to reality as one could perform. Mandy goes into his highlight real. In a surprising directorial decision to set up the film in chapters (a la Pulp Fiction) there is a huge scene-moodchanger smack dab in the middle that can't go without praising good ole Bill Duke (and in contention for some of Cage's best work as well). Cage visits Duke (character's name is Caruthers) in a scene that is saturated in warm, natural light, and feels most within the realm of reality--splitting the slow-drug induced first half from the bad-acid-trip gore fest that is the second half. It is a beautiful exchange that has a freaked out Cage (meticulously trying to make sense of the night before) met with a calming, all-knowing wise man in Caruthers, who informs Cage these people are monsters, and that if he persues them he will not come back. One cannot help but listen to Duke speak his monologue as we are still reminding ourselves we are refreshed to be watching a normal scene of dialog. Mandy is the best film of 2018 so far, and one of Nic Cage's best performances. It is off the rails in every way and a ride into bloody madness.",Mandy
147,svhot,"One of Nicolas Cage's Best Performances, Great and Unique Direction Style, Intense Revenge Movie",10,30 January 2018,"""Mandy"" is a real delight for all those movie lovers who (like me) love intense revenge-drama, are Nicolas Cage fans, and enjoy watching movies that are set in the lovable 1980s. This movie takes its viewers into an alternate , apocalyptic type of environment in 1983. Nicolas Cage's girlfriend is kidnapped by a demented cult, and Cage sets out on his ""hunt and kill"" mission.  While the basic plot may sound a bit predictable , be ready for an enjoyable number of surprises. It is the director (Mr Cosmatos) who has made this movie truly enjoyable and thrilling up till the ending scene. The best element about ""Mandy"" is that Mr Cosmatos has motivated Nicolas Cage to give one of the finest, greatest, darkest, and probably the best performance of his career.  I hope Nicolas Cage and Mr Cosmatos are given some awards for teaming up and creating this new cult classic movie.",Mandy
148,just_in_case,"Fits in the ""good"" Nicholas Cage film list.",10,29 October 2018,"This is one of the one's where you get popcorn, sit back and watch Nicholas cage be Insane for 2 hours and wonder what kind of drugs he did on set. He's 100% in character for this one. The movie also benefits from a lot and I mean lot of artistic UMPH. There's a ton visual and audio references to 70s progrock progmetal and a touch of pink floyd. This is a more a surreal journey than a movie. If you're up for that you won't be disappointed.",Mandy
149,rabbitmoon,"Over hyped trash. Nice to look at, hard to truly engage with",3,1 October 2018,"Mandy is hypnotic - visually arresting, slow as hell, and with a trippy atmosphere that feels 'other'. Do those aspects justify a film? Maybe, to some people and in some contexts - being stoned, late-night grindhouse get-togethers or whatever. As a film its dull. The story is as simple as I Spit On Your Grave (its essentially a much less nasty remake), dragged out to 2 hours. The thing that infuriates is that it promises to build to this ultra-violent last act that you read about, with Nic Cage doing his thing - but just becomes super lame instead. The last act was the dullest for me, predictable, lame squirty-blood gore and nothing going on story-wise.",Mandy
150,liderc,Stoned violence porn,1,30 March 2019,"Mr Cages career must be really hitting rock bottom if he stars in a movie like this. Ok, it does have a classic plot, but it executes it with a minimum of effort storywise. There is some tension in the beginning, but its minimal. The flat, uninspired direction is only interested in trippy color and image effects and showing as much gritty violence as possibly in a strangely detached, disinterested way. There are adult movies which exude more excitement and passion as this strange movie. As the uninspired direction and performances are further stretched by very sloppy editing and writing into an overlong mess of a movie, the only feeling at the end is relief that its finally over. I believe it was made by recreational drug users with sadistic tendencies for a similar audience, so its appeal is very limited. One further curious detail is that the main actress already looks aged and lifeless when her character actually is still alive. Waste of time and money.",Mandy
151,tresm87,A brooding slow burn thats pretentious at times with very striking visual prowess.,7,25 September 2018,"Though predominately it plays like another attempt at high brow ultra cinematic ""art"" for pseudo intellectual hipster film snobs and indie loving critics, there is a plethora of excellent redeeming visuals. The plot is a simple revenge tale with some deeper attempts at symbolic thematics. It moves at tortoise pace for a majority of the time and lucky enough for the viewers the long drawn out exposition scenes are shot in intriguing manner with vibrant colorization and beautifully lush cinematography. Unfortunately the dialogue is so incredibly annoying and ridiculous it bogs these slow scenes down somewhat. There are a few downright brilliant sequences when the bizarre and twisted visuals rise this above mediocrity. The practical effects on the creatures are realistic and fantastically intense. Towards the finale it picks up when the blood soaked revenge kicks into insane levels of high gear and this is when the film is is at its most effective with Cage wreaking absolute havoc. Cage is his normal self as far as his emotional acting and it's good to see him get some recognition once again. The soundtrack is very well done and sets the tone in brilliant fashion. Overall if you can look past some of the arthouse smugness of the dialogue, pacing, symbolism, and appreciate the ultraviolece and colorful visuals and sounds, it's an interesting ride. 6.7/10",Mandy

Featuring a crazed cult, motorcycle-riding demons, over-saturated film stock, and, well, Nic Cage wielding a custom axe, ""Mandy"" is a slow burn on an apocalyptic scale.""Mandy"" has garnered devilish amounts of praise from horror/sci-fi/retro-revenge film fans, and deservedly so. The film delivers big time on the camp-crazy, the weirdo-bizarre, and the trippy-unexplained. Unfortunately, the film is frustratingly slow with heavy exposition, long walks, and dreamy dialogue. When the big payoff finally arrives - and c'mon, a chainsaw fight! - relief is felt, not satisfaction.Cage plays Red, a lumberjack looking for payback after Linus Roache's New Age cult has his woman, the eponymous Mandy, killed for laughing at his fantasies. Roache's Jerimiah summons forth demonic bikers (as I think demonic bikers were easily summoned in a pre-Reddit 1983, but you know, just go with it) to stop a vengeful Red, who focuses his wrath into forging a Conan-worthy axe, a talent most lumberjack's probably tend to hide from their public. Demons and humans alike fall in spectacularly-dismembered messes. The blood does boil, but it simmers for an eternity.Cosmatos, to his credit, strives to elevate this VHS-worthy, goofy slasher throwback with art house cinema faire. The mustache-twirling baddie twirls with a cause. Cage, likewise, is able to ham it up enough to bring back those fond memories of ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""Raising Arizona"". In the end, ""Mandy"" is more like ""Eaten Alive"", less like ""Stranger Things"".",Mandy

I will say though that it is a little slow to start (the title card doesn't even show up until over an hour into the film!). But the movie in itself knows what it is and doesn't take itself too seriously or have any hidden agendas so it works perfectly. You go into it expecting a gorefest with crazy Nic Cage and that's exactly what you are given. You also get a great soundtrack and some beautiful visuals along the way.

167,toddg-473-289818,"Yes this review contains spoilers, but read it anyway. This movie is AWFUL.",1,1 November 2020,"2018's MANDY is long, slow, and just plain stupid. It begins by showing all of the opening credits except the title, so you don't know you are watching the right movie until you hear someone say the name ""Mandy"", about 45 minutes in.Nicholas Cage and Andrea Riseborough play a couple who live in the mountains, and are kidnapped and tortured by members of a fanatical cult, who are permanently changed by some bad dose of LSD. Cage's acting is almost nonexistent, largely due to the absence of dialogue in the script. His character seeks revenge on the cult members who murdered his wife, tracking them down one by one, set to a psychedelic backdrop. It really seems like he was just collecting a paycheck to show up here. The only decent acting in this movie came from Linus Roache, who plays the demented cult leader. You might recognize him from his excellent portrayal of King Ecbert in VIKINGS.Even setting aside the overarching hallucinatory theme, there are so many basic flaws in the story. The most glaring one is how, after being tied up and gut stabbed with a large blade, Cage's character didn't simply bleed out and die. No, somehow he frees himself, administers no first aid to patch his wounds (except swilling vodka and yelling incoherently), and recovers with the physical strength to hunt down his tormentors. Also, this movie is allegedly set in 1983, yet there are two visual references to electrical towers, both of which clearly show cellular antennas. These were not around in 1983, and it was a lazy and sloppy mistake.In the movie production there are nods to Stanley Kubrick, with long, single point perspective camera shots, and David Lynch, with just plain weirdness, all set to 70's style music, pointless reference to comic book characters, and cosmic surroundings. But ultimately this movie tries to be too many things, and fails at all of them.",Mandy

Script is not strong.As the tension builds, it becomes apparent that horrible violent things will take place, and nobody can stop it.

The ""bad guys"" are so over-done that it doesn't matter if they live or die.Our ""hero"", Cage, seemingly gets new abilities for his revenge mission, the explanation for these abilities requires a lot of suspension of belief.

They say it's pretentious... call the plot stupid. Well people, this movie wasn't made for you. It was made for people like me. And this film is SPEAKING VOLUMES.I have to say this film has one of the greatest opening credits sequences of all time. The haunting music of King Crimson's awesome song, ""Starless"" and the logging of the forest... it just really, really sets the tone. I knew this movie was going to be incredible right from OPENING SECONDS. The colors... the fonts of the titles... Then into the dreamy pot tokes... the fantasy art being penciled... Red coming home.. cracking the bad joke and looking at her artwork, then the way Cage looks at her afterwords... fading into that amazing dialogue about the planets and our galaxy, the kind of conversation only two people deeply in love seem to be able to have. Then, fading out on their serene little cabin and up into the surreal night sky... WOW.This opening segments of this film should be studied... this is MASTERFUL story telling in my opinion. So much is said without actually being said. We know these two people have past traumas in their lives and they have saved one another from self destruction... I could go into all the signs, but I recommend watching the first act of this film and really studying it, and you will really see how incredible the direction, performances, screenplay and editing are. It's just MASTERFUL. It's one of the best first acts ever in my opinion. There is so much truth in it. A good story always has ""truth inside the lie"".I also want to point out how insanely good this films soundtrack is. It's beautiful and horrifying at the same time. It's just so perfect for this film. I always love to point out how ""metal"" this film is but it actually doesn't have heavy metal music in it. The music gets heavy, but not in a headbanger kinda way. It's just INTENSE. But it's also mixed with that tender love theme that really just makes you want to see Red take out these cult members.Let's also mention how amazing the character of Jeremiah Sand. Linus Roache gives the performance of a lifetime. ""PPPPppppplllleeeeeaaaaasseee... just be quiet and fetch me brother Swan..."" and then his sort of possession afterwords are some of the best delivered lines I've ever seen or heard.The thing I love the most about Mandy is how such a simple story is told so incredibly well. Even if this is not your thing, it will leave an impression. This is one of the most unforgettable movies made in my opinion.The cinematography, sound design, and dreamy editing style melt this fever dream of a movie right into your brain.It's also really funny in parts. (The electric car window... Jeremiah getting naked... ""YOU RIPPED MY SHIRT!"" ""I'll S.... your D...!"" Perfect bits of relief sprinkled throughout, but not turning it into clown town.I only hope one day, as an aspiring filmmaker, that I can make a movie that's half as cool as this film. I really love it. A+. 10/10. Thanks for making it Panos Cosmatos. I find it truly inspiring.",Mandy

The beginning is very slow but if you are a patient film viewer you might like the second half of it much more; the pace picks up a bit and you get used to the style and atmosphere by then. I can easily understand why this film will not appeal to some. You will probably enjoy it if you are used to watching offbeat, slow, art-house type of films. It can be quite an experience if you let it and I believe, that no matter what you might think of Mandy, it is important to recognise the sheer ambitioun and original visoion and take on the revenge movie genre. Nicolas Cage and the rest of the cast do a great job as well. I would recommend it but since the reviews are completely mixed, see it and make up your own mind about it.",Mandy
174,Dave_douell,Entertaining,7,9 January 2019,"The only reason I watched this movie is because I watch everything with Andrea Riseborough. She is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. She was a little too skinny here though, not as healthy looking as usual.
The movie wasn't bad, I've not been watching newer Nick Cage movies. I think it would have been better if they had stayed away from the supernatural stuff. But then I guess it would have been like any other revenge movie. Worth watching if you don't mind that stuff.",Mandy

176,eismoc,Another Version of Chainsaw? Drive Angry? Why?!,3,22 September 2018,"The movie has some visuals ideas, I can say that. What else? Nothing. 
Sorry to see Nicolas Cage wasting his talent (and time) for nothing. I think he underestimated himself a lot in this movie, trying to make a new version of older failed movies. The role is meant for younger, less professional, and less known actor; not for one of the best actors in the history of Hollywood. I can go through the list of embarrassments he put himself into when taking part in Mandy, I bet he already knows them. This is not criticizing Cage personality, but his strange role in this movie, it is not for him. Anyways I like most Nicolas Cage films, but this? I'm disappointed.",Mandy

Now this might not be everybodies cup of tea. But I urge to try it. The actual story of a couple taken by a cult isn't new but the execution of this story is perfect. It's like mixing Hellraiser w Bikers and pick any zealot cult w elements of art film, psychedelia and good ol Nicholas Cage and you have it. Vague yes this is because you need to try this director's vision, you won't be disappointed.",Mandy
179,jmerlino,Wonderfully insane,7,24 September 2020,"This is the type of horror movie I love because it made me laugh like a hyena on nitrous.We've got Mandy. Mandy is an artist and apart from that I don't really see what her appeal is supposed to be. But regardless, she lives with Red and they seem to be pretty happy together.Then we've got Jeremiah, a failed musician/cult leader (obviously modeled on David Koresh, but with a Lynchian glaze of insanty). He becomes infatuated with Mandy after seeing her on the road. Why? We have no idea.We've got mutant bikers. These guys are Jeremiah's muscle, and they're addicted to a potent form of LSD created by a chemist.Mandy laughs at Jeremiah's advances and music, which enrages him, and he has her burned in front of Red. Red proceeds to go apesqueeze and kills everyone.So much silliness: Apparently the LSD in question gives Red visions as soon as he tastes it (most acid I've ever heard of takes about 45 minutes to kick in). It has also made the chemist psychic since his conversation with Red is pretty one sided. The chemist has a tiger. The tiger also somehow represents Red.But also so much awesomeness: A chainsaw duel, mutants, animated sequences, a chainsaw duel, a skull crushing, Jeremiah offering sexual favors to Red for his life, and did I mention the chainsaw duel?But what you'll really want to know is, do they let Nick be Nick? The answer is a glorious YES! I actually thought Cage was a little restrained given the rest of the film, but he does have an excellent YouTube worthy moment where, having escaped barbed wire bonds, he pours vodka all over his wounds and drinks the rest (to kill the pain presumably, but there's also a suggestion that he may have had a drinking problem at one point.)This scene, despite being up there with the ""Alphabet"" scene in Vampire's Kiss in terms of sheer lunacy, actually makes a lot of sense. This is the first time that Red has had an opportunity to vent his grief and rage, plus he's also clearly in a lot of pain.But for most of his revenge spree, he does the ""man of few words"" kind of thing, and the Cageian insanity is conveyed through facial expressions. A couple of which are downright classic.There's probably a lot of metaphorical and allegorical stuff going on on the symbolic level, but honestly, who cares about that when there's a chainsaw duel?This movie was just plain fun. A refreshing change of pace after all the serial killer movies I've watched recently.",Mandy

It has some decent scenes and visuals, but over all, its so pretentious and punishingly boring at times that it's difficult to pay attention. Why people seem to love this movie is lost on me. The crazy visuals seem to be the only thing anyone will remember from this overbloated, overrated film.Also, why does everyone take five minutes to say one sentence? It doesn't matter anyway.

The movie has a mixture of arthouse and grindhouse horror with really cool, slow burn visuals, nightmarish sequences, bloody violence, awesome fight scenes, chainsaws, gnarly psycho bikers, religious freaks, a tiger, etc. Plus it has an extremely blissful soundtrack from the late, great Johann Johannsson. Mandy stars the vintage Nicolas Cage, who we fans know, and he is finally back with a vengeance. His performance as Red Miller is the craziest ever! Andrea Riseborough is amazingly stunning as Mandy Bloom and Linus Roache is evil and creepy as religious cult leader, Jeremiah Sand. Also, there are awesome cameos from Bill Duke as Caruthers and Richard Brake as The Chemist. Salute to director Mr. Panos Cosmatos for this ultimate 80s cinematic masterpiece!",Mandy
187,Abranth-d,What did I Just watch ?,6,19 July 2019,"Here's my review of Mandy . So Mandy is this cult movie of a genre that I can't even classify . It's a movie the whole internet's gone crazy about posting their own takes and theories and stuff. The movie stars Nicholas cage and this is the movie where he actually acts in many years. The story is very linear. A group of hippies kill his girlfriend so Nick cage goes full John wick on them . But there's a lot of imagery , Easter eggs , biblical references , counterculture themes and probably much more but that's all I could notice with a half sleepy eye cause that's how boring this movie is . It's Soo slow that it makes the blade runner movies look like speedy Gonzalez in a cheese factory. But after reading some explanations I felt this was a pshychadelic movie / biblical movie / slasher movie. Exactly. So I still don't know how to classify it. The movie also has disturbing imagery but I'd say it depends on what you consider as disturbing. In the end I thought it was a boring movie with stunning visuals. I don't think I'd watch it again either. But I highly recommend this movie . Because there are people who gave this a 10 / 10 and some who gave it a 1/10 . Some called it the best movie they've ""ever"" seen and some called it as utter trash and there was no middle or grey audience. So I guess you should watch it to find out which side of the camp you're on.",Mandy

189,alexqueens,Nic Cage Having Fun,6,30 October 2019,"I waited a long time for Panos Cosmatos's next feature film - almost 10 years since Beyond the Black Rainbow which was an instant favorite with me.
Mandy is not what I expected; though to be honest, I didn't know what to expect.The first half gave me the impression I was watching a David Lynch movie, which quickly descended into a universe where I thought Hellraiser and the Cenobites would pop up to say hello, with its 3rd half resulting in a body-horror straight out of a Rob Zombie flick.Nic Cage was obviously enjoying himself and Linus Roache, as the Manson-esque cult leader Jeremiah, turned in a pretty wild-card performance.",Mandy
190,nikxatz,Rockit,8,16 July 2019,"This film is really hallucinating and mesmerising and dizzing experience and whoever likes revenge stories, art-house heavy metal stuff and Nick Cage...well you might love it.
One aspect of the film that makes it even weirder is its really weird pacing and structure. At first it is really slow and we just meet our 2 characters and the villians and we just see a few conversations between the characters. Still, the first have is visuall stunning and has a really unique style. I was interested during the first half but I was stilll waiting for the boom!
And yes as the film goes on it becomes more action packed and feels more grand and action-packed. The second have is a love letter to stylish violence,revenge stories and the film's most dark star...Nicolas Cage. The fights are insane, the cinematography and the stylisitc presentation...just a feast for the eyes. I love ow his character gradually turns into a maniac who mournes for his oved one by smashing heads and stabbing monsters with blades.Cage's acting is of infinite praise too. Pain and madnesss become one on his gritty and bloody face and his smile...a piece of gold.
Most people criticize the film for being more style over substance...and although this isquite the case...that is not certainly bad. Style gives also soul to a film and visual stortelling is really powerful techinque for a film like that.
Also... it bight be a stylisitc extravaganza but substance is present.
As I see it,Mandy is the depiction of a ruined, unfair and corrupted society. The main antagonist believes that he is God but he is actually a piece of nothing and he feels powerful but the truth is that he is a funny minifigure wich fails at everything. The monsters in the film portray the uglyness of human nature. They are people who have become one with sin and that is why they watch porn and do drugs and look so ugly.... Their exterior is as ugly as their interior.Our hero is a man who seeks revenge for his love's unfair and pointlsss death. He is a tragic character who fell in a black hole for no reason and he rises form his ashes and he takes his revenge even if he loses his mind during this crazy journey. This whole situation turns him mad and leads him to lose his mind. The bathroom scene is a pure depiction of his situation.This film is nuts It is not crazy as hell. It is hell.I mostly enjoyed it.",Mandy

The directors name is Panos Cosmotos so ya, gotta be a crazy movie if that's the directors name.Movie includes:
Jesus freaks on LSD
Hellraiser type villians
Full frontal male nudity by Batman's (why do we fall) Dad, followed by ridicule

It's cerebral but maintains all the elements of an actual plot and keeps moving at a good pace. The cinematography and visual elements are amazing and fit perfectly with the music.

And I've never been a big Cage fan. And to think N. Roache who played an incredible role as the most ruthless would be king of a United England in the terrific series Vikings played this cult leading demon summoning lunatic that even Charles Manson would have been afraid of pissing off. Someone put up all the money required to pay such actors of note, DID do a fantastic job of lighting, coloring, and score/songs to set the proper mood for such an insane production...they all get ten of ten as well. However, can anyone tell me how Cage can be stabbed in the General area of his intestines and kidney, yet not give it a second thought? He pours vodka on his wrists cut by wire, but never gives a thought about his deep stab wound. And the withered black man Cage goes to is the same actor who was the burly tough guy in such movies as the original Predator. If his withered appearance is due to poor health, I can only hope he is doing well.The movie is for Acid Heads, not 'regular' people who expect a plot, dialogue, and something to care about other than creative ways to kill people.

196,jgkelley-48797,The 1/10 ratings are seriously getting annoying,6,19 May 2019,"People have the right to give their own review. I'm just having a hard time understanding what scale these people go off of. Id love IMDB to force users who give a 1/10 list 5 movies-in the same genre they are reviewing-that they believe are 10's. Its like if they don't like the movie it's a 1/10 lmao. What they don't understand is that is asinine. Just would love to know some of their criteria for an 8 or higher. I go by is it watchable, if I sit through the whole movie it is. Hell I finished thousands of movies that by then end I'm like that wasn't a good movie. But others I shut off minutes in they are that bad. If you watched the whole movie GTFOH with that 1/10 bs.
Then i go by how enjoyable it was. Both the plot & acting and just me but I'm big on endings & being satisfied. Now just because i don't enjoy a movie or like ive seen enough to know it doesn't always mean im ready to pair it with the worst movies ive ever seen. I'm sry bout the rant but this 1/10 is so outta hand in starting to skip ova every 1/10 rating I see because they offer nothing & I know the person is putting no thought into the review why should i trust them with determining what kinda movie I should or shouldn't watch. I suggest others who have this same aggravation with these 1/10 spammers do the same & just start skipping ova them. I know I am not alone. Actually I know I am in the majority cuz its getting outta handAs for the movie, idk i like almost anything Nicholas Cage is in. Add in some revenge, some nice violence, and that old school 1980s feel & I'm hooked. Listen this definitely isn't for everyone but if u like any of the grindhouse movies & enjoy good ole revenge flicks like payback you'll like this. Just know its obv gonna have a bit more violence & takes an obviois different angle. I don't like to give away anything when reviewing I like others to do that for me. But I wanna basically let people know what I thought of it & i enjoyed it. Its no 10 by my rating cuz its nowhere close to being one of the better movies ive seen.

The red was overkill. I thought the bikers were summoned from hell but they turned out to be real people. Even Cage couldn't save this.

199,salonsoab,So Smart it is Disturbing,9,9 July 2019,"Mandy is an ambitious film, where it basically takes everything that is considered ""standard"" in a film and completely throws it out the window and presents something new and different. I really enjoyed this film: Nicholas Cage delivers one of his best performances yet, the visuals are overall stunning (although there were a couple of times where the color saturation was too much), the score is amazing, and the overall story is told in a way that every person that watches it can have a different interpretation of why things are happening on screen.",Mandy
200,dwankan,Watch it on fast-forward,6,4 April 2021,"If you can do so without losing sound, watch this movie on 1.5 or 2x speed. It has an exciting story, some great, weird cinematography, and a good score, but it moves at a painfully slow pace. The reviews raved about how atmospheric and innovative this film was, but it's just plain too much. Cut down on the endless takes (most shots lasted far beyond their contribution to the story), turn on some lights (a good 1/4 of the film may as well have been photos of cute cats because it was so dark you couldn't see anything), back that camera up (far too many painfully too close close ups), and you'd have a great (if utterly ridiculous) movie here. All the comparisons to great, innovative film directors misses one basic fact: good directors use style as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, substance, and this movie had very little substance. I love weird, artsy films, but there's a limit to the value of weird stylistic elements, and this film far exceeded that limit.",Mandy

While I can definitely understand and agree with a lot of the criticism I still count myself on the love-it side because of the pure visual spectacle.It's a very simple story that could have been told in probably half the run time, but each scene is drawn out with jaw-dropping visual effects. And I like that!The story: Hippies in love, Red (Nicholas Cage) and Mandy (Andrea Riseborough), live their simple life out in the woods. Mandy is abducted and killed by an acid-dropping hippie religious cult, and Red goes on an acid-fueled revenge killing spree.All that acid explains the outrageous visuals.There's not much back-story or character development. It all takes place in The Now. It's very violent. There are some very uncomfortable scenes (Red chugging vodka in his underwear and screaming while sitting on the toilet). And a lot of the hippies-in-love purity and innocence sequences are almost enough to induce an eye-roll.But I thought it all worked!",Mandy

203,captainpass,Filmwork as Essentially Visual,7,31 October 2021,"Either you enjoy occupying the world of Panos Cosmatos for two hours or you do not. I do. The plot, narrative and dialogue are in some ways beside the point, as Cosmatos is first and foremost interested in film as a visual medium. The dialogue is toss-away. And despite the kinetic plot-line of the second half of the film, the action always is subordinated to the lighting and camera work. In the end, it is the imagery that remain with you.So as far as story goes, this is a wronged-man-avenges-the-wrong film set in the dying light of the 1960s counter-culture. But to summarize the story line leaves out most of what makes it an engaging entry: The surreal color schemes swallowing the dense, wooded scenery; the blending of images in and out of focus; the camera lingering on the often-overly stylized facial expressions and motions of the actors. (One prominent feature: the eyes of the actors are often filmed in a way that reveals only a glint of light; as if they were black polished stones.) Cage puts his scenery-shredding tendencies to good use here, as ""over-the-top"" is not a bad thing in a film that feels like an acid trip cooked up by a deep woods biker gang.As in ""Beyond the Black Rainbow,"" the aesthetics of the early 1980s figure prominently: the muted color schemes, the analog music, the era-specific set pieces. I often thought of Cronenberg circa ""The Brood"" or ""Videodrome"" while watching. But stylistically, ""Mandy"" reminds me more of the experimental films of the late 1960s, early 1970s- with this difference: the film work here is vastly superior. For contemporary references: if you enjoyed ""Under the Skin,"" ""Braid"" or the work of David Lynch, this might work for you. (The comparisons by viewers to Lynch are not off the mark, though I find Cosmatos to be more deeply psychological, hallucinogenic and disturbing where Lynch is quirky and absurdist. They both have a love of the giallo-style lighting arrangements, though Cosmatos renders his world in brown, gold, dull red, burnished orange and amber.)",Mandy

And it's all of those things.

207,MackMonMay87,Divisive Nic Cage Revenge Flick is Gorey Fun,6,16 September 2018,"I notice there's already a lot of reviews for Panos Cosmatos' ""Mandy"" on here already, and this is definitely a movie that's going to get a response from the audience, whatever that may be. 
If you look, many of the reviews are either 1/10 or 10/10, and not a lot of middle ground in between. The reason for this is because Mandy unashamedly commits to it's bizarre images, intense gore and violence, and it's own level of absurdity. I got the feeling the director and everyone involved knew what kind of movie they were making, and if that concept isn't clear to the person watching it, they're either going to enjoy it ironically or hate it outrightly, and I understand both responses to this movie.
I can say one thing about this director: he really knows how to craft a memorable image. With psychedelic freakouts, Epilepsy-inducing flash-cuts, and even animation, Mandy has visuals that stick with you, but of course it's all hanging off a very thin skeleton of a plot, and barely any dialouge from one of the greatest scenery chewers in Hollywood history (although Cage fans will get their due more in his expressions, close-ups, and some other key moments.).
It's as simple as a revenge plot can be, and it doesn't waste a lot of time with explaining things like how did Cage's characters find the occultist's, what are the villain's goals and motivations, or seemingly why any of this is happening. It's just not that kind of movie. This is a great warm up to Halloween, and clearly the director had a series of shocking, over-the-top scenes in mind, and strung them together as loosely and quickly as possible, while tossing in plenty of Grindhouse-style cheeze. I absolutely don't recommend this to families or anyone squeamish about violence or sex.",Mandy

The Grindhouse-esque direction by Panos Cosmatos and the lead performance by Nicolas Cage are superb. But it's definitely more of an experience than a traditional film.With that said, for me personally it was a bit too drawn-out and claustrophobic. That and the extreme violence at times made it feel like a nightmare brought to the screen. The film also didn't make me feel any kind of emotion towards the characters. I didn't care about Mandy dying or the evil weirdos getting killed by an unleashed Nicolas Cage. In the end, it's really the outstanding visual direction that makes the film worth a watch.",Mandy

The scenes with the religious cult leader (Roache) were the very best, so twisted and trippy that enforces the movie tone and individuality.This movie crafted its own kind of horror, I hardly believe to watch something like this in a near time.

It's one of those films that's weird just for the sake of being weird. From the heavy use of dramatic lighting, very long static scenes, bonkers dialogue, it was a trudge to get through. It's a difficult film to rate as it's very niche and my score of 3 doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. It's a story told hundreds of times before, but just done in a weird way.If you're wondering whether to give it a go:
If you're into arty, weird and wacky films, you'll probably love it.
If that's not your thing, give it a miss.Did I say this film is weird?",Mandy

which is really great the first three minutes only to run into a complete cacophony with primitive notes and a mess of drums.I only give it 2 Stars because of that song, with the cacophony cut off.

214,pseawrig,artful grindhouse,10,13 December 2018,"Mandy perfectly combines two types of movies that I love: art house cinema and exploitation films. If you like films with hallucinatory imagery, bewildering plots, creepy recreations of earlier styles, and lots of over-the-top gore, you too will love this movie. If you're instead looking for a tight, twisty horror plot with lots of jump scares, keep looking: Mandy is not for you.Nicolas Cage's off-kilter acting style, which is and always has been both clunkily earnest and soaringly operatic, works perfectly here. Between this movie and Mom and Dad, he is having a late-arriving career renaissance. Linus Roache is at least as captivating as Jeremiah, the simultaneously sexy, repulsive, and ridiculous cult leader whose depravity drives the story.If you're into seriously weird cinema, like the films of David Lynch, David Cronenberg, Terry Gilliam, or Clive Barker, then I think you're going to enjoy Mandy.",Mandy
215,SeriousMayhem,"A polished turd, soaked in LSD",5,18 December 2018,"Simple revenge flick that tries a bit too hard to be artsy and something that it is not; a good movie.The story is mostly non-existant and to say that it's slowly getting where it wants to go, is quite the understatement, as this movie is about 80 minutes too long. I love me a slow-burner, but this was just tedious for the most part. Eventually, revenge is had, in a largely unexciting and unorignal manner, making it fail in the one place where it shouldn't have.I guess the ""it's different and not a blockbuster, therefore it must be good"" crowd will love it. Good for you, enjoy the colors and nostalgia. I remain unimpressed.Regretfully, Nic Cage can't save the day either; he adds not much to the movie at all, besides making a few faces. Too bad, since this is a role well fit for him.Conclusion: meh. I give it a very generous 5/10.",Mandy
216,Tobeshadow,A great slice of Sci-Fi!,8,13 October 2021,"Mandy is a great slice of sci-fi weirdness, with an outrageously over the top lead from Cage and brilliant support from Linus Roache and Andrea Riseborough who inhabit their roles with great conviction.Panos Cosmatos has mentioned his love of Heavy Metal (1981) before, and Mandy feels like a lost live-action segment of that movie. Great stuff!",Mandy

This is one of those ""What did I just watch?"" experiences. I'd read enough reviews to know pretty much what I was in for, so I guess I shouldn't complain, though I will. I've heard this compared to David Lynch movies, which should have put me right off because I despise David Lynch. But this was much worse, in that at times I was absolutely certain I was being pranked. This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life, and I sat through ""Blue Velvet"" *three* times freshman year in college, so I know a bad film when I see it. Lynch is offensively pretentious, but has legions of pseudo-intellectual fans to defend his cinematic vomit as art. Writer/director Panos Cosmatos, on the other hand, isn't pulling it off by a long shot. To be honest, I don't know much about him - and you probably don't either - but apparently he's a 12 year old with a red lense filter, a stack of old Heavy Metal magazines, and enough misguided funding from *somewhere* to get this massive...""disappointment"" (cough cough)...made. It's another Hollywood green light mystery. I'll never understand why something like ""A Confederacy of Dunces"" is forever lost in development hell, but dreck like this just rolls out year after year after year. Hollywood stinks on ice.",Mandy
218,mukherjeesubham93,Leaves you in a trance!,8,18 January 2019,"Mandy isn't a movie. It's an experience. An experience which shouldn't be missed at any cost. Director Panos Cosmatos deserves all the credit for his uncompromising vision, and audacity to bring something like this on screen.
With a storyline which is fairly generic, Mandy's beauty lies in presentation. Call it a throwback to grindhouse movies,call it an insane LSD induced hallucination, call it a supernatural extravaganza, all of this won't be enough to describe the cinematic experience this movie is. It's a movie which deserves an adjective of it's own.
When Nicolas Cage plays the sanest character in a movie, you know you're in for a ride. Nicolas Cage's over the top histronic style is perfect for such type of a movie and lends the movie an emotional backbone. Watch out for the scene in the bathroom where he drinks and shouts unbearably in agony and pain. Mandy wouldn't had been half of what it is without Cage.
Lastly, Cinematography, Art direction for it's use of colours and and the music by the late Jóhann Jóhannson. Mandy is dark, insanely violent, and exaggerated by stark reds which make the movie look otherworldly gorgeous. These distinct visuals are accompained by perfectly apt music. The music by Jóhannson is a
a tribute to death metal, and together with the imagery it creates an audio visual eruption which leaves in you in a trance.Do not miss this future cult classic!Rating: 8/10",Mandy
219,bvnisarga,Psychedelic,7,13 February 2019,"Mandy is to put it simply a revenge story, A revenge story on LSD. Reality and fantasy merge seamlessly in the cinematography. The sequences are visually stunning and The background score is killer.
The atmosphere is like another character in the movie, It adds many layers to the movie.

222,iamjacksmoviechannel,Cage a force is bloody thriller filled with symbolism,8,21 September 2018,"So Mandy, the newest bio-pic on Princess Bride's Mandy Patinkin. Actually no, furthest thing from. Wow, this is some movie. Maybe the best gothic revenge thriller since The Crow and the most thoughtful meditation on good vs. evil since Nicholas Windng Refn's Only Good Forgives, and not just because both seem to use bright neons to convey emotion.Nicholas Cage is Red, the boyfriend of the title character here. He's a logger who spends much of the first half of the movie on the sideline so that we can get to know Mandy. Later on she's kidnapped by a bunch of brain addled Jesus freaks and if you think that's going to end well, you should just go see a different movie. Red seeks vengeance. It's a revenge thriller but the first half is actually remarkably restrained and very intuned with the spiritual. Mandy for example is an avid reader on the planets and has a few stories of the pain she's felt at seeing dead or wounded animals. One could say she is even one with the heavens and Earth, the two planes of consciousness that God idealized the most. If you hate this kind of metaphorical stuff I just said, just sit tight cause I have more of it. This movie actually got me to do some theological reading, and I understand it about as well as I did when my parents forced me into to Sunday school as a kid but director Panos Cosmatos actually does make this as fun as any director possibly could. Everything is better with LSD and blood. That's a for real thing. The villains here really are false prophets completely screwed up on Acid. They think themselves touched by God but in actuality they are the destroyers of all beauty. Nicholas Cage really is playing a version of the Grim reaper. Death metal is the perfect soundtrack to a confrontation with evil. And this is just surface level stuff. I'd be interested in what a real theological person could take from this.Again if this kind of metaphor is not your thing, the first half may be a bit confusing for you but you still have some excellent direction going on here. The sense of foreboding horror is always present and the lighting, especially the red neon whuch reminded me of scorched Earth, is about as on point as you can get it. But come second half, this is Cage's show. It's not so much a new turn from him as it's just finally him doing a variation of the same gonzo performance in a movie that expertly matches his over the topness. He's a man of broken heart and righteous rage and he wears both of those things on his very bloody sleeve. The second half is just awesome. He grabs a crossbow and even finds a sickle for extra emphasis and from there it's just bloody action straight through, with incredible fights along the way, including one with chainsaws. Nothing about this is subtle but it swings for the fences in the boldest of ways. You'll either hate it or love its insane good vs. evil comparisons.",Mandy

I love that someone wants me to do an interview about a film I saw. Do you mind if I record this? I'll be posting it to my blog.Interviewer: That's just fine, I'll be doing the same.JohnnyPHreak: Excellent. I don't get much exposure but I'll take it.Interviewer: If you don't mind, I'd like to just get into it.JohnnyPHreak: Sure, fire away.Interviewer: Let's talk about Mandy...JohnnyPHreak: Oh man, did you pick a wild one. Okay, I've wanted to see this for a while. I saw the trailer and it threw me for a loop. But I was too busy to catch it in theaters. I read so many positive reviews about it. I do a lot of research on certain movies I see. I'm a film new junkie. It's my crack. I had to wait a while to finally see it. I was going to actually just by the blu-ray when it was dropped. But I eventually decided against it. Then I had signed up for Redbox. There were a few nights I didn't get to rent it. I've only had Redbox for a month. Then I saw Shudder had it. I've wanted to sign up for Shudder for almost a year. When I first heard about the streaming site it pushed all the right buttons. Being a huge horror film nerd I needed it in my life. The final nail in the coffin was they got one of the best-underrated horror movies of all time The Changeling. As soon as I found that out they got that I signed up.Interviewer: Back to Mandy, what is it about?JohnnyPHreak: Nic Cage stars as Red with Andrea Riseborough as the title character Mandy. They live off the grid in the woods in the pacific northwest. The film is set in the '80s. But an even crazier 80's than in reality. Something is going on in the nation where things are being outlawed and craziness is ruling the lands. After the couple runs afoul a cult group with a tyrannical leader, Red goes on the dreamlike crusade of revenge.Interviewer: That sounds...interesting. Is there a twist? Is that why you don't want to dive into more detail?JohnnyPHreak: I just don't want to give away the entire film like most trailers do. Why can't have those retro trailers from the '70s and '80s? They gave just enough to whet your appetite. I say that being the pot calling the kettle black when I ran to the internet to complain about the Endgame trailer. Mandy is a movie you have to experience. I don't want to ruin it for anyone.Interviewer: I take it you enjoy the film?JohnnyPHreak: This is a very cool and badass horror fantasy. It's also nice to say horror fantasy in the same words. We don't get enough of that subgenre. I hope this is the start of more quality films being made inside of it. From the start, you have no idea where this film is going. It feels like a crazy dream and acid-trip fantasy you might have had ""experimenting in college"". Panos Cosmatos direction with Benjamin Loeb wild cinematography and lighting gel so well. Some of the scenes are so vibrant and colorful, you might actually think you are tripping. Cosmatos has a good eye for drama and a great eye for gore. Ever scene looks different and I can't even imagine how long it took to edit to make the film has this look.Interviewer: What about the acting, is it well acted? Does Nic Cage go crazy?JohnnyPHreak: Nic Cage is fantastic here. I believe this is his best movie in years. He's subtle to start. There's a sober loving feel to his character. But when blank hits the fan, he devolves into madness and we get to see Nic Cage be Nic Cage. It's glorious. There were a few moments I was smiling the whole time. He has a couple of classic lines as well. The more people see this film I think they easily seep their way in the pop culture lingo. Andrea Riseborough is good as Mandy. She plays it subtle with layers. We know that there is more to Mandy. It's a nice balance with you believing they are very much in love. Linus Roache goes purely over the top cult leader/villain. It works so well in this film. At times he's charming then terrifying then loving then weak then a monster. His followers each play their part well. We get the typical group of followers, the 2nd in command, the older woman, the young woman, the muscle and the eager young man. They round out the group in a way that feels just right.Interviewer: You mention this is...JohnnyPHreak: Bill freaking Duke from Commando and Predator shows in a nice cameo as a guy who used to work with Red? It's never really explained how they know each other. But they know each other well.Interviewer: As I was saying you *pause* mention this is a horror fantasy.JohnnyPHreak: Oh my goodness is his film bloody and vulgar as hell. It earns its R Rating and I'm happy about it. People get butchered and tore apart. It's all done very bloody in a very fantastical way. Cosmatos is very well very in horror and he pours it on when the film needs to be that way. I'm very eager to see where he goes next. If he stays in the horror genre I'm all for it. This is definitely one of the bloodiest, craziest horror films I've seen in a while. And the fantasy elements feel natural in the world he created. The haunting score by Jóhann Jóhannsson is a fitting send-off as he passed in 2018. It's very beautiful and outer worldly. This is one you'd want to pick up on record and just play for days and days.Interviewer: Any final thoughts before we move on to our next film?JohnnyPHreak: I really didn't know what to expect. But I'm happy with the outcome. The film does start slow. It focuses on the characters before falling off a cliff into madness. But it's oh so sweet when it all goes to hell...almost literally. I think all horror fans should see this. And if they enjoy it demand we get more horror fantasy film. Because when done right they are wholeheartedly entertaining. Mandy is cool as hell with a badass Nic Cage performance.",Mandy

Directed by Panos Cosmatos. Written by Panos Cosmatos and Aaron Stewart-Ahn
It took me a while to get the fortitude together to brave this one. I'm not saying that this movie was so bad, it scared me to see because that doesn't bother me. I was apprehensive due to what was written about it beforehand. Slow moving movies are not usually my thing. Overly color corrected heavily stylized movies can be a drag. This one wasn't necessarily. It is hypnotic and lulling you into a sense of complacency. Then it gets nuts.It highlights a different color in every scene. It is like a beautiful painting and there is very little dialogue. But once things get crazy, the filmmaker washes the entire movie in a blood red that feels like you're inside a hellish inferno. It is a very simple story and the style is the reason it doesn't fall by the wayside. It might even be the reason it is still talked about garnering attention.The heavy color correction does make things difficult to see and your eyes will require some time to adjust so you're able to watch and appreciate the story. Their relationship is quiet and sweet. You feel for what happens to them. It works to pull you into the revenge. The LSD scene is really well done. The few times we do get extended scenes of dialogue they are excellently executed.But my lord is this movie way too long. It runs a little over 2 hours and you feel it in your very bones. If this had been the length of You Might Be the Killer we would have been in good business. It just kept going. Everything seems to happen easily for him but of course because it needs to flow like a river and not really focus on character development. That's not its reason for existing. It is designed to put you in the middle of what is happening. You know this when the LSD scene comes on.I would say give this one a try if you like weird, very colorful movies.

Set in 1982, Mandy really works as a modern production's take on films of its era and The Evil Dead especially shines through.Mandy first and foremost intentionally priorities cinematography, shot composition, score and atmosphere over plot and character development - but that's kind of the point.The film is drenched in neon visuals which look absolutely fantastic and the score is really well produced as well with a mixture of euphoric pads, harrowing growls and occasional metal influence.Nicolas Cage revells in his role in this film as he pushes his emotions to a level that only he can achieve. And it completely works for this movie (even if some scenes did make me chuckle - I blame the memes).The use of practical effects and occasional animation is nicely done as well!It might come across a weird horror movie for casual audiences with its intense visual palette (lots of strobes and neon visuals) and excessive nature but it definitely has its charm as a nostalgic piece built on an iconic era of cult horror and action movies.Go rent a copy from Blockbusters or your local VHS Rental store.",Mandy

This film is every bit of ""style-over-substance"", but it's spectacle is more than enough to overpower any desire of meaning you seek in this. This is a RIDE.Bright neon against thick fogs of smoke.

His work here is SPECTACULAR, crafting a hybrid of 80's-era synth straight from groundhouse horror films and a hard rock undertone that make this the ultimate backdrop for the insane imagery we witness throughout. From minute one, this film ENVELOPS you in its sound, in all its aggressive and mystifying glory.The performances are all perfect for its pulpy, over-the-top tone. Nicolas Cage, for all of his negatives, is absolutely beastly in this and will make you cry, make you laugh and make you absolutely terrified to even look at him. I'd dare say this is career-reigniting for him, and no man in Hollywood deserves it more. He sells his soul to this role. Andrea Riseborough is also phenomenal in what she manages to get in, along with the rest of a bonkers cast that sells this world and tone better than anyone has in recent memory.This film is available on digital right now, but if this is in theaters anywhere close to you, it is WORTH IT to seek this out. This is an otherworldly film that needs to be seen to be believed, and I cannot see anybody leaving this film without their jaw hitting the floor at least once.I highly recommend you see ""Mandy"", whether on digital or in theaters, right this second.

247,laurinen71,Visually arresting,9,28 September 2019,"The plot of ""Mandy"" is almost non-existent revenge story. What sets this little movie apart though is Panos Cosmatos' very rich visuals and use of music. Nicholas Cage is at his entertaining best here, too. A must see for horror and pulp fans and art students. I hope P. Cosmatos gets more work, because he clearly has unique talent.",Mandy
248,samconlan94,I love this entertaining psychedelic gorefest. It's a perfect movie on Halloween,10,17 August 2021,"I made a ReviewThe Main Storyline: In the Pacific Northwest in 1983, outsiders Red Miller and Mandy Bloom lead a loving and peaceful existence. When their pine-scented haven is savagely destroyed by a cult led by the sadistic Jeremiah Sand, Red is catapulted into a phantasmagoric journey filled with bloody vengeance and laced with deadly fire.The Director: Panos Cosmatos made a dark movie full of trippy things. He also made indie movies like the sci-fi ones. The Actors: Oscar Winner Nicolas Cage (from Vampire's Kiss, Moonstruck, Face/Off, Con Air, The Rock, Matchstick Men, Knowing, Kick-Ass, the Ghost Rider movies, Disney's National Treasure Movies, Adaptation and The Wicker Man Remake) plays as Red Miller (Protagonist), Andrea Riseborough (from Oblivion and Birdman) plays as Red's partner Mandy Bloom and Linus Roache (from Batman Begins, Vikings TV Show and The Chronicles of Riddick) plays as Jeremiah (Villain). It's a Live-Action movie It's got Action, Horror, Mystery, Thriller in it. Back in 2019, I watched it on Foxtel at home by myself. I love it because the movie is so dark, gritty, scary and awesome but like an entertaining psychedelic gorefest. It's got the fight scenes in it, the dark and scary tone are so cool. It's a True Horror Movie that Fans will Love it. It's a perfect movie to watch on Halloween.I give it 10/10This movie is now streaming on Shudder. Now available on iTunes, Google Play, Blu-Ray and DVDThanks for Reading.",Mandy
249,coolliegal4,Intriguing but not wild enough,7,18 September 2018,"For a revenge movie I expected more and I KNOW Nicholas Cage has a lot more crazy in him. I was expecting some ""face off"" acting but he was one step below that and that is only due to the writing and directing. So I don't blame Nicholas but that's what it came down to. It is very unique and I loved that about it. In the beginning it was very mysterious and intriguing but started to lose its wonder at the end. The writer could have took it up a notch and put some more details into it.The fight scenes were ok. That's about it. They could've been a lot more creative in the way he got his revenge but overall it was a solid movie although not gonna be a classic for me.",Mandy
250,mga-65088,Not just a movie it's a lifetime experience,10,6 July 2019,I think it's the first time Nicolas Cage was able to be both realistic and crazy in the same movie in a very long time as in the last ten years he was just crazy in some movies like bad lieutenant and in other movies like Joe he was realistic and more serious but Cage outstanding preformace wasn't the only thing good about this movie an extraordinary cinematography and amazing soundtrack were two of best elements that made this movie very distinctive I expect a bright future for its director as well,Mandy
251,tjsuf,"It's visually stunning, but falls completely apart in the writing.",5,11 January 2019,"I mean, it's different, no one is arguing that. In fact, if you go through these reviews that is probably the one thing everyone agrees on. The lighting and cinematography is pretty breathtaking, for about an hour, but then even that gets boring. The reason why is because it's slow. I don't know if it was the plot that was horrible or if they shot it to be suuuuuppppeeeerrrrr slllllloooowwwww, or a combination of both, but Good God did the movie drag on. It felt like they were moving in slow motion the whole movie. If they did not have Nick Cage in it, the movie probably would have been a dud, and you all know it deep down inside.
I give the movie like a 5.2, it's a fun watch if your drunk or on drugs. If not, its super slow and to me, it fell apart because there was no direction to the story. Well there is a direction, but it was predictable, bland, and overdone.",Mandy

253,Marc_Horrickan,Parodying the Unparodyable,6,19 October 2018,"I am not sure why I had such high hopes for Panos Cosmatos stylish husk of a horror film. The word-of-mouth buzz around it was perhaps one contributor, as was the promise of that rather gorgeous promotional poster. The fact that the late Johann Johansson had worked on the soundtrack, which sounded like a free interpretation of the great electro themes of early 1980s cinema also had grabbed my attention. While the presence of Andrea Riseborough in the titular role balanced off the frustrations of any film where Nicolas Cage is encouraged to implode. Yet all of these possible sparks of excitement count for nought having now surveyed what I can only describe as the first Netflix aggregated film.Cosmatos is clearly a film nerd in the Tarantino tradition, having gorged himself on the kind of high-wattage 80s trash of the TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2 and MOTEL HELL, he has chugged up for the audience a film that feels custom calibrated to appeal to a nostalgia for the idea of the 'midnight movie' and 'the video nasty'.It is a film that is consciously riding the retro-zeitgeist for all things neon, electro 80s. In casting Nicolas Cage as the avenging husband Cosmatos seems inspired less by what to do with Cage in this role and more by the Youtube infamy that Cage's school of overacting has achieved. One scene in particular, involving a pair of Y-fronts and a bottle of vodka, is nothing more than the cynical addition to Cage's YouTube 'wig-out' reel. The inclusion of King Crimson over the title credits gives the film the further gloss of artful pretension. While the bum-achingly slow pace of the film rings of Cosmatos ridiculing the indulgent stylings of 'arthouse' slow cinema.What makes the film even more unfathomable is the restraint that the whole thing actually evidences, certainly when placed in the context of the type of horror movie it is liberally riffing from. The violence here is brutal, but completely undercut by the dual attack of daft humour and a aversion to lingering upon the gorier aspects of what the film offers. Eyes pop, heads roll, women are cremated alive, but none of this violence is really felt, nor is it particularly repellent. Compare what Cosmatos is doing to the more audacious Giallo-infused self-reflexiveness of Helene Cattet and Bruno Forzani's work. THE STRANGE COLOUR OF YOUR BODY'S TEARS (2013) has a similarly trippy aesthetic, in which the violence is more shocking and brutally rendered.There is clearly craft at work in the visual aesthetic and the score. Cage will always have his fans and defenders. And there really is nothing quite like a good revenge tale. Yet that is the limit of my positive feelings toward this film. Its real crime is in parodying the unparodyable, making it impossible to appreciate some of the great work from Linus Roache as the drugged-out Mansonesque figure, who has the flavour of Todd Rundgren about him. Rather than doing something as groundbreaking as certain critics have suggested, I find the whole affair a kind of conservative regression, a film that attempts to bring the outre into the mainstream by coyly viewing its violence through a glass darkly. Disappointing - and what on earth did Andrea Riseborough sign up for?",Mandy
254,Grismar,I really want to rate this even higher,8,4 February 2019,"I mean, an occult 70's/80's-retro revenge porn horror romp with a tilted Nicolas Cage in the starring role, with amazing eye candy and a score to die for. Throw in some crazy fx and animation sequences and this has to be a 10/10.For fans. Because that's the issue here: this is not a good film. It's amazing and I'll re-watch it a couple of times over the years, with friends and alone, I'm sure. But it's really only that good for a niche audience. If you suspect you might be in or near the target audience, buckle up for the ride of the year. But if you're not, steer clear of this one.Rating this moving even higher would only be possible if it had all of the above, as well as two more things: originality (in story and not just form) and slightly more mainstream appeal (without losing the fan service).But god, I love this film and I can't help loving Nicolas Cage for these kinds of roles.",Mandy
255,b-96875,Mandy,9,11 September 2020,"A star vehicle for the much maligned (and often rightly so) Nicolas Cage, Panos Cosmatos has created one of the most stunning and visceral cinema experiences I have had in a long time. Sure, Cage can sometimes border on the overly campy but Mandy serves these tendencies well.",Mandy
256,bobhartshorn,Lynch via Zombie,8,19 October 2018,"A Hell spawned psychedelic horror cartoon made flesh from the Son of Rambo featuring a Nicholas Cage vodka-cleansing meltdown in a Clockwork Orange décor bathroom?!? No, don't pinch me, this isn't a dream/nightmare, this is a living breathing reality - and if you're quick enough, you can catch it on the big screen where it deserves to be seen.
On paper, Mandy is nothing more than a standard nuts & bolts revenger: Lumberjack Red Miller (Cage) hunts down wrong-uns who've seriously mistreated his other half (a supernaturally unrecognisable Andrea Riseborough in the title role). Cue bloody eye-for-an-eye retribution and you-know-the-drill etc.
In the hands of director and co-writer Panos Cosmatos however, the visual aesthetic is content and king: performances, dialogue, composition ad infinitum, are stylised to within an inch of their beautiful lives in a slow-burning, virtue-in-vices action-horror that shamelessly worships at the altar of John Norman book covers and the fanboy soiled, dog-eared pages of Metal Hurlant magazine. It explicitly bows before unfashionable fantasy icons Boris Vallejo and Frank Frazetta, boldly wearing cosmetic homages to their work like a barbarians' shield of honour on its claret soaked sleeve, often to brilliant effect.
Cosmatos finds room too for acid-casualty Cenobites on wheels, ghoulish anime' interludes, dueling chainsaws and Linus Roache's religious cult leader lunatic (the wickedly christened Jerimiah Sand) paying unapologetic tribute to Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet...and - is that a Friday The 13th reference I can hear? Toss in Don Dohler, anal sex, chuck-up cheese goblins and some well timed humour, and voila! - we.have.Mandy (think Mastodon: The Movie directed by David Lynch and you're half way there).
My only complaint is, it doesn't take things quite as far as it should have done. Mandy is left a little bit wanting at times, almost as if Cosmatos held back on the accelerator for fear of landing his Heavy Metal meditation on life, the universe and broadsword thingamajigs the wrong side of 'tasteful', thereby disqualifying it from the almost unanimous cheers of goodwill its warmly received from the critical elite (the 95% rating at Rotten Tomatoes is richly deserved, but one can't help feel that the exact same voices of praise would have spat on Mandy if it had been directed by Rob Zombie).
Cage should have been madder, the bad guys badder, the blood bloodier and the drug-stuff druggier to take it from plain ole' OTT, to the orbit of Jupiter (or Saturn) where it truly belongs. If Mr Panos had pushed it just that little bit further, then I'd be able to push it to full marks and (possibly) my movie of the year spot.
But don't let that (smallish) gripe put you off. Mandy is still a stunningly shot, cinematic blast from start-to-finish with the best soundtrack of the year courtesy of the late Johann Johannsson (RIP). And there's not a Barry Manilow song in sight.",Mandy
257,CitizenKaneAAAAA,it's one of those!,6,1 December 2018,"Mandy for better or worse belongs to the artsy fartsy-compilations of unique shots-possessed deep or double meaning and more than just a ""horror film"" category of horror film genre. there are Witch, Babadook, It Follows, Mother! (which i despise so much!), Get Out, and many other. they are usually driven by a political issue disguise as other things, in this film it's an attack towards religious beliefs, Mandy and Nic Cage are towards nature where everything is calmer and peaceful, and they are fighting against the religious people who got their grandious idea by drugs.we kind of lose the meaning of film as an escapist medium and not as a propaganda, now more than ever. but, even though i'm pretty tired with everything critically acclaimed has to be political including horror films that i love since i was a little kid, i don't really mind, as long as the filmmaker realize that as much as rich the film is with some sprinkle of propaganda, it has to be entertaining as well, and gladly Mandy realizes that. there are a lot of cool and cheesy stuffs going on in this film as well as the high brow ones.",Mandy
258,iSkyWalKing,Edibles May Enhance Viewing Experience,10,24 June 2020,"If you've decided to watch this film, you should already know what you're getting into prior to going in. What you see is what you get. This is a fantastic film and possibly a masterpiece if you're into the genre. It's dark, gritty, grim, psychedelic, ominous & atmospheric. It has a grindhouse feel to it, with a dream like filter that adds to the overall mood of the film. Colour tones are used to set the vibe and it does a fantastic job. The fluctuating faces and pupils add a haunting tone. There are segments of animation that weave in and out very smoothly. Excellent transitions all around. Technically it is a beautiful film. It is essentially a drug fuelled revenge film that is meant to be an uncomfortable watch...This is one of three Nicolas Cage movies I've seen recently where I actually feel he fits perfectly into. Nicolas Cage has always been a joke but as I stated in my reviews for the other 2 films ( Color Out Of Space, Mom & Dad ), I feel he may have found his niche in the twilight of his career. There is very little dialogue in the film and VERY little dialogue from Nicolas Cage in general. These are the type of roles he belongs in. He is an awkward and weird individual and is made for off beat and awkward films such as this. Overall a pleasant surprise..This is a great film if you are into the genre and is a psychedelic trip. Some edibles or perhaps some mushrooms can definitely enhance the experience. Or just keep it simple and smoke a joint in advance. You can't go wrong.. I'm sure I'll come back to this film time and time again. As I stated it feels like a masterpiece to me within it's boundaries.",Mandy

Nicolas Cage gives the performance of a lifetime, he is absolutely stellar and wildly entertaining. His over the top acting and pure insanity is exactly what this film needed and he is undoubtedly perfect for this role. Watching him tear through a religious cult of cosmic evil is just captivating. Tremendously stylistic, almost every shot is meticulously crafted, stunningly color graded and is consistently a gorgeous sight which only adds to the horrific imagery. I love the way the film slowly descends from a grounded forest lakeside reality into the depths of a treacherous and demonic fantasy. All of this accompanied by a phenomenal score, one I can only describe as dreadful in the most complimentary way possible. Mandy is infinitely entertaining, and limitless in satisfaction, with the third act being absolutely volcanic and drenched in insanity.",Mandy

The movie is ambitious, as stated in other reviews, but maybe too ambitious for its own good. It tries to change the husband getting revenge on the bad guys scenario by adding the trippy, visual element to it. It was kind of cool in a weird way I guess, but the movie is hard to follow at times because you just don't know what the hell certain things are in the film and I think that was Panos Cosmatos' (director of the film) intention. The plot is simple in terms of a husband's wife is murdered by a gang of goons and he is given a chance to get his revenge on them. There are few things in this movie that step outside the formulaic plot given and you think to yourself well that can be made into a whole other movie in its own right. I didn't totally like Mandy as a whole, but Nic Cage spices things up with his gonzo, freak-out performance. His emotions displayed in this are on par and he really gives it his all. Don't ya just love Nic Cage? Movie: 7/10, Nicolas Cage: 10/10.",Mandy
265,mmaggiano,$6M Worth of Eye Candy and Deliberate Camp,1,3 February 2019,"The narrative, character and dialogue in Mandy are stripped down to a kind of deliberate camp and pulp that it could have been written by an incompetent storyteller, and then maximalist lighting and color grading has been applied with $6M. This is likely done on purpose, but any purpose in making it - beyond profit and yum-yums for those who hanker for retro-pulp and saturation knobs set to 200% - any purpose beyond that fails to exist. As a reviewer I'm usually with the kind of believer that the arts should have something-somehow worthwhile to say (historically and politically that's a wide range of believers, from hippies to tweedy professors to ordinary folk) and I will shunt any discussion of art-for-arts-sake or deliberate camp as a kind of yuck vs. Yum discussion: I may find such art tasty or not, but any disagreement about that kind of work is a matter of pure taste. It's easy to see how a sketch parody or a 1-panel comic meme about Mandy might instantly have more to say than Mandy itself does. Yes, cinematic freak-outs, midnight movies and deliberate camp can absolutely be great fun, but so can frozen yogurt, or your drug of choice for your midnight movie viewing- it's mere taste.Looking at this and feeling around for ironic purpose is a tough sport, especially the kind of deliberate camp here, done by professionals with a budget measured in millions. It often reduces to watching the nearly-crippling decadent kinks that a director and his flock need to finish. Did they really need all that equipment? How precious. Sontag's Notes on ""Camp"" must come to mind here, and I'll finish my brief thoughts on this movie in communication with that essay. I might differ from Sontag on deliberate camp; to me, deliberate camp can indeed have as its purpose a kind of ironic or farcical statement. That said, Mandy certainly has the ready-made characters and the style-over-substance of camp. But just as one can differentiate naive camp from deliberate camp, one can differentiate between deliberate camp as 'mere taste and detatchment for dandies', versus deliberate camp as 'dethroning and detatchment '. Foppery and insurrection don't overlap much. With Mandy's mock-dramatics yet responsible artistry and too-quality cinematography, it must be mere taste. Mandy is a quality version of what you wanted if you wanted more vaporwave/oversaturation/formal lighting, 80's pulp, Nic Cage, metal, fantasy, action, horror and thriller. It's stripped of anything to straightforwardly say or anything to ironically feel. It's camp as flavor. Don't confuse that with even the simplest things camp can do in dethroning seriousness.",Mandy

The characters are gritty, funky and strange.Watching Mandy was like every screen was a work of art, one after another - never knowing what the next screen would show. I was mesmerized by it. The colors, the lights, the filters, the music and the ambiance in this movie are amazing.Mandy is also very David Lynch - many of the scenes were awesomely and hilariously Lynchian, the kind where you want to almost poke your own eye out, which was just the cherry on top.If you are looking for something fast-paced with lots of fun and great dialogue, Mandy isn't for you.

Psychedelia, creepy religious happenings, crazed Cage shenanigans, and a megalomaniac if insecure leader. The music, sound design, and visuals create such a weird atmosphere. Voices are often distorted, and scenes pull off visual tricks like Jeremiah trying to inculcate Mandy, their faces dissolving into each other. Then there's little moments like the Cheddar Goblin commercial, instantly memorable and destined to be iconic. All performances are solid, but I'm not gonna lie - Nicholas Cage absolutely steals the show, starting out quite restrained, even gentle, which makes his freak out in the second half all the more powerful. You see him scream grief in his underwear, swigging copious amounts of alcohol, forge his own weapon, snort cocaine, and bring down some serious pain on his enemies.

The whole scene, women, alcohol, drugs, the whole holywood scene and like many he melted down. He makes so many movies because he does not get the salary he once did as an a lister. That does not mean he makes all bad movies, just watched one from couple years ago where his was more a cameo than lead but he was awesome, sword play knights templar type movie, it was good and enjoyable. he has a wide range and when he really wants to and focuses can put in an excellent performance.Sadly, he does not have much to work with in allot of the films he does, the indie's and b's, no budget, no good effects, no good supporting actors, some times this is a good thing lol. I really hope he get's his act together before it is really too late and stops His bad habits.

Some people may think it is gonna be action packed movie with a chainsaw wielding Nic Cage.You get that though. You get some really amazing ""classic nic cage"" freak out and crazy moments with cool bursts of action and fights but the film requires you to be patient because it takes it's time to build towards an awesome third act. It's a slow burn.Also, this film has a great BLACK COMEDY element to it so it did make me laugh where it was supposed to It has some really good cinematography, great use of color especially neon blue and red color which reminded me of Only God Forgives and the Neon Demon. The film is also beautifully edited with fade transitions.The score by Johan Johansson R.I.P is amazing. It perfectly serves the sense of surrealism and all of the badassery that follows in the third actThe review can't be complete without talking about Nic Cage. Under a right director and a good script, he is a really good actor and here he proves that. He has some scenes where he has to go crazy and act over the top but I think that's intentional but it works well because who doesn't love a crazy and pissed off Nic cage throwing tantrums? but here he also showed a lot of emotional range in emotional scenesOther actors, Andrea Riseborough and the actors who play the villains were also quite good.A critique of mine is that the first two acts could've been cut a little short, just a little bit so the film moved faster because at certain scenes, it was getting too slow, especially in the first act which was about making you care about Nic cage and his wife and the second act. Also I wish they did a better job of making you care but they did do a great job of making you hate the villains Final Rating 7.0/10. While the story is just okay and moves at a slow pace in first two acts, it stands out as a new spin on revenge-action grind house film because it sets up and pays off it's set up really really well in that balls to the walls, crazy, twisted and satisfying third act. Be patient, you will like it.",Mandy
286,juanandonly-80815,Loved the surrealism and references but that's the end of it,6,6 December 2020,"""Mandy"" has a shallow and typical plot about revenge and cult but the surrealism made a bit exceptional storytelling. The 'cabin in the woods' atmosphere strengthen every hallucination moments that gives viewers an abstract psychedelic experience. The mood of the film is seemingly a product of ominous forces coming in a stylish passion. ""Mandy"" is like a lowkey and broad counterpart of Stanley Kubrick and Quentin Tarantino's work combined together but with outlandish seriousness and terror. Actors did an underrated output led by the main star Nicolas Cage but Linus Roach was the one that delivers the most vicious impression. Difficult to consider a masterpiece but the certainty about ""Mandy"" is it is done through a commendable effort by a virtuoso.",Mandy
287,Krush_Burner,The Masterpiece of Grindhouse Cinema as a Total Art form,10,12 September 2018,"There is first and foremost word one should know about this film before watching it, and this word is: ""Gesamtkunstwerk"". In 1840s Richard Wagner used this term to describe the work of art which embraces different forms of expression and unifies them within a single form. This constitutes ""Total Work Of Art"", and ""Mandy"" is definitely looks like one of such works. This parallel my seem odd and even ridiculous, but Panos Cosmatos's film is nevertheless great example of a film in which form and content are united inseparably and supports one another.
On the surface lies amazingly crafted revenge action horror, tenderest love letter to every grindhouse fan, full of gore, creepy soundtrack and fantastic acting (besides brilliant Nicholas Cage there's a great performances by Andrea Riseborough and Linus Roach, plus cameo by Bill Duke), with a lots of geeky references. But this is only the beginning.
In the deep abides dark, twisted story, which incorporates themes from religion to current political agenda in an visionary style, filled with bright, screaming colors and aesthetics of a violent vengeance. This is obviously very personal film, made from particular point of view, but it has an universal meaning thanks to story and acting. Tragic and sarcastic, violent and sentimental, with it's tongue-in-cheek humour and witty dialogues, this simple story becomes something magnificent. In this way, again, ""Mandy"" can be regarded as an attempt, conscious or not, to establish a total work of art, perfect blend of narrative, music, acting and subtext into something very powerful. This is 1980s-inspired exploitation film made by genius. Go see it. Think of it. Let it flow through you. Enjoy the ride.",Mandy

Nic Cage for me has become a sign I am about to watch a crappy movie I even find going back to his older movies he was never a good actor really he just had good roles with better actors picking up the pieces where he failed.

296,crom-dubh,"Brilliant, entertaining, moving",10,11 December 2018,"This is, quite simply, a work of genius. If anyone saw Beyond the Black Rainbow and wondered if Cosmatos had made a one-off fluke that was so singularly bizarre and compelling, we now know the answer to this question. All the ingredients that made his first film good is present in Mandy in greater quantity. Cosmatos is a film maker who is capable of taking the humor and schlock of the grindhouse sensibility and fusing it with the consummate artistry of a director like Kubrick. This might seem like a bold statement but I stand by it. I think regardless of whether you like his films, one has to admit that he has an impressive command of the medium. We get the impression that everything is carefully controlled by someone who understands the desired outcome.Mandy is a film that was very much marketed as a bloody, escapist revenge romp. But that's really only half the story here. The first act of the film is actually very slow-moving, and we really get to settle into the idyllic relationship between Red and his titular love. Tragedy causes the film to morph into something much different. Dreamlike, hallucinogenic, surreal, are all words you could use to describe the events leading up to this moment. I have heard people criticizing the build-up as boring, but in many ways this is the best part of the film for me.That is not to say, however, that the events that follow are any less satisfying. On the contrary. What follows is absolutely nuts, and I think anyone who went into this film craving violent revenge will not be disappointed. I think that revenge is a dish best served messy. Many films portray our avenger as almost superhuman in the efficiency of their work, dispatching their enemies with ease, mowing through rooms full of them without effort (think Kill Bill). I prefer films like Blue Ruin where our protagonist is a mere mortal who has no natural talent for violence but blunders his way bloodily through by sheer force of will. Mandy falls into the latter category, and I think it's better for it.This film ticks all the right boxes, and the acting, direction, music all cohere into a singular experience that will leave you equally entertained and moved.",Mandy

This is a slow-build type of movie. It sometimes uses long lingering shots that don't contribute any information to the plot. The main character and his lady Mandy are pretty bland people at first. The cult figures are obviously evil but not that interesting until they decide to go after Mandy. The stuff starts getting CRAZY. The 2nd half of the film turns into an insane grindhouse style killing spree. I enjoyed it. It makes full use of Nic Cage's craziness. I loved his decent into madness, starting with his booze chugging in the bathroom, later snorting a big pile of coke belonging to a guy he just killed, and finally sampling something in a jar that I have no idea what it was. I loved his performance and even laughed a couple times. 
 
The movie uses weird filters and colors so watching it is like being on LSD. BE ADVISED: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE ON LSD (OR MUSHROOMS) OR YOU ARE PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEED A BAD TRIP. Just watching it sober makes you feel like you are tripping out. Sure the visuals can be a bit much and the synth soundtrack is borderline annoying but it creates such a feeling of tension and madness that I can't help but kind of like this movie just for the experience. The movie is weird, it has plot holes, it is boring at times and cheesy at others, and once it was over I couldn't help but think ""Wow, what the hell did I just watch?"" But that being said I still enjoyed it, hence my rating of 7.Be warned, this movie is not for everyone.

Take some time and watch a David Lynch, Darren Aronofsky or Alejandro Jodorowsky film, understanding surreal films are not the most popular film, but it is better then a one star!Think of this as John Wick as a Surreal film.All you have to know, man loves women, woman loves man. Crazy Cult guy lust after women, summons demons to get the women. Crazy cult guy and his followers drug women so he can have sex with her. She laughs at him, even be drugged up, she sees through his BS. Crazy cult guy gets angry and burns her alive, while the mad is tied up in barb-wire and stabbed at his side.

I wouldn't say this a 10/10 movie, but it's not a 1 either. The good points:- it's well crafted, with lots of gratuitously over the top violence. Nicholas Cage doesn't have much dialogue and he puts in a reasonably good performance. The manson-esque religious cult leader also gives a Dennis Hopper type homage with his acting and also does a great job. The bad points:-. The story is just very weak, there's no depth to any of the characters, the pace of the film isn't really exciting or engaging at all.

One scene in particular has such rawness of emotion that pushes Cage's character beyond the anti-hero stereotype and creates a relatable and haunted man.
There is some dark comedy throughout and equally powerful performances by co-stars, the whole movie is a surprisingly good horror-dramedy.

The visual effects and cinematography are beautiful, the music and sound effects also suit the film.

313,Reelnerd,Mandy: It's a Trip,7,29 October 2018,"Real Nerd Review: Mandy
By Nelson Nantanapibul
Writer/Director: Panos Cosmatos
Starring: Nic Cage, Andrea Riseborough, Linus Roache, Ned Dennehy, Olwen Fouere, Richard Brake, Bill Duke, Line Pillet
Legion M an independent fan owned movie studio has released an indie horror film produced by Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings) and starring the legend that is Nic Cage (Ghost Rider, National Treasure, Face Off). Mandy is a trip of a film directed by Panos Cosmatos the son of George P. Cosmatos (Tombstone, Cobra, Rambo II). This film is a love letter to The Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and just about any and every horror film from the 80's and before.
Panos uses some interesting imagery and his use of filters and colors mimics what I would imagine is a bad or maybe a good acid trip. This film is hard to describe in terms of plot, characters and anything relating to a traditional film and traditional filmmaking. I couldn't even tell you Nic Cage's name in the film because I don't think he's ever referred to by name but the title character of the film is named Mandy who is Cage's love interest in the film who is kidnapped and murdered by a cult and some crazy Zombie drug addicted bikers who resemble the cenobites from The Hellraiser series.
I will reveal some spoilers in my review because it really won't ruin anything. This film is about the journey not the destination. Plot and character really doesn't matter in this film as it's a Grindhouse art film through and through. After Cage's love is slain by a cult leader and his followers he goes on a revenge spree to end all revenge sprees. He is Ash Williams from The Evil Dead turned up several notches in insanity and intensity.
There is a very fun and insane chainsaw fight in this film between our protagonist and one of the aforementioned Zombie bikers. Cage has sparse few lines in the film his character is relegated to grunts, groans, primal screams and crazy facial expressions throughout. Think of Mandy as a Tarantino-esque film sans the witty dialogue.
As I said this film is set in the early 80's and is an homage to 80's slasher/revenge thrillers but don't expect a nostalgia fest either. This film is extremely low budget and they couldn't afford the licensing rights to popular 80's songs so they rely mainly on an 80's sounding synth score by Johann Johannsson who recently passed away. His score is quite haunting and quite good.
This film is not for everyone certainly. You have to have a particular taste for this type of Grindhouse style film. Many who see it may not like it at all which is understandable. This film is over the top ridiculous nonsense and I enjoyed it thoroughly. If you're a fan of Nic Cage and his films check it out.",Mandy

But this held me oddly captivated.
I don't think it's a movie you can explain to someone who hasn't seen it. I'm not sure if I understand the point of this movie. But it's like being lowered into the deep end of a polluted swimming pool, the surface swimming with all the lovely swirling colours of an oil slick. Or something like that. Arthouse revenge. Who knew?",Mandy
315,fpcholcomb,"The Definition of Style Over Substance, A Good Film",7,19 September 2018,"Mandy is a visual delight that captures a wicked and perditious 70s vibe through extraordinary use of color and editing. In one scene two faces are shifted almost seamlessly together warping slowly in a closeup that was as disturbing as it was compelling. Mandy is full of little delights like this and for that alone is worth seeing.But there is a disclaimer here, the movie is not for the faint of heart. It is grotesquely violent and deals with devious, devious, characters. The violence is altered somewhat by the movies presentation, the world does not feel real. It feels ripped from an old sci-fi book, extricated from normal society. So the violence does not feel as real per-se. It does seem to hint at the danger that lurked around rural areas with drug problems, an issue that is unfortunately very real and still plaguing America to this day, and which is most certainly disturbing.Then there is the Cage factor. The acting was great all around with surprisingly compelling performances from Andrea Riseborough, playing the innocent, coming-from-a-troubled-home Mandy, and Linus Roache, playing a blatant Manson ripoff. But Cage really takes the cake here. My absolute favorite scene hands down involves Cage in a bathroom with some wounds and some alcohol. It is a respite from the distorted imagery from the rest of the film, it looks realistic and grounds the film somewhat in reality, and his dedication to his character's pain rippled through the screen. I do complain that we did not get enough exposition on Cage's character, so the effect of his inevitable change did not land as hard as it should have. I could have used a few more lines of dialogue while Cage was normal and out in the wild, but that is a minor gripe.The film includes a lot of cool references to 60-70s era culture and there is the low hanging fruit of religion that it harps on rather ineloquent in my opinion, but all in all my major complain with Mandy is that while it is absolutely dripping with style the overarching plot is that of a generic cult thriller. These Manson movies have been done to death and while I liked its commentary on drugs and lust in the backcountry, as far as thematic boldness Mandy offers little. Thank god for the disfigured biker gang that added an interesting and well designed foe into the mix. The biker scene with the pile of cocaine and the pornography was hilariously entertaining and needed to be in this film.The movie is so absurd it becomes funny at times, and its presentation is so engaging I can't imagine people becoming disinterested unless the violence turns them off. A definite recommend for those that can stomach the harshness of what Mandy offers.One last thing I should mention, I do not know if the movie theater I went to had weirdly adjusted sound levels but Mandy's score, while brilliant, gave me a headaches at moments that persisted through about half the film. In some respects it made the effects of the visuals more stupefying but on the other hand I was left disjointed for the rest of the day. Just a warning.",Mandy

Beyond the Black Rainbow, Mandy, and I assume Color Out of Space does the fun lighting as well. This effect is not really practical for these or any type of movie, but it does create an atmosphere that I happen to enjoy.Mandy also suffers or delights, depending on who you ask, in going lean on the dialogue. I also enjoy movies that try to show you a story over telling you a story. Sometimes, this doesn't work. Under the Skin does it well. Beyond the Black Rainbow maybe doesn't do it so well. Mandy tries it and does ok, but not great. For what the movie is, the extended scenes of silence don't particularly help the story along. They just appear to aid in the arthouse effect.As far as revenge flicks go, there are many better ones, but this one is interesting nonetheless.

But for the most part, it delivered and was overall very entertaining. Most are calling this a ""Love it or Hate it"" kind of film. That may be true but I believe there's elements present here that can satisfy a lot of people. There's no denying that ""Mandy"" is a revenge film, plain and simple. And in executing that factor it succeeds. The kills are fun, violent and bloody. Nic Cage is over the top but not goofy. This is certainly the most enjoyable performance I've seen him give in quite a bit. The films has its flaws though. The first half is rather slow with some scenes and shots that drag on for far too long. And since all the kills leading up to the finale were so satisfying, it was a shame and kind of a buzz kill that the last one was rather silly and underwhelming, even considering the film's tone. But all in all it's a solid revenge flick with a blood soaked, axe wielding Nicolas Cage that's undeniably a visual treat.",Mandy
325,bwallarab,Death Wish meets Timothy Leary,8,10 July 2019,"This is a gorgeous film. While basically a boiler-plate revenge flick, the film, with its subtexts of insanity and hallucinogenic drug use, is simply gorgeous to look at. Deserving to be viewed more than once, the film satisfies at different levels. Cage's virtuosic and nuanced performance is a thing to behold and only adds to the canon of films that prove he is perhaps the finest actor of his generation. Even in the throes of insanity and LDS tripping, Cage adds multiple layers to his intense performance, the man is a genius. All performances are top-notch, by the way. The cinematography, lighting, color schemes, and masterful use of camera shots are worth viewing alone, perhaps with the sound off. While it at times hints at graphic novel visuals, it is more than that. The sound design is remarkable as well.
As mentioned earlier, there is not much to the plot although there is a novel, almost supernatural quality to the biker gang. But perhaps revenge movies don't need to be more than that. This is not about reason...it is about the animalistic, visceral desire to avenge loss when there is nothing more to lose. Higly recommended.",Mandy

329,anasismael,"Perfect,, unbelievable,,, wonderful💥💥",8,16 September 2018,"Your exact point of reference for what Cage's most recent peak was may vary. For my money, the psychedelic revenge narrative of Mandy is probably the best Cage movie in over a decade -- probably since Adaptation in 2002. As Red Miller, a humble lumberjack in the Pacific Northwest circa 1983, he gets to be a quiet romantic and a violent lunatic. It's in the same wild-eyed, gonzo vein as his iguana-hallucinating turn in Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, but there's also a tenderness to this coke-sniffing, biker-slaughtering odyssey. This is the most poignant, emotionally raw movie with a chainsaw fight I've ever seen.",Mandy

Between 'Mandy' and 'Beyond the Black Rainbow', Panos Cosmatos has carved out an impressive niche of nostalgic psychedelia worthy of cult status and praise for decades to come. This is of course bittersweet with the passing of one of the greatest film composers of all time, Jóhann Jóhannsson. Due to the nature of the film, this won't go down as his most accomplished work. Regardless, the marriage between the score and imagery in 'Mandy' is extraordinary. RIP Jóhann and thank you for your remarkable contribution to some of the best films of the past decade (i.e. 'Sicario', 'Arrival', 'Prisoners', 'The Theory of Everything' and of course 'Mandy').",Mandy

Calling it that is like taking an arts catalog and calling it a good book.The acting is top-notch, the directing is good but there are some significant problems with the pace. There's no build-up before the fights, they just occur, very randomly at times. The problem is compounded by the fact that the fights are also very short and that prohibits the development of any tension.

Even art movies can take your attention, but this movie slow , it seems to enjoy it you need to take some of their pills, and if u thought it just bad, then it comes up will be worse they want way too far with this ""art"" vein characters not introduced , they have no story, eventually they has no goal as well or anything you can think of, the only reason i put ni worse score, because even I hate 100years loneliness novel, because it slow and boring , it one of the best books for other people. Generally therefore i would give 4 stars but could not do because i thought ok i will listen this in background and focus something else but it is not possible because the voices/effects are totally annoying, watching it in a theater / cinema would lead people leave the room, just bad i have no words...

Unfortunately, the story turned out to be an uninteresting bare bones revenge story. It didn't even have a story twist or some ambiguity or anything, from around the middle .it just felt like a slow video game- The visuals and music alone just weren't enough to keep me interested for the full two hours. I think it will find it's audience though; it reminded me of Mad Max:Fury Road, which was also just visuals, so I think if you are the person that liked Futy Road, you'll probably like this one as well.

There's 3 demonic figures in this film that serves NO PURPOSE whatsoever. I became confused at are critics and audience misleading me, and I said yeah!

The only slightly positive things I can say about this movie is that the casting and acting was ok. The rest is just a bad acid trip on a low budget.

It's like someone took ghost rider & drive angry and tried to make a drugged up 'psychadelic' mashed up version. Like where even are they now? In the woods? In a quarry? In a frikken cave?!

355,irrelevantlife,"Completely off the rails, but in a good way!",7,25 April 2020,"Mandy is just too weird at times to be taken seriously, but it knows how to delve into the depths of human depravity and misery. And this is where is succeeds to trigger the right emotional response in the viewer, lending its characters a sense of believability amidst a cast of outcasts and downright psychopathic characters.
Cage is cast just right as the quite yet potent avenger of his beloved Mandy, willing to go the extra mile to see the ones responsible for his tragic predicament get what is coming to them.The cinematography is truly absurd at times, it feels like the filmmakers had experimented with various type of mushrooms and other recreational drugs to come up with the coloration and lightning effects in the movie. But this in turn ends up being completely viable as the plot and its characters are just as extreme as the cinematography itself, one could call it a perfect marriage of form and function blending abstract art-form with just as abstract characterisations.If you can stomach some of the more gruesome scenes in the movie, then give this one a go!",Mandy
356,justice_for_allro,King Crimson and Tool translated into imagery,10,26 September 2018,"After beyond the black rainbow I was very anxious to see what Panos will deliver through Mandy.I got even more excited during the first minutes of the movie when I've heard King Crimson's starless. KC is (along with Tool) my most favorite band, they deliver a unique sound in the realm of art rock just like Panos delivers unique visuals in his art house films. Before I get to the movie itself, I think that casting Nic Cage was both a good and a bad decision. He was great for the part but the ""fan base"" he has consisted mainly in mainstream movie lovers. Those came here and gave their vote (mostly 1 to 3 stars) on a movie they wouldn't otherwise (in case Cage wouldn't be part of the cast) see. On the other hand, Beyond the black rainbow, a movie with no mainstream actor in it, still got pretty low ratings considering how good it is. 
I can't begin the actual review without comparing it to BTBR, with whom he shares many similarities. Both have, portrayed as the antagonist, a delusional and egocentric, LSD/drugs driven characters. Panos Cosmatos did an excellent job in choosing the actors for both movies, Michael Rogers and Linus Roache are great in portraying deranged individuals. 
The resemblance to BTBR doesn't end here ... both take place (at least partially) in 1983, both are homage and pay tribute to great filmmakers, they share the same vibe and feature and excellent score and some similarities as far as the cinematography is concerned. The car scenes have the same concept in terms of lighting and a similar meaning, altered/changed personalities and a reminder that the main character is in a fantasy world. Enough with the comparison, let's get back to the film and talk about the script & story. (this is where the similarity to BTBR starts to fade). Story wise it isn't so complex and but I do think that there are plenty of metaphors and symbols throughout, at least enough of those in order to let the viewer use his imaginations and draw his own interpretation. Warning - mild spoilers aheadIn the beginning we see the idyllic/ utopic world the characters live in, they seem to be soul mates and live in a secluded house, sharing the same ""universe"". The fact that they chose this remote place to live their lives in, could be a statement that the company of the other is enough for both of them. 
Besides being a huge fan of Panos and King Crimson I must admit that I also love the location they decided to shoot in (Wallonia region in Belgium).When they are ""separated"", the revenge part I think is mostly a symbolic one. Not only he managed to revenge her, but does it by entering a different world (her fantasy world). The ending scene, where you get to see her drawings, is a good indicator that he traveled to where she is. Overall, I would highly recommend this movie, especially since 2018 brought few original flicks (""The endless"" being one of those few). It's a cathartic and unique experience both visually and in terms of the excellent chosen score.
 
PS: It's not really a classic tale of revenge so I won't compare it to what I think is the benchmark of revenge movies (Dead man's shoes).",Mandy
357,ThatSlackerOnSci-Fi,A Revenge Thriller from the Bowels of Hell - A Grindhouse Classic,9,2 January 2019,"If I were to simply describe Mandy it would be as a dark, twisted but beautiful nightmare. The story is simple but that's not a bad thing, it's how the story is told and how creative the movie expresses that story. This is one of the most beautifully shot movies I've seen, it's a full on psychedelic story of lost love and revenge. It's a movie on crack, it may not be perfect, the first half is especially slow, (although the cinematography is incredible). Once you get to the 2nd half, it becomes something of an action masterpiece.Nick Cage gives his best performance here, in fact all the actors bring their A-game here in playing these vulnerable yet despicable people. Although their performances are secondary to the spectacle and actor, the characters are simple but again, this isn't a bad thing. It's not for everyone but if you are slightly twisted and want a perfect movie for Halloween that isn't just another cliché horror movie or you just want something completely unique that embodies the feeling of listening to Heavy Metal, then this is the movie for you.",Mandy

Panos Cosmatos builds on what he created with Beyond the Black Rainbow (also recommended) by turning up the pacing and brutality while maintaining the trippiness. There's not a whole lot I can really say except that it must be experienced. Without a doubt one of the most engaging and gorgeous movies I've seen recently. Imagine the coloring of Suspiria mashed with the revenge brutality of, let's say, Hobo with a Shotgun meets Green Room. Watch the trailer, it does give an accurate taste of what the whole film is like. Haunting performances by Linus Roche and Richard Brake meld with the badassery of Nic Cage. The movie is very much a two parter: the first half a slow, creepy trip and the second an LSD fueled demon massacre. You'll know what I mean when you watch it. Just watch it.

The trailer suggested a beautiful, gory, and funny grindhouse film with Nicholas Cage freaking out in the way only he can. And I was really looking forward to seeing the axe Cage forged in the trailer. The second half of the film kind of lived up to this, but the first half is like a totally different film.When 'Mandy' finally got to Nicholas Cage freaking out it was a delight, it just took far too long to get there. The hints of 'Hellraiser' were cute, and the film was beautiful to watch with a fantastic score. But it dragged a lot, didn't show the axe enough considering how prominently it was featured in the trailer. The bigger chainsaw joke has been done to death and made me think of 'Phantasm 2' which is always good. Unfortunately it made me wish I was watching 'Phantasm 2' instead. If I watch 'Mandy' again now I know what kind of film it is I think I'll enjoy it more, although I would probably still be left wondering why the axe needed to be in the trailer when it's barely used in the film.",Mandy

As a King Crimson fan I found the use of Starless irritating....at first, but it really does belong there. The scene where Mandy meets Jeremiah could have felt cheap and distasteful, but it was done so well it wound up being my favorite scene. When the bikers showed up I got an immediate flashback to Iron Maiden's video for ""From Here to Eternity"" and rolled my eyes, but then as the movie went on the cheesy heavy metal aesthetic began to feel more and more intentional until I was totally on board.

But at least we see his grimaces with his face covered in blood, or mud or, well, it's hard to tell because the film is so badly under-lighted that it is hard to tell what that slimy stuff is supposed to be. It could be an avocado peel as far as I can tell. And an avocado peel would make just as much sense as anything else in this movie. Apparently there is no script so bad, or premise so ridiculous that Nic won't do it for the right money. In this case it looks like he might have got paid at least a $20 per-diem, because they sure didn't waste their money on anything else in this movie, like sets or a script that makes sense.

369,icanbeaghost,"Beautiful and Gritty, Stays with You",9,2 November 2018,"Mandy is one hell of a piece of exquisite filmmaking. Combining arthouse with grindhouse has never come together quite as flawlessly as it does in this film. I couldn't help but immediately think Tarantino upon seeing the opening credits and as it progresses, the parallels are definitely there. That's not to say that this is a knockoff, quite the contrary, I think most filmmakers take cues from others and if Tarantino's work is one of Panos Cosmatos' inspirations, I welcome it. Also thrown in are some Charles Manson vibes, a subtle sense of humor, a killer, rock 'n' roll soundtrack and a touch of the supernatural, packaging it all up nicely. Not to mention Nic Cage, I mean, wow! With the exception of Leaving Las Vegas, I've never considered myself a huge fan due to his mediocre acting abilities and slew of less than satisfactory films, but damn if the part of Red wasn't written just for him. This is probably his best performance to date and I've gained a new respect for him that I hope to nurture further. In conclusion, when I first heard about Mandy several months back, I knew I would love it and I was more than right. It's definitely not for everyone due to its subject matter and elevated level of gory violence but even the most hardened critics, or softest hearts, should at least be able to appreciate its vision, artistically and otherwise.",Mandy

372,FolkHorror,A cinematic masterpiece - But not for everyone,10,16 January 2019,"Title: Mandy
Format: DVD Language: English Released: 2018
Director: Panos Cosmatos
Starring: Nicolas Cage, Andrea Riseborough, Linus Roache
I'm a huge Nicolas Cage fan, when he is good there really aren't many that can match him on screen, so when a horror film comes along with him in it, it's a no-brainer, I'm going to watch it. On top of this you have Linus Roache, another incredible actor, thrown in for good measure.
Panos Cosmatos, the creator of Beyond the Black Rainbow, is a director I've heard many good things about, sadly said film doesn't have a UK release, so I went into this film not knowing anything about his style, other than the high praise from my American friends.
It's hard to review this film in a short blog, I could write a thesis on it, it really is that complex and deeply layered. So, bear with me as I try to keep it short. It opens as a love story between two, well, lovers, Red Miller (Nicolas Cage) and Mandy Bloom (Andrea Riseborough), they live in a small house in a forest.
From here the film takes a dark turn when a cult called the Children of the New Dawn, led by a failed pop star, Jeremiah Sand (Linus Roache) catches a fleeting glimpse of Mandy as he passes her on the road. I would ruin what happens if I said more, so I will only say this, bad stuff happens and Red goes on a revenge mission to hunt down the Children of the New Dawn.
Seems simple enough, yet it is so very much more. The style of the film starts as a tripped-out art-house film when introducing us to the two lovers, but it never becomes so much so it pushes you away. Instead we are drawn into, and can feel for, the life these two hippy lovers, have together. I really felt I knew them; how they lived; how they thought. I cared for them as a couple, everything was bliss, perfect between them.
Then the Children of the New Dawn show up and tear everything apart. Red is left with life threatening wounds, as he slips in and out of consciousness, we see him slowly start to break. Putting myself in his shoes for a moment, would I have done things differently? Maybe phoned the police, gotten help? Given how deeply in love Red and Mandy are, I've got to say no; I would have done the same thing.
The second part of the film changes slowly in style as we watch Red fall deeper into madness. Gone is the hippy art-house colours of love and peace. Everything starts to get more defined, the shapes, lights, environment, it all becomes sharp and clear around Red, symbolising his focus on this newly found mission.
Yet now and then when Red slips into unconsciousness the world becomes an animation, showing us his thoughts and dreams, reminding us of his love for Mandy, she seems to be a spiritual guide, letting him know she is with him through this downwards spiral, that he is never alone on his journey into hell. Later these dreams and reality become intertwined with each other, another insight into the breaking mind of Red.
It reminds me somewhat, of the Greek tale of Orpheus and Eurydice, where Orpheus journeys into Hades to get Eurydice back. That's the thing that hit me the most, Panos use of mythology. Religious symbolism, from Greek and Norse myths, to Pagan and Christian ones, they saturate his film with their bloodiest tales. No matter what you believe or know, you can't help but see the mythos behind his style of film-making.
And like the heroes of old there comes a point of no return. When the hero is tested, does he become what he fights against or does he pass the test and remain pure? In this example we have Red standing, axe in hand, in front of Sister Lucy (Line Pillet), one of the Children of the New Dawn, does he kill her, cementing his downfall into Hell or let her pass and save what is left of his soul? Well I'm not going to tell you, you will have to watch the film!
This is another example of the complex story that Panos, weaves into his film. It is never a black and white or right and wrong story, you can never say, well these are the good guys and these the bad guys. Lines are blurred between right and wrong, victim and abuser. You never know if what you are seeing is the reality of the situation, or how Red is justifying it all in his mind.
This is reinforced towards the end of the film when we look into the car right at Red, he is bloodied and dirty but looks like a warrior from legends, then in an instant we are in the car next to him, looking at a crazed killer, soaked in blood with wild eyes and equally wild hair. Which one is the real Red? That's left up to you to decide, can you justify what just happened or are you horrified by what you have just witnessed.
This film is truly amazing, it's beautifully shot, thoughtfully edited, the cinematography and sound is all carefully planned and executed. From the location, set, clothes, makeup, acting, it all works seamlessly together to present an organic story of love and loss beyond almost anything I've seen or read for a very long time.
Not since I saw Guillermo del Toro's, Pan's Labyrinth, have I been so silenced and moved by a story on screen, my only wish now is to get hold of a copy of Beyond the Black Rainbow. Panos Cosmatos, has, in my humble opinion, created a masterpiece of cinematic storytelling.",Mandy

And by ""it all"", I mean chainsaw duels, Nic Cage losing his mind in a bathroom, and, most importantly, Cheddar Goblin.Look, is this going to be everyone's cup of tea? Absolutely not. In fact, I completely understand if you watched this film and walked away confused and also a little angry. I personally loved it. But also I am, admittedly, a huge weirdo.The direction is fantastic, the cinematography and lighting is to die for, and the whole thing has this trippy, almost post-apocalyptic, B-movie, 80's-metal-nightmare feel to it, and I loved it. If that description doesn't suit you, again, I totally get it. If it DOES, you're in for a treat.Plot-wise, there isn't a whole lot going on here. It all basically boils down to: crazy cultists kill Nic Cage's girlfriend and he goes banana-sandwich trying to get revenge.The film is not perfect by any means. There are a few scenes that really drag a bit, but I was ultimately so aesthetically pleased by the movie that I didn't really care.I'm not trying to sound like a broken record or anything, but I do want to emphasize that this film is not for everyone's tastes. It's the product of a director with a very intense, uncompromising, singular vision, and if it doesn't captivate you from the get-go, you probably won't enjoy the ride.However, if you're interested in something delightfully bizarre, trippy, intense, sometimes disturbing, and off-the-wall bonkers in the best way, give this film a watch. If it doesn't really sound like your thing, at least do yourself a favor and search Cheddar Goblin on youtube. The joys of Cheddar Goblin are universal.",Mandy

But the film is not easy at all. It had a lot of complex layer & perspective. From the very first scene to the last, there is a lot of crazy allegory!Parnos Cosmatos 's experimental art film seems to be a masala Hollywood horror with extravagant visual but the result is completely different.It's something turning into God from human and the God is like demon, powerful, cruel, brutal, self destructive, crazy! Overall the story mocks to be a revenge, it's actually a psychedelic dream set in an otherworldly dimension.Nicolas Cage is as brilliant as usual.But the legend late Johann Johannson's last Score is a masterpiece and a strong contender of OSCAR 2019 for Best Musical Score.

380,christianrmaxwell,A Nightmarish Visual Feast,10,9 August 2019,"Mandy is a psychedelic tale of brutal revenge, and a fairly simple one at that. Although simple, it is hands down one of the most enjoyable film experiences I have ever had. Nicolas Cage gives one of the best performances I have seen in a long time, being able to convey such raw emotion through very little dialogue. Speaking of the dialogue, there is very little in the entire movie, leaving the visuals to speak for themselves a lot of the time, and I see this as an absolute plus. The visuals are eye popping and trippy, with neon colors and a dreamlike quality to them, they are truly a pleasure to look at. The practical and cgi effects are both done extremely well, lending both of their hands to make this as surreal of an experience as possible. Watching this movie is like that to watching Suspiria, in that it feels more like a nightmare or a dream than an actual movie. If you explain the plot to someone, it is very simple, and plot wise the movie could be summed up in a paragraph or less. However, for me, it is the experience that the film takes you on, that is way more important than the plot in this case. Also, it has some of the goofiest lines of dialogue I have heard in a long time, such as, ""You are a vicious snowflake"" and ""You ripped my shirt!"" Of course, these lines come from Nic Cage, giving an extremely wild performance that gives into the silliness of the action many times, and boy does it work. The movie is serious and hits hard when it needs to, and then during some of its more odd or ridiculous sequences, it commits to that ridiculousness (Nic Cage literally killing a demon for ripping his favorite shirt). This movie also has one of the most satisfying endings I have seen in a long time, it made me want to get up and cheer. This movie is perfect. Everything about it just works so well, it is an absolute blast to watch, and will surely be getting many more viewings from me in the weeks to come. And if you are watching this movie and feeling bored or feeling like the movie is moving too slow, at least skip to the second half, that's where things get wild and ridiculous. Overall, this movie is amazing and I would recommend it to fans of Nicolas Cage, horror, drama, revenge tales, and trippy visuals. I give Mandy a stellar 10/10.",Mandy
381,pjtrekker,A tale of two movies.,7,30 December 2018,I really liked this movie but the abrupt tonal turn In the second half almost derails it. The first half is terrifying and bizarre. Cage establishes his character as a laid back woodsman He felt very real Then he turns into Rambo and the film loses its human emotional edge I guess it was believable becuase the whole story seemed to be a re-enactment or the fantasy novel his wife had been reading. I still highly recommend this movie. I would give the first half 10 out of 10 and the second half 5 out of 10. You will not be bored and I admire the director's ambitious choices.,Mandy

383,crosshatch,Awards! for worst...movie...ever,1,16 September 2018,"I heard a lot of hype about how this was Nicholas Cage's ""role of a lifetime"". I don't think he was EVER a great actor. Just so-so. So that in itself wasn't saying much.
But I had high hopes.
The first 20 minutes I kept waiting for the movie to start.
After an hour I was still waiting to see some acting. Or a plot. Or palatable script.
Then I was just waiting for it to end. I am still banging my head on the wall wondering why I wasted two hours of my life.
Poor effects. Ridiculous, disjointed plot scenes pasted on top unbelievable characters with bad acting. Blood. Chainsaws. Penis. Anime. 
What a fitting end to Cage's career, not to mention the other actors, the writer, producer, director. 
Whoever gave this movie high ratings was high. Or paid. 
There is NOTHING redeeming about this movie except that it will win awards for the worst...something.",Mandy
384,fosterino,I was disappointed by Mandy for surprising reasons!,7,1 October 2018,"I was very excited to see this movie - I loved the heavy metal vibe, I love Nic Cage, I love movies that are clearly just... different. I really wanted to like it, but came away rather unfulfilled.Here's what I did like about the movie. First of all I was all in on the vibe - a heavy metal fantasy, with bizarre touches of the supernatural (or is it just drugs?), awesome music (RIP Johan!), great performances, etc. You can tell this movie looked and felt exactly as intended. I was reminded of Twin Peaks a lot during this movie - the woodsy setting is part of it, but the last episode of the original run of Twin Peaks, where Coop ventures into the Black Lodge, is a good comparison. For 2 hours we are inside this movie/world where everything is aggressively odd. There's nothing like this movie at all! What I didn't like was the actual revenge part of the story. It was executed (no pun intended) in the most boring way possible. Especially for a movie with the famously insane Nic Cage, playing in a film with an insane heavy metal vibe, I was expecting either more gore or more over the top kills. After Nic Cage confronts and kills the demon-bikers the movie becomes rather dull, in all honesty. That scene had some odd editing (where did that giant pit come from?!) but had a wild, fun energy to it and the scene had some amusing implications for world building - this a crew of demonic Hellraiser-looking bikers who store steel caltrops in their sink (they all live together?), but they also order in pizza and chinese food? Do they tip the delivery guy well, at least? The bikers at least represent a very tough challenge for Nic to overcome. After that, only one member of the cult puts up any kind of fight (the chainsaw guy) and Nic mostly just walks up to people and stabs them, or kills them off camera, without much fanfare. The disappointment set in gradually, as I realized that oh, maybe this movie isn't really what I had hoped... And by the end opinion wasn't changed.It's not like this movie had to hide some violence to get around a harsh rating - this is a movie in which a woman is gruesomely burned to death and an insane Hellraiser-looking biker-demon uses a knife-dildo (a la Se7en) to stab at Nic Cage while hardcore porno plays on a TV in center frame. Maybe budget played a part? Some of the editing is done to obscure what would have been more complicated (expensive!) special effects gore - I'm thinking about the conclusion to the famous chainsaw duel in particular. I'd still recommend this movie; I'm kind of amazed that something so bizarre made it to theaters. It's clearly hitting big with some people - maybe you're one of them! I hope you take more from it than I did.",Mandy
385,Ol_MekDonald,Great,10,14 September 2018,"I give it a 10 because this type of movie is right up my alley. But for those wondering if you want to see it: it's an art house movie. It's slow, strange and to a general audience member, probably very boring. It's very meta and exists as a love letter to old school trash films. So if you're into that kind of stuff, then give it a try. This movie is less about plot and more about mood and feeling. It's bizarre but nothing so abstract that you can't understand it. There's some darkly funny moments but it's played straight throughout. Cool visuals and a really good soundtrack. It's not a gore fest like the trailer may lead one to believe, but the violence is satisfying. All in all, I really enjoyed it and I think anyone who's a film/horror buff would too.",Mandy

Then, there's Nicholas Cage's love interest, (Andrea Riseborough) who is not attractive in the slightest in this movie. In real life, she's cute. But not in here. Then there's a cult leader named: You guessed it ""Jeremiah"". lol...

387,bradaviel,Equally a Nicolas Cage and a Panos Cosmatos movie.,8,20 November 2018,"I'm a big fan of Beyond the Black Rainbow. I have the Mondo poster on the wall up my computer screen, the limited Vinyl and I also have the VHS limited edition. Even with an ending as weak as it has, it's one of my favorite movies ever.
And for a LONG time, Nicolas Cage was my favorite actor. Leaving Las Vegas, Sailor and Lula, Vampire's Kiss, Face/Off, The Rock, you name it. I LOVED the guy. So when I heard those two would team up, my mind exploded. And when I saw the movie, I was equally disappointed and delighted. Because It's not a Panos Cosmatos movie all the way. It's not a Nicolas Cage movie all the way. It's Both. I didn't understand that at first. Because I didn't think it was possible. I marvelled at the scenery, at how the shorts were eery and haunting. And I loved how unhinged Nicolas Cage was in the second part. But I thought it weakened the story telling. I wanted things to be logical. I wanted character building that just wasn't plot points given to you, and scenes just dropping like bombs. I was doing something I usually do not do : I was expecting to see something, instead of just being amazed to watch Nic evolving inside such a crazy and beautiful universe. The fact is, when you put Nicolas Cage in a movie, you cannot expect him not to be the monster actor that he is. It's as if he's not playing a character, but some version of himself coming from another universe. And only then can you truly enjoy the movie. It's the same with Panos Cosmatos. You cannot expect the vision to have a logical explanation. It's as if you expect Mucha's illustrations to make sense of all the flowers, windy hair and light clothes to look realistic. It wouldn't be as beautiful. Just sit and enjoy the show, nobody does it like these two do it.",Mandy

For a man with much promise and plenty opportunity and who has acted in nearly a 100 feature films one would think his acting portfolio would be chock-full of all time memorable greats. Now ""Moonstruck and ""Leaving Las Vegas"" withstanding due to aforementioned bias, I can only bring to mind a handful of truly remarkable performances from Mr. Cage. Performances where one leaves and says only he could have pulled that off, or that part was written for him, or I couldn't see anyone else playing so-and-so. He's done and continues to do a ton of cameo work where flashes of brilliance shine through and his steal-the-scene ability/presence cannot be ignored. Many of his special effect driven film roles require only that Mr. Cage does not sink the production. They do not rely solely on a ""lead"" to draw viewers and bolster box office returns. Hopefully, when all is said and the DVD released the film grosses more than its budget. Why is this relevant? Truth be told, following his premature meteoric rise with early film successes, I find it difficult to say his body of work has been has been all it should and could have been. With over a 100 feature films to his credit find me films that showcase his acting, films that are timeless, ""the greats"", e.g., ""Adaptation"", ""8MM"", ""Bringing out the Dead"", and ""Joe.""  The dearth of quality works doesn't garner ""actor of the year"" accolades, but with too few standout performances in a lackluster, yet enduring, career, it seems Cage's ship has sailed and now it's just a cash grab taking any piece of garbage script that comes across his assistant's desk to cover his debt, foreclosure, frivolous spending and poor investing.Until......now with ""MANDY!""I was wrong and happy to be so. I went on a whim removed from all external noise without an iota of what the film was about. I recant, I knew of two things: A) the genre(s) action/horror/suspense.

I couldn't have been further from the truth. Mr. Cage proved his worth in salt this time with ""Mandy."" Nicolas Cage's superbly haunting performance will become a benchmark to aspire to.

(spoilers ahead)
 'cage screaming in the bathroom scene' just seemed unrealistic and no where near genuine to me, the fact he didnt even bother to contact anyone - family - friends - THE POLICE about his wifes/gf murder just seemed ridiculous and certainly not realistic in the least (but oh was it a bold artistic choice to have him act the complete opposite to every other human on planet earth) even the fact that he FORGED his own artsy battle axe thing from iron and brawn ('oh what a man he is' Ron Burgendy 07) was completely ridiculous when he could have just got a perfectly usable machete from home depot for $15 and saved spending what would have been a whole freaking day forging a stupid barely useful sword thing when he could have been out revenging.. I would have been more satisfied if he just went around with a 9mm or a rifle shooting them all dead - at least if that happened it would be more REALISTIC instead of trying way too hard to be different and artistic- but hey if he didnt forge his own stupidly overboard sword and used a over the counter gun instead where would all the 'art' be?? Think of the children!!
This is seriously one of the WORST 'revenge' movies I have ever seen and also one of the worst slasher/thrillers I am really not sure why this got so much praise because nobody I have spoken to has liked this movie - possibly because on IMDB it is classified as a ' Action, Horror, Thriller' when I think it should simply labled 'drama'... Literally just drama because it was NOT horror and was not thrilling -- it was an artistic attempt at something DIFFERENT.. Maybe I have been opinionated by all the AAA big budget movies I have seen that actually have a coherent story and are not artistically driven, maybe I am too used to horror movies actually trying to be scary, thrillers actually trying to thrill and action movies having some action - maybe that has made me bias but then again there is likely a reason that so many people enjoy coherent movies with a believable (or at least somewhat believable) story arc and a reasonable budget where the movies doesnt literally have to solely rely on artistic elements to create positive feedback..The acting for the most part was great I would have given it a better review if it actually had a coherent somewhat realistic believable story but unfortunately this was not the case.",Mandy

408,parasolspetticoats,Bad trip!,10,29 August 2020,"I cannot wait to see what Panos Cosmatos does next. I saw Mandy first, then went back to Beyond the Black Rainbow, then back to Mandy again..and again. And again. I can't often objectively explain why you should appreciate a movie, nor do I care to. I just like what I like and that's what this review is about.I feel like minimalist storytelling turns people off, but sometimes less layers to peel back isn't a bad thing; especially when the story unfolds though a deliberate, meticulous, nightmarishly hallucinogenic lens. Panos creates a world, maybe earth, maybe not, where genres are blurred and Nick Cage wields a gigantic chainsaw. Hippie cults, Black Metal, motorcycle mutants and a cheddar goblin. It's even more bizarre and exploitative on paper.This movie, albeit violent and harrowing, is gorgeous! It hits every visual, sonic and emotional angle that keeps me thinking about a movie days after I first see it. It's the kind of movie I leave and immediately say, ""I can't wait to watch that again"", knowing full well I will pick up something new the next time around.Mandy rules.",Mandy

410,schmidtp-54221,2h 1min I'll Never Get Back,1,9 December 2018,"You know those movies - not much happens in the first 20 or so minutes. You want to switch it off but keep going because SOMETHING has to happen. Well it does - you fall asleep.
How this movie even has a rating above 2 is beyond me.
Driveling dialogue, a very bare story plot and basically you name an 80's horror movie and there was some screen shot or dialogue ripped off from it. The only thing that was generally amusing was the chainsaw fight.
I found myself flicking through 50% of the movie.
And this is a prime example of why you'd download a movie - and then just as quickly delete it. Actually skip it and don't even with bother. There's plenty of good 80's flicks, produced on a tiny budget that would bury this garbage.
Let's hope Mandy stays dead.",Mandy

I sat through 20 minutes of this waste of cellulose before I couldn't take it anymore. For twenty minutes, we are presented with multiple, quick (as in ten to twnety seconds each) scene changes with no context; very little dialog at all; no cohesive plot - really no plot at all, because there's no story!I read one glowing review that said that all of us who hated this just have no imagination or attention span. I propose instead that if you truly do find this movie a ten-star class act, perhaps you're smoking a little too much ""imagination.""This ""movie"" is only for the most diehard of Cage fans; ""hipsters"" who watch movies ""ironically""; people who enjoy looking down on normal people while pretending that they understand ""art"" that the rest of us ""just don't get""; people who are higher than kites; or those with insomnia, but only if you can't find a golf game on.

Also story wasnt anything new or special, just typical revenge story.
Really liked how this looked, sounded and felt.

Music and sounds were pushing this dark overall sinister feel and worked perfectly.
And also Nick have us great performance near insanity.",Mandy
420,scarredpariah,Nic Cage is back with a vengeance,8,29 March 2019,"A vengeance story painted lavishly with psychedelics and mysticism, leading to a descent into blood-drenched violence. After a slow introductory first act, the pace picks up effectively despite continued use of long, languishing shots throughout.
The simple, linear plot is buoyed up by a magnificent, grandiose soundtrack, with rich, saturated lighting and bold camera-work.More accessible than Beyond The Black Rainbow, there are nods to the rock music, horror and fantasy of the era within a well-crafted world filled with unique, evocative detail. The immersion into this world is marred slightly by an issue that plagues many modern films: much of the dialogue is quietly rasped or whispered, while there are sudden onslaughts of booming music, requiring the viewer to keep a hand hovering over the volume control. But this is forgivable considering the many qualities of the film, including an energetic performance by Cage reminiscent of some of his earlier work.",Mandy
421,oddjrgensen,aluminum fantasy axe...,6,1 January 2019,"Cage, never one to go for the toned down performance, turns the Cagey up to 11 here.
It starts off slow, Cage works at a logging company, where we are fortunate enough to not see how inept he i with a chainsaw for more than a couple of seconds. Then he and his colleagues are airlifted out of the woods with helicopter? Is this how loggers usually go home for the weekend?
Then we get a montage of how in love he is with Mandy, and that she suffers from some sort of mental trauma? She is very melancholic, waking at night and goes out in the woods to find a stillborn baby deer.
Then as she is out walking along the road home from work, she is spotted by a van full of weirdos.
The cult leader in the van sends his minions to get her, and it get's real weird from there on. A sacred horn is blown, biker xenobites on acid shows up, and Mandy is gone.
So, as one does, Cage casts a fantasy looking axe out of aluminum, then starts to hammer forge it, which makes no sense, unless they wanted to pretend it was steel, which would make the axe weigh some 30 pounds. He visits the magical black friend in a caravan in the woods for his trusted crossbow, and goes after the cult. It's all over the top Cage from there on out.
If you got nothing better to do, there are worse films to kill time with.",Mandy
422,bardavidi,what a great piece of retro 80's grind-arthouse,8,8 December 2018,"With very few hiccups, this is a solid, well-crafted piece of retro 80's grind-arthouse film that takes its vision and runs with it for 121 minutes; achieved by great cinematography and soundtrack and aided by spot-on casting choices: the obvious being Nic Cage's Red and the refreshingly haunting Andrea Riseborough's Mandy (seriously channeling Shelley Duvall's The Shining stare).",Mandy
423,jj_palencia,Perfection!,10,6 August 2019,"Great movie, great music,super animated and stays with you. Covers spychodelic drugs, violence,romance, love, poetry, revenge and space. Very catchy slasher based on year 1983 which is my both year and maybe I'm a little biased",Mandy

425,ommbomb,ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!,10,16 September 2018,"I don't need to say anything realy but... You will LOVE or HATE this trippy, vengeance fuelled gorefest. Watch it..then watch it again like I did. Cage is great in this, Riseborough is kinda creepy, the Children Of The New Dawn are mental...Jeremiah is insane. The satanic bikers on acid rocked.

430,DanMovii,Style over Story,5,25 December 2018,"The movie gets a 5 only because of Cage, the kills and it's style in parts. When watching I felt very lost as there was never a whole lot happening except random conversations leaving the last 35 minutes of this 2 hour movie to do the film's job which is deliver a action packed revenge tale something it handled well in the final 35. It's clear to see that the focus was on its style and not on the events transpiring. I feel it Cage wants to do more horror, which he should then it'd have to be with another filmmaker.",Mandy

It's somehow a film from a different era, while also being one of the most modern, avant garde pieces of Cinema ever made. It'll immediately become classic cult film that'll be studied in film school and have Halloween midnight screenings. It is the culmination of Nic Cage's career, from his days as an award winning actor, to action star, his descent in madness, and his current rise in independent Cinema.
 That being said, you'll probably hate it. 
 It begins as sloooow psychedelic introduction to the characters & a taste of what kind of movie you got yourself into. The casual movie watcher will walk during this, while movie buffs & film connoisseurs will love every second of it. Without warning, the movie turns into a bizarre nightmare. Its in the middle of the movie where it goes full on classic, blood, guts, chainsaw fights, grindhouse with Cage wielding the most badass axe ever. He spirals into revenge fueled madness, slaughtering through meth demons & cult members; all highlighted by the greatest macaroni & cheese commercial ever.",Mandy

The story follows a simple revenge ark in a way that has not been done until now, which I must say is very much enjoyable. It starts slow which felt like a drag but once the second act happens then it finally finds footing. The third act the pace skyrockets in comparison to its first hour leaving you with a great ending, equally as confusing. This movie is not for everyone, it wasn't really my type either, but I can appreciate the film for it's ambitious visuals and performances. It's an artsy movie with the perfect blend of violence featuring Nicolas Cage in a drugged up insanity",Mandy
438,lapelpinproductions_remo,beautiful grindhouse madness,10,9 October 2018,"I loved this film: it's a slow burn, a gory madcap descent into one man's personal hell and back again. It's a great ride. I believe 
the mainstream audience has a preconceived notion of what a good film should be, and that notion falls on a very small part of the entire film spectrum, and that's a shame. ""Mandy"" definitely does not fall within the mainstream acceptable levels of a ""good film"", thus the 1 stars. This is great filmmaking. I loved Hausu/House, Raw, Neon Demon, Antichrist... and this is right up the same alley. If you liked these films, watch ""Mandy"". And after watching this, I believe Panos Cosmatos would be perfect for a ""Hellraiser"" reboot. I cannot wait for his next project. Two thumbs up!",Mandy

I won't go on too much but there was a lot of drug taking involved and I felt I needed some to make any sense of this.

444,thedarkknight-23206,Style over Substance,4,20 March 2021,"The plot is just a simple revenge story. Girl gets killed, guy seeks revenge. The presentation on the other hand looks like a trippy music video from a 80s Rockband. The people and the sorroundings are dipped in a red/purple color and you often times are left wondering why. This color mish mash begins even in the beginning where it seems to have no signigicance other than to look mysterious and meaningfull. When in fact it isnt.
The antagonists are a bunch of religious freaks who seem to just drive around and kill people. The reason for it gets explained by a black dude in the middle of the film and its really so f dumb that it made me scratch my head .
And Nicholas Gages character is inconsistent as well. At the beginning hes a normal dude. Then he becomes a cool badas$ spitting out one liners. Then he goes back to normal again and is emotional and than serious again.The revenge part is the best part of the movie. The splatter effects are handmade and look decent. But its the way how the story progresses and how Nicholas Cage gets to the bad guys which is so nensensical that it can get quite boring and confusing to watch.
It all just feels so stitched together and feels like an attempt to be something very special, while it is all style over substance, which makes the movie boring and blend.And there are a lot of references to old classic horror movies like hellraiser and texas chainsaw massacre which are so obvious that its not cool anymore.But all in all its a watchable movie. But not as good as some people want to make you believe",Mandy

Crappiest dialog.I do not understand the hype, i really do not.What happened to Nic Cage, why is he doing these crap movies?All those 10/10 reviews must be paid reviews or idiot people.Worst movie I saw in 2018.

Dialogue is minimalistic using visuals to help push the narrative and create feelings of what the characters are going thru. P.S. I think all the tiger visuals represent Nic Cage himself.

Some cult drives by in a van. The cult leader decides he wants the hippie chick. One of his followers blows on a rock and summoners some demons that look like Hellraiser rejects on motorcycles no less to kidnap the hippie chick. Once she's with the cult they get her high, which seems totally redundant since every character this far appears to be high except for Nicolas Cage. All of this in the 1st 45 minutes!

First of all, visually I found it to be extremely beautiful and appealing, you could even call it gorgeous. All the actors are excellent and they fit their roles perfectly, I loved watching Nicolas Cage being in a movie like this ( the scene in the toilet is still stuck inside my head). The audio is really interesting.Some might find it sickening. I thought elevated the movie. The plot...the plot is for everyone to judge on their own. The premise is simple, but what goes on and how can everything be interpreted is easily a 5 hours discussion. The only thing that I have to notice is that the movie is essentially separated in two parts, which have little to no resemblance when it comes to tone, speed, violence etc. Some may find that weird, I thought that it was really interesting.
Overall I thought it was certainly a different and unique experience and I recommend watching it!",Mandy
452,geereesh-girish,This one gave me Migraine (I like Nic Cage),3,17 September 2018,"I have been a huge Nic Cage fan. Whenever some new movie of his pops up, I religiously go through the ordeal without bothering about the ratings and his movies are usually enjoyable, although are not to be taken much seriously. However, it was different about 'Mandy'. This movie was much hyped and was somewhat treated as a grand comeback for the once sought after star who has 1 Oscar win in his downward spiralling career.And given the hype or not, I was disappointed with this film. Lets tackle 1 thing at a time: Story.- Its a simple revenge story, nothing wrong with that isn't it? Or is it? We have 100 such movies made on somewhat similar lines..so nothing innovative with this. 
Music - This part literally gave me Migraine. End of story. 
Direction - Using Red colour, close shots of ageing actors for 5-7 minutes at a stretch for no reason doesn't make you a revolutionary Director.
Acting - Nic Cage shines in some parts of the movie. But think, he had much more scope in 'The Humanity Bureau', 'Mom and Dad', and 'The Runner'
More than anything, I found surprisingly highly rated reviews on IMDb for this film. It was a matter of concern to me. To those claiming this as innovative, it isn't. Revolutionary - No. All in all, It is time to realise that different is not always great and IMDb reviews are not always fair..",Mandy

455,michaelnicholasluciano,Unapologetically Unique,9,5 October 2018,"If you have an open mind then you will be entertained.This movie was the perfect blend of a simple storyline contrasted with an extreme aesthetic through visualization, music and precedent film tropes. The Sunn O))) and Johannson collaboration for the music was the best thing I've heard since the recent Mad Max film. The extreme visualizations and characters felt like an acid drenched dream drawing from movies like Evil Dead, Heavy Metal, Road Warrior and Holy Mountain with Cosmotos's own style infused. The transitions are flawless. The story never drags and there is tons of new techniques being explored throughout this 2 hour 10 minute piece of film that any film buff could enjoy. I thought it was an unapologetically unique film and had some real edge to it. Definitely go see it!",Mandy

However, it does not matter at all, because stylistically, visually and athmosphically, it is excellent. For once, Nick Cages overacting fits perfectly here and Johann Johannsson has delivered a worthy requiem with his soundtrack. It doesn't bother at all that the revenge plot couldn't be more easily knitted and, as I said, there are only few really creepy moments, although the violence and gore are over the top, but it is really hilarious how some of the scenes are served with a certain wink .... just as the film - I think - it doesn't take itself too seriously overall.",Mandy

Hence, why we see the 1.0 ratings. To deduce some negative reviews stem from fundamentalist Christianity is also not too much of a stretch......KKK identify as Christians. Hitler arguably identified as a Christian. The Jeremiah Sands character fits the mold of (Waco-massacre) David Koresh, who identified as a Christian and a new 'Messiah'. The movie does no disservice to Christianity and is rather a reminder of Dark Ages and the checkered past of religious faith.In a picture of this sort, visceral and brutal violence tells the story better than some PG-rating would allow, so I feel the movie is better off for it.Cage gets some well-earned justice and does it well in his signature OTT style, descending further to the inner circles of Hell... Linus Roach did an excellent job, I feel. I wish his character hadn't broke near the end - then reverted back to form... Rather I'd just have the ""kneel before me, mother*****"" etc. dialogue, then gets cracked.

Surreal cinematography and trippy powerful psychedelic music by Crimson King and Johann Johannsson help turn the dial up to eleven. Nicolas Cage was born to play the kill-them-all revenge bound Red Miller in this bloody arthouse thriller. 
 
The beginning of movie starts slowly, floating over the beautiful serene forests of the Norwest, where Red Miller (Cage) a logger, lives a quiet peaceful life until a weird demon like cult takes the love of his life, Mandy. With minimal dialog, the second half ramps up the energy as Cage goes from a laid-back logger to an enraged blood soak avenger, wielding a finely sharpened handmade axe and a powerful crossbow. Extreme gore, sex and drugs, cool 80's animation, chainsaw battles, demon Hellraiser-like cenobites on motorcycles, and trippy music makes this an unforgettable yet creepy film. With pupils dilated and a facial scar, Mandy, played by Andrea Riseborough, (Cruise's wife in Oblivion) brings a haunting angelic quality to the film. Linus Roche (Bruce Wayne's father in Batman Begins) is perfectly cast as the sex hungry psycho cult leader who wants Mandy at any cost.Lately, I thought the aging pudgy Nicolas Cage was mailing it in for the paycheck. But in Mandy, with minimum dialog, Cage carries the movie showcasing mad man facial emotions and screams of anger that make it all believable.The unique cinematography and music are as much a part of the movie as the actors. The late Icelandic composer, Johann Gunnar Johannsson, blends traditional orchestration with trippy contemporary electronics to powerfully drive this sci-fi horror. Psychedelic neon mood lighting and blurring red filters create a creepy strange look. Reportedly, half the audience previewing Mandy at a recent film festival walked out, but the other half who stayed were mesmerized and loved it.

I was looking forward to a semi-surreal horror movie with a revenge plot. BUT, the trailer to this movie is massively overselling it. The first half of this movie is complete nonsense, the actions aren't linked together and they do not really connect to the plot later on. It is just dribble to waste the viewers time in a very, very non entertaining way. For example will you watch some ugly dudes face for like two minutes straight as he nonverbally contemplates to use his flute / ocarina or not...
The revenge plot only unfolds very late in the movie. The conversations contain zero depth yet aren't entertaining in an actiony way (machete, punisher, die hard etc.). There are inconsistencies not to be explained with the ""drug"" component of the story-line (story is a bit of an overstatement here).

489,mickekarlsson1974,Mandy is not as clever as it thinks it is.,3,16 November 2018,"I really get why this movie has gotten so many great reviews, and why there are those who will defend it by putting down those who berate it.
""You don't get it!"", ""No wonder Transformers-movies are topping the box office"" etc...
Yes, Mandy is not for everyone, yes it is very ""artsy"" and visual..... But here's the thing:
I have seen enough slasher b-flicks in my life to recognize one from afar, and Mandy most certainly is just that! It ticks ALL the boxes!
It has a linear and ludicrously simple plot. It has cartoon villains. It has strange truck-sized plot holes. It has zero redeeming qualities.
Normally I don't have a problem with these things. None at all!
I've seen at least two dozen films on the same ""wronged spouse/friend/son/daughter/mother/father out for revenge"" - theme, but most of those are unashamedly only just that. Nothing more.
Mandy goes out of its way to cover it up! And, judging by the professional reviews it has gotten, strangely successfully so.
It utilizes everything from fuzzy imagery and over saturated colours to altered sound speed and full frontal nudity (and before you write me off as a prude, I'm Swedish ffs, we've had full frontal nudity on state television for decades!). Mandy even incorporates short cartoon segments and is set in the 80s - a fact that has NO impact on the story, but it is ever so trendy now isn't it!
These are some fabulous ways to mask the fact that the story itself is paper thin, and contains nothing more than a very simple revenge plot.
And to that I might add that it does very poorly in executing said revenge, that starts about an hour into the 1h 55min long story. Not because it doesn't know how - at least I don't think so, I mean how hard could it really be to make a few explicitly nasty and torturous death scenes? Almost anyone could manage that, right?
But in it's strive to win over critics, and try to outsmart joe public, Mandy simply decided to not give a damn about the death scenes, no matter how much you as an audience wants them. And believe me, after having seen the endless parade of depraved characters doing/saying the most nasty things imaginable, you are really longing for their death! And while you get it, it is style over form that is the ticket of the day here.
Because rather a deep red saturated slow motion image of a back lit Nic Cage in a basement grotto than a satisfactory kill scene up close and personal...right?Yes, I know what you're thinking; That's been done to death (no pun intended), at least this is new and fresh!
And sure, I get how it would seem that way.
But the 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre managed to invoke real feelings of panic and dread without masking what it really was (which is a b-movie schlock fest).
Mandy is a silly b-movie, nothing more. It just pretends to be something else, and it is not very good at it either.
If you don't believe me, and why should you, just watch the whole thing - from start to finish - and afterwards do a recap in your head of the one scene with Bill Duke, and tell me that just at that very moment, in that very scene, the makers of this movie DIDN'T forget to cover up the schlock fest, and just let it run right through, complete WITH some redundant exposition and some silly albeit kind of funny humor and all!",Mandy

It's hard to explain how bizarre this film is, you have to just watch it and experience the madness.It is a basic revenge story and the bad guys are a murderous hippy cult. So on the face of it - not too original... until you watch this total trip fest and see how the characters and story are presented.The visuals are awesome if you love that dark 70/80s vibe and I think that's what I enjoyed most. Plus the music and sound in general really suited the ethereal, not quite of this world feel. LSD is a theme throughout the movie and I feel this is reflected in the way the movie is presented - so if that was the aim I think it achieved it well.Some of the violence is pretty excessive so not for the faint hearted!I don't think this is everyone's cup of tea but it certainly wasn't forgettable or like anything else I have seen recently.

I must say I feel this is very harsh and unfair so I will try my best to give a more balanced review of the movie...So - What is it? Is it a horror movie? Is it a Thriller? Is it a Sci-Fi movie? An Action movie?... And that's just it... It's not any of these and there in lies the problem... you don't really have anything to compare it to and perhaps that's what the director - Panos Cosmatos is attempting to do as with his earlier work Beyond The Black Rainbow. (Which definitely is more Sci-Fi based) It's hard to say anything about giving the plot of the movie away, but what I will say is - It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, like a lot of the critics have suggested... but it's not the best movie I've seen either. However there is something about the movie that I found draws you into the storyline and you can't help but to continue watching to see what happens in the next scene. One thing I would say is the movie is very dark but again, it's not a horror. There are some great scenes in the movie, and dare I say it, that are very artsy, but they are great scenes. There is not a lot of dialogue in the movie, but everyone plays their part really well. There's not anyone in the film that feels like they don't fit.I think what also helps the movie is the score by Johan Johannsen. Again, it's different.... Alternative... and it's very good and again it fits with the movie.... and perhaps that's where I should class the movie. It's definitely...AlternativeAll in all I'd say if you're looking for something different definitely check this out. Just keep an open mind, but if you're looking for the best film you've ever scene you're not going to find that here... However for some people it will be... See what I mean.

Everything, from visual, characters, acting and sound design comes together to produce a compelling experience.Then the movie devolve into a cheap, explicit horror movie, with a subpar revenge plot and action scenes, effectively destroying most of the elements that were build in the first part of the movie.

The locations exist in two flavours only: surreal or mundane. Nothing is done to explain Nick's weapon of choice, there are weird bits of cartoon scattered all around the piece... the only thingthis vaguely reminds me of is the spirit that reigned in Metal Hurlant, only much darker in tone.

503,adrianf2001,The Ultimate Psychedelic Horror,7,9 March 2021,"Let's confirm what you may have heard about Mandy right away.
Yes, it's a weird movie and with that being said this movie is not for everyone. I find that those who possess a patient open mind for the love of movies, or those that are seeking a new mentally-destroying horror can truly enjoy what Mandy is putting on the table.
Mandy is an experimental psychedelic nightmare that seems out of sorts, with title cards appearing to separate scenes to vicious malevolent unique demon antagonists, to even the cinematography and edited contrast of colors to show scenes involving the character's usage of LSD.
Mandy's uniqueness really shines something wicked when main character Red Miller (Nicolas Cage) is in great grief when his wife Mandy Bloom is killed by a sadistic cult leader, Jeremiah Sand. Red's way of coping was to go after those that took the life of Mandy in a crazed act of vengeance that he imagined he wouldn't come back from.
After learning more about his enemies from his only friend Caruthers, Red Miller is informed of the sinister biker gang of demons that the cult deals with from time to time.
From then on we see Red Miller fight his way through the demon gang to get to the cult in order to exact his vengeance.
The nature of the demon bikers is as mysterious as how they come, I will assure you that it is not frustrating but more intriguing as you're hooked into their undisclosed existence.
They're aggressive and terrifying which makes it all the more awesome to watch Red Miller rip them to shreds after mistakenly using the powerful drug that the demons got from the cult.
At the end of the movie, Red Miller eliminates the most devoted cult members and executed Jeremiah Sand in the most memorable way in any horror death scene ever created.
As his reign of revenge comes to a end he is left with the empty feeling that Mandy will never come back, and as the viewer this scene was received smoothly and comprehensible.
This allows the viewer to sympathize with Red in a movie where sympathy is far from expected.
There are many positive and memorable things that linger in my mind months after watching Mandy, for such a unique film that it is it's surprising that there's never been much discussion on the horrifying elements Mandy displayed profoundly.
It has it's flaws and sins but compared to the many positives it presents, I'd say that those sins are outweighed.
Jeremiah Sand, a righteous man and narcissistic, psychopathic, egomaniac is a great antagonist and is very convincing as a cult leader written character. He is very interesting as he is ego driven and manipulative to his inner circle of followers.
The brief interaction between Sand and Mandy was powerful in dialogue and tensity when Mandy rejected him harshly in front of his fellow followers.
Overall, the use of dialogue between any character within the movie is greatly written and executed.
Now on to my reasoning for a 7.3/10 IMDb score rating;
This movie is known to drag.
Beginning is very slow and as I stated before, title cards appear on screen to separate the acts in the movie. It isn't until Red Miller starts hunting the demons that things begin to pick up in pace during the final act.
Although, pacing may have been too slow for my liking the soft banter between characters makes up the slow startup.
The use of exaggerated contrast and editing in the movie makes it appear as a fever dream which in my opinion takes ahold of the viewer's own mind.
These two elements right before the action are what makes the movie presentable, it's comparable to a blow pop. First, you have the taste of the sweet lollipop itself (Dialogue and Editing) and right before you finish you have the satisfying gum in the end (Action sequences).
Nicolas Cage's range of emotions make the movie all the more great and all the more human. There is a lot of unnaturals in Mandy, so much so that it could turn off people who are easily lost when watching movies or people who just aren't into heavy subject matter that's within the movie.
Overall experience, a great one and a film that will forever be brought up when someone asks me ""What's the weirdest movie you have seen?"" as I would like to give them the best one I could proudly standby.",Mandy

Take a look at the title itself, and you will realize that it's about someone that is having a surreal ""bad"" trip. And this is what the movie is all about. A drug trip in form of a movie.Stunning visuals music execution and vision from Panos.
I totally recommend this movie, but don't expect this to be a movie movie where the story is the focus. Instead expect a drug trip in visual form, in form or a movie by the protagonist. By Nicolas Cage.",Mandy

512,SimonHendursuhn,Done to death - why?,3,16 June 2019,"I have a hard time figuring out why this movie was made. Was it an excuse to show Panos Cosmatos's favourite collection of 1980's fonts? Was it to play with wacky filters and strobe lights on set? Was it to revive an already outdated revenge-flick in the hopes of scratching an itch of art-house snobs?If so, Mandy should be considered as a success - a great success even. If not, Mandy seems to use its filters and visuals as a way to mask an unfulfilling, unoriginal and drawn out plot that delivers as much in substance as rain in Sahara.It's use of neon visuals and mellow synth orchestra has been done to death, and Panos Cosmato is no closer to making it relevant again.

However, after reading couple of interviews of the director I gave it a second watch and I would say that the symbols and the journey/transition of the main characters is brilliant.

527,Disclaimered,"Beautifully colors, visceral gore, but loses steam throughout.",6,8 April 2019,"I had the pleasure of viewing Mandy with two friends and my wife, knowing nothing about the movie besides its trailer.The color scheme in all the scenes, while some can be a strain on the eyes; really offers am other worldly look.The slow burn buildup works very well in the first half as we're introduced to the characters and the plot. Then the proverbial s**t really hits the fan as we discover the cult and their intentions for the main character. It's at this point, I was hoping for a non stop brutal blood fest as the main character rampages through everyone that wronged him.Now, don't get me wrong, the violence is perfect for fans of these genres. But it kept playing out like--main character finds first of 10 people, kills them, and then we drag as he travels to find the next one. This brings the excitement felt in the scene down a ton. I do love the movie as a whole, but don't know if I could sit through multiple viewings.I recommend it for at least one viewing for you to decide, it's definitely not for everybody. But I will say the last shot of Nicolas Cage smiling it's one of the best and most hilarious things I have ever seen.",Mandy

The plot is driven by zero emotions and the jokes are placed forcefully throughout. There should be no mistaking the films strangeness for a dreamlike state. The filmmakers seemed to have chosen personal whimsy over a comprehensiveness, abstraction, or purpose. The film may have been intentionally bad, but it does not do this as cleverly as other films of its genre. If you love the colors, sounds, and technical side of cinema than this may be worth a ticket. Don't expect a classic.",Mandy

The music is perfection. (Some of you may not believe this) Nicholas Cage shows such powerful emotion. YOU'RE READY. The film PREPARES you for what you EXPECT will be a dreadful but FANTASTIC second half.The second half of this film is ugly.The plot vanishes. Only unsatisfying violence and unexpected perversion remains. Although still visually stunning, it's only a pretty picture. With unanswered questions and unsatisfactory resolutions haunting you after it ends, I feel entitled to tell you, the reader:See Mandy. Please. It deserves to be seen. Support the more artistic side of film, but know this is not entirely a film.Each half of this film should be scored individually. First Half: 10 (No Exaggeration)
Second Half: 5I would score this film 7.5 if it were possible. Lastly, I feel that it's important to state that I personally loved it. Not only for its extraordinary style, but its substance. I only regret to close by saying that I feel Panos Cosmatos tragically lost his way somewhere in the Second Act.

You know Nicholas Cage hasn't been the main star of any good movie in well... a while (at least to my knowledge) this movie is oddly beautiful to look at. All of the visuals and colors look right out of a Trippy music video. Its honestly like a metal rock opera in movie form. I think people have said that before but they're 100% right.

After Mandy's murder by the christian cult, when he is in the bathroom tempestuously freaking out, the wallpaper is yellow with an orange design printed on it. Jupiter is largely a yellow and brownish planet. The storm is orange and red set against the yellow of the planet must like the wallpaper colors. Red is wearing an orange shirt and is also set against the yellow of the wallpaper. This establishes him as being akin to the storm on Jupiter. Also, the characters name is 'Red' which the storm on Jupiter is in it's center.Later on in the film, the chemist calls him a Jovan Warrior from the eye of the storm which further confirms this theme. The planet Jupiter symbolizes authority. Perhaps Red is the warrior sent by this celestial authority to bring cosmic order to the world. One could argue this cosmic authority is set in counterpoint to the false christian authority Jeremiah Sand invokes.",Mandy

The Inventiveness & Acting in certain parts deserves Oscar attention. Cage in the bathroom for one, & the ""Goblin"" commercial, OMG Hilarious!Bill Dukes character gave the film a perspective that was absolutely brilliant & necessary.

If you liked BTBR you'll be in awe after watching this, because its diffenetely better.

However, I think it's a fun, campy, sometimes really pretty movie. The premise isn't crazy original but it's visuals, Nick cage, campy violence, and the vibe is what saves this from being dull. The beginning is a little slow but it eventually kicks off. It's like stranger things mixed with David Lynch. It's not a perfect movie, but it's a fun and cool watch, especially if you're bored. It's really 80's slasher campy, if that's you're kinda thing then totally give this one a shot",Mandy

I loved it, but I really wanted to hate it but I couldn't. It's exactly the type of movie I normally dislike and Cage has been a bit of a has been for a while now which doesn't help matters, but still, I loved it! I even read a bunch of the bad reviews and thought that based on those, I wouldn't like it, but nope, I still loved it!The music I actually loved for the most part (it's very loud and in your face, not subtle at all) , the colors and cinematography in general were just great, just beautiful, and great actors to boot. As most people pointed out the first 30 minutes are a bit bizarre and trippy but for some reason I loved it and didn't have a problem with it. Please keep in mind the whole movie is a bit bizarre and trippy for the most part. Nicolas did a great job as did Andrea and Linus Roche was just plain great in it! The supporting actors did a fine job as well Not really sure what else to say, I don't feel the need to break it down.If you're thinking about checking it out, give it a try, there's a 50/50 chance you'll actually like it.",Mandy

559,domdab99,Best movie of 2018,10,24 February 2021,"If an actor manages to upstage a blood-covered, screeching-in-existential agony, bent-on-revenge Nicolas Cage, that's a movie I'm going to like.Red and his wife Mandy live an idyllic life in the woods of some 1983 rural fantasy. Mandy draws intricate, Heavy Metal-esqe type art and reads fantasy fiction, works at the local country store, and waits for her man to come home from his logging job.But something deep and dark and nasty also resides in the woods... and it destroys Red and Mandy's life, forcing Red to go on a murderous rampage of revenge.Holy moly.Mandy is unlike any movie I've ever seen. It's a feverish, grindhouse, LCD trip, comic book, Herzog-like, insanity that will not be for everyone. Like Cosmatos' previous film, Beyond the Black Rainbow, Mandy has a 80s' vibe and sheen to it, from it's setting to it's monochromatic color pallet to it's rock opera synth score by the late Johann Johannson (his last film). But it is night and day from the former film. Black Rainbow is all sterile and interior while Mandy is outside in nature and Dark with a capital D. Both in theme and cinematography.The movie is like the Road Warrior by way of Polanski, with Ralph Bashki-style animation and lots and lots of smoke surrounding two warriors in a ****ing CHAINSAW battle, backlit by unnatural colored light and fire.There are three or four leather-clad demons that ride off-road quad runners and resemble the Cenobites from Clive Barker's ouvre.Mandy is a pastiche of 80's B-movies that we watched over and over on VHS, or late-night Cinemax - and it looks it, as it was shot on a Ari Alexa with Panavision AL series anamorphic lenses.Andrea Riseborough is an actress I've liked for years, and she always looks different in every damn movie she's in...great presence.Linus Roache plays the Jesus-on-acid leader of a small-time cult who takes a shine to Andrea Riseborough's Mandy. He and his band of followers kidnap her and leave Nicolas Cage's Red for dead.Roache has been in a lot of film and TV, and he always seems to stand out. I remember liking him a lot in The Chronicles of Riddick, but holy hell, I don't know what he was channeling here, but he makes Dennis Hopper as Frank Booth in Blue Velvet look positively quaint. When you're taking your eyes off a Cage to watch this other nutcase, you know you're going to have a good time.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but I don't recommend it for most people. This is a B-movie art film that will generate screams and laughter in equal measure. It's pretty damn violent, but it is also lyrical, painterly, and a sonic sledge hammer.A masterpiece.",Mandy

He has drenched this film in a color palate of red, purples, and blues. He's paired it with long, eerie sounds, and ripping metal music. He then compliments that with images of metal (barbed wire, chainsaws, nails) and wood (church) and fire.Finally, he's written 3 distinct characters that are so different from each other (Cage, Riseborough, and Roach) and just lets them do their thing. And boy do they deliver. All of three actors transform themselves into characters into so unlike themselves that it is a pure joy to watch.This film shines not just because it celebrates the elements of the horror genre, but because the imagery, sound, music, and acting were all very strong.",Mandy

First of all, this movie aint for everyone but there is entertainment to be had here if you can watch it for what it is...A totally unhinged, crazy LSD fuelled psychedelic 80's set revenge love story in which Nicolas Cage gives one of his best performances in years (Yes, he goes Full Cage) as Red Miller, a Lumberjack who lives a secluded life with his Love, Mandy Bloom and when a crazed cult leader accompanied by demonic bikers takes his love away he embakes on a quest of revenge whilst tripping out of his mind.
This film is one the craziest experpiences I have ever had in the cinema, visually stunning, trippy and very gory but with great acting performances from the leads and solid heartache from Cage, it makes it much more than what it's billed as.

I was excited by the fact that it was supposed to be some David Lynch meats modern horror meets Nicolas Cage come back and it was just none of the above. Furthermore, I was completely open-minded and didn't care if it met any of those expectations....my mind was completely open. This is just a terribly boring movie. And please believe me when I say that I have watched lots of camcorder handheld horror movies and got a lot more from them than I did this. I want this to be a blistering review because honestly it deserves nothing but this blistering review! I am a mother a 2 year old and right now and I don't get much time to watch horror movies all by myself (that's my favorite genre and my favorite movie is 28 Days Later) My husband was out and I was so excited to see this and trust me, I was just so so so so disappointed! I was freaking BUMMED that it was so bad. Do not watch it. I implore you to please save your time and money. I know I am not a famous critic but all my friend know me as a horror movie aficionado and I am telling you the truth. This SUCKED!!! I swear... I am not a Debbie Downer. Don't watch this.",Mandy
569,aftermoviediner,"THERE'S A CHAINSAW FIGHT AND A NIGHTBEAST REFERENCE, WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?",9,13 September 2018,"Mandy is the latest indie darling/art-house horror/Nic Cage film that is setting the internet ablaze and movie critics reaching for the hyperbolic adjectives. It's almost the perfect film for the current generation of movie goers: it's arty enough for the critics, hip enough for the nonchalant, above-everything crowd, gory and violent enough for the hardcore genre fans and it stars Nic Cage so even the ""oh my god he's just so crazy"", ""so-bad-it's-good"" meme makers are happy. Mandy tells the story of loving couple Red Miller and Mandy Bloom. Living in the Pacific north west in 1983, Red (Cage) works as a forestry worker while Mandy (Riseborough) is an artist and works in a local shop. Their idyllic, private and quiet life is soon torn asunder, in a vile and brutal way, by a drugged up, hippy, religious cult, accompanied by three insane bikers. Cage then goes all mental and revengy on them, having borrowed a cross bow from a random cameoing Bill Duke and forging his own, both futuristic and ancient, scythe/sword thing.From there it gets violent, bloody and darkly comic and features a recurring tiger motif, genre homages a plenty and a legitimately groovy chainsaw fight. So let's get into it then. I like Nicolas Cage as an actor. Not in an ironic way, not in an aloof way but just in a genuine way. Does he occasionally over act and does he ever give strange line readings? Yes - see almost any decent actor out there. Actors can become personalities, parodies of themselves and while that might improve their brand, it tarnishes their talent. Will you be a Christopher Walken and acknowledge it but just continue doing what you've always done or will you be a Jeff Goldblum and go full maximum Goldblum, letting it define you? Well I think Cage is sticking on he Walken side of that equation.He does too many movies and the roles are too diverse for you to ever pigeonhole the Cage method. Contrary to popular belief he is not an Eric Roberts, taking any single film idea offered to him. When you look through his filmography and actually watch a few of the films (as opposed to just ironically watching The Wicker Man remake stoned and laughing or sharing memes of his hair in Bangkok Dangerous) you'll find an actor in the enviable position of working in whatever genre likes, telling weird and wonderful stories and having tremendous fun into the bargain. He's not beholden to Hollywood narrow-mindedness or to fan pressure to just keep doing one type of thing. Not many people in the business can claim that. 
 
When it comes to Mandy, also consider these two bits of information:
Cage was offered the role of the manic, charismatic and egotistical preacher Jeremiah Sand (Linus Roache). This is the obvious Cage role, in a movie with barely any dialogue, Jeremiah has all the pontificating, grandstanding and mood-swinging we've seen Cage do previously. Cage instead pushed to get the role of Red Miller, a role that director Panos Cosmatos intended for a much younger actor. Now, Red Miller has his moments and there is definitely a drizzling of unhinged Cage in the film but the role is also defined by its silence and by its screams, not its dialogue or its mania. I have heard reviews single out a bathroom sequence, where he drinks vodka while in unimaginable pain, as Cage doing his ""thing"". I didn't find the sequence ""classic weird Cage"", I actually found it understandable, moving and disturbing. The film really hinges on us following his journey both emotionally and physically. Like a silent film, Mandy relies on its visuals and action to tell its, relatively, limited story and allows for audience interpretation and extrapolation. If Nic Cage's performance doesn't work, if you're not gripped by his plight and pushed forward by his determination for retribution then none of it really works.The second bit of information is that during an interview with filmmaker Kevin Smith, Nic Cage admitted not only to watching Panos Cosmatos' previous film Beyond the Black Rainbow but to watching Kevin Smith's ""walrus movie"" Tusk. No one mentions the ""walrus movie"" in an interview unless they've actually seen it. Smith was talking about Valley Girl, if Cage wanted to simply repay the compliment he'd say Chasing Amy, Clerks or something he might have watched at a film festival once. No, Cage dropped Tusk, that tells me a lot about Nicolas Cage.Andrea Riseborough as Mandy says only a few things in the movie and, spoilers (not-really), the plot involves her exiting the film early on. What we can ascertain, however, is that she is peaceful, detached, likes art, fantasy novels, 80s metal, sci-fi films (more on that later) and living out in the middle of nowhere. An unexplained scar on her face and her quiet removal from society indicates maybe some past trauma but that is never developed upon. More than anyone else in the film, her character's apparent passions and taste define the influences on the film. The strong, deep, vivid colour palette of the cinematography, the cinematic references, the metal album cover references, the designs of the bikers and even a few animated sequences all seem to flow from what we see of Mandy Bloom during act one of the film.The other cast member that definitely deserves a mention is Linus Roach as Jeremiah Sands. While no clear philosophy or message comes through his babbling preacher and variety of messed up followers - a hodge podge of crazies, true believers and lost and damaged souls - Sands is a frustrated musician, ego maniacal lunatic, mood swinging abuser and deluded psychopath. On the surface he's just an amalgam of any other clichéd cult leader but, as previously stated, Mandy is short on exposition but shows you just enough of any character that you can extrapolate most of what is trying to be portrayed. The true genius moment of his character is when he puts on his record, hoping that his drippy, psychedelic, pastiche folk stylings will impress Riseborough's Mandy. For those in the know about music and cult leader cliches it is a belly laugh moment.Panos Cosmatos definitely wrote and made this film for people who have seen films like this before but who, probably, haven't seen one presented like this before. In other words he trusts a savvy audience to fill in some of the blanks. I think the artistic sheen on the movie, and clearly very deft cinematic skill with which it's constructed may push some to believe the film is deep in someway but, don't be fooled, this film is an exploitation film pure and simple. Just because they skimped on character and plot explanations, shot it with a bunch of lights and filters, scored it with tension building rumbles and high, unnerving synth tones and left wide gaps for the audience to fill in doesn't mean there's some hidden message or explanation there. It just means Panos Cosmatos knows how to construct a good genre film. He knows that in most horror, action and/or exploitation films you point the audience at a bad guy, put the good guy through hell and with that justify the carnage filled journey of our anti-hero for the remaining 70 minutes.I'm sure there are reasons for some of the tiger imagery and some of the vaguries in the film but its driving force is exploitation, cool moments, grusome kills, mad weaponry, Argento style lighting, movie references all over the shop and hip t-shirts.An easy criticism would be to say it is style over substance and it is, it's glorious, arresting, eerie, difficult, dark, disturbing, mad, violent, deeply coloured and surreal style over substance.There was one scene, however, that sold the whole film to me and made me love it unequivocally - what are you talking about Jon? The chainsaw fight? are you talking about the chainsaw fight because that scene is off the chain! - No, I am not talking about the epic chainsaw battle, although that scene is, indeed, off the chain. I am talking about a sequence that'll probably mean very little to a lot of people but allow me to explain why the Nightbeast scene in Mandy is EVERYTHING.During the opening 15 minutes of the movie as we meet Mandy and Red, see their life together, there is a sequence where the two of them watch a sci-fi B Movie together. They eat TV dinners, at separate tables and do not take their eyes off the TV screen. A TV Screen which is showing Don Dohler's Nightbeast.Don Dohler is the Baltimore native filmmaker who made alien invasion movies, mad horror/action films, straight-to-video slashers and naughty vampire films in the quiet suburbs, at the end of a nondescript cul-de-sac, in Maryland.Unfortunately, in this age of snarky 'so-bad-it's-good' film fandom, some of Don's films have been either derisively enjoyed or simply dismissed by some people. This is a crushing shame because when you look passed their limited budgets and occasional amateur moments, you find a passionate, creative, inventive, weird, gonzo and original series of homemade masterpieces from a person who followed his dream. He should be an inspiration to the backyard John Carpenters and basement Hitchcocks of today - in fact in his home town of Baltimore he has been and indie filmmaking thrives there. This is why the scene in Mandy where Nic Cage and Andrea Riseborough sit so seriously and intently glued to Nightbeast is the best scene in the film. They don't laugh, they don't mock it, they are genuinely into it and this tells us b-movie fans all we need to know about their relationship. I am the first to admit that low budget filmmaking is not for everyone but when you find that person who will, un-cynically, watch a Don Dohler film (or similar) with you, then you have found true love and a soulmate. When I saw that scene, I understood the film. In lesser hands the couple would've watched The Room and laughed at it in an ugly, derisive way and I would've hated it....",Mandy

He's already amazing and I'm already obsessed with him, but this may very well be the pinnacle of his performances. The score by the late Jóhann Jóhansson is phenomenal and powerful and had me floating through the film like a drug. I can't express how much I loved this. Panos Cosmatos is a god.

583,lynnbarr-99398,The downslide of Cage's career,1,24 September 2018,"Firstly I would like to say ""What the heck I've just watched"". The movie is just a mishmash of weird cinematography and colors, with a bit of animation thrown in just to add to the confusion. The story has been done before, a man's wife is murdered by an evil cult leader and her husband seeks revenge. I'm really struggling to find the right words to review this movie I haven't seen a movie like this in a long time and I don't mean that in a good way. I really don't know what the director/producer was trying to achieve. Nicolas Cage has done some bad movies in the past year or so but this actually has to be his worst movie to date. his character Red Miller goes on a killing after the murder of his wife, he suddenly turns from an ordinary lumberjack to a killing machine even forging his own weapons. The chemistry between Cage/Miller and his wife Mandy Bloom played by Andrea Riseborough is zero, this woman was so wooden she would give Pinocchio a run for his money. It all turns into one big bloodfest, with Miller killing all involved in his wife's murder and even taking out the four motorbike demons, yes, we have demons as well. I wouldn't recommend this movie",Mandy

587,themoviemaniac-47685,What utter tripe!,1,2 January 2019,"I'll start off this review by saying that I am not one of those people that gives out 1 star reviews lightly. But this is by far the worst, most pretentious movie I have seen in a long time. Having read many of the positive reviews on here and seen this movie included on lists of the years' best horror/action films I was expecting great things. Instead what I got was a movie consisting of characters speaking really really slowly, lots of red lighting, and blurry imagery representing the characters tripping.The story is of a bunch of Manson wannabes that have taken a bad batch of LSD who think they are part of some kind of religious cult. Suffice to say they cross paths with Nick Cage's character setting up a revenge story line. The story sounds simple enough but the execution is torturously slow. There has been a lot of talk of the violence and action in the film but that doesn't happen until the last 30 minutes. So, you have the first one hour and 30 minutes of long drawn out scenes of characters talking really slowly and endless amounts of red lighting! Really, don't bother.",Mandy

596,Brian_McInnis,Likely the Best Goriest Film Ever Made,10,14 September 2018,"'Mandy' is amazing. Amazing. Amazing. In all honesty, I'm more impressed by it than I was by Paul Thomas Anderson's newest film, because it's so much more original, so experimental and so fearless in its utter, bizarre, grating unusualness. It's not even really fearlessness; Panos simply doesn't seem to hold any awareness of cinematic conventions or formulae. I'd never, ever have dared intertwine tragedy and comedy so closely as he does here.It's much less important, but I also felt like I was watching Cage's comeback in real time. He's magnificent, and a lengthy shot in a bathroom could easily be the best single shot of his career.Of course, the one convention the movie does hew to is the revenge genre, and I feel like the encounters in the second half get slightly repetitive, and some of the gore feels just slightly juvenile to me personally. Also the music never quite jumps out and astounds us the way the rest of the movie does. But those are pretty minor complaints. It's one of the most atmospheric movies I've ever seen, and watching it really does feel more like visiting a place than watching scenes unspool.Cosmatos is absolutely going to be one of the most fascinating film-makers to watch in our era (although, at this rate, it looks like we should probably expect a smaller oeuvre than most). Over and over and over again, I just couldn't believe what I was seeing and hearing had actually just been done.",Mandy

When action started I already hated the movie. if I had paid more than a dollar to see it I could have been arrested for citing a riot demanding my money back.

I was partially correct. This film borrows heavily from other films and that's fine. I felt that the visuals were pure; the soundtrack was decent; the writing was a bit empty; the villains... meh. I initially found the cult to be slightly intriguing but that slowly disintegrated as the film progressed. The leader I felt was a bit long winded and I wanted to learn more about the rest of them. I suppose I just like my antagonists to have depth. I'm not going to dissect this entire film. Not really worth my time. I will simply say that I felt strong David Lynch and Rob Zombie vibes.

604,tm-juli,I should have loved this movie!,8,12 December 2018,"I approached ""Mandy"" with an expectation that did not live up to the final movie. This usually does not matter to me, because I like weird sh*t and I am adaptable, if it is a different kind of weird sh*t as expected.
""Nicolas Cage butchering demons with chainsaw and self-forged axe in a visually fascinating flood of images."" That was burned into my brain after the trailer and so I prepared myself to exactly that, as I put ""Mandy"" into the Blu-ray player.
Now everyone who has seen the movie thinks I would hate the movie because of its first half. Since this is the opposite of everything from my ""expectation phrase"". But the first hour of the movie convinced me of a movie that is so different from the trailer and the second half. An interesting art-house movie about Mandy. She has an interest in everything extraterrestrial and lives with her husband, played by Nicolas Cage, in a secluded cabin. Her special aura attracts the attention of an egomaniac and cult leader.
The clashing ideologies are really fascinating. Andrea Riseborough gives Mandy so much fragility, personality and strength. Visually, the film is intoxicating, albeit with some annoying Speckling and lens flares. The story seems innovative.
But then comes the revenge film in between, which one expects from the trailers. Nicolas Cage, who did not experience any characterization in the first hour, goes for a bloody streak of revenge, which instead of interesting continuation of the thoughts on religion, determination, love and egoism offers blood and brutality.
Do not get me wrong, when Nic Cage lights his cigarette on a burning severed head, I'm the first one in line in front of the cinema. But here, after a long and slow hour of arthouse mania, I could not get involved in the blood-soaked revenge movie that was actually expected. At a certain point, all I wanted was for it to be over. After all, the principle of vendetta is always the same and thus predictable and not very exciting. The viewer has no relation to the Nic Cage's character, since the first half was focused only on Mandy. Thus, it is a visually stunning string of brutal fights and kills that should give me cinematic goose bumps in theory, but left me cold in practice. The animated acid-trips were a standout of course, but all good ideas were ultimately trapped in an unfocused Revengemovie.
Maybe I need a few more sessions, until I understand the deeper meaning of ""Mandy"", if it exists at all. After my first round, but I have to say that it couldn't really convince me and in the end even annoyed me. And that should not really happen with a weird revenge movie with Nic Cage equipped with a self-forged axe.",Mandy

Nicolas Cage is brilliant, closest performance to insanity I have seen for the last years. 
The bad guys are evil, crazy evil, seriously evil. The thing that works with this movie is that even though it may be insane and unrealistic, it stirs fear and anger and generally emotion from the viewer because simply it's point isn't that this is fantasy or real.

But there is no explaination of the characters. Why does she have the scar? If you didn't waste the first half of the film with slow motion, you could have had time for some background depth. Then the Nicolas Cage performance? This is his big comeback? He did not deliver something new, that we haven' t seen before from him. The highlight was the c-class movie star dick, that we can see. I liked the freakiness of the bikers. But thats it. I felt betrayed by the trailer. It suggested a totally great horror flik.",Mandy

Add a good cast of heavys and a cameo with Bill Duke and u have a pretty good movie. Trashy? Who cares. It is full of style and atmosphere to spare.

There is nothing special in the story, but in total with the hard music, sounds, and lights, cartoon dreams, violence, it makes The movie. The sound matches the movie well. I don't remember any other film like that. The only issue is the first hour of the movie. The film goes about 2 hours, but the main action begins after an hour. The first hour is all about speaking. Not many conversations but they are very slow and make some sence.

I had to force myself literally force myself to get past 20 minutes in this movie just because it's Nicolas Cage. I have to say I'm very disappointed in Nicolas Cage. He keeps making movies like this nobody's going to want to watch his movie. I don't know how on Earth this got so many high-rated votes unless it's from the crew and Friends. IF you can manage to get through the first hour then the rest gets better. Fast forward through the first 20 minutes very boring. The first hour is boring and dull the last hour is very good with lots of blood and gets an action. Too bad he couldn't have put a little more action in the first hour of the movie.

This movies symbolism is unreal, the imagination behind this movie is something truly amazing and I love it. There's not much dialogue and there's a lot of pink and grainy darkness in this movie. But that just adds to the energy that this movie possesses, it's an energy like no other. This movie is something truly unique and I highly recommend it, even tho I know this type of film is not for everyone.
Bad news: some parts can really run on, and I get what the director was going for with some of these long scenes, and it really lands with some of them, but others don't. The build up it's self kinda ran on, but that's all I have for the bad news this movie is great",Mandy

I am unsure whether it's poor writing, poor interpretation of the screenplay or just bad all over. 
A mess of a film with little direction. I get that the makers were trying to explore the whole other plain scenario but they fail miserably. 
I see HMV and other retailers selling the film in limited edition packs, don't be fooled this is just a ploy to force the film into some sort of mythical cult genre which it does not deserve. It is not a grindhouse film, the production is too good to make that claim.

Don't watch it if you can't think abstractly, it is not made for you!!! Movie gets seriously weird at some point so be ready, like 'Alejandro Jodorowsky weird' with all the imagery and mind blowing soundtrack.If you enjoy Frank Frazetta arts, David Lynch, Alejandro Jodorowsky, heavy metal (in a visual way), 80-s horror, comic book visuals, Nicholas Cage (who I respect so much after this) - you will enjoy this movie like no other.I advise you to watch it alone, with a good sound, dark room and a nice TV, it is a rare experience and deserves your maximum attention.Talking about Frank Frazetta, I think Panos Cosmatos would make a great Conan movie.

638,LassoGirl6205,Unpopular opinion: it's terrible,3,17 January 2021,"This had a decent basic storyline which could have made for a good revenge movie, but instead it was a long, drawn-out snorefest thanks to the numerous attempts at being ""artsy"". Now, I love movies like Natural Born Killers and anything made by Lynch or Kubrick, but this one seemed like it was trying too hard. And unfortunately, that takes precedence over the story.I was excited to see the film's first beautifully enhanced scenes, thinking that this was going to be a visually stunning movie. But the director seems to rely on using the same few effects throughout the film, so the impact is lost before long. He is especially fond of reddish filters, using them in nearly every scene. This became quite tiring after 45 minutes or so. About the only thing I really appreciated was the soundtrack.At least the first half was interesting enough to keep me watching it. The second half took a hard veer and I stopped paying attention to it after that.",Mandy

I wasn't surprised at all to see that it's the same filmmaker who did Beyond the Black Rainbow. Similarly, Mandy has a great score and has insanely fun lighting and editing.There's minimal dialogue, but I love me a revenge movie, so I was okay with just being along for the ride on this one. The gore and fight scenes are super fun and from start to finish the movie is entertaining.

The film it self is definitely a drab fever pitch of a hallucinatory dreamscape... Nicholas Cage is perfect in his role.. He doesn't go full Nicholas Cage unless it is brilliantly crafted to do as such... it IS truly is a hXc revenge film but equally as brilliant as Beyond the Black Rainbow (I know I just said that).. In many ways it is truly an existential acid / art house film combined with the last season of Twin Peaks and viscous elements of Hellraiser 2 at times. The color palette was beyond magnificent as I had expected... If this director only makes one film every 8 to 10 years we are lucky as an audience.. But, with all the critical praise he has received from Sundance .. just check the rotten tomato score.. I have a feeling he will start to get complete control over most projects he wishes to craft.. which is a true sign of an artist and not a Hollywood director ... Also this film would not have been possible without Elijah Wood and Maniac...",Mandy

647,to_the_ark,Occasionally drags to the point of torture.,6,30 August 2020,"Mandy is a psychedelic revenge flick.That's the entire film summed up.
A logger pursues a hippie cult that wronged him in order to kill them all.The visual style and cinematography are fantastic. This film has lots of iconic imagery and dialogue. The violence is horrific, graphic and disturbing. The acting across the board is mesmerizing. Nicolas Cage gives a wildly memorable performance in particular.I think the part I struggle with most is that there are a few very long sequences in this film that have very little to say. These scenes go on for such a long time that it stops the tension completely in its tracks to the point that you might consider checking a notification on your phone while you wait for it to end. It is more prevalent in the first half than the latter half. For the most part, the entire second half of this film rushes by at a frantic pace and I kind of wish the first half also did this.That aside, this film is well done. Get a group of friends if you want to see some pretty visceral reactions. There is stuff here that will satisfy even the most hardcore horror fans.",Mandy
648,deanhawkey,Panos Slayed it,10,15 September 2018,"As a fan of 80's pop culture, b-movies, heavy metal, Gore, artsy cinematography and Nick Cage. It is hard not to see some influence of things like Rocky Horror, Rob Zombie, Pink Floyd The Wall, Clockwork Orange, Lost Boys and all the other cult classics in this flick. Yet Panos pulled it off in a way that none of it felt plagiarized. His ideas and visions and production is all original with solid cult grounding. If you are a fan of this genre, you will love this movie and it will quickly land its way into your top 10. If you have a week stomach for that kind of thing you might as well start bashing the film now. The High contrast gritty HDR feel to the movie was a brilliant way to keep production costs down and really make the film flow. And Johan Johansson's last score is perfectly meshed as part of the mood of the movie. You will be lulled into a trippy state without the use of any narcotics and that state is exactly where Panos wants you.This is not for the faint at heart.

lastly, the directing reflects all what a generation bliss lived in the 80's, through the last drop of legal LSD coming from the 60's, and created in the 1938.

660,graphicsgod,An interesting descent into madness..,7,29 September 2018,"Where do I begin? I'm not going to say this movie is perfect, but it's nice to see Nick Cage being Nick Cage again! The film feels very 70's or early 80's. Both in tone and how it's filmed. Nice to see this classic style of film making in this day and age!! Now days, everything has to be clean with CGI smeared all over the screen. So this was a nice change!Anyway enough gushing over the style and look of it.. The film starts off with Nick (sorry I don't know any of the characters names, except Mandy), doing his job as a lumberjack and shortly coming home. Dialogue is minimal in this film. Thankfully all the cast can act and emote without having a lot of lines. Except Mandy, she comes off very bland, and to be honest, she looks horrible! Like as homely as the chick from The Shining! I get they were going old school film making, but they couldn't find a more attractive woman to play her?!?! Anyway, I'm going on a tangent.. So he goes home to her and a good chunck of the movie is with them hanging out enjoying each other's company. I've never seen a woman so quiet in a relationship before! In real life she would be talking Nick's ear off! Anyway so far the movie is kinda normal at this point. But one day Mandy walks to work. I guess she's a owner of a general store in the woods. They never explain this, but it's not important. And a cult leader (of a very small cult I guess), sees her and has to have her. And apparently whatever this guy wants he gets!At this point we're almost an hour in the movie where she is captured and murdered right in front of Nick (not spoiling anything since everyone has spoiled this part)! Also the title of the movie just comes out of nowhere! I actually laughed at that! I was like what, now, why?!? And then the movie starts to get good and the whole movie is like one big acid trip!! The closer we get to the end of the movie, the descent into madness is at it's climax, both in tone and visuals. Nick makes a giant metal axe and there's a chainsaw fight it's crazy!! But at the same time, there just enough there. It's as if the director was like, money is running out, let's hurry and get this over with.. Even though the action and gore is small and not enough, but what's there is still good!Would I recommend this movie? If you like weird trippy horror like movies that has a 70's grindhouse flare, and Nick being Nick at his best, then yes! Then this movie is for you!A 7 out of 10, decent descent into madness revenge thriller that's a nice change from the usual crap that gets released! If only that remake of Death wish, was as good as this! I hope to see more from this director!",Mandy

666,dem9508,Very enjoyable in a very strange way,8,3 May 2021,"I definitely wouldn't call this movie a horror (there's really only a couple parts that I think lend to that labeling) but it was a very different kind of movie that had very cool cinematography and an exciting, albeit a little campy, ending. It's the kind of camp that I think is good and can be appreciated and enjoyed. Probably better to watch if you've had a couple to drink already though ;)",Mandy
667,michael1123,Delta-wave Horror,8,21 September 2018,"It is essentially psychedelic dream-horror on a new level.

669,febedi,Weirdly piece of movie,3,5 October 2018,"One of the weirdest movie I have ever seen.

670,samdaviesp,2 hour long acid trip,7,22 March 2019,"Although not the Barry Manilow biopic that that the title suggests, Panos Cosmatos' Mandy is a definite contender for most surreal film of the decade. Nicolas Cage stars as Red Miller, whose peaceful existence is shattered when his girlfriend, Mandy (Andrea Riseborough), is violently murdered by a fanatic religious cult, sparking a blood-soaked path of revenge. What follows is a lesson in excess, featuring a BDSM demon biker gang, a chainsaw fight, and a deranged Cage lighting a cigarette from a burning severed head. Yet somehow, despite all the chaos, these psychotic elements come together in a genuinely beautiful, contemplative piece of cinema that could have been a complete disaster if left in the hands of lesser filmmakers.
Mandy is a brave piece of filmmaking (what other film doesn't present its opening title until 75 minutes in its runtime?), a film set in a version of 1983 that could easily be the distant future. Cosmatos takes his audience on a hyper-stylised acid trip through his Lynchian dream world, influenced by cheap fantasy novels and heavy metal music, eternally building until a tremendously violent climax. Sometimes it feels like there is just a bit too much emphasis on style over substance, and lingering shots of serene landscapes and hypnotic faces seems self-indulgent in a film with a two-hour runtime and about 20 minutes worth of plot, but the filmmakers are smart enough not to let you get bored. Benjamin Loeb's cinematography is absolutely breath-taking, seeming more like a painting than a film in certain moments. At around the hour mark, the arthouse sensibilities of the serene first half give way to a more grindhouse aesthetic, paying tribute to 80s exploitation classics. The sudden change in tone doesn't feel awkward or forced, however, the two halves work harmoniously together; if both were like the first the film would be boring and if both were like the second it would be ridiculous and exhausting, the chaos appearing as a reward for your patience.
Cosmatos demonstrates his skill as a director by seamlessly manipulating genres to his will. Mandy is a hybrid creature made up of elements of body horror, revenge thriller, animation (both 2-D and stop-motion), and even delving into the realms of advertising with a fake vintage-style trailer for macaroni cheese featuring a goblin throwing up pasta all over a child's head. The animation in particular is a refreshing break from the live-action when it finally appears; the 2-D animation is reminiscent of 80s thrash metal album artwork, in-keeping with the film's retro aesthetic, while the stop-motion effect is used for some particularly shocking face-melting effects after Cage samples some especially potent hallucinogenic.
Nicolas Cage's performances have often been derided by critics for being over the top or just straight-up silly. With Mandy, however, he proves that all he needed was to be unleashed in the right environment with a director just as unhinged as he is, with what might be his finest performance to date. Mandy allows Cage to deliver his full range, from a mellow and calm opening, to the best screaming scene by any actor since, well, Nicolas Cage in The Wicker Man, to completely deranged fury in the second half. Cage is absolutely in his element as he carves his way through the film's final act, and you can tell he's loving every second. In fact, there's not much not to love performance wise; Linus Roache turns in some of his finest work as the repulsive and sinister cult leader, Jeremiah Sand, and Andrea Riseborough is haunting as Mandy - wide-eyed and ghostly. Some 80s retro credibility is added by veteran actor Bill Duke who turns up for a convenient expositional sequence needed to advance the plot and explain some of the more baffling aspects of Cosmatos' mythology.
Mandy is a film that is certain to divide audiences, it doesn't really belong in either the arthouse or mainstream camps of cinema. Its overlong, contemplative style is sure to put off some viewers expecting a traditional, gritty revenge film. However, in a market currently oversaturated with remakes and extended universe franchise building, Mandy is certainly a breath of fresh air and a rewarding cinematic experience for those willing to give it the attention it deserves.",Mandy

For example, There is over a minute of a man opening and closing a screechy car electric window, whilst the other occupants stare out of the window. WHY?His wife reads extrct from a book? WHY?A man making Acid tabs releases a tiger from a cage that roars at the moon WHY?In fact as I write this, I think it must have been one of them games, where someone starts a story and then passes the story to someone else for 1 minute. This film is a collection of about 100 scenes writen by 100 different people, then cobbled together to form this Sixth Form Art Film in Red and Blue.Each to their own, and maybe I'm missing the point of this film?

I don't know if everyone would love it as much as my friends and I, but I still think you should watch it. If you love thrillers, action, horror, aesthetic films, Nicolas Cage, 80's movies, or are looking to get into any of those things, watch this! (It took place in the 1980's and is filmed similarly to movies from then although it was released 2018). Keep in mind when you start watching Mandy: you may not like the beginning at first but keep going! Watch the whole thing. It gets better and by the end you'll feel differently about the start.

The cinematography of the film is good not superb but not subpar and does its job of telling the narrative but does little else. The acting is mediocre and it times it feels like the actors are limited by the poor script. The film feels like a remastered mashup of 80' & 90's films, with a mix of artisitical styles that often leave the viewer confused about what's going on.

But then... magic. I laughed and squealed my way through the rest of the movie. I'm hard to please, cinematically speaking, and most films get a tepid response, but I'll be recommending this to everyone I know who doesn't have a large twig lodged anywhere. I buy maybe two or three DVDs a year, and this one I'm buying. This is not Camus.

The movie IS visually intriguing, however, it takes a solid hour and ten minutes to even get to the point, as the first half is dreadfully slow and pretty much sets up the ""plot"". When things begin to ""pick up"" it's rather quick and uneventful. The action/murder/revenge scenes are played out rather quickly and uninvenitve. The fabled chainsaw fight lasts a whole 20 seconds before it ends in a very disappointing fashion. With so much build up, the ending comes and goes quicker than you'd want.While gruesome for a few seconds on some of the villans deaths, it's not very satisfying for the climax of the film. Thankfully I didn't have to pay to watch it, or else I'd of been double disappointed. I've seen so many high praise reviews and for which I don't understand. The story wasn't really that great, the whole ""80s nostalgia/grindhouse"" thing isn't really part of the film, it's just lots of red lighting and rock riffs during the more flashy sequences. The film culminates to a weak ending.An hour in, the crazy psycho cult burns Mandy's body in front of Nicholas Cages character, which sets up his revenge fueled journey. He then grabs weapons and makes a pretty cool axe thing to use on the cult. He's kidnapped after attempting to kill one of them on their motorcycle. He then wakes up and tries to kill 2 cult members and succeeds, both of which weren't eventful. He stabs one in the throat and breaks the others neck.The chainsaw fight was so quick to pass, ending in one of the villains falling on the large chainsaw and it killing him, again, uneventful and disappointing.At the end he squeezes Linus Roache's head until his eyes pop out and blood goes everywhere.

737,coumns,"When a couple's idyllic woodland existence is targeted by a psychotic pseudo-christian cult and shattered into cosmic terror, Red (Cage) sets out on a bloody rampage",10,6 December 2020,"Panos Cosmatos creates love letters to cinema. His films are packed with references, flagrant horror conventions and meticulous pairings of sound and imagery to invoke a plethora of emotions, generally soaked in an 80's styled neon-nightmare of colour.If this style was wholly evident in his 2010 directorial debut Beyond The Black Rainbow then it applies doubly for his following film, 2018's phantasmagoric horror masterpiece Mandy. By the time of his sophomore effort, Mandy, Cosmatos had truly found his feet. After witnessing the trailer for Mandy I couldn't have been more sold. It seemed to scream: ""Yep, this is everything you've ever wanted from a film. Look, there's even a chainsaw fight!""Armed with a similar scale of plot to his first film (this time stemming from a marathon of Charles Bronson's Death Wish series) and a stellar cast including the likes of Andrea Risebrough and the legendary Nicholas Cage, Mandy gives the impression of coming from a fantasy horror fever dream of uncanny nostalgia.When a couple's idyllic woodland existence is targeted by a psychotic pseudo-christian cult and shattered into cosmic terror, Red (Cage) sets out on a bloody rampage of revenge and crushed skulls.The film's opening to King Crimson's 'Starless' and a sweeping, grain-soaked shot over endless pine forests should send chills through any hyper-fan of the VHS age. Like Beyond The Black Rainbow, Mandy takes its time to tell its tale, though its ideas feel more fleshed out, its every frame feels more meticulously planned and its inspirational roots are worn as badges of honour.Mandy is dense with references; from the demonic bikers The Black Skulls appearing a combination of the cenobites from Hellraiser and a Mad Max-esque road gang to Bill Duke himself appearing to give Red some advice and arm him for his savage quest. The film's ethos appears to be Heavy Metal (or love's vengeance, if you like) against religion, or narcissism under religion's guise, which may seem almost juvenile had it not been for the repeated self-aware references to rock and roll and heavy metal music throughout. (see: the film's opening quote).Music plays as big a part in Mandy as anything, boasting a rich and emotional score from Johan Johannson made all the more morbidly effective by his tragic passing not long after the film's release. The score is an eclectic mix of heavy retro synth, moving orchestral passages and devastating guitar distortion from drone band Sunn 0)))'s Stephen O Malley which seems to have been written alongside the film's creation to ensure their optimal convergence into a single cinematic force.To use such long, atmospheric takes to portray a story so devastating and emotionally charged requires acting talent. The entire cast of Mandy brings something new to the table, from Nicholas Cage's halfway-point switch from content affection to savage insanity to Linus Roache's seedy, delusional portrayal of Cult Leader Jeremiah Sands. It seems as though Cosmatos is content to roll the camera and just let the actors go with it, each scene feeling loosely organic alongside it's detailed visual planning. Personally I rate this as Nicholas Cage's best performance, and the one that solidified my place in the ""Cage: good or bad?"" argument. Though his balls-to-the wall approach is highly entertaining, it won't be for everyone.Mandy is very 'one man's vision' which does not necessarily equate to an accessible film. It's a bold statement, even in structure where the films titles don't even appear until around the halfway point, indicating that what you've just watched was a mere setup for the madness that is about to begin.Mandy is the story of a man who loses everything, allowing the darkness to fully envelop him into a world of brutally violent vengeance. It is a glorious leap from its predecessor and hopefully a preemptive look into a future of darkness from Panos Cosmatos' mind. Beware the Black Skulls and remember: A psychotic drowns where the mystic swims.",Mandy

And when Things Happen, Cage really comes into his own, and you might feel like you yourself have taken acid. Instead of goblins you have twisted acid-causality bikers-from-hell.

Nicolas Cage
Mandy is a beautifully, intensely, ferociously *human* film. Sitting in a darkened theater and diving into this hallucinatory experience, a strange kind of connective magic forms between director Panos Cosmatos, star Nicolas Cage, Cage's character Red, and the film viewer.In several interviews Cosmatos describes how creating Mandy and his previous film Beyond the Black Rainbow were ways for him to work through the feelings of rage and helplessness he experienced after losing his parents. The extreme arc of emotion that both Red and the film viewer experience is informed by Cosmatos grappling with his own difficult emotional journey.Rather than creating a more literal and grounded exploration of loss, Cosmatos instead crafts a bold and shocking mythical world populated by demon bikers, chainsaw wielding cultists, mind-melting drugs, and strange magical artifacts.Mandy follows a home invasion/revenge plot structure that we have seen many times before in films like Death Wish, Rolling Thunder, and others: a parable for the sacredness of the loved ones in your life and the importance of valuing them above all else. Cosmatos filters this familiar narrative through a psychotronic blend of dark fantasy, 80's horror, and 70's surrealism. The characters in the film exist as archetypes from an epic fantasy novel: Red evolves into an armored warrior hero wielding a mystic blade, self-appointed messiah Jeremiah Sands is the evil warlock king, the Black Skull bikers are monstrous orcs, the LSD manufacturer becomes a guiding oracle/wizard, and Mandy herself is elevated to a mysterious and powerful goddess. Cosmatos utilizes these mythic forms to tap into the same realm occupied by tales like The Minotaur, The Oddysey, and Beowulf: stories where heroes must leave the world of the familiar and venture into the terrifying, murky underworld of the unknown and face the monsters they find there.Mandy's bloody and bombastic midnight-movie aesthetic might make it appear to be a superficial love letter to cult movies of the past, but I argue that it is a masterclass in symbolism; an exploration of the pain of the subjective human experience in a powerful poetic fashion. Psychologist Dr. Jordan Peterson says of myth and fantasy, ""The Mythological landscape is the landscape of human experience. In this world, there is nothing more real than pain"". Cosmatos utilizes this symbolic realm of fantasy to explore his very real grief and fury.This is a movie about emotional intensity: the value of being intensely passionate and accessing the primal warrior instincts you have locked deep down in the dark, seething abyss of your psyche. Nicolas Cage describes his acting style as 'nouveau shamanism', a process in which he journeys inward into the recesses of his own mind, and utilizes what he finds there to embody a character. His goal is not to pretend to be something, but rather to access his most powerful emotions, memories, dreams, and experiences in order to genuinely feel something, and express it via a performance. In interviews Cage shares that he utilized his shamanic practice to access the powerful pain of his most recent divorce in order to bring the character of Red to life. It's fascinating to see how Cage evolves his character through the remarkable visual communication of his acting. He utilizes his face, voice, and body language to depict the transformation of Red *visually*. In many scenes Cage doesn't speak a single word: he reveals everything through his face with expressions both subtle and wildly erratic. Red evolves further and further away from the calm, gentle man he was at the beginning of the film. Cosmatos has his character undergo several stages of mutation through 'rites of passage' that plunge him deeper and deeper into madness and the realm of the fantastic. As the film opens Red and Mandy have achieved a sort of heaven together. Red sees Mandy as an angel, a sacred being: she is his divine and she brings him peace. Cosmatos communicates this through lush scenes of visual fluidity focusing on Mandy's haunting, beautiful gaze. Mandy exists as a powerful symbol of that which we hold sacred. She is the amalgamation of those we love: a symbolic wife, girlfriend, mother, sister, or dear friend. Those who, if they were to be lost, would plunge you into an unimaginable hell of despair. Red's transformation begins when he experiences this loss. He evolves into a primal beast of retribution; a dark force of nature whose sole objective is to right a wrong and restore balance in the universe. Captured by the psychotic cultists, Red undergoes a sadistic 'crown of thorns' treatment as his hands and face are bound tightly in barbed wire, and he is forced to watch his beloved immolated before his eyes. And so begins his descent.Following this is Cage's spell-binding melt-down in the bathroom. This scene functions as a kind of 'crossing the threshold' moment for the character where he takes his first voluntary step into the strange unknown. The bathroom set is designed to act as a visual manifestation of Red's mental state: the shocking orange patterns of the wallpaper and bright lighting make it seem like a perverse prison cell or microcosm of hell in which Red is trapped.Cage wails in anguish, desperately chugging a bottle of vodka, oscillating wildly through the spectrum of emotional torment. The vodka becomes a symbolic elixir; something that numbs his physical pain and transforms his despair to burning, skull-crushing rage.In the layer of the demon bikers, Cage endures another Christ-like act of suffering when his hand is nailed to the floor. He undergoes a horrific baptism when he slashes the throat of a giant orc biker and a waterfall of blood drenches his face. Cage's maniacal laughter as he gargles demon blood made the theater audience and I laugh out loud in crazed disbelief, reveling in the sheer insanity of it all. Mandy provides many such surprising moments, shocking and delighting even the most jaded film-junkies among us.After an impromptu snort of coke, Red dips his finger into a mysterious jar and mutates even further when his tongue touches the mind-warping ""skull juice"" LSD concoction. It liquefies his reality and rockets him to another primordial plane. This is followed up by another gleefully psychotic scene of Cage lighting a cigarette from the flaming, decapitated head of a demon biker. He takes a long drag off the cigarette and shows us visually through his wild, nerve-shredding, electric stare that he has somehow journeyed even further into madness. What is amazing about this series of wild scenes is that Cage manages to change his character's state of mind incrementally after each threshold of violence and depravity is crossed.Red becomes an avatar of our own rage against the injustices we've experienced in our life. Through him we fight back; eviscerating with savage fulfillment all the dark forces that have harmed us. His mystic blade, forged from grief, is a symbol of the act of psychologically fortifying ourselves, taking our pain, growing stronger from it, and facing that which we are afraid to face.It's often said that the appeal of horror and violence in films is that it allows the viewer to achieve a sort of emotional catharsis: a chance to vicariously act out and thus purge our darkest impulses. Mandy is one of the few films I've seen in theaters where I did in fact achieve this catharsis. As the end credits appeared, I found that my nervous system was shot--my brain cells blasted to another dimension. The blood red text rolled silently past and I sat back in my seat, staring up at the theater ceiling. I suddenly felt intensely relaxed, and just sat there enjoying the swirling haze of emotions I was experiencing in the moment. Mandy made me think about a lot of things related to the pain of the human experience, surviving tragedy, and honoring that which we hold sacred. The credits dedicate the film to the late composer Johann Johannsson, which creates another poignant layer of loss within the film. Johannsson's uniquely haunting and powerfully monstrous score breaths sonic life into Mandy exploring both the fragility and intensity of human life through sound.If you experience tragedy, it is easy to sink into nihilism. In your grief and pain it can seem like there is nothing good or worthwhile in the world...everything is just chaos and death. The film seems to say that we must have a powerful commitment to that which we value most in life: a ferocious commitment. Like the many heroic myths it draws upon, Mandy shows us the value of not shriveling away from the demonic, but instead tapping into the primal strength that we have within and battling fiercely for what is meaningful in life. As always, the viewer brings their pain with them to the theater. Through the alchemy of film we can experience our pain from a unique perspective, reflect on it, and perhaps find answers.",Mandy

But as a long time fan of his, I can finally say that he has performed to his most impressive and rewarding extent! Mandy provides not only a beautiful cinematic showcase for viewers (before the storm), but it proves that Nic Cage is more than capable of showing a gentle exterior. In this gorgeous revenge rendition of a tale we all have seen before, Panos Cosmatos shows us a story that no Nicolas Cage fan has ever seen work this perfectly before. The overall beauty of this film is gorgeously in line with the casting of; it calls for the most hallucinatory and whimsical directing decisions that I have seen thus far.

I found it to be true art pretending to be grindhouse trash but looks like it's just pure trash to some. If you're into a beautiful, slow, and psychedelic fueled visual journey, give it a shot. If cult movies are also your thing, probably a good choice for you.What I experienced was something magical- a hypnotic meditation into an unexpected horror. Through simple lighting and shooting techniques, Cosmatos manages to turn a pretty mundane setting- woods, a quarry, and a church into a completely alien and unsettling alternate planet. We explore the change from wedded, isolated bliss, to terror, to high octane revenge. There's also dashes of unhinged and bizarre humor too.. cheddar goblin anyone? I've never laughed so hard right after a chilling and upsetting build up from drug fueled cult and traumatic death scene. It's strange as hell and yet it all works. One of the most memorable and enjoyable things I've seen in awhile. I've watched it five times already and I'm sure they'll be more. It's got so much going on despite how slow & atmospheric it seems.

782,Pseudonymouse,Perfect Pastiche,10,2 November 2019,"The most embarrassing reviews here are the ones praising this film's originality. The directorial style, the colour palette, the soundtrack/score... none of it is unique. What it *is* is a superbly executed comedy that will appeal to those who (whether they liked the originals or not) recognise the tropes of the era.Just like the practical-joke peyote-flavoured toothpaste found in the guest bathroom, Mandy evokes screams of recognition from the moment the Play button is pressed. Whether those screams are of delight or terror is immaterial, the point is that it captures every aspect of early 1980s (should-have-been) straight-to-video B-movie terribleness perfectly.Either you're old enough to have seen the films it pastiches the first time around (or you got an education in the film/television of the early 1980s along the way) or you're not in a position to appreciate 'Mandy' for what it is. I absolutely hated the originals I was subjected to by various friends and family members at the time, which is probably why, traumatised as I am, I recognise Mandy all too well and, as a result, whilst I didn't laugh out loud so much as cringe all the way through, I can still concede its brilliance.If you're a fan of everything from Red Sonja to Hellraiser by way of Knightrider and Battlestar Galactica then Mandy is for you.

787,joelalastair,Hypnotically Entrancing Stylistic Overload,7,3 February 2020,"Mandy is an incredible balance of absolute insanity and unique visuals that requires over the top acting and bizarre imagery to fit in with the Grindhouse feel. The film, while possessing qualities that may appeal to fans of high level gore and action, is not suitable for people who dislike slow burning thrillers. The first act can be bogged down by the slow pace and little narrative development, however it is integral to understanding the two main characters personalities and drives in life. Nicolas Cage brings some of his best emotional diversity seen on screen to date, and portrays his character in a way that makes the audience feel deeply for his motivations. The soundtrack builds upon the colourful aesthetic with psychedelic heavy rock which encompasses the intensity of the scenes. While scenes centred around Andrea Riseborough towards the beginning chapters of the film are slow, they possess some of the most stunning cinematography and framing.",Mandy

After it finished I sat there thinking WTF and I had to go make a cup of tea and seriously think about some of my life decisions.Once that was done I came on imdb to find out more about the film and to frankly rant a little. After spending a good half hour reading a lot of very mixed reviews I decided to leave it and watch the film again another day. Which I just have.It's not my cup of tea. I think the majority of people will hate this film purely because it's not what they are used too, and they just don't get it. Yes ok sympathise with the haters the film is a very simple revenge plot, there's not much dialogue, it's filmed mostly in red and it can drag on in places and many will turn it off before it gets half way.... Which is a shame as this film left me with a similar 'wtf did I just watch' feeling that reminds me of the first time I watched 'Eraserhead.''Mandy' is very much an arthouse film with a dose of 80's grindhouse thrown in and if that's the kinda film you like you will love this film. Nic Cage is brilliant in it, and yes he has those rage moments, the violence is swift and brutal, there's even a chainsaw fight. It's surreal, the atmosphere and music blends perfectly with the madness and drug induced hysteria and anger the film is trying to portray in its own arthouse style and I genuinely think this will turn out to be a cult classic.So yep, not for everyone, but at least try and appreciate it for what it is. 8/10.",Mandy

The acting is amazing with Nic Cages deranged look while killing the gang members and on screen relationship with Andrea Riseborough seems really real and believableI think the reason this film lost near to 5 million USD is because the genre I think wouldn't appeal to many audiences with the sort of Sci Fi/Horror genresIn Conclusion, this is a good watch to anyone who's invested to gore, suspicion and paranoia",Mandy
792,adrianopa,Visuals on their own don't make a good movie,2,26 August 2020,"Anyone giving this movie a positive review will definitely mention its aesthetics, and granted this movie makes great visuals, aside from a ""Neil Breen""-esque scene of a tiger (yup, that happens in the movie). However, as I've already mentioned, visuals on their own don't make a good movie, and aside from visuals what you get from Mandy (2018) is a darker, ""arty-farty"" rip-off of the Death Wish series, starring Nicholas Cage.
On that note, Nicholas Cage is top billed, but for the first half of the movie he barely shows up, and for the entire movie he has 6 or 7 lines total. Look, I liked the scene of a bloodied Nick Cage screaming in a mix of sorrow and anger in the bathroom - scenes like that were made for him - but there's not much to say about his performance. He lazily appears a bit for the first half, he screams in the bathroom and then he does several poorly lit fight scenes, on which the poor illumination may be hiding a stunt double for Nick.
The villain is the best part of the movie - he's well constructed, you know him, his motivations, his personality and he has an arc (in the sense that he gets what's coming for him), but then he dies (spoilers) in a bad effects scenes which seem to be pulled from the movie Spookies.
As I said, Nick Cage barely appears in the first half, so what happens in the first half? Well, nothing! Up untill our villain sees Mandy, everything before that could have been completely removed from the movie. We get to know that Nick Cage is a lumberjack, we get to know that him and Mandy live together in the woods, we get to know that Mandy has a terrible childhood story about her father, we get to know Nick's and Mandy's favorite planets (because that's a thing)... None of that pays off by any means. There were several moments which I thought something would pay off, but no, nothing pays off. The scenes are perfectly disposable.
If you wanna a rip off of Death Wish, watch Blood Debts, Payback (with Mel Gibson), hell, go watch Death Wish, and you'll get a better movie experience, forget this ""arty-farty"" bulls**t.",Mandy

There were so many tones interpreted into the visuals and music which provided an eerie feeling that builds suspense in the first half of the film. Nicolas Cage has very few lines (think Mad Max), but makes up for it with his visual spiral into insanity, which compliments the story very well. Imagine a David Lynch film with a dash of Hellraiser and Kill Bill. The gore isn't overbearing and the ending felt complete.

821,thebakura,Tonal and Visual Ecstasy,9,19 July 2019,"It's a gothic Rock-and-roll drug-induced revenge nightmare and it leaves a crimson-violet, gem-encrusted hole in your heart that only otherworldly music and voiceless darkness can fill. You have to be open to something unlike a traditional movie because this is not a popcorn time sink. This is a caress of your senses that deserves a big screen, robust sound and a Blu-ray, do not waste the experience on anything less than HD.The story is fairly simple, a man devoted and submerged in a deep and cosmic romance runs afoul of all manner of evil in his seclusion, his lover transcends her earthly form into a force of will and vengeance and in her name he pursues the evil into the very heart of darkness.The acting ranges from campy and delightful to chilling. It's never careless but you will see a few questionable choices that make you wonder what tone this is going for. Don't worry, they do not ultimately detract from the whole experience, you will hopefully appreciate the absurd humour even if it doesn't necessarily fit, this does deserve a few scattered laughs and they are completely bonkers.This plays like a cheap fiction from a bookstore that hasn't been cracked open in 30 years, a cheesy title in shiny embossed letters. Perhaps the titular Mandy's love of those books is what makes this feel like one of those old paperback treasures come to life, but I'd like to think it captures the feel in the details. And oh my god, the title cards will hit you like a musty, yellowed paperback to the head.All in all its an experience and I can't believe I've watched it 4 times this year. At least. But every few months I feel it calling me back. I hope you have my reaction, my boyfriend is more straight-laced and prefers a more traditional action or horror movie, so he felt it was ultimately weird and cheesy. I sincerely hope you'll have the reaction I had because I am desperately looking for more of this.",Mandy

I think the 6.6 review is from people expecting to see another captain America film. This is not your classic action movie, nor your classic horror movie, nor your movie with tense action punctuated with brief moments of levity. It does however take the best moments of all these genres and spins it into something completely original and spellbinding. Let the ephemeral music and weird distorted camera effects take you under and transport you to world seemingly familiar like the woods in your backyard, but can twist it into a completely horrifying version of that familiar place. The scene where Mandy is under psychedelics plays out in a way never done on screen, brilliant and surprisingly accurate to what a real experience like this would feel like. Love this flick, it's my favorite one to crank up loud after midnight with a stout beverage in hand, do yourself a favor and take this ride with Nic Cage, he's a punchline a lot of the time unfortunately, but his talents are put on display here, with plenty of blood and insanity in tow",Mandy

Top ten most F'd up movies ever and in a class with Evil Dead 1 & 2, In the Mouth of Madness, Hellraiser, Event Horizon,etc. This is not a move for everyone but if you can handle a movie that marries the visual magic of movies like The Doors, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Fear and Loathing, with the creepy, chillingly-evil vibe of Clive Barker or H.P.

This was the worst movie night since a long time. I seriously felt ashamed in front of my friends because I chose the movie this time. I think that author took way too many acid and other drugs during making this piece of trash and probably tought that he was making some masterpiece. Many, many, many pointless scenes that takes literally couple of minutes to move forward. Without them, the whole movie would took around half an hour. Constant color and voice changes makes you feel ill, literally. People with epilepsy shouldn't watch that movie. I know Cage takes whatever he can these days, but boy oh boy...

I regret watching it. It had 1-2 actually good/fun/decent scenes. There are basically no redeeming qualities in this movie.

Yeah, we walked out of our first screening, drove straight to the box office and bought tickets for the next screening. There is nothing like being in an audience watching Mandy. This is THE midnight movie. I wouldn't hesitate to say it is on the level of Rocky Horror Picture Show as far as potential cult status. From 15 minute psychedelic trips filmed with a second lag and a pinkish filter, to two unspeakably amazing weapons, there is nothing on its level. Cosmatos' direction and the cinematography are better than 95% of studio movies nowadays. This is what watching movies is all about. And let's just say, every single cast member is pitch perfect, creating the infernal hell that the movie is. God willing, this movie will get the distribution it deserves so we can see it once a year at midnight in our favorite art house cinemas. Instantly nostalgic.",Mandy

Don't get me wrong, this isn't really a horror but more of a psychedelic trip that grips you due to the way that it is filmed and Mr Cage.The first 20 mins need to be stuck with, but once you have got past that there is no doubt that this movie excels.Watch it, love it and bask in it's greatness.",Mandy

I wanted to like this movie so much more than I did due to being a metalhead, horror fanatic, occasional fan of Nicholas Cage, and due to how well the trailers were put together, but there was no reason given to care for any of the characters and very little reason for most of the character's motives (outside of Cage's quest for vengeance). The relationship between Cage and his significant other was at best awkward and missing any real indications for warmth. Due to the lack of backstory & warmth between them, I half expected Mandy to be happy about where she wound up after the crew of Hellraiser wannabes showed up.Despite it's various issues, Mandy is still worth experiencing once for anyone who is fans of horror or Nicholas Cage and great things should be expected from the people involved in making such a beautiful looking horror movie.",Mandy

Putting red or purple spotlights in all scenes doesn't make the film ""artistic"" in any manner. 
Music even worse than in series B movies from the 80s. 
Willing to be an hommage to horror movies of the 70s and 80s, the film completely fails and is not even a parody. The only real agony we are given to see is not from Mandy burning nor the villains but the spectator spending this time watching the director's onanistic experience.",Mandy

A completely unique and beautifully executed piece of art.The first half of the film is the beautiful slow touching set-up. The film takes its time putting all of it's pieces together, connecting you with our main characters, introducing the evil cult, feeling the love the mains have for each other, and developing the dark underbelly of the universe. All the while with dream-like presentation filled with color, daunting beautiful music, and gorgeous cinematography. When the crime finally happens you are completely bonded to the characters and the world they live in. The film takes its time getting you completely invested, then gives you so much.The second half is almost a different movie. The color layovers disappear, the dreaminess disappears, and things become more like a nightmare. Nic Cage's revenge on these people is such a wonderful thing to witness. B-movie levels of ridiculous are gifted to the viewer for their patience.

He is obviously very influence (almost to the point of copying) Lynch and Cronenberg. Oh, and he has definitely seen Hellraiser. There is some 70's Agento with the color saturation, but (credit were its due) he made that his own. All that is missing is an editor. The 1st 40 minutes of this movie should have been cut to 15 or 15 minutes. Introduce the characters and move on. It wasn't very coherent so it can't be defended as atmosphere. It moves along fine until the revenge which starts off damn strong and then wanders around a bit. Cut the tiger scene. There was no point. Cut the ""Heavy Metal"" animation. It didn't add anything. He was just mixing too many elements. The ending was pretty solid. Panos could make a pretty decent movie if he learned to edit. He needs a new stick for his next movie too. He's done the color saturation fuzzy thing twice now. I guess you could get away with one more and call them a trilogy. Anymore is going to get stale.",Mandy
875,xxx-50074,"Wasted potential, style over substance",3,18 September 2018,"First half of the movie: 6.5/10
Second half - 2/10Okay, first things first - visually it's not bad, if you ignore the abuse of the color correction in some places, there's some interesting things about camera work and such, but all of it falls flat after the first hour of the movie, because everything else takes a nosedive into the pool of excrement.All the build-up and suspense in the first hour of the movie is completely gone in the second half, when the ""action"" comes in.When members of the cult are first introduced, you can feel that they are a threat. The first appearance of these cenobite-like bikers is good - you don't know anything about them, their identity is completely mystified and they feel like something inhumane, demonic.Guess what? Nope, they are just a bunch of drug-addicted douchebags, and they are killed by main character in a very lame manner in about 15 minutes of screentime.Same goes for all other cult members - turns out there's just small bunch of them, and, by some lucky coincidence, they are completely separated from each other, so they can be easily killed by Nicholas Cage in the most lazy and uninspiring ways.Have i told you that action scenes are bad? Oh boy, they are. There's two ways in which main character kills someone - it's either some quick cheap death made possible by pure luck and stupidity of the victim, or badly choreographed cringe-inducing attempt at making a fight scene.Here's some example: there's a very long camera shot of the guy polishing his car, there's nobody around and he's completely unaware. Suddenly, it cuts to a looped video of the rotating axe at pitch black background. Next shot just shows the guy silhouette falling with the axe in his head and that's it - it looks like something straight out of Troma movie.Given that story is non-existent, and it's only there to accompany the visuals, you at least expect the ""revenge"" part to be satisfying and over the top, especially if you watched the trailer. But unfortunately it turns out to be a boring slog, with an anticlimactic ending and feeling of dissatisfaction.",Mandy

He said they used this technique all through the whole film, this is how they gave the film that milky look to it, I think this was very inventive and gives the movie a very original look and feel to it, I could say alot more.On the acting side, Cage deserves an Oscar nod, I haven't seen acting like this from Cage in many many years, the bathroom dealing with loss, is a good example.The people giving this film 1 star/anything under 6 have No Vision, & are simply morons.

The plot is so unnecessarily slow and none of the characters are developed at all, it is just a bunch of random characters murdering each other with no obvious reason.
The movie is full of awful plot holes, from wounds that heal magically, ties that stay tied up during the anger and easily come off later.
The story is horrible as it doesn't have a clear reason behind it. There are so many unnecessary scenes that could be removed. This movie doesn't have enough content for a ten minutes short and they tried to fill it up with nonsense dialogues and characters that you don't even know where the hell they came from!

Honestly after watching I would have expected a score no higher than the 30's or 40's, the cinematography being the only high point. Plot was mediocre for a revenge flick, and the acting was painful. Andrea Risborough's talents are wasted on this mess. Completely cheesy and unbelievable. I'm sad that the cinematography was wasted on such a poor plot and Nicolas Cage. It reeks of film school and juvenile hedonism. A cobbled vision of revenge as seen through the eyes of someone who's never struggled in life.

A writer had this midnight scratches on papers which fits Cage's last miserable performances. A friend might ask me how do I feel about this movie and I would say IT'S A CLASSIC. It's a low bugget incoherent bloody like why is he not dead and what the hell is going on in that writers head from the beginning to the last after ending images.

Scenes drag on way too long, the acting is below Z grade, the splatter is nowhere near gory enough, and no cleverness in the deaths, just soooo stupid. The only redeeming feature was some pretty lighting, though it lacks relevance to the *cough* story. Candy colored irratatingly lame snoozefest disappointment.",Mandy

Avoid, save your time, you'll regret losing two long hours when you are on your deathbed and think ""I could have been doing something soooooooo much better than watching Mandy"". I know Nick Cage will these days just about doing any film offered but this is a new low. Pretentious, badly filmed, badly lit, bad sound, bad soundtrack, bad.

Don't put youlself thru it if you are just scratching your head or rolling your eyes and don't put others who loved it thru reading a 1/10 Star review.Mandy is not for everyone, and I don't think the film or director himself makes any bones about that! 2010's Beyond The Black Rainbow was, for me, a visually original piece of cinema that lacked a proper story line. It felt like a lot of beautiful images scattered around a lose idea and a love of 80s horror. Thankfully Mandy still retains those beautiful images, cinematography and lighting but has a core linear story line. It's a basic one, theme of revenge but it works! Cage seems to genuinely be present in this film, he looks at home as he moves from quiet protector to all out maniac with such ease. It's the Cage we mock but also secretly love and hope we'll get when we see he's involved.The look of the film is very much grounded in 80s horror but it feels so much more like a continuation than a tired throwback. Loved it",Mandy
908,bonedogg,Horrible,1,28 September 2018,"Does Nicolas Cage owe some people a lot of money to just take any job? I think he would've had more dignity working at a convenience store. This movie was crap from start to finish with no break in between. The only thing that saved this movie was the ending when the last credit rolled. I too try to find the good in any movie, but without a doubt the 1/10 star I gave was strictly a mercy star. Was hoping the movie would freeze on the on demand channel so I could on demand my money back. I can't even give a review of this movie because I'm not even sure what was going on with all the artsy-fartsy cinematography and failed attempted creepy music. If Nicolas Cage needs money this bad I would've started a go fund me link for him before letting him make this movie.

909,bengermensheil,Judge a movie by its genre,9,2 October 2018,"The people who gave this movie a 1/10 are the same people that would give a movie like Black Panther a 10/10. If all your looking for is just a regular slasher thriller movie to watch sometime over the weekend this is definitely NOT the movie for you. Panos Cosmatos has created a slow dark 80's psychedelic Grindhouse slasher purely designed around absolutely amazing visuals and soundtrack. The story is pretty basic and disjointed at points, Nic Cage says probably 5 words in the entire movie, and it's pretty slow. This is some strange artistic grindhouse movie like I've never seen. If that's not your thing that's fine, you don't have to like it but if you going to watch Titanic and give it a 1/10 because you don't like romance movies your not a critic your just ignorant. I saw this movie with two of my friends and we all loved. I think there's plenty of people who will appreciate this movie for what it was made to be. If you liked this movie watch Cosmatos' earlier film Beyond the Black Rainbow.",Mandy

913,mcketchupde,Different and experimental - The problem?,8,3 November 2018,"The visuals, the sound and the dialogue are harmonizing so good together that you can sink into this movie very good.... if you admit it. And thats the problem with this movie. Its very different from other movies and very experimental. But that isnt the problem.Over 30 per cent of the world are atheists, and in this very religious, mystical world they cant embed themselves into the movie. This is their personal feeling about that, so it is very hard to rate this movie in numbers in pure objectivity.You have to watch it to make your own opinion. But if you cant get into some mysterious or religios thematics then dont watch it.
I dont say this movie is an underated masterpiece, its is some fresh air in the actual mainstream cinema but the movie has some weaknesses. The script is good but at some points to long, the story couldnt be simpler and in the ending there are many cuts with very less explained.
But its till a good movie you can sink in because of the beautiful, but sadly last, score of johann johannson and the harmonisation of light and old look camera technique.",Mandy

921,jimoshea-66694,Cage Crushed It!!!!,9,15 October 2018,"Nicholas Cage, in my myopic view, is/was a product of Nepotism a winner in the gene game. For a man with much promise and plenty opportunity and who has acted in nearly a 100 feature films one would think his acting portfolio would be chock-full of all time memorable greats. Now ""Moonstruck and ""Leaving Las Vegas"" withstanding due to aforementioned bias, there are too few memorable performances and reams of forgettable. The performances where one leaves and says only Nick could have pulled that off, or that part was written and tailored made for him, or I couldn't see anyone else playing so-and-so. It's said given his talent and ability to transform and brings us, although few and far between these days, on a remarkable life altering film adventure. He's done and continues to do a ton of cameo work where flashes of brilliance shine through and his steal-the-scene ability/presence cannot be ignored. His many special effect driven roles require only that Mr. Cage does not sink the production.UNTIL NOW....His past CG films did not rely solely on a ""lead"" to draw moviegoers bolstering box office returns. Why is this relevant? Truth be told, following his premature meteoric rise with early film successes, I find it difficult to say his body of work could have and should of been so much more. 
With over a 100 feature films to his credit, only a handful have earned room in my Mt. Rushmore movie mind, e.g., ""Adaptation"", ""8MM"", ""Bringing out the Dead"", ""Joe."" ""Matchstick Men(a stretch perhaps)', Leaving Loss Vegas"" ""Rumble Fish"", ""City of Angels"" debatable but I'm a sucker for it. The dearth of quality works doesn't garner ""actor of the year"" accolades, but with too few standout performances in a lackluster, yet enduring, career, it seems Cage's ship has sailed and now it's just a cash grab taking any piece of garbage script that comes across his assistant's desk to cover his debt, foreclosure, frivolous spending and poor investing.UNTIL.....""MANDY!""If you are still reading, thanks for dealing with my verbose drivel :) I hope you will not be disappointed by what follows.I went in on a whim not knowing one iota except genre action/horror/suspense and that it had a decent Metacritic review score. I'm glad too, it made for an experience to remember! Unable to discern depth and detail or predict future scenes, format, future and finale, I found myself riveted, tirelessly searching for a flaw, a movie mistake making it far more easy for me to dismiss this film rather than dissect. I thought 10 minutes yawn, shut off and dismiss it as you do his last 20 films.Nicolas Cage's performance was superbly haunting head-scratching had me riveted to my seat tirelessly searching for flaw and mistake for it would be far easier to dismiss this film that dissects it and that would keep par with N Cage's poor choices in scripts for the last 20yrs save for ""Joe"" of course. I couldn't explain this performance or film away as just another money grab since he has had to foreclose on many properties due to unwise spending and investing. Anyway, hat's not here no there. I was just hoping to watch 10 minutes turn it off, yawn, and dismiss it as you would any of his other roles these past two decades.I was wrong!And happy to be so. I was pinned to my seat from opening credits (Indecently they don't roll till late), I tried to find a flaw. I would be so convenient to write this off and dismiss it as another cage film of no merit or value churned out in a week patchwork from past film crafted by a group to appease a group of their peers. trying to find flaw for it would be simpler to dismiss this flic. figure out the future scenes and unable to pigeonhole the format future, and finale cinematography I was unable to pull away or solve/figure out the formatting of today's many mundane media.

Even if you went in blindly, I think those who understood the type of film he intended to make were able to pick up pretty quickly what Mandy is all about, because he sets the tone in the opening scene.
Incredible acting, atmosphere, and script, to say nothing of the authentic what-a-forced-acid-trip-via-your-eyeball experience might feel like. Those who know certainly know.
From the subtle humor to the unique cinematography, it's a truly unique experience and without a doubt a rare gem. The only negative feelings I had after watching was wishing there were movies like it.",Mandy

925,jrmitchell-93021,QUICK REVIEW: Mandy (2018) Grade: B-,7,21 November 2018,"After my first viewing of ""Mandy"" it's easy to see why this is such a polarizing film for audiences. I personally found it to be a bit of mixed bag but, ultimately the good triumphs the bad here. My main applause has to go to Nic Cage's badass performance alongside, stunning camera work and effects. Not to mention the sheer originality of the film. Even if you didn't enjoy ""Mandy"" you have to admit, it's something new. Where ""Mandy"" most likely succeeds the most is, how unsettling it was on first viewing. ""Mandy"" successfuly weirded me out and, built up some suspense along the way. My big issues with the film are the pacing. ""Mandy"" should've been 30 minutes shorter because in the grand scheme of things, 2 hours is a lot for a revenge thriller. My suggestion would have been to cut out some of the meaningless cult mumbo jumbo. Additionally, the color scheme should've worked more often than it did. Maybe 1/3 of the time the colors wound up assaulting my eyes and left me with a headache. Overall, ""Mandy"" is a decent movie that could've been a fantastic one with some trimming and a change in the color palette.",Mandy
926,cthulhuplaysgaming,"An insane, arthouse, heavy metal, B movie drug trip in the best possible way.",10,13 February 2019,"This is a film that most people won't get. I say that not out of any sense of superiority- I completely understand not liking this movie. It is slow, and abrasive, and has vast jarring tonal shifts. It is filled with mono-colored psychedelia scored by a beautiful and incredibly ominous Johan Johansson score (featuring guitar parts by Sunn O)))'s Stephen O'Malley), and that is certainly not for everyone. This is a film that feels made for a very intensely specific audience; one who love David Lynch, Don Dohler, and death metal in equal measure. It is a beautiful and moving art piece, and yet, it pays constant homage to 70s and 80s B movie schlock and most of all, heavy metal. The performances are fantastic, though it can be strange initially with how quickly they shift from serious, to comedic, to something else wholly impossible to describe. The cinematography is beautiful, and nearly unmatched. You will likely never see another film that looks like this. You will see vast and barren alien landscapes, bizarre and visceral gore, melting faces, and reality-shattering animations. The pacing of the film, while it may seem strange and jarring to some, I felt was done perfectly. It takes a bit of getting used to, and Mandy is very, very much not for everyone, but if you think an arthouse heavy metal surrealist drug trip action revenge horror movie (and I can think of no other way to describe it) is exactly your thing, this might just be one of your new favorite films.",Mandy
927,yitongz,There's nothing psychedelic about it,1,18 September 2018,Every visual and sound used trying to make this movie Trippy is a failure. And it's clear that the director himself weren't really sure about what he want and therefore all actors were constantly showing that blank angry face throughout the movie. I never understand why people always say that cult film doesn't need a plot. Clearly this director believed it. I guess all the 10s are those who were so used to low budget gory films that a little bit of technology gives them orgasm,Mandy

932,drifterf4,Highly recommended for the grind-house aficionados,9,17 September 2018,"Mandy (2018) starring Nicholas Cage. 
 It is fun to think that Nick Cage lives in Vegas and driving angrily to dish out his revenge cold (he was actually witnessed at Lee's Liquor Store down the street) . 
 Mandy is a weird film. It is a simple revenge story done in multi-layered, visceral, hyper-aesthetic storytelling. It is destined to obtain a cult status in the years to come. 
 There seems to be plot holes and badly executed dialogues but immediately after the first-time viewing, I started questioning all the inconsistencies and disjoints within the film are in fact intentional macguffins in another cinematographic dimention as in Seijun Suzuki's neo noir films (or in David Lynch's Twin Peaks Season 3). 
 My most favorite elements of the films are the black riders/bikers, the uber-villains of the film. Their cenobite-esque armors and mythical presence, reminiscent of the Nazgûl the Ringwraiths assured that Mandy is in fact a Dark Fantasy film. Along with the use of King Crimson's song, ""Starless"", the blackmetal like chapter titles and unreal sceneries with old-fashioned matte-painting, it transposed 1980's Pacific Northwest to the Middle Earth of your worst nightmare. 
 Highly recommended for the grind-house aficionados.",Mandy

Want something visually stunning, without having to take drugs? Blueberry, by Jan Kounen.
Want something a bit more mind-challenging? Altered States, by Ken Russel
Want something a bit more fun and gore? Shrooms, by Paddy Breathnach, or Crank, by Mark Neveldine.
The point is: this film fails completely, as a thriller, horror, or crime movie. Even back in the 80's, there were already much better films around. The producers must have taken too much bad coke to believe in this project.
And speaking of drugs, since the 90's at least, there's MDMA and other empathogens: obviously, this crew missed out on that...Never at one moment during the film do you feel the slightest kind of empathy or sympathy whatsoever for any of the characters...So is it just supposed to be some kind of revenge movie? Even there, you'll find plenty of better movies than this one...

954,happypatch,HOLY MOTHER OF CHEDDAR GOBLIN!,10,30 September 2018,"(First, I've read reviews here for years, but never had an account. THIS MOVIE is the reason I finally created an account.)
OK, a quick look through the reviews shows about 95% of the ratings are either a 10 or a 1. So people either love it, or... THEY DON'T GET IT!!!
Not every film has to have a story involving a complicated plot. As Panos Cosmatos clearly shows us, a very simple story can engage us powerfully when it is told through amazing images and sounds.
If you enjoy seeing what a director can do to advance film as an art form, this film is for you.
If you appreciate creative and bold lighting, this film is for you.
If you want to be moved by the sound design alone, this film is for you.
If you want to see possibly the best depiction of an intimate romantic relationship between the two main characters in any movie, ever, this film is for you. With no exposition dialogue - in fact very little dialogue - and no sex scenes, just amazing images and performances by the two leads (Cage and Riseborough), within about 15 minutes we see and feel clearly that they are each other's world. It's the most powerful set-up for a revenge story that I think I've ever seen. 
There are lots of weird, trippy touches throughout the film that seem to throw off the people who give it a low rating. But I found every little detail added perfectly to the mood of each scene. There was so much information given to us through the use of the camera, the lighting and the sound; it was like a sensory roller-coaster. The way Cosmatos uses sound and music is breathtaking. And his choices for angles, shot compositions, and how he moves from one scene to the next are all inspired. There isn't a single element that doesn't display thought and creativity. Yet it often only hits you after you see it; while you're watching a scene, all you can think is, ""Oh my god...""
This is the most wonderful film I've seen in a long, long time. I wanted to watch it again IMMEDIATELY after it ended. And I want to preach to everybody I know that they must go see it at the theater. Unfortunately, I know that many of my friends and family are the kinds of people who would be weirded out and rate it as a 1. That's the sad reality.
But if you're the kind of person who is open to seeing something different in film, go see this! One day, you will be able to say, ""I actually saw that when it first came out. And back then, nobody was making films like that. Cosmatos was the first one to do this, and the first one to do that, and..."" 
Finally, I just wanna say about Nicolas Cage: the respect from me is back up to 100%, man. Nobody could have done that role except for him.",Mandy
955,the_spiral11,Acid-soaked Revenge Masterpiece,9,30 September 2018,"""Mandy"" is what would happen if you took a bad dose of LSD, snorted bath salts and (rather than running outside to eat a stranger's face) you stayed in and watched a regular Nicolas Cage action/revenge flick. If that sounds fun to you, 1) get help and 2) welcome to the greatest cinematic experience of your life.The plot of this movie is deceptively simple: an evil religious cult kills lumberjack Red's beloved wife Mandy, and he embarks on an epic revenge spree with some badass weapons including chainsaws, a hand-forged battle axe and his bare hands. The director twists this cliched plotline inside out and transforms it into something truly unique by setting it in an alternate universe where nothing looks familiar. The visuals are stunning and otherworldly, with the characters' appearances and surroundings constantly shifting and changing to reflect their inner lives - and the copious amount of drugs they snort, smoke, drink and inject via giant wasp (yes lol) - rather than objective reality. The film combines many different tones - dark, violent, gory, intense, tender, funny, romantic, religious - and balances them masterfully to bring something truly new and creative to the midnight movie action/horror genre. It's clear the director has a deep respect for this genre based on the little gems he throws in for its fans, including the infamous ""Cheddar Goblin"" puppet scene and 80s legend Bill Duke's clever cameo as a gruff, one-liner spouting exposition fairy. The fun never stops from beginning to end.My only (small) complaint is that the second half of the movie slightly loses steam after the gorgeous visual insanity of the first half, turning into a more straightforward series of fight/kill scenes leading up to a rather uninspired ""final boss"" confrontation. But otherwise, I can't recommend this movie highly enough for people who enjoy weird/experimental cinema, or just appreciate the spectacle of a blood-soaked Nic Cage sitting in a hideously wallpapered bathroom in his underwear, chugging vodka from the bottle and primally screaming.",Mandy
956,mrybalchenko,Love it,10,2 October 2018,"I'll just summarize everything and say that this is basically a heavy-metal saga with hints of lovecraftian horror and fresh new look at overly abused 80's aesthetic. Pretty much everything I adore and see value in. P.S. I feel really sorry for all those people that gave it 1/10 and wasted their time. Man, it really sucks when you wasted 2 hours of your precious time that you could've used to fight world's poverty and feed starving population of 3rd world countries. My prayers to you.",Mandy
957,michaelcushing-80518,Absolutely Awesome,9,9 October 2018,"I watched this movie about a week ago, and haven't been able to get it out of my head since. I'm not usually one that likes a Horror Movie that focuses too much on tone or mood. Most Horror Movies that include a lot of Art in it, I would absolutely roast. That was, until I saw Mandy.Mandy has very little actual dialogue to it. You're not going to get a big character study with this movie. Hell, you're not going to get any background information on the characters at all. You're only going to know and see as much as Panos Cosmatos wants you to know and see.The best way that I can describe this is that when Mandy and Red are just lying in bed talking to each other, in the opening scene, imagine taking a very heavy dose of LSD. Now if you've ever tripped before, you know that it doesn't hit you all at once. It slowly creeps up on you. Normal things start to look, sound, and feel just a little bit different, until the Drug completely had you in it's clutches. That's what happens here. You're going on a trip. Except you're going to wind up having one seriously messed up bad trip.The trip ends with the last shot of the movie. When you actually see, for the first time, what Panos Cosmatos doesn't want you to see. I still can't get that last image out of my head.",Mandy

961,gcardale,Easily one of the best films I've seen all year,8,22 October 2018,"As the 80s are more popular now than they were even in the 80s, it is no wonder we have a never ending supply of media based on the decade. After Stranger Things made us all want to move back in with our parents and have a nice glass of Crystal Pepsi, we were subsequently given dozens of films (and shows) romanticizing the decade. Up until this point I had not found anything that truly captivated me, that is of course until I found Mandy. Over the summer I must have watched the trailer two dozen times so I was of course pumped to see it. Thankfully I was not disappointed, the film creates a real atmosphere, of which many films nowadays fail to capture. From the beautiful score by the late Jóhann Jóhannsson, to the gorgeous visuals, director Panos Cosmatos truly delivers a spectacular glimpse into the decade we love to remember. Despite a fairly basic story involving revenge, cults, and Nic Cage, it is easy to loose yourself in this glorious movie. Without giving anything away, there is one scene towards the middle of the film with the title character and the main antagonist which was just spectacular and must be seen by any movie fan. I would be perfectly fine having the whole 80s rebirth to end here because ,honestly, I think I can't see anything topping Mandy any time soon.",Mandy
962,dwambolt,"Amazing, unique movie. Don't listen to 1 star reviews. Judge it for yourself!",10,1 January 2019,"It's telling that many of the 1 star reviews are very short, with the only criticism being ""it's stupid"" or ""I didn't like it"". For sure, not everyone has to like this film. But if you are going out of your way to condemn it, offer up more constructive criticism for *why* it didn't work for you. I suspect that the reason other people didn't explain their reasons for disliking it is because they haven't put any amount of critical thought into it. And hey, I can always recognize when I movie I dislike personally is well constructed and acted and serves the purpose it was trying to make, but didn't connect with me on a personal movie. I do not condemn those films, just because I subjectively didn't like it. I reserve criticism for films that fundamentally failed at what they were trying to achieve.And to be equally fair, I wouldn't give a 10/10 review to a movie I personally liked if it didn't warrant it. I should disclaim that I like pulpy grindhouse movies, but I won't pretend that one is revolutionary if it really isn't just because I happen to like it personally. I also like arthouse films, but I won't give a 10/10 if I think it has failed to say what it wants to say meaningfully or is overly pretentious.What makes Mandy so good is that it marries both of these aspects, and executes it wonderfully. If you're not into either genre, you will probably not like this. But the film successfully gives us the best of both worlds and captilizes on the strengths of both genres, while also elevating it with genuine pathos and poignancy. It succeeds in doing what it set out to do. While the movie relies on some old tropes (particularly horror and thriller ones), none of it is ever unwarranted or cliche, and only makes the film better. At the same time, it genuinely adds a new layer of thoughtfulness. You may think you've seen movies like this hundreds of times, but you really have not.The performances are really what makes this movie. The plot line is solid, if fairly simple. It doesn't lose itself by trying to be overly complex. The cinematography is gorgeous, but you can't rely on aesthetics alone. Nicolas Cage, in particular, is perfect for this role, and I can't imagine it working without him. People forget that Cage has always been a great actor. He thrives in roles where he is able to play a mentally unstable person and works under a director who understands his strengths. See: Leaving Las Vegas, for which he won an Academy Award, and Adaptation, which was also nominated for one. Also worth mentioning are Bad Lieutenant, The Weatherman, Bringing Out the Dead, Matchstick Men, and more. This is an incredible return to form for Cage after he has been churning out subpar movies for a paycheck. This is proof that he is still unparalleled in his specific talents when he is at his best, and Mandy is arguably his best performance in any movie ever. Much like the film itself, Cage's performance has the best of both worlds. It allows Cage to have his trademark freak outs that he has been known for lately. But it also shows that he can channel emotion so we'll, and he gives a harrowing performance of grief and trauma that will stay with you for months after seeing the movie. Maybe longer. At the time of me writing this, it's only been about 4 months since the film's release, and I've been thinking about it constantly. I feel like I may still be thinking about it for years to come.Cage is the highlight of the film, but it would be remiss to not mention the other main characters. (and while not as memorable, I can't think of a side character who gave a subpar performance. Bill Duke, in particular, was great).Despite being the titular character, Andrea Riseborough is not the star. And yet, there is a reason the film is called ""Mandy"", and not ""Red Miller"". It's hard to explain exactly what makes her so magical, and that is precisely what makes her so enthralling. In the trailer, when Linus Roache's character, Jeremiah, says ""you're a special one, Mandy"", you know he is speaking the truth. There is something almost ethereal about Riseborough's performance.Jeremiah Sand is mostly a straightforward character. Without spoiling much, though, he is different than what you would expect from your average villain. If Sand is to be mocked, reviled, despised, and portrayed as pathetic, that is all a deliberate part of Cosmatos' vision. Sand is not supposed to be sympathized with, respected, or complex. The film is not about him. It is about Mandy and Red. It is about love persevering in the presence of evil. But Roache is great in this role. As someone who knew him mostly as Thomas Wayne in Batman Begins, he was unrecognizable. He has managed to turn himself into a character you hate, but pity. His performance makes you believe that he is really like Jeremiah Sand in real life. But if you watch him in any interview, he is basically the polar opposite.Mandy may be too stylistic, too intense, too weird, or just not a right fit for some people. That is fine. But one could never say that it is unimaginitive, heartless, or unoriginal, or overdone. Panos Cosmato, with the help of his wonderful cast created a movie that is wholly unique and somehow a homage to movies you've seen hundreds of times, and yet unlike anything you've ever seen. I'd wholly recommend it to anyone. Even if it does not work for you, it is an experience unlike anything else.",Mandy

965,kellyfappas,Not for EVERYONE,1,6 November 2018,"Just to balance the scale...which I see is why sooooo many people complain about good movies having bad reviews but...that's the point a NORMAL PERSON should be aware with a low score that it will not appeal to the masses and this film is not even sitting on a line. Not even a teeter. This movie is ""slow"" but not a slow burner. As far as I could gather... it is a staring contest under the pretext of gore, horror, and a superficial plot. Visually interesting...but I lost the staring contest multiple times...fell into deep trance-like states where the plot came to life...in my dreams. I woke up rewound and sped up to x15 and still lost a number of times. It's pointless for pointless sakes. I don't get it. I'm not sure I get the person who gets it....then again I am not a fan of Mr. Cage other than in Adaptation but only as Donald. So if you like your movies to have a plotLINE, action, dialogue, and you want to watch something that is smart, makes you think, is creative and imaginative, or funny and entertaining....ANY and i mean any...base, cookie-cutter, movie is less of a waste of your energy than this thing. If you are the few NOT getting paid to watch and review this um...film, then don't. If you are the type of person that doesn't like watching movies....then I guess this is for you?",Mandy

968,zdmarabl,The Unexpected Rise of Mandy,10,2 December 2018,"Mandy is a drug fueled love story about Red, played by Nicholas Cage, who exacts his revenge on a blood thirsty cult out of his undying love. Nicholas Cage is able to reach new heights and channel his true strength through this animalistic portrayal of a man who has been scorn by evil. It's a 2-hour showcase of the incredibly talented director and screenwriter, Panos Cosmatos, and his extremely artistic vision and ability to blend together fantasy and reality into one cohesive story. It is an odd, bloody love story but it is refreshing to see a different type of film overall. The film is mind bending and overall a chaotic ride that captures the attention of the audience. The movie excels in its writing, colorful bled of surreal animation with live action, and the stellar cast of fleshed out characters that make the world feel real and dangerous.
Obviously, there are some viewers who don't see these qualities as positive attributes for the movie. For Instance, Geoffrey Macnab from The Independent says, ""For no particular reason, other than to add to the prevailing mood of extreme strangeness, writer-director Panos Cosmatos throws in some animation. The performances are as arch and crude as the dialogue"" (Macnab 1). Macnab acknowledges Cosmatos' artistic vison, however, he just sees it as jarring and holds back the movie as a whole. He saw the more lavish elements of the film to be over the top and out of place for the movie in general.
Furthermore, another complaint about the movie is that it can come off as convoluted or aimless. Andrew Lowry from Empire believes that, ""Once he's into his increasingly bloody spree, the film seems to forget about Mandy, and deep character work isn't exactly the order of the day..."" (Lowry 1). Lowry believes that after the movie picks up, it completely loses its spark and forgets what the point is. The movie shifts and changes its direction overall, but the point of Mandy very prevalent. However, Lowry sees the subtle undertones as a sign of reluctance and forgetfulness rather than the director taking artistic license with his film.
Although I can understand where this dispute is coming from, I do not agree with it. Even after the movie takes a major tonal shift about half way through, it does not put the overall movie in jeopardy. It enhances the experience for the viewers by helping the story and characters progress further. Chris Nashawaty, a writer from Entertainment, goes on to say, ""But Mandy is a movie where it would be impossible to go too big. It's a fully immersive experience that begs to be anchored by someone who's lit from within by blinding neon, but who also, amidst all of the nutty squalls of genre scuzz can still wear his broken heart on his sleeve"" (Nashawaty 1). Cage plays Red with powerful resilience and an underlining hatred for those who did him wrong.
The elements of the film, Mandy, can be seen as jarring or out place, but it can also be seen like a refreshing new take on movie genres. Mandy takes a love story and spins it out of control in this insane and colorful world where it is close but parallel to our own. The colorful animation used in the film helps to show the vivid imagination of the character and show the slow descent of his mental state and how his mind slowly starts to unravel throughout the film. It also is a clever way to show the surreal world we are in and show how it affects the people living in it in an interesting way. Cosmatos crafts interesting caricatures of people in this intense and insane landscape to tell an out of the box experience. His quirky writing helps to give the impression that things like this happen a lot in this world, which helps to flesh out the world overall and make the stakes feel real. You understand why the characters are basic stereotypes of real life and it makes sense because of the cartoonish elements in the narrative. The blend of breath taking animation and realistic characters enhance the viewers experience and to enthrall them into the story.
Mandy is a blood-soaked train ride that takes the audience into a surreal world filled with gore and fantasy fused into reality. While the movie isn't perfect, it is an artistic acid trip with Nicholas Cage taking the lead. The unconventional love story that is riveting and overall captivates the audience. I acknowledge that the movie may not be for everyone, which is probably why it had a limited theatrical release in a small number of theaters around the country; however, this most defiantly I a movie for those who aren't faint of heart. For that mall group of people who can truly appreciate the heart and soul and beautiful imagery that was injected into this horrific project. It is full of life and love, but most importantly, it is full of vision. That artistic and outlandish vision that so many movies now lack is what sets Mandy apart from others. Cosmatos takes charge and creates something that goes against film norms. He doesn't pander to the more wider audience, which is what makes this entertaining. Mandy isn't for big blockbuster lovers. Mandy is for those who love attention to detail slow burning chemistry, art, and the insane antics of Nicholas Cage. Without even trying, Cosmatos has created a movie that is equivalent to the original Evil Dead for our generation.",Mandy

As you watch ""Mandy"" you begin to become so tied to the main couple's relationship and can't help but feel unconditionally sympathetic for Nicolas Cage's character, especially after his amazingly well acted reaction to Mandy's fate as he's helpless to save the person that he cares about more than you or me will likely ever care about someone. The rest of the movie after Mandy's death is suspenseful, entertaining, and incredibly satisfying as you see this completely unlikely badass in Nicolas Cage get his revenge. I loved this movie, great modern Cage movie and a sign of a bright directing future for Panos Cosmatos.",Mandy
975,Soopsmart,A very unique movie experience,8,22 February 2019,"Mandy is a very unique film. It is visually stunning and very brutal as well, The score done by Jóhann Jóhannson was fantastic and is one of my favorite scores from 2018 and Nic Cage had a very insane and emotional performance in the film too. Although, this movie is VERY slow. Some scenes kind of dragged on for too long and I was drifting off at some parts as well. However, the movie picked up near the end and I enjoyed it. This movie is not for eveyone, since it is reminiscent of a Grindhouse film and has some pretty brutal scenes. This movie had a lot of potential but it leaned towards more style over substance. However, I would considered this a cult classic and one of the more unique films of 2018.",Mandy
