0,TheLittleSongbird,Wildly uneven film that starts off well but peters out too early,5,31 January 2017,"Not a terrible film by all means, but one where it is easy to see why it would polarise viewers (as evident in the user reviews here) and why there are those considering it a lesser Steven Spielberg film.'The Terminal' is not Spielberg's worst film, to me 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park', '1941' and 'War of the Worlds' (which had a very good first half and completely fell apart halfway through and never recovered) are worse. Ranking it in his filmography, it is nowhere near close to being one of his best and while not rock-bottom to me it is lesser Spielberg.Starting with 'The Terminal's' merits, the production values are top-notch and Spielberg regular Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is once again beautiful and a major plus. While not some of his best work, John Williams' score is pleasantly understated and slick without over-emphasising the mood.Of the performances, which mostly are good, Tom Hanks makes a valiant effort in the title role and does an excellent job on the most part and Stanley Tucci clearly enjoys himself as Dixon. Hanks and Tucci's chemistry is where 'The Terminal' is particularly strong. The supporting cast are good, and Kumar Pallana is quite a scene-stealer (though the wet floor stuff does get over-used and repetitive).'The Terminal' starts off well. The story is intriguing, there is a razor sharp satirical edge to some of the comedy and there is an affecting whimsy.However, 'The Terminal' is hurt by the second half being nowhere near as interesting and Spielberg himself (regardless of his technical mastery) playing it too safe with a subject matter that should have been executed in the film more sharply and harshly. There is too much emphasis on the airport-terminal-as-microcosm-of-society angle and it just doesn't work because of how tentatively and safely the subject is approached.Credibility rapidly decreases and gets increasingly strained and too often replaced by the sentimentality going into saccharine overload. Really could have done without the romantic subplot, that was not necessary, felt like thrown in padding and was completely underdeveloped and featured far too much. The lack of chemistry between Hanks and Catherine Zeta Jones doesn't help, nor does despite her beauty Zeta Jones being so bland in a role that gives her practically nothing to do. The characters are also far too neatly black and white with stereotypes that won't bode, and actually hasn't boded, well with some.Overall, wildly uneven that had potential to be good but doesn't ever fully convince. 5/10 Bethany Cox",The Terminal
1,Leofwine_draca,Light and frothy,5,17 July 2018,"THE TERMINAL is an example of Steven Spielberg at his most average as a filmmaker. This is a massive-budgeted production that features Tom Hanks delivering a typically pitch perfect performance as a likeable immigrant stuck at an airport, of all places, and yet compared to Spielberg's best work this is insignificant and ultimately hollow. There are a lot of light laughs en route to the climax, and some well judged supporting roles, but THE TERMINAL also has some serious flaws. A wooden Catherine Zeta-Jones as the shoehorned-in love interest is one of them, and Stanley Tucci's antagonist couldn't get any more bland if he tried. My advice is to watch this if you're a Hanks fan, but otherwise skip it.",The Terminal
2,SnoopyStyle,mix of serious and light comedy,6,29 November 2014,Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) from Krakozhia arrives in JFK. He speaks limited English and has limited understanding. Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) tells him that his country has just had a coup and the US has revoked his visa. Viktor is a stateless man with no status. Dixon can't allow him to enter the country but he can't detain him either. Dixon allows him to move freely in the international transit lounge. However the temporary situation turns into a long running saga. Dixon is getting promoted. He tries to get Viktor to leave on his own. Viktor befriends various people. He meets flight attendant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and pretends to be a frequent traveler. This is an uncomfortable mix of serious and light-hearted. The whole thing just strikes me as being fake. It starts with the fake country. Then there is Tom Hanks faking an accent. His English is conveniently bad when the movie needs it to be but good enough whenever the movie wants. Also there is the fake setup. There may be a heart-warming funny indie film here somewhere but it needs an unknown to play this role. The story has some serious stuff but the light comedy really whitewashes it. Director Steven Spielberg is probably not the right guy for this film and Hanks is too recognizable. I don't want to be a Scrooge and hate on this light comedy. Most of it doesn't work for me. Spielberg is such a master filmmaker that he squeezes some heart-wrenching moments as well as some light comedy out of it.,The Terminal
3,Hitchcoc,A Charming Movie,8,9 January 2017,"This is a movie about little people who do their jobs every day. Tom Hanks plays a man who is caught at an airport because his country is experiencing a coup. What that means is that for the moment he has no country. He has no visa to get into the United States but depending on what ultimately happens in his country will determine if he can go back there. He begins to try to survive at the airport by figuring out how to find food and maintaining himself. Of course, there are bad guys who want him to accidentally set foot on American soil so they can arrest him. The airport officials are also harassing him. He meets Catherine Zeta Jones who is having a bad time and the two of them have a sort of relationship. We get to know all the airport employees who befriend the man. This is one of those movies that anyone would enjoy. Hanks is delightful as the main character. There is also a really touching subplot that keeps our interest.",The Terminal
4,Prismark10,No duty free,5,21 December 2016,"The Terminal is a small scale film from Steven Spielberg. It is inspired by a true event but is really a fictionalised account.Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a traveller from Krakozhia who arrives at New York's JFK Airport only to find that his passport is cancelled due to a civil war in his homeland. He is left stateless and living at the airport terminal lounge because he cannot leave the airport and enter New York or be sent back home.Vicktor needs to find a way to survive at the terminal lounge, find a way to earn money for food for example, even learn English and pass the time day by day. Frustrating him is Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) the security chief at the terminal who just wants him to leave so he can be someone else's problem. As time goes by Viktor learns English, gets a job, earns money, makes friends with the staff even finds romance with a stewardess (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and confounds Dixon which makes him more angrier.Spielberg has made a Kafkaesque fantasy comedy and is helped by a likable performance by Hanks. They just about get away with this absurd premise helped by supporting characters such as Diego Luna, Kumar Pallana and Zoe Saldana (playing a Star Trek fan before she ended up with a major role in the Star Trek films.)If this had happened in real life, Vicktor would had been sent an immigration lawyer and an interpreter and would had got temporary admission to the United States.However Spielberg does lapse into schmaltz frequently in this film and Dixon is a weak token villain of the piece.",The Terminal
5,claudio_carvalho,Delightful Fable About a Patient Man Who Is Trapped by the Bureaucracy in the International Lounge of JFK,8,25 April 2005,"Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) has just arrived from Krakozhia in JFK Airport, when there is a coup in his small eastern country, with the revolutionary forces taking the government by force. The USA does not recognize the new government and the validity of his VISA and passport are canceled. Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), the bureaucratic administrator of the airport, who rules by the book and does not show any compassion for people, leaves Viktor, who does not speak English, in the international lounge of the airport with a problem without solution. While patiently living in Gate 67 for a long period, Viktor survives, learns English by himself, makes new friends among the employees of the airport and falls in love for Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones). ""The Terminal"" is a delightful and uncommon fable about a patient man who is trapped by the bureaucracy in the international lounge of JFK. I heard that an equivalent event would have happened indeed in Paris, but there is no reference on the DVD, and the writer takes the credits for the idea of this theme. Anyway, Steven Spielberg is really magic, and was able to make a delightful movie with such a weird storyline. Tom Hanks is excellent as usual and the beauty of Catherine Zeta-Jones is still very impressive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Terminal"" (""The Terminal"")",The Terminal
6,gavin6942,Terminally Ill: Put This Film Out of Its Misery,3,5 March 2006,"This film was a roller coaster ride for me. Initially, I was told be practically everyone this film stunk. One person said it was ""artistic"" (and I now disagree). The film started off slow and tedious, focusing on the main character's language barrier. By halfway, I admit I was in love with this film. I was eager to see what would happen next -- the ways the character gets food and money are very interesting. But the honeymoon was short and by the end, I wished this film a spot in eternal damnation.The story, if you don't know, is of a man who uses his citizenship in midair because his country plunges into civil war. Not being able to go home, and not able to enter America on a now-bogus passport, he ends up trapped and living in the JFK Airport.The film stars Tom Hanks (who is given way more credit than he deserves) and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Also, there is an Oompah Loompah that juggles and spins plates. Sadly, this guy is the most interesting character in the film.My minor beef is the ""product placement"" that runs rampant in this film. Burger King, Borders, and a dozen other stores must have poured millions of dollars into this movie. My major beef is the ""far-fetched"" complaint. At first, it starts out believable. But soon, the airport security chief becomes a monster and a caricature of evil. Hanks builds things -- walls and fountains -- in the airport without security caring, and rips chairs out of the ground. He befriends people and exchanges favors, falls in love with a gorgeous flight attendant (who annoyingly brings up obscure Napoleon facts for no reason at all the wrong times) and in some scenes has what looks like a thousand employees working as his entourage. I don't happen to believe this.A point for Steven Spielberg. While he usually pumps out mediocre crap, this film is different. It's still mediocre crap. But it's mediocre crap that doesn't rely on aliens, Jews or little boys to sell the story. Thanks Steven, I appreciate the fact Tom Hanks didn't have to fight off aliens in the terminal to save a Jewish boy. (Although in fairness all directors have their themes.) Is this film recommended? Of course not. If you like Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, that's your first mistake. Don't make renting this movie your second mistake.",The Terminal
7,lee_eisenberg,you won't want it to terminate,7,8 May 2006,"I was surprised when I learned that ""The Terminal"" was based on a true story, but the movie did a pretty neat job with it (well duh, it involves Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks). The plot of course has Viktor Navorski (Hanks) coming to the US from the fictional Eastern European country of Krakozhia when he gets stranded in the airport. The rest of the movie has him getting acquainted with various people in the airport and wondering what will become of everything now.It's a simple idea, but they know how to do some neat things with it. Above all, it shows that Tom Hanks not only is one of the greatest actors of our time, but is one of the few who can put on a believable accent. Maybe they didn't need the love affair with Catherine Zeta-Jones, but otherwise it's pretty good. Stanley Tucci's character is likely to make your skin crawl. All in all, pretty neat.",The Terminal
8,jboothmillard,The Terminal,6,22 September 2005,"Director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan) because of his long success with film-making has permission to direct pretty much anything he wants, and this film certainly proves that. Basically Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks, in his third Spielberg film) from Krakozhia wants to go to New York, but a war in his country means it is unrecognised by the U.S., and with no correct identification, he cannot legally enter the United States, or go home, until the war is over. For now, Viktor must live in the JFK airport terminal and not leave the building, so he adapts and sets up residence in the airport, and this is making the man who put him there, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) very unhappy, and Navorski in the airport could complicate his chances of a promotion. He tries a few ways to get Viktor to leave, but he remains where he is surviving on left over food, until of course he gets help from new friends in the airport staff, Joe Mulroy (Chi McBride), Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna) and Gupta Rajan (Kumar Pallana), who help him to survive. Over the time he is in the airport, who also once in a while bumps into flight attendant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta- Jones), who is hopelessly waiting for her boyfriend to come back to her, so they are both ultimately waiting for something, and even though they get close, they cannot be together. Eventually, the war does end in Viktor's home country, but Frank refuses to let him go to New York and fulfil his promise to his father, he also threatens to fire all his friends because of their disrespect to rules and regulations, but thankfully Gupta delays the plane and Viktor finally heads for the doors to America, and even Frank's right hand Ray Thurman (Patch Adams' Barry 'Shabaka' Henley) lets him go. A happy ending when he finally gets the signature of the final member of a classic jazz group. Also starring Zoe Saldana as Dolores Torres. Hanks is superb with accent and emotions of all situations put in front of him, Zeta-Jones has her moments, Tucci is a great power-hungry villain-type, and there are some gags and dramatic moments to be had. Steven Spielberg was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Tom Hanks was number 3 on The 100 Movie Stars, and he was number 39 on The World's Greatest Actor, Catherine Zeta-Jones was number 10 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 39 on The 100 Worst Britons.

10,blanche-2,Nice Spielberg-Hanks collaboration,9,12 July 2007,"Tom Hanks is Viktor Navorski, a man without a country who lives in ""The Terminal,"" a 2004 film directed by Steven Spielberg. While Viktor is en route to the U.S. to fulfill a wish of his late father's, there is a coup in the Eastern European country he calls home. When he lands at JFK airport, he finds he cannot enter the U.S. because his country is no longer recognized by the U.S., and all flights home have been canceled. While waiting in this limbo, Viktor takes up residence in the Terminal, to the chagrin of one of the administrators (Stanley Tucci) for whom Viktor is becoming somewhat of an embarrassment.This is a delightful film, if a bit too long, about the true meaning of home, about resourcefulness, and how a dream can propel a person to keep going no matter the odds. There are some funny scenes such as one of the custodial people, Gupta, watching people slide across his wet floors, Viktor taking apart seats at Gate 67 to make a bed, walking across the terminal in his bathrobe, and gathering luggage wagons so he can turn them in for quarters (he lost the food vouchers he was given). A brilliant contractor in his own country, Viktor even finds work in the terminal when his talent is recognized by the boss of one of the crews doing repairs on the building.Viktor makes many friends at the Terminal and even falls in love with a flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is attached to a married man and can't seem to break it off. That and the peanut can that Viktor carries around with him make up the poignant parts of the story.The performances are wonderful. Hanks is a true Everyman as Viktor and really gives one the feel for what it's like to be alone in a strange place and not know much of the language. In one sad moment, he watches the TV monitors and cries as he realizes his country is in trouble. Viktor is a smart man as well as being a grounded and basic one. As with all his other roles, Hanks sails through the part, making it look both believable and easy. Zeta-Jones is a stunning and vivacious Amelia who sees Viktor's true worth even as she is pulled in another direction by a dead end relationship. Stanley Tucci, an airport administrator to whom Viktor has become an embarrassment, does an excellent job portraying a rules-only mindset and the disconnect between his job and the people he's supposed to serve. In one of the most powerful scenes, he refuses to let a man into the country with medicine for his dying father because the correct forms weren't filled out in the man's country of origin. All of the supporting characters who learn the meaning of true friendship from Viktor - Cruz, Gupta, et al. are fantastic.""The Terminal"" is a real feel-good movie, beautifully directed and acted, touching and engrossing. Highly recommended for the smile it will leave on your face.",The Terminal
11,Quinoa1984,"a good piece of humanist comedy, nothing more, nothing less",7,14 January 2006,"The Terminal is sort of like a a Frank Capra tale spun into 21st century America, with it a sort of divide between the naive innocence of ordinary men, and the cynicism of the outside world. It also is akin to E.T. as being about an outsider who comes into a strange situation, gets befriended, but in reality is really all on his own on his quest. There is a sweetness to the film that works well, even when all plausibility at times goes right out the window in return to try and make shamelessly entertaining product. Steven Spielberg here has a film that is meant, in a way, as THE film for airline movies, as it can be geared for kids and adults, though like airplanes its not always the best experience.Tom Hanks is genuine for a lot of the performance, and at least a little fascinating, as Viktor Navorski, a refugee from a country made up for the sake of the film (though, apparently, his accent is for real). He's stuck in the airport, not able to leave into New York City or back to war-torn home. So, he sticks around, he meets the janitor, he runs into a emotionally weary flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones, not the best she's done but cute enough), and gets to become familiar company around the huge terminal. It's a huge place, with adversiting that almost makes it like a insular Times Square. During this Viktor goes from befriending the workers, to befriending the attendant, which leads to some romantic interest- or maybe not. Who knows with Viktor's true intentions to stick around for his chance to get into New York City. The reason he ends up telling is, actually, one of the most touching moments in the film, maybe even in the better of Spielberg films.This isn't, however, overall anything great in the filmmaker's cannon. Maybe not a 'minor' work, but it's often with too much whimsey. Or maybe not; it is a film that is meant as a crowd-pleaser, or a heartwarmer, but at times isn't too sure how to balance between some of the believability the script needs at times (i.e. why is the focus sometimes squarely on Navorski, when its a security station meant to focus on everyone at the airport). The visual styling is impressive, with some cool camera sweeps and tracks in the immense set. But it doesn't add up to anything that marks it as a great film. It also doesn't hold up as well as Spielberg's other films on repeat viewings; on a first go-around it is sheerly entertainment, but once seen again certain scenes bring out some groans. It might be even more enlightening or fun for kids, as it is on that sort of E.T. level. And Hanks' performance, which only shows some dimension towards the last twenty minutes, is good enough, though could've been more.I guess in short I'm saying that the Terminal is reccomendable, especially as a 'date' movie of sorts, though I wouldn't say to start off with it as the first Spielberg ever. That being said, Kumar Palau (the janitor character, also a Wes Anderson regular), is the best thing about the movie.",The Terminal

13,sunwarrior13,Entertaining And Mesmerizing,10,28 December 2011,"Shot almost entirely on a two-and-a-half-story recreation of a full-size operating airport terminal, this romantic comedy entitled,The Terminal from director Steven Spielberg revolves around Viktor Navorski.The Terminal is a comedy-drama film that stars Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones together with Stanley Tucci,Barry Shabaka Henley,Kumar Pallana and Diego Luna. It is about a man trapped in a terminal at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport when he is denied entry into the United States and at the same time cannot return to his native country, the fictitious Krakozhia, due to a revolution. It is partially inspired by the 18-year-stay of Mehran Karimi Nasseri in the Charles de Gaulle International Airport, Terminal I, Paris, France from 1988 to 2006.An Eastern European man by the name of Viktor Navorski,whose plans of immigrating to New York were hastened by a violent coup in his home country. Unfortunately, Viktor finds himself on the wrong end of a nasty technicality while en route to America: His passport was issued from a country, which, during its upheaval, ceased to exist in an official capacity. Unauthorized to leave Kennedy Airport upon his arrival and unable to return home, Viktor finds himself exiled inside the terminal's international transit lounge. Though airport official Frank Dixon views Viktor as an annoying bureaucratic glitch, other airport employees -- including a beautiful flight attendant by the name of Amelia -- come to see him as a welcome, if unofficial, addition to their numbers. As the days stretch on into months, the terminal transforms from an intimidating atmosphere of forced assimilation into a country within itself, complete with culture, ambition, status, complex diversity, and the need for love.This is an amazing film for the story threads that play out enjoyably, and other threads end up going nowhere as it was played completely in one location: the airport terminal. Enjoy the film from scene to scene, since there are definite pleasures along the way. I commend Hanks for his brilliant portrayal of Victor Navorski for he was excellent in keeping the viewers interest and sympathy towards him from the beginning to the end of the film.Also,I applaud Spielberg for delving into some new territory that was never explored in other films in the past. Although some may not be satisfied with Spielberg's direction,I still find this movie truly entertaining and mesmerizing.",The Terminal

15,hitchcockthelegend,"A trifle over sweet it may be, but the showing of the spirit is very pleasing.",7,11 August 2011,"During a stop over at JFK Airport, Viktor Navorski finds that his homeland of Krakozhia has erupted into chaos and a military coup has taken place. This puts him bureaucratic purgatory because his passport is no longer valid, meaning he can't get home until Krakozhia's new government is officially ratified. Forced to spend his immediate future solely in the confines of the airport, Viktor shows tremendous spirit to survive in his totally alien surroundings.The Terminal is loosely based on the case of an Iranian gentleman who was trapped in a French airport for almost ten years. Given the complete Hollywood treatment, The Terminal just manages to keep on the good side of good by fusing its fabled heart with a triumph of the will story line. Viktor {Tom Hanks perfectly cast} must use all his wits just to survive in this unique situation, be it a resourceful way of getting cash, a stoic drive to learn the English language from a simple travel guide, or making friends with an oddball assortment of airport personal, Viktor engages us as he goes about his merry way. The scenarios that are thrown up of course make for many a laugh, more so given that the said airport personal, played by Barry Shabaka Henley, Kumar Pallana and Diego Luna, are proper residents of America, but are actually equally as alien to the folk on the street as Viktor is!In amongst the frivolity {which is great and very rewarding}, there's a question of how people treat people who are not English speaking? Perhaps director Stephen Spielberg wanted to make a point here about folk presuming that those alien to the language one speaks are cretins? Annoyances getting in the way of normality? Maybe, perhaps. It's certainly the impression I got from watching it on my latest revisit. Sadly the fun and serious angle is let down by the good old romantic strand that is wedged into a film that didn't need it. For sure Catherine Zeta Jones is beautiful, but her character is weak and adds nothing to the film's basic structure. In fact it feels out of place, in the wrong airport perhaps? On the major plus side we have a wonderful performance from Stanley Tucci as airport commandant Frank Dixon, Dixon is a complete jobs worth, a stickler for the rules and views Navorski as a threat to the smooth running of his airport. If we discount the pitch perfect show from Hanks? Then Tucci most definitely takes the acting honours on show.It's a very enjoyable film that has a couple of underlying veins of seriousness, it's just a shame about the tagged on romance forcing it out into pointless treacle territory. 7/10",The Terminal
16,jotix100,Airline food at the mall,9,1 July 2004,"We went to see the film without any preconceptions and frankly, once we accepted the impossibility of this situation, we fell right under its spell. Yes, it's a bit long, yet it kept our attention until the end.I have no idea who pitched this tale to Mr. Spielberg. Evidently, the story is a far cry from reality to people like Viktor, in the situation he encounters upon arriving in New York. Viktor would have been held by the Immigration authorities, then processed, and sent to a detention center to wait for his appointment to see a judge, who ultimately would have decided his fate. No one in this situation would have been allowed to stay unguarded in the terminal, as in the case of this stateless man. Then again, we wouldn't have had a film, at all. The screen play twists the facts to adapt the story for a Tom Hanks vehicle.At the beginning it takes a while to adjust to Tom Hanks supposedly Russian accent. The inner life of the terminal is brought to life by the people that play minor roles in the movie. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg make a great team. The director and its star compliment one another. Mr. Hanks is delightful as this man who, through no fault of his own, is stuck by the red tape encountered at his arrival in this country, at the present time. Catherine Zeta Jones' flight attendant is a fake. Ms Zeta Jones makes us like her, in spite of knowing she is as deep as a Danielle Steele novel. When this woman selects a Napoleon biography from the book store, many people laughed knowing a flight attendant and Napoleon are the equivalent of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.Stanley Tucci, Diego Luna, Kumar Pallana, add a comic relief to the film.

I'm told its based on a true story, but any connection between this movie and reality is a mistake.Steven Spielberg is a good filmmaker. For years he's cranked out film classics. The problem is that many of them exist with in their own reality which isn't even remotely real. This is film suffers from this problem in spades.I never once felt that this film was even remotely real on any level what so ever.SPOILERS AHEAD You'll forgive me but I couldn't ever really accept anything in this film. For example, and in order, Why is Hanks the only one with this problem? Why does person after person talk to Hanks but no one gets a interpreter? Why is Hanks simply turned loose into the terminal when he can barely speak English? How does Hanks pick up English so fast? I could go on for almost every plot twist but I won't. END SPOILERSThis is a well made but completely unreal film. Since the situations were unreal I couldn't care what happen to anyone in the film since they seemed so unreal, Hanks first and foremost.

18,grantss,Painful,2,13 August 2016,"Victor Navorksi (played by Tom Hanks), a man from the Eastern European nation of Krakozhia, flies into JFK airport. At Customs he is forbidden entry to the USA - Krakozhia has been taken over in a coup and the US does not currently recognise the new regime, or nation. In addition, the borders of Krakozhia are now closed. This leaves Victor in limbo - he cannot enter the US or go back to Krakozhia. While waiting for the diplomatic situation to sort itself out he is forced to live in the International Transit section of JFK, living off his own resourcefulness. He also makes some new friends along the way.Painful to watch. The movie had heaps of potential as a wry look at diplomacy and international politics and how it affects everyday people. Instead director Steven Spielberg tries to make this thought-provoking situation into a comedy.Not that it's funny. Well, maybe if you're 10 years old, it's funny, but if you've got a developed sense of humour or any degree of intelligence, it's not funny at all. 10-year-olds do seem to be the target market as the ""humour"" is corny and involves cultural stereotypes, no-speak-English farce and other cheap shots.Continuing the made-for-kids theme, the movie quickly regenerates into a poor downtrodden hero vs all-powerful bad guy caper. Pity that the ""bad guy"", the head of security for JFK, is actually trying to help Victor, while doing his job. He gives Victor ample opportunities and avenues to improve his situation but Victor is too stupid to take them. Yet Spielberg makes him the bad guy and Victor the good guy.There is also a romantic drama element to this. Once again, it's more kids' fantasy than anything approaching reality. The catering guy-customs woman story was very stupid and contrived. The Victor- air hostess story was a bit more realistic, but very trite.Tom Hanks delivers easily his most irritating performance, laying on the faux Russian accent and no-speak-English shtick so thick that it is impossible to like Victor.

19,Boba_Fett1138,A movie to enjoy!,8,14 January 2005,"Very much like Spielberg's other 'little' movie ""Catch Me If You Can"" this is simply a movie to enjoy. It will not win any big awards and it's not a real must see but it is a very excellent and entertaining movie to watch.I think that it are only two things that make this movie work; Tom Hank's acting and Steven Spielberg's directing. Hanks returns to his roots, that of a comedy actor. He shows that he still is a very talented and great character comedy actor. Spielberg's directing makes this movie a light one to watch. It is filled with some typical and good as ever trademark Spielberg kind of humor and some realistic and yet enjoyable characters. Stanley Tucci really plays excellent in this movie!Main problem with ""The Terminal"" is the story. It is filled with some rather big plot holes and in a way most of it is predictable and cliché. It's like they said; 'Hey we've got Spielberg directing and Hanks starring in the main role, who needs a waterproof story!?'. In a way it doesn't really matter, it doesn't make the movie less enjoyable to watch but it just prevents it from being a perfect and a must see movie.All in all a very enjoyable movie with some good comical moments and characters but not one of the must sees of 2004.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Terminal
20,view_and_review,Tom Hanks loves being stuck,7,1 March 2007,"Tom Hanks seems to be good at the ""stuck"" role. First he was stuck on an island in ""Castaway"", now he is stuck in an airport in ""The Terminal"". He plays Viktor Navorski and he is in America from his Eastern European home, but since there is turmoil in his land, he can't get permission to step foot onto American soil.In a movie such as this one, you are greatly relying on the actor to carry it. This is a movie with no action, no real romance, no special effects, and no scene changes. Tom Hanks does an excellent job as the broken English speaking European. There are a few engaging incidents throughout the movie while the main story prods along: that being Viktor trying to get permission to walk outside the airport. There are a few other interesting characters, and there is even a bit of anticipation as you hold on to find out exactly why Viktor is in America. I liked the movie. I thought Tom was wonderful and I thought the character combination was choice.",The Terminal
21,Uriah43,A Touching Comedy,8,4 August 2019,"On his way to New York City to resolve a personal matter, ""Viktor Navorski"" (Tom Hanks) becomes victimized by a civil war in his home country which leaves him in a curious situation. In essence, since his government no longer exists his passport and visa are no longer valid. That means that he cannot go back and he cannot enter the United States. So with no other options the temporary head of Homeland Security at JFK Airport ""Frank Dixon"" (Stanley Tucci) decides to detain him for the time-being in the international terminal there. Unfortunately, as the civil war drags on with no clear resolution, Viktor is left homeless for weeks on end with only a couple of employees there as friends. Yet despite all of this he remains resolute in his determination to finish what he set out to initially accomplish. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an especially cute and endearing film which captured my attention from start-to-finish. Admittedly, there were a few slow parts here and there but they were definitely made up for by the frequent comedy, romance and drama scenes which flowed all around. On that note, while Tom Hanks was quite impressive, I also liked the performance of Kumar Pallana (as ""Gupta Rajan"") who I thought was absolutely hilarious. Likewise, having two attractive actresses like Catherine Zeta-Jones (""Amilia Warren"") and Zoe Saldana (""Dolores Torres"") certainly didn't hurt in any way either. Be that as it may, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and have rated it accordingly. Definitely above average.",The Terminal

It is some parts all of the above and other parts of not much.  $pielberg takes a great story and provides us his usual glimpses of film brilliance surrounded in his always present feel-good fluff.  Hanks' character is fascinating - funny, brilliant, observant and caring.  The subject terminal could have provided so much more insight into human interaction, but instead relies on too common stereotypes.  I loved the story line of Diego Luna and Zoe Saldana, but it gets ruined by a ridiculous plot twist from an episode of ""Fantasy Island"".  Zeta-Jones' story is so pathetic, I was cringing with the dialogue almost from the first moment. How many times can she say ""stay away from me""?  It seemed limitless.  OK, enough with the wet floor jokes.  How about some more of the scenes with Hanks and Tucci - that was the meat of the story if one were to ignore the terminal possibilities.

When war breaks out in his country an Eastern European citizen becomes stranded in a New York airport unable to leave. He understands little English but makes the best of his situation. Structure is sometimes disjointed but surprises when the mystery is revealed regarding the peanut can he possesses. Spielberg gives a detailed feel to airport operations. This marks the third collaboration between director and star, after previously helming Saving Private Ryan and Catch Me If You Can. Tom Hanks is superb as someone out of his element yet adapts when all else fails. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a stewardess down in relationships yet she finds friendship and freedom with this peculiar foreign fellow. Stanley Tucci plays an airport commissioner who tries to maintain order yet ultimately must face the fact that his terminal sleepover guest is not quite the hindrance he at first thought. Chi McBride plays a security guard who sympathizes with Hanks. He shifts through disjointed moments yet performs with appeal. Zoe Saldana plays an immigration officer and, like McBride, the role is standard fair and barely elevates above plot conventions. This is a rewarding film about conquering life's hardships.

24,HotToastyRag,"A few laughs, but not really a feel-good flick",7,28 December 2017,"The preview of The Terminal is a pretty good representation of the film, which isn't always the case with modern trailers. Tom Hanks plays a man from Krakozhia, visiting the United States for the first time. He arrives in New York City, but before he gets through immigration he runs into a pretty major problem. Stanley Tucci, the customs director, informs him that his government is going through a crisis and he isn't allowed to enter the United States. He's also not allowed to be shipped home, so he's stuck in ""the terminal"" until his country stabilizes. He meets a host of airport workers who have a host of quirky traits, and he also becomes attracted to stewardess Catherine Zeta-Jones. And, as you can see from the preview, there are a few laughs, some good acting from an accented and utterly foreign Tom Hanks, some cute scenes, but it won't end up being your favorite movie in the world.My biggest problem with the film are the minor characters. Kumar Pallana, a janitor, is extremely irritating. His character is written to have a major attitude problem and to be intentionally mean, for no reason except to exact a frustrated chuckle from the audience. Diego Luna and Zoe Saldana have an awkward romance that isn't the most amusing part of the plot. Catherine Zeta-Jones, while written realistically, isn't a very nice person and reminds audiences of that one person in their circle of friends who makes endless mistakes but is tolerated because of her beauty.Basically, if you're a Tom Hanks fan, or a Steven Spielberg fan, or a John Williams fan, you'll probably want to see it. But it's not exactly the feel-good movie that you think it will be. There's a big mystery in the plot and once it's revealed, you might feel a bit let down. Having said that, I do own a copy, since there are some cute scenes. My favorite is Tom Hanks's preparation of asking Catherine Zeta-Jones out on a date, or as he says it, to ""eat a bite"". He's a cutie!",The Terminal
25,movieman_kev,Terminal is fading fast,4,4 July 2005,"This Spielberg helmed tale VERY loosely based on the story of Iranian refugee, Merhan Nasseri, has Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorski, stuck in an American airport, rather than a French one (because if it was set in France, why couldn't have those great jabs at the Department of Homeland Security, right?) after his Visa is void thanks to his home country being in a state of upheaval. He must find a way to survive while the evil Homeland Security authority figure attempts to get him out of the airport. The film actually convinced me that it wasn't going to be a pretty good, albeit cute little film. Then the horribly miscast Mrs. Michael Douglas shows up as Viktor's love interest (cause, hey what good looking woman WOULDN'T want some homeless refugee man-meat?) and the film starts it's gradual decline into mediocrity. Hank's acting is great as alway, but everyone else, not so much. And I'm sorry Tom couldn't or shouldn't have to carry a film all by his lonesome. I'm still waiting for Spielberg to make another great movie (his last one I loved was ""Saving Private Ryan), but every film since than, has been a major disappointment in one way or another. This one perhaps more so, as the first 15 or 20 minutes showed much promise.My Grade: C-",The Terminal
26,The_Void,"Not bad, but not Spielberg at his best either",7,5 July 2005,"There's no doubting that Spielberg knows the workings of cinema well enough to ensure that his movies are always entertaining, but sometimes he doesn't choose his projects all that wisely. The man is at his best when he's got a huge budget and a long list of stunts to play with; and he showed this with his Indiana Jones trilogy and Jurassic Park films. When Spielberg attempts drama, the results are often mixed. Schindler's List stunk of a blockbuster director trying to win an Oscar, and while it doesn't look like Spielberg was going for gold with this picture; the movie doesn't quite bode right, and much of the drama seems forced or overly sentimental. This makes the film hard to take seriously at times, especially since many of the events in the film are completely detached from reality. The extremely swift wedding ceremony sticks out the most. The plot, based on a true story, follows Viktor Navorski; an Eastern European man who finds himself stranded in a New York airport when his country goes to war and isn't letting anyone in or out. He then, through lack of other options, decides to take up residency in the airport itself.In 2004, Tom Hanks delivered an outstandingly over the top performance in the Coen's remake of the Ealing classic, The Ladykillers. The Terminal sees Hanks delivering another over the top performance, but it's not half as good this time. Hanks' put on European accent isn't bad, but it quickly becomes annoying. His dumb antics are another thing that becomes annoying all too quickly, and after about an hour; the premise begins to show signs of becoming tired. Catherine Zeta-Jones is Hanks' massively underdeveloped love interest. It is this aspect that is the film's main downfall. The romance between these two is hardly explored and it happens all too quickly. It therefore feels like an afterthought in an underdeveloped movie. It isn't all woe for this film, however, as the movie does have it's good points. Spielberg does a surprisingly good job of setting up his protagonist's plight and the way that we are constantly reminded of the predicament that the immigrant is in, is good. On the whole, this is worth watching; but Spielberg has been better, and far more entertaining, than this on many occasions.",The Terminal
27,zetes,"Good, but has too many weak parts.",7,28 June 2004,"Definitely one of Spielberg's lesser efforts, one that might play at the 2 AM slot on TCM when he dies. One wonders why he took this project; it seems more like something Robert Zemeckis might knock off. There are a couple of moments of such amazingly poor writing that you wonder if Spielberg, or even Tom Hanks, even read that page of the script. However, most of the film is a decent human comedy. A man from a made-up Eastern European country lands at JFK airport and finds out that his government has been overthrown. His passport and visa are unacceptable, and no one knows what to do with him. The head of the airport (Stanley Tucci) orders him to wait in the airport while they figure something out, only they never do. Hanks becomes a permanent resident there, becomes friends with most of the little people who work in the airport, and even courts a pretty flight attendant whom he runs into now and then (Catherine Zeta-Jones). It's all pretty fun, and even at times quite romantic (there's also a subplot where Hanks helps a young food delivery man win the heart of a woman on the airport security staff that is kind of sweet). I also like the way the film celebrates the melting pot that makes up America. It's a nice picture in a time of ever-rising insularity. Yet there are so many bits holding the film back. The screenplay really needed some editing. Hanks carries around a peanut jar through the whole movie. We are told fairly early that it does not contain peanuts, and so the audience knows that a big surprise is coming. When we actually find out, it's quite lame, and, metaphorically, this part of the film just doesn't work. And, strangely, there's this one character who works a lot towards bringing the movie down a peg or two. The character of Gupta seems to ruin the movie. His backstory is melodramatic and not fit for this story, he's a paranoid, sadistic jerk (he is the janitor, and he washes the floors just so people will slip on them), and he provides the movie with the silliest deus ex machina imaginable. That's not to mention the actor, Kumar Pallana, is a horrible actor. This film is actually inspired by the true story of an Iranian man who became stranded at a Parisian airport after his briefcase, which contained his passport and everything he owned, was stolen. The original story is much more interesting than The Terminal. A movie has already been made in France about it, but it hasn't been seen much outside of that country. I think the real story would make a great film. 7/10.",The Terminal

The movie is sappy, but that is it's intention.  Directed at a quick pace.  The movie has a set goal, Tom Hanks visit to New York.  I believe the real life guy was stranded in the Paris airport, when trying to arrive to Holland.  My guess is that this is what influenced this movie.  I give this movie a 7 out of 10.

30,JamesHitchcock,Stuck in Transit and Not Going Anywhere,6,8 December 2020,"When Viktor Navorski, a tourist from the Eastern European Republic of Krakozhia, arrives at New York's Kennedy Airport, he does not realise that the airport terminal will become his home for the next nine months. While his plane has been in the air, a military coup has taken place in Krakozhia and civil war has broken out. It appears that the American government does not recognise either side in the civil war as legitimate and consequently does not recognise Viktor's passport as a valid travel document. The result is that Viktor is not permitted either to leave the terminal and enter the United States or to return to his homeland.The film then chronicles what Viktor does during his nine-month stay. He gradually learns to speak English. Although he has no work permit, he finds a job and earns some money helping a team of contractors who are decorating the terminal. (It is implied that Viktor is himself a building contractor in Krakozhia). He befriends some of the workers, including a beautiful air hostess named Amelia. He is harassed by Frank Dixon, the officious head of security at the airport who is desperate to get rid of him so that he becomes someone else's problem. And eventually we learn why Viktor has come to America. (It turns out that his late father was both a jazz enthusiast and an autograph collector, and Viktor needs the autograph of a famous musician to complete his father's collection).Hanks, Hollywood's resident Mr Nice Guy, makes a likeable hero, and there is a good, if manic, performance from Stanley Tucci, playing Dixon as the sort of heartless bureaucrat who cares less about helping people than he does about impressing his superiors because he is desperate for promotion. Catherine Zeta Jones, however, seemed rather wasted as Amelia. At one time it seemed that the film was going to turn into a romantic comedy and that Amelia and Viktor would fall in love. She is in an unhappy relationship with a boyfriend who is continually unfaithful to her, and we are told that her age is 39, several years older than Jones's real age at the time of filming, a detail which seemed to have been invented to make her seem more compatible with the middle-aged Viktor. (Tom Hanks was in his mid-forties at the time). In the event, however, a romance between the two never develops, Amelia returns to her unsatisfactory boyfriend and fades out of the story.There may have been a reason why Steven Spielberg did not want to make a rom-com, which would doubtless have ended with Viktor becoming a US resident after his wedding to Amelia. (I doubt if she would have wanted to make her matrimonial home in a war-torn foreign country). Spielberg wanted to get away from the idea (a commonly held one in America) that the great desire of every foreigner is to swap their own citizenship for a US passport and to live the American Dream in the Land of the Free and Home of the Brave. When Dixon offers Viktor the chance to apply for political asylum, hoping that if he does he will become the immigration department's problem rather than Dixon's, a bewildered Viktor makes it clear that his greatest desire is to get back to Krakozhia.I did find myself wondering just how plausible the basic scenario behind the film is, even though it is said to be based upon the true story of an Iranian who allegedly spent eighteen years living in Charles de Gaulle Airport, Paris. Violent changes of regime are a sadly frequent feature of international politics, but they do not normally lead to nationals of the countries concerned becoming stateless or being forced to stay in airport lounges. And was Viktor the only Krakozhian travelling to New York on that particular day? If not, what happened to the others? Another matter I found implausible was that, despite Viktor's limited knowledge of English, neither Dixon nor the other officials dealing with him ever seem to use an interpreter.Overall, ""The Terminal"" is an agreeable enough film, although small-scale comedies like this one are not what I have come to expect from Spielberg, a director I have always associated with more ambitious fare, even if his ambition is not always crowned with success. He himself stated that after ""Catch Me If You Can"" (which also starred Hanks) he wanted to make another movie ""to make people feel good about the world"" at a difficult time for the world. (The film came out in 2004, a year after the outbreak of the second Gulf War). To some extend he succeeds in this aim, but too often I felt that the film, like its central character, was stuck in transit and not going anywhere. 6/10",The Terminal
31,StevePulaski,"Wonderful, whimsical, optimistic, yet sometimes poignant",9,9 March 2012,"As a film, The Terminal is a beauty to watch and to look at. Yes, I believe the two are different. At least in this sense. Just because you're watching a film doesn't mean you like looking at it. You're sort of just watching what is happening. Who knows if you actually like what you're seeing? It's like if you're seeing Saw. Yes, you're watching it, but do you like to look deeply into the eyes of victims who have been gutted and left for dead? The Terminal is a lot brighter and more vivid than most dramas I have seen, and it's a beautiful film all around. It's food for your eyes and your thoughts.I'm not sure another actor could've played the character of Viktor Navorski better. Tom Hanks has been working in film for about thirty years now, and has ejected his charisma into almost every character he has played. As an actor, Hanks is fantastic. As a character actor, Hanks is excellent.In The Terminal, he is Viktor Navorski, who travels from the fictional country of Krakozhia to the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. Navorski's native country is in ruins with a recent revolution taking place, and all planes in and out of the country have just been halted. His passport and credit cards are no longer valid either, meaning he can't enter the United States. He has slipped through a rare, unexpected crack that basically states he can't go forward or backwards. He has can't pass ""Go"" or collect $200.His home base is the airport, a large and, literally, foreign world to Viktor, who can't speak English fluently. He spends most of his time desperately seeking money by returning luggage carts for a quarter a piece so he can have his next meal, eating saltine crackers and ketchup, and sleeping restlessly on rows of chairs. I'd like to call The Terminal a comedy, but the film is so sad in some parts it earns the title of ""a drama."" CBP Head Frank Dixon (Tucci) questions Navorski's strange behavior and his unhinged abiding of the rules. He doesn't resist, yell, scream, or get flustered. He just abides. Dixon wants Navorski out of his care, and tries to force him out the doors of the airport. Much to his dismay, Navorski chooses to follow the rules and stay put until the light is green. There is something so very admirable about a character who can cope peacefully in a cryptic and stressful situation.It is much to my surprise that the entire airport is a man-made set in a hangar in Palmdale. It looks marvelous. According to director Steven Spielberg, everything functions as it would in real life, with real food and drinks in the designated outlets, real working stoves in the food court, bathrooms, escalators, etc.I love films set in a public area, which would explain my fondness for films like Career Opportunities, Clerks, and Mallrats. Why I'm so astonished at The Terminal's location is that the film doesn't feel low or shy on material where it has to resort to pictorial aspects as a means of humor and substance. Scenes from a Mall, a Woody Allen movie, was about a married couple working out their marital differences, in public, while walking around a mall. There were so many unnecessary elements like a cloyingly unfunny mime wandering around with them and the fact that Allen's character had to lug around a huge yellow surfboard for the majority of the film. Those elements felt like gratuitous and impetuous distractions. Not to mention, the film didn't need to be set in a mall area. This was a film about a couple working out their differences; why did they have to do it in public? The Terminal avoids redundancy by including various characters, and dodges caricatures and dramatic dead-ends by providing development and substance to each one it introduces. When we go to an airport, we don't care about the janitor, the security guards, the people in there, or the people flying the plane; we care about getting from there to our desired destination, on time, and in one piece. Spielberg has created a wonderful, whimsical, optimistic, yet sometimes poignant story focusing on a man's unfortunate experience in purgatory without turning it into a ridiculous epiphany or a laugh riot.Starring: Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci, Barry Shabaka Henley, Kumar Pallana.

32,=G=,Ka-thunk!!,5,24 November 2004,"""The Terminal"" tells of an Eastern European man on a personal mission (Hanks) who becomes stuck in a NYC airport terminal because he doesn't have the proper papers to enter the US and cannot return to his home as his country suffered a coup while he was en route. Given it's pedigree, this film is a dud. Too long at 2 hours, full of filler and commercial product impressions, and very predictable throughout, ""The Terminal"" tries to build a story around the Hanks character including wooing a flight attendant (Zeta-Jones) while bathing in a public restroom, eating at BURGER KING, buying a HUGO BOSS suit, and carrying around his precious PLANTERS DRY ROASTED PEANUTS can, etc. With yawns from the critics and a lukewarm reception by the public, ""The Terminal"" is fodder for fans only.

33,MovieAddict2016,One of the most genuinely annoying films I've seen all year,3,5 September 2005,"I guess it's not fair for me to judge the film. I was a bit biased. I had read about the true story of Merhan Nasseri, an Iranian refugee who landed at Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris in 1988 after being denied entry into England because his passport and United Nations refugee certificate had been stolen. Due to the technicalities he stayed in Terminal 1 and finally, years later, was granted permission to either enter France or return to his own country. The irony is that he has chosen to remain living in the airport.So, the potential for the film was quite interesting. It's an amazing story and given the right cast I was sure it could be told well. When I heard Spielberg was on board, I was excited, because it implied (to me, anyway) that an experienced director was at the helm who would respect the original story without turning it into some MTV-generation romantic comedy.Little did I know Spielberg was yet again adding his ""magic touch"" to a true story, and thereby destroying it. This is worse than any MTV movie - it's Spielberg Shlock.Don't get me wrong, Spielberg's a great director... when someone's got a leash on him. But sometimes he's given too much freedom. His ego tends to get the best of him; he needs to get rid of the yes-men. Something tells me there were a lot of yes-men on the set this time around.And having Tom Hanks play Viktor was about the worst choice. Hanks' performance is simply awful. Something tells me he had too many yes-men handing him praise, as well.The plot is very, very, VERY loosely based on the true story of Nasseri, and I'm sure whenever he gets to see the film as it plays on the free TV in Terminal 1, he'll be quite disappointed.His story was already made into a French film in 1993 named ""Tombés du ciel."" I haven't seen the original but from the plot description on IMDb it sounds far more factually accurate.Okay, so, you want to know my real problems with the Spielberg remake? Okay, first things first. If you're making a movie about an eastern immigrant, DO NOT name his native country ""Krakhozia."" That's about the WORST fake country name I've ever heard in any movie, and that's including Narnia and Toyland.Secondly, the movie's smug, self-conscious, ""happy"" attitude is awful. It's like a continuation of ""Forrest Gump"" only Hanks is even more annoying.Thirdly, all the stuff Viktor does in this movie is totally fake and I never for a second bought that he was any eastern immigrant. His accent was terrible and he's stupider than Tara Reid, yet a week after being in the airport he's learned English (with the help of a terminal worker, who, as we all know, have jobs transporting baggage because they're so smart and well-educated). Suddenly Viktor is a well-knowledged, experienced American immigrant who ""knows the ropes"" - he even gets a job as a painter in the terminal.And then there's the Mandatory Romantic Interest Subplot. It's totally unnecessary and gives the movie a fake, bogged-down feel. Catherine Zeta-Jones is completely annoying (almost as much as Hanks) and her character is a shallow, trite, convenient addition to the plot. Neither character is given much depth and their ""romance"" comes across as being entirely heavy-handed and unbelievable.On top of the schmaltz and plot contrivances, the continual marketing tie-ins are sickening - I can't say how many times I had Burger King crammed down my throat while watching this movie. After I left, I felt like going to the nearest Burger King and throwing stones at everyone inside. That's how mad it made me. When I pay $16 to see a movie (yes, I paid in pounds, which in dollars is doubled to around $15 or $16) I don't want to have Burger King, Nokia, Gatorade, Coke, Pepsi, etc., thrown into my face. I get enough of that on TV. It was truly embarrassing (and I felt ashamed for Spielberg) when he spends ten minutes following Viktor's adventure to buy a hamburger from Burger King.The message is nice - if you're an illegal immigrant and can't afford anything, just get jobs no one else wants like cleaning toilets or collecting luggage carts and earn minimum wage so you can buy a greasy hamburger from some pock-marked self-absorbed teenager who probably spat in your food.I hate to sound really bitter and all (I'm truly not this bitter in real life - usually) but there's something about this movie that just struck me as too nice. It's like Martin Short in the movie ""Clifford"" -- it's so sweet you know there's got to be a hidden agenda somewhere.",The Terminal

It's heartwarming and has humanity to it along with cute comedic moments. Tom Hanks Russian accent seems forced in the beginning but I quickly got use to it and seemed natural afterwards. Tom plays a very naive and yet kind hearted guy name Viktor Navorski who can't leave the airport terminal because of certain circumstances. And Stanli Tucci put on a believable performance and fit the mood of this movie well. He plays a Frank Dixon who is the head of security at the airport this movie takes place. And is the one that gives Navorski the most difficult time but without him there wouldn't be this story. The comedic moments in this movie really works and is a film the whole family can enjoy. The different scenarios come together in a delightful manner and that is what this film is, it's delightful and entertaining. So parts just seem way too far-fetched and underdeveloped. But that is passable because this isn't suppose to be a really realistic film. In fact it sorted reminded me of ""Forrest Gump"" except it takes place in a terminal. Overall this is a movie that adults and kids can enjoy.8.5/10",The Terminal
37,OllieSuave-007,A good movie to catch at the terminal.,8,26 April 2014,"This is a good comedy drama starring Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorsk, an Eastern European visitor to the United States who becomes stranded at a New York airport terminal because war broke out in his home country, voiding his passport and putting his immigration status in limbo.The plot of Navorsk getting mixed up in government bureaucracy while the state of his home country remains unknown provides a good source of suspense and intrigue, making the viewers wonder what would become of the man. The developing relationship between Navorsk and U.S. airline flight attendant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) provides a good subplot, adding intrigue and drama to the movie.Steven Spielberg provided solid direction to the cast, whose acting I thought was pretty spot-on, including Tom Hanks' European accent. John Williams provided another great music score for the movie.Overall, it's a steady-paced movie, but also a feel-good film that doesn't rely on action and gritty melodrama to make it entertaining.Grade B+",The Terminal
38,Buddy-51,about as much fun as being stuck at the airport,4,1 October 2005,"Viktor Navorski is a man without a country - literally. On the very day his plane touches down at JFK, Viktor learns that a coup has occurred back in his fictional home country of Krakozha. Among other inconveniences, this international crisis renders his passport invalid until the United States government agrees to recognize and establish diplomatic relations with the destabilized country's new leadership. Until then, Viktor remains a virtual prisoner in the terminal, unable to leave the premises and forced to live under the watchful eye of airport security. There's a certain irony in the fact that Viktor, who was presumably raised in a draconian communist country, becomes the ultimate victim of a de-humanized bureaucracy and a mountain of red tape the minute he sets foot on American soil. From that moment on, he has to find a way to survive in this strange new environment, but eventually he learns to make the airport his home, winning friends and wooing a love interest (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) into the bargain.Certainly, there are those who will find this fable about a simple man, trapped somewhere between the worlds of Capra and Kafka, heartwarming and charming. All I can say is that I found it, for the most part, aggravatingly contrived and cutesy, too infatuated with its own premise to develop a sustainable storyline. The problem begins with Tom Hanks who has milked the Average Joe/ Mr. Nice Guy shtick so much throughout his long career that it has long since lost any impact it once might have had. Adding a cutesy Eastern European accent to the brew just makes the performance all that more insufferable. In essence, Victor is reduced to little more than a ""man/child,"" hardly a character worth developing a full length, tour de force feature film around.Steven Spielberg, who normally can do no wrong as a director, for some reason is unable to make an effective go of things here. Could it be because Spielberg handles sentiment well when he's working in a generally unsentimental genre like science fiction where he has some built-in tension to work off of, but that when he's dabbling in a highly sentimental genre like romantic comedy, he runs out of energy and vision? He's done a terrific job recreating an entire functioning airport terminal on a soundstage, but none of that really matters very much when we begin feeling as trapped inside the setting as Viktor himself does. Throughout the whole movie, I just kept wishing Viktor would bust his way through the terminal doors and find his way into a more interesting story. Almost all the secondary characters are shallow, stereotypical and uninteresting, while Stanley Tucci's nasty little airport manager is not only annoying and repulsive but completely incomprehensible from a psychological point of view.""The Terminal"" is one of those movies that is so impressed with its own sweetness and goodness that it winds up patronizing all the ""little people"" it thinks it's celebrating. This is a film strictly for those who actually enjoy being stuck at the airport.",The Terminal

40,MOscarbradley,One of Spielberg's most underrated films is also one of his best.,10,4 January 2021,"The premis of Steven Spielberg's ""The Terminal"" might seem far-fetched, (a non-English speaking Eastern European tourist is stranded in limbo in JFK airport after a military coup in his own country has left him citizenless, unable to enter US soil or return home), and since he's played by the very non-Eastern European Tom Hanks, the whole thing should fall flat on its very Spielbergian face and, of course, it's sentimental in the extreme. However, ""The Terminal"" is based on an actual incident that occured in France, even if the director has taken considerable liberties with it.In the hands of anyone else, it would probably have just been plain silly but Spielberg knows exactly what he's doing and in Hanks he's got a sublime actor who can actually carry this potential nonsense off. The critics mostly hated it and the Academy ignored it but it's actually very funny and superbly acted, especially by Hanks and Stanley Tucci as the less than likeable Head of Security. I've seen it described as Capraesque but fundamentally it's 100% Spielbergian and this gem isn't just one of his most underrated films, it's also one of his best.",The Terminal

42,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Stuck in the airport with you.,6,29 October 2021,"'The Terminal (2004)' stars Tom Hanks as a vaguely Eastern European guy from a fake Eastern European country (in an effort to prevent anything from hitting too close to home) who gets trapped in an airport terminal after his country is caught up in a coup, which leaves him both without permission to enter the USA and without a home to return to. As such, he lives his life inside the airport, meeting a variety of people as he does his best to earn enough money to sustain himself on a primarily Burger King diet and to maybe, just maybe find love. It's a sappy sort of story with hints of romantic comedy and an almost vignette-like structure. Hanks bumbles about, practically choking on his accent, as he works his way into the hearts and minds of the airport staff who, essentially, become his family. Along the way, he unwittingly makes an enemy of the airport's supervisor, seemingly for no other reason than because he's kind; the supervisor makes it his mission to force Hanks' character into breaking the law by trying to escape. It's a bit of an odd choice to include an almost comic-book antagonist, but Tucci makes the role his own and the rivalry works as a catalyst for most of the movie's plot points. The rest of the cast do what they can with what they're given, but it's really Hanks' show. In a way, he seems the same as he always does; the accent is the only thing that separates this character from most of his others. It's a bit weird to cast perhaps the all-American actor as an Eastern European guy, but he's affable enough. The flick lacks any real themes and it's also slightly inconsistent when it comes to tone. It's enjoyable enough, though, and has its legitimately sweet moments. It's third act doesn't quite know what to do with itself, but the overall experience is generally entertaining. It isn't something that's likely to stick with you, but it does what it sets out to rather well. 6/10.",The Terminal
43,dromasca,best airport movie,8,4 October 2004,"I usually avoid seeing films while traveling, despite flying quite often over the Ocean. Cinema experience does not fit well for me with the poor sound, very small screens, and airplanes food. I could not resist however seeing 'The Terminal' both because the movie was presented by the airline before the DVD is out, and also because this is definitely The Movie to see in-flight. It's about airports after all, and I am spending nowadays part of my life on airports!Well, I am not sorry at all. This is a typical Spielberg film, and with the exception of 'Schindler's List' here we have a film maker who cannot care less about credibility. His film making is about emotions, relationships, fears and monsters, and we have all of these in the film. The story is of an East European tourist, who finds himself stuck in the no land zone of a New York airport after his passport is being made valid by a military coup in his country. He is not allowed to enter the US, he cannot return home, or fly some other place. He became a non person in international law terms.The best part of the film was for me the culture clash between the main character and the bureaucratic machine he needs to face. The message is that there is more humanity in his naive, East-European approach to life then in the government clerks supposed to represent the 'Western civilization'. America is an immigrant society, and this film tries to remind this basic fact. This is not supposed to be realistic life description, but more a symbolic confrontation, somehow similar to a Chaplin character facing the Big Machine. There is no other word to describe Tom Hanks performance but perfect. A good supporting cast provides the comic counterpoint. There is not too much to say about Catherine Zeta-Jones. She is beautiful, and this is all what the role required. This may not be one of Spielberg's best films, but even when he does an average film Spielberg succeeds to make it interesting, and in this case funny. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.",The Terminal
44,MLDinTN,sort of interesting...,4,6 April 2005,"but even Tom Hanks can't make a film great if the story isn't there. Hanks plays, Victor, an eastern Europeaner who has come to America only to find out his country doesn't exist politically any more. So, he can't get a visa and is stuck in the airport. The top airport security guy thinks it will just be a few days to straighten it out, but Victor ends up staying months. Along the way he meets a nice flight attendent, played by CZJ, but she really isn't given much to do. Plus, she's not that likable since she's having an affair with a married man. He also befriends other employees of the airport. He helps them, and they give him food and help set up dates with CZJ. The head guy sets up schemes to get Victor to leave the airport, but he won't. He can't even get Victor to admit he's fearful-one of the funny scenes. He even gets a job and makes a shrine to CZJ. It ends with him finally getting to do what he came to New York to do. His reason makes you think the money spent on air fare could have been better used since he only planned to stay a day any way. There's also a corny wedding between two airport employees Victor helps set up.FINAL VERDICT: Slow going, not much action. Another disappointment from Spielberg. I don't recommend it unless you have to see everything Hanks is in.",The Terminal
45,g-bodyl,Brings Me A Good Feeling!,9,11 May 2014,"The Terminal is one of the better feel-good movies I have seen in recent years. After watching it, I just felt so good about life because of this movie. This is why I can admit that Steven Spielberg is one of my favorite directors. He doesn't always make Oscar-friendly movies, which is good because he can make great films that are made to entertain, not win accolades. This film is very charming, has several funny moments even if didn't try to have them, has fantastic acting, and it basically answers the question of what living in an airport would be like.Spielberg directs a film about a guy named Viktor Navorski who is traveling to New York, but is denied entry to America. He is not allowed to return home as well because his country is at war. So, that means he is forced to stay at JFK. While there, he learns English, makes some friends, has encounters with a by-the-book Director of Customs, and even finds love.The acting is very good. In recent years, we haven't much called Tom Hanks funny. But he returns to his comedic roots as Viktor and shows he can be funny without trying. He has such an impeccable taste when it comes to his timing. Catherine Zeta-Jones is solid as the flight attendant Viktor falls for. In every movie Stanley Tucci has been in, he manages to steal his scenes. That means he is excellent in this film.Overall, The Terminal is one of Spielberg's awesome feel-good movies. This movie is not meant to win awards, but it has an objective to please the audience and give them quality entertainment. This film can be schmaltzy at times, but in a very good way. The screenplay is very well-written and is often heart-touching. John Williams contributes another great score, though a little low-key. Another fine directorial effort by Spielberg. I rate this film 9/10.",The Terminal

47,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Mild, meaningless film",5,18 September 2004,"Steven Spielberg used to tackle massive movies that were huge blockbusters and instant classics. Think Jaws, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan. Now he's busy with 'who cares?' little movies with little stories and little meaning. Catch Me If You Can and The Terminal are perfect examples of this. What has happened to Spielberg? Why is he wasting time on easily forgotten stuff like this and not concentrating his efforts on something bigger and better. Tom Hanks is great as Victory Navorsky, the traveler from Eastern Europe who is stranded in JFK airport after war breaks out in his country. He is not allowed to leave the terminal so he settles down in an abandoned departure gate and makes a temporary home for himself. In between mild scenes of mild drama some colorful characters pop up for some mild involvement. The least of which is lecherous Catherine Zeta-Jones as Flight Attendant with no clue who ends up being a complete waste of time.It's not so hard to believe why Dodgeball beat this to the number 1 spot this past summer. Both movies are instantly forgettable but The Terminal doesn't have much of an audience outside of pensioners (I was the only person under 60 when I went to see, in an almost empty cinema).With Catch Me If You Can, Steven Spielberg certainly proved he can do simple, non-epic movies. But he also proved that 12 years earlier with Always. Did we really need another one? The only thing worthwhile in the Terminal is John Williams' warm musical score.

In order to appreciate this movie fully, one must put aside the usual American romance expectations and just enjoy the movie, the acting, the fine nuance of humor and the ordinary life experiences that occur in a major airport terminal. This rather eccentric slice of life view of a man trapped by circumstance offers Tom Hanks one of his finest expanding roles to date and Catherine Zeta-Jones with a delightful character that we can identify with as well as the bittersweet message of the movie. The humanity capture in this microcosm of an airport and the promise to one's father further presents a optimistic view of man.

51,ironhorse_iv,"I finally watch it. Yes, this movie was worth the wait.",7,1 October 2012,"Terminal: dying: affected by a fatal illness or condition that is approaching its final stages. This movie isn't that. The Terminal, to me, was a comical representation, presented with a serious almost adventurousness, of the Airline system. A foreign man play by Tom Hanks to come to America *for reasons known later*, was held up at an airport, as his small almost unknown made up country goes into a revolution which no one will acknowledge the country. This presents a problem for the foreigner. Since now that his country is gone, he can't be taken into America, for some odd paper work reasons forcing him to wait at the airport which really does seem realism at all. It's doesn't in any source. If you understand that silly odd plot line, you will find Tom Hanks's being told by those in charge tell him to wait, expecting him to leave. They want him to leave, where he will be someone else problem likely to pick up as an illegal alien. He doesn't, and proceeds to carry out his life in an airport. At first, he has a hard time surviving in the terminal leading him to risk going outside. The Terminal actually address some language issues between those who work at the airport and those traveling over seas as Viktor has a hard time speaking English. Then he gets an 'Under the Table' job at the terminal, makes some money, and feeds himself and makes the terminal his community. This makes it, a little bit more weird, and he falls in love with a flight attendant play Catherine Zeta Jones who is having an affair with a married man, (a complete DO NOT EVER DO) scenario, and that never works out in the end. I think this is the downside of the plot. The named situation of this is the girl the foreigner meets in the terminal. She is admitting causing an affair with a married man, and doesn't seems to want to stop. This is Hollywood writing all the way, and it very much disturbing. It really doesn't have anything to do with the other plot. On the good side, the Terminal has that rich blend of humor, emotion, and anticipation. The movie isn't much of an action thriller, but it has the attributes of an overall terrific movie. The humor of this movie was superb. A good laugh here and there, and the movie definitely does not overuse humor like a lot of movies do. Emotional twists are another strong point of this movie. Anticipation of the unknown created by these twists will keep you on your toes too. Days turn into weeks, weeks into months, (9 to be exact) and Viktor finally gets out of the airport when the revolt is over and the last part of the movie is one of those emotional twist turns. In conclusion, the Terminal is an excellent movie just not as good as the other Spielberg's films.",The Terminal

54,tomgillespie2002,Manipulative attempt to re-create the magic of Capra,4,8 May 2013,"Film-makers frequently find themselves going back to basics or back to their roots in order to find inspiration, rather than seeking innovation. Two of Hollywood's arguably most powerful men - Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks - did precisely this back in 2004 with the release of The Terminal, apparently based on the 18-year stay at Charles de Gaulle airport experienced by Iranian refugee Mehran Karimi Nasseri (although the film-makers and producers have failed to acknowledge it). Spielberg had been striving for bid-budget, CGI-laden blockbusters such as A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001) and Minority Report (2002), and historical epics like Amistad (1997) and Saving Private Ryan (1998), before he made The Terminal. Although those films were generally good to very good, Spielberg returned to something more simple and heartfelt; something in the vein of Frank Capra or Billy Wilder, who combined sentiment and romanticism to such a glorious effect. Well, to be frank, he shouldn't have bothered.Victor Navorski (Hanks) arrives at JFK International Airport from his (fictional) home country of Krakozhia, with the intention of getting the autograph of a famous jazz musician who was loved by his late father in New York. Though what he doesn't know is that Krakozhia's government has been overthrown, leading do a devastating civil war. This puts Head of CPB Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) in a difficult situation, as America no longer recognises Krakozhia as a country, voiding Victor's passport and cancelling his right to leave the airport doors. So Victor sets up home in the terminal, making money by returning baggage carts back to their holders for 25 cents a cart, and befriending the various oddballs and desperado's in the airport. He also meets flight attendant Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an emotionally unstable woman who is in a relationship with a married man. Despite Dixon's frequent attempts to thwart Victor's activities, Victor becomes extremely popular with the airport's inhabitants by performing various good deeds.If there is one thing that Spielberg's movies are frequently lambasted for, it is for their cloying sentimentality. Even his darkest output, such as Minority Report and Munich (2005) had their moments of emotional embraces to the sound of a string score that felt shoe-horned in. With The Terminal, Spielberg has gone all-out with the rom-com aesthetic. The result is a manipulating and almost fraudulent throw-back to the great Cary Grant films of the 1930's, capturing none of the magic of Spielberg's idols. Hanks is good value as always, but the character of Victor is almost offensive in it's stereotyping of the simple, almost idiotic foreigner.The collection of supporting characters don't fair much better either, with Dixon's Hitler-esque CPB man raising questions as to the reasons behind his hatred for Victor. Everyone else seems to like him, even his own men, so is he doing it for career progression? His own soon-to-be- retiring boss informs him that empathy and humanity are key to the job, and if Dixon needs to be told this, then how has he gotten as far as he has up to now? Zeta-Jones's Andrea at least puts a different spin on the familiar rom-com heroine, with her erratic behaviour and questionable decision-making at least adding a bit of dimension. The most impressive aspect of the film is actually the set, built from scratch after no airport agreed to allow Spielberg to film for such an extended amount of time, and this, if anything, adds a flow to the way the film is captured. But when the set is the best thing about a film, you know you're in trouble, and this is undoubtedly one of Spielberg's worst efforts.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",The Terminal
55,Dr_Coulardeau,This is a metaphor of security obsession,9,20 December 2006,"Steven Spielberg brings together a civil war in some Slavic country, a tourist from this country coming to John Fitzgerald Kennedy Airport on a private visit to New York City, a brand new security boss and an international diplomatic imbroglio that can last centuries if it is not taken care of by history. When a lawful government in a foreign country is ousted by an unlawful revolution and replaced by a fully illegal government that the US does not recognize, all flights from and to this foreign countries are banned in the US, and all citizens from this country have non-valid passports. If this happens to take place when one of these citizens is in the terminal of the airport before going through customs he can never get an entry-visa and is trapped in the airport for a long time. Imagine this situation and imagine the passenger is an enterprising but law abiding man and you can imagine too how he is going to find a place in the terminal, in the hearts of all the regular workers in that terminal including security officers, and even in some transient personnel like stewardesses or who knows what and whom. There we find out that this silly situation can become pathetic and even full of empathy and sympathy, even some compassion. One could live for a long long time in a terminal. But everything has to come to an end one day and it is even more difficult to bring the absurd situation to an end than to avoid it or solve it. At times it is funny. At times it is a deep satire of American security obsession. At times it is symbolical and metaphorical. But it is always extremely human and even humane. Even in such an artificial surrounding things can remain heartfelt and throbbingly moving.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",The Terminal
56,zkonedog,Great Idea + Great Hanks = Entertaining Film,7,27 February 2017,"Sometimes, a movie only needs a great idea and a great actor to be really, really good. ""The Terminal"" is an example of that kind of film making. There are a number of things that prevent ""The Terminal"" from being an all-time classic, but the performance from Tom Hanks and the ""guy trapped in an airport"" premise is enough to make for a very entertaining movie.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on Viktor Novorski (Hanks), who is trying to get from his home country of Krakosau into the United States (New York City, to be exact). On the international trip, however, Krakosau is over-run by rebels and no longer recognized by the U.S. government. As a result, Novorski cannot return home, nor can he legally enter America. He is ""trapped"" in the airport terminal, waiting for something to happen. Not helping matters is that airport director Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) has it out for Viktor. While patiently waiting for a resolution to his situation, Viktor meets a number of friends, including a potential romantic interest (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a woman he greets every day trying to get his status validated (Zoe Saldana), and a number of other airport workers who help him be as comfortable as possible in such a strange situation.""The Terminal"" is a charming movie mainly because you'll probably never watch a film quite like it. Under the able direction of Steven Spielberg, the movie succeeds in taking a ludicrous situation and making you care about a majority of the proceedings. Of course, it helps to have Hanks in the drivers seat of the leading role, as he turns in yet another performance that will make you think ""this can can play anything!"". Without his presence, this would be a forgettable experience.Unfortunately, ""The Terminal"" is completely and utterly unable to capture any romantic chemistry between the Hanks & Zeta-Jones characters. For whatever reason (likely because Zeta-Jones just simply isn't around enough), the emotional backbone of the movie fizzles. For me, this was enough to drop the experience an entire star rating. Had the romance angle been done better, it would have easily been five stars. As it was, there were just too many moments towards the end of the film where I was thinking ""I know I SHOULD be wrapped up in these emotions more, but..."" instead of just enjoying the experience.Overall, though, ""The Terminal"" is a quirky, entertaining little flick that really emphasizes the ""less is more"" philosophy of making a solid cinematic experience. In this case, all it took was a great idea and a great actor. With those components given to Mr. Spielberg, he was able to work his magic (sans a believable romance) with the rest.",The Terminal
57,johnnyboyz,A good film overall but still rather weak in a few places.,7,30 September 2004,"The Terminal is a good film that is funny, entertaining and deals with some good ol' fashioned drama situations. It felt very much like a documentary at times, maybe due to the fact it's based on a true story from the 1980's, but that didn't retract from the enjoyment factor. To say it's a story all about the trials and tribulations of just one man is perhaps a little too shallower way to sum it up but at certain times, you do wonder if the film's going anywhere. Such it is that the film DOES contain a few laughable moments adding to its comedy tag.These come at certain intervals and everything in-between is just 'filla'. So there are some good, comic moments but in my opinion, there aren't as many 'funny' parts to make you laugh all the way through. The film deals with 'slapstick' humour in parts such as slipping over a wet floor or walking into a window. It's those sort of moments that do sort of distract from the film slightly.Some of the stories within the film also feel generally annoying in the sense of the point of them being there. The film was supposed to be about one man (Hanks) I thought, NOT solely about anyone else and so I was rather surprised to see the little story about the food/cafeteria delivery worker attempting to get one of the other airport workers to fall in love with him. Things like that were flawed and distracted from the actual film. As I said before, that particular story line acted as a 'filla'; a way of upping the film length and it was disappointing.Hanks' acting is good and although his accent was terribly annoying early on, I managed to adjust accordingly and with stand it all the way through. The character 'Gupta' is also rather amusing; using the simple concept of forcing people to slip up on his own polished floor merely for his amusement was rather odd- odd but funny none-the-less. Zeta-Jones' character and performance was also 'tolerable'. She wasn't in the film much I didn't notice but it's a good feeling when you realize Hanks has someone to really relate to as you stat to feel as if your feeling sorry for Hanks if you get into it too much and the acting from Zeta- Jones is some relief at least.All in all I think you'll enjoy 'The Terminal' if you're the patient type. It's got a bit of humour, a bit of tragedy, a hint of romance and some moments where you'll really feel good for the characters as they finally get what they want after the last half an hour or so was probably built up to 'will it/they or won't it/they' not to mention the film itself on Hanks' struggle with staying in the airport.",The Terminal
58,filipemanuelneto,"Pure entertainment, but it could be better.",4,7 October 2016,"Anyone who has traveled by plane usually hates wait long at customs or passenger control, and can lose his composure with delays or baggage losses. In this case, the unfortunate passenger played by Tom Hanks will go through a bit of all that for having lost his own nationality, ending retained ""ad aeternum"" in New York airport terminal. Assuming that this film is a comedy with some romance, the idea is good, even if it seems little logic. Despite this promising start, the script ends up lost in trivialities and huge plot holes. One of the most egregious is the fact that Viktor, Tom Hanks' character, who hardly spoke a word of English, having learned so quickly the language. His story with Amelia (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) also does not fit in the rest of the film, so that is quickly cut with a simple and abrupt ending.Tom Hanks deserves, however, congratulations. He was again perfectly up to his work. His character could be just a caricature of any citizen of the former USSR countries, but he managed to give it a very kind and patient soul, who easily conquers the public. Zeta- Jones had less luck with her character, poorly planned and poorly embedded in the plot but, nevertheless, made a decent and satisfying work. Stanley Tucci makes a good villain in the person of airport immigration director, Frank Dixon.This film is pure entertainment, and it works very well in this light. But it could have been more intelligently developed in several aspects.",The Terminal
59,leplatypus,Zen & the art of Spielberg (DVD),7,26 December 2006,"Thanks for coach Phil Jackson to recommend this enlightening book from mr Pirsig ""Zen & the art of motorcycle maintenance"", whom ideas are brilliantly illustrated in that movie.First, it's about being stuck in life due to own value rigidity: Victor Navorsky can be seen in this way. As long as he wishes to enter America as an acceptable traveller, showing honesty to administration & compassion for his fellows, he is stuck in the airport terminal. The word ""terminal"" as ""end of everything"" is funny in that interpretation.It is also interesting that the character played by Tucci is also very rigid, and his fundamental keys are clearly explained: his passion is ""rules"" and Navorsky would be ""stuck"" in the terminal as long as he. The escape from this stuckness can be more flexibility, in fact doing ""what is good"". As Victor recognizes that the ultimate goal of his trip is the memory of his father, then his value evolves, and he can be free from his stuckness: He goes to New-York by breaking the law & leaving his friends in difficult situations.Second, Zen is an instant-to-instant practice: the scope is what you see in each moment & you have to deal with that to be happy. In this attitude, Victor excels: he uses every bit, every space of the terminal, and by doing this, he gains a lot of friends. In the opposite, pain is only the experience of not letting go what is lost. His last gaze to Amelia is a perfect reaction: he knows the relationship is sadly dead & accepts it: He gave to Amelia all his best but that wasn't enough for her. He understands that it is useless to add anything else, so he just stares at her.For all those reasons, movies are very helpful to offer advices, wisdom & reflexion to people who must face difficulties but without any family or friends presence. And Spielberg is one of the best filmmaker: his camera is alive (like the spy one at the terminal.. bzzz.. bzzzz) and he always assemble a great team: Tom Hanks (great in dubbing eastern accent & being open-minded), great theme from John Williams, all the world-wide casting & and extraordinary ordinary set of an airport terminal.A movie similar in spirit to ""Groundhog Day"" and as enjoyable A recommendation.",The Terminal
60,howard.schumann,"A playful, warm-hearted film",9,7 December 2004,"In Steven Spielberg's The Terminal, Tom Hanks is Victor Navorski, a citizen of the fictional republic of Krakozhia who has come to New York on a personal mission only to learn that his country is in the middle of a revolution and that America is ""closed"" to him. Based on the story of an Iranian who remained at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris for twelve years, The Terminal is not a complex and demanding film, nor does it contain hard-edged social commentary but it has humanity, humor, and a great performance by Tom Hanks. He is ""everyman"", the little guy contending against the dehumanizing institutions of our modern world and Hanks' great screen presence makes him someone we can believe in and root for.Viktor is a man without a country and must remain in the international transit lounge until things are resolved in Krakozhia and his nationality and visa status can be sorted out by rule-bound Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), JFK's Security Chief. While at the airport, he surrounds himself with an extended family of airport employees who, while wary at first, become eager to help. These include Gupta (Kumar Pallana), an Indian janitor who is paranoid about being deported, Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna), a food coordinator who is in love with agent Torres (Zoe Saldana), a burly baggage worker (Chi Mcbride), and a flight attendant named Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) whom he falls in love with. It is to her alone that he reveals the mystery behind the strange can of Planters Peanuts he carries around with him. At first unable to cope with the language and his confusing surroundings, Viktor gradually gets things under control. He creates a private bedroom in an unused part of the building that is under construction and earns money by collecting quarters from luggage rack. After taking it upon himself to plaster and paint a wall, he is hired by a construction crew to work at the airport earning $19 per hour, a sum which keeps him well supplied with Burger-King Whoppers. Navorski, destined to remain at the airport for an extended period of time, learns to slow down, develop patience, and become aware of what is happening around him. Yes, The Terminal has flaws. It is too long, too neatly packaged, and, given the state of homeland security paranoia, its credibility is stretched pretty far. Yet at the end I felt better about the world than I have for quite a while. Consider me a sentimentalist but The Terminal is the kind of playful warm-hearted film that I can enjoy over and over again without feeling guilty about its lack of significance.",The Terminal
61,matthewssilverhammer,Better Than You Remember...,7,3 October 2019,"Look, the romance is bad & takes up too much time. Otherwise, I can't help but feel like our universal disdain for this breezy, inspirational dramedy upon initial release was largely because of its proximity to 9/11. Now it serves as a fascinating mirror to our current ""crisis"", keeping people we consider ""unacceptable"" prisoner while we decide what to do with them. Sure, its charm often dips its toe into cheese, but Hanks is so winning, funny, & empathetic, it's hard to deny the film's core humanity.",The Terminal
62,Anonymous_Maxine,America is closed.,10,24 June 2004,"When I first saw the theatrical trailer for The Terminal recently, I was initially worried about the fact that Tom Hanks takes on such a heavy accent, since his character is from Krakozia (sp?) and speaks only a few words of English. This is not, in my opinion, necessarily one of the hardest things for an actor to accomplish (because I think a lot of the road to success is paved by the audience's ability to believe an actor with a new accent), but rather one of the hardest things for an audience to accept. A well known actor taking on a different accent or, in this case, a completely different nationality and language, tends to call attention to the man or woman on screen talking so differently from how we are used to hearing them. Tom Hanks, nevertheless, pulls it off flawlessly, once again demonstrating the sheer vastness of his screen presence and acting skill.
Spielberg once again delivers an immensely moving story about a man trying to get home, a theme that he clearly loves, since just about every movie he's ever made boils down to that theme. The reverberations and reflections of the things that are going on in the world today are impossible to miss, which is why it shocked me to read one reviewer on the IMDb refer to The Terminal as a light-hearted romp. Yes, it's a lot of fun, it's amusing, endearing and charming, but it's also extremely powerful in a very serious way. It features the second most direct and blatant impersonation of government officials working in America today, second only to the replica of Dick Cheney in The Day After Tomorrow. Stanley Tucci plays the part of an customs and immigration official, whose charge to look after national security matters at a major airport disquietingly echoes much of what is going on in America today. The little American flag that he always wears on his lapel is far too similar, in size, shape, and location, to the one that George W. Bush always wears to possibly be a coincidence.The story is remarkably simple. Tom Hanks plays the part of Viktor Navorski, a man who has traveled to New York for reasons that are revealed near the end of the movie, and while he is on the plane to New York, his country falls into a military coup and basically ceases to exist, leaving Viktor without a country and without a valid passport, and thus nowhere to go but the terminal. He can't set foot in America and he can't go back to his country until it establishes a government recognized by America. He is a perfectly innocent illegal alien who has fallen through a loophole in what is meant to be the most sophisticated national security system in the world. And since I live here, I like to think that it really is.The movie walks a very fine line between sadness and comedy, since Viktor's hardships tug the heartstrings so much but the movie itself is so funny, and these two emotions are woven together to create an unusually strong bond with the character who, like Chuck Noland in Cast Away, is basically stuck on a deserted island and left to his own resources to survive. Chuck Noland had to literally live off the land for years, Viktor Navorski now has to survive in an isolated location, surrounded by capitalism, indifferent Americans in a hurry to catch their flight or get home, and a bureaucracy that increasingly wishes he would just disappear. As Viktor proves to be capable of following the rules that were laid out for him (and in a language that he could hardly understand), Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) grows increasingly impatient, which leads to the most biting criticism that the movie makes of the way the American government handles the maintenance of national security at our airports and, presumably, beyond. Viktor is stuck in a terrible situation, and Dixon does little to make it easy on him. He explains to him that he can't leave the airport until further notice, and then forgets about him until it turns out that he is doing exactly what he is told. Here you have a national security officer who is faced with a timid and exceedingly polite foreigner who he can't allow to step onto American soil, and because he is obeying all the rules set out for him, Dixon doesn't have a clue in the moon what to do.From this point on, Dixon does everything from explaining to Viktor that for a specific five minutes, a specific door into America will be left completely unguarded and available for easy escape to planning to basically pass him on someone else. Release him, but just enough so that someone else will catch him and then he'll be someone else's problem. Dixon can't arrest him unless he breaks some law, and Viktor is apparently entirely unwilling to break any law, even to pass into America unlawfully when the man in charge of the airport's security has instructed him to do so.While living in the terminal, Viktor sets up his own little living space in an area of the airport that is under construction, and he gradually becomes known throughout the airport. There is a particular scene involving a Russian man who needs to take medicine to his dying father, but Dixon insists that the prescription drugs must remain in America until the proper red tape can be processed, and Viktor diffuses the situation in a tense scene which makes him a hero throughout the entire airport. How everyone heard about it I'm not entirely sure.There are also numerous smaller stories that take place as a result of Viktor being stuck in the airport. Catherine Zeta-Jones passes through the movie on a wispy strand of a plot involving a flight attendant who is having an emotionally destructive relationship with a married man, and as she and Viktor grow closer and closer together, although not quite close enough for a whole date, she goes back to the married man that has been causing her all kinds of pain, disappearing into his arms and out of the movie. There is a charming Indian janitor named Gupta, who is unable to go back to his country for reasons that are slightly hinted at by the extent of the pleasure he gets from seeing people take nasty spills from walking across his wet floors. Then there is a food services employee who befriends Viktor in hopes that he can help him to win the heart of one of the women working at the immigration office, which seems to be the story put in to balance out the ones involving Catherine Zeta-Jones and Gupta, who suffers a rather unfortunate fate that is never shown.The Terminal is a simple story that moves along quickly and efficiently because the script and Hanks' acting make us care so much about the character of Viktor Navorski that we really want to see how his story pans out, we really want everything to work out for him, even if some laws have to be broken along the way. Spielberg has been accused of being sappy many times, and if he is guilty of it in this movie, it is because of things like the portion of the movie that explains why Navorski was in America in the first place, but only because something that moving is not necessary in order for the audience to care enough about Viktor for the movie to be effective. Viktor had us at `Krakozia!'",The Terminal
63,Vartiainen,"Heartwarming, kooky, touching",8,2 January 2016,"Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) is a citizen of Krakozhia, an obscure non-existent Eastern European country, who arrives at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in order to visit New York City. Unfortunately his country has experienced a revolution while his plane was in the air and has promptly revoked all travelling licenses. Including Navorki's. So, they cannot allow him to enter United States proper, but neither can they send him back, because technically he hasn't been recognized as a citizen of the new Krakozhia. So he has to stay at the airport, indefinitely.Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have always been a fantastic team and this just might be my favourite film from the two of them. Spielberg's flair for entertainment and intrigue is in full blast. The airport is riddled with personalities and as most of the film is spent with Navorski simply wandering around and interacting with them, it makes sense that they should be the focus of the film. Well, they are and they work wonderfully. I especially like Stanley Tucci's Frank Dixon, the head of the airport, who gets far more than he bargained for in Viktor and is slowly driven to the brink of insanity because of this one man. The film might also be Catherine Zeta-Jones's finest work.But it's Tom Hanks's performance that shines the brightest in this film. Sure his pseudo-Slavic accent is hokey, sure it makes no sense that he doesn't just leave the airport and claim asylum, sure there are a whole bunch of other small things that don't really add up. It's not a very realistic film - though it is inspired by real-life events - but rather a film that pulls you into a story, an experience, an adventure. And in the middle of all that is Hanks, living through it with sad eyes and a solemn face, which every now and then lights up with joy and discovery.If you like Spielberg or Hanks you're going to like this film. If you like them both, you're going to love it.",The Terminal

65,jtindahouse,Really good feel-good film!!!,8,12 January 2006,Tom Hanks truly is a genius when it comes to acting. This movie just once again proving to us he really can manage anything. The movie itself is pretty decent but let's itself down with a pathetic marriage midway through which just gives the impression they're trying a little too hard to make it a feel-good. The issue of misunderstanding of language can be really funny and I would expect to see it used more after the success of this film.If you're into feel-goods but you're a little bit old for the Home Alone type then this is probably just the one for you. If you're not big on the whole humor thing and you'd rather see Bruce Willis blowing baddies to bits then I'd take a punt that this movie isn't for you.,The Terminal
66,ianlouisiana,"""A Great Day in Harlem"" echoes half a century on.......................",8,8 March 2011,"The back story - if you like - of ""The Terminal"" is rather less celebrated than the ""Man without a country"" type plot that has been well - covered by writers on this site. Back in 1958,""Esquire"" magazine commissioned Art Kane to take photographs for a special Jazz edition.It was his idea to get together all the top jazz musicians who were in New York on the actual day of the photograph and picture them outside a Harlem Brownstone. The resultant portrait became one of the most iconic of all jazz photos and was the subject - 30 years later - of a TV programme known as ""A Great Day in Harlem"". Victor Navorski (Mr T.Hanks) had flown to New York To complete his late father's collection of autographs from all the musicians shown in Kane's photograph.That collection was in the tin of peanuts he guarded so fiercely. Saxophonist/composer/educator Mr Benny Golson was leading a quartet at a New York hotel.His was the last signature Victor needed. JFK's crystal - like appearance resembles Superman's Fortress of Solitude as our hero refines his game plan,righting wrongs,uniting star - crossed lovers and jumping over tall buildings in his spare time. Despite the worst efforts of the Lex Luthor - like Mr S.Tucci,Victor is able to escape from his glass prison and meet Mr Golson. He then returns to Krypton where no doubt everyone is as compassionate,honest,multi - talented,decent and forgiving as he. Mr Hanks is really very good in this movie.Not,as some have suggested,patronising or even racist.

67,PWNYCNY,Perhaps Tom Hanks' worst movie.,3,2 July 2011,"What an incredibly bad movie. This could be Tom Hanks' worst movie. Everything aspect about the story was contrived. Tom Hanks' performance was contrived. The whole premise of the movie was contrived. The idea of anyone being stuck at an airport and then living there is completely implausible; no way could that happen. Literary license can stretch just so far and in this movie it went way beyond what the rubber band can bear. Every character in this movie was uninteresting, most uninteresting being the drub played by Tom Hanks. His character has to be one of the dumbest Hollywood contrivances in cinematic history. The character is part stupid, part clueless, part hapless and completely unlikable. This movie should have been over the moment his application for a visa was denied. That itself would have been a red flag for airport personnel. That Tom Hanks' gives a sloppy performance can be forgiven. After all, he was working with substandard material. But that a production company actually felt this was a movie worth making is sad. People get stuck at airports all the time; it's one of the drawbacks of traveling. Planes are late, delays occur, bad weather, unanticipated events, but NO ONE ever actually lives in an airport, no matter how egregious the situation, except a man named Victor in a movie called The Terminal.",The Terminal
68,ackstasis,"""I've been waiting my whole life""",7,20 March 2008,"I know that it's a blatantly-absurd contradiction, but I've always regarded Steven Spielberg, despite his incredible critical and commercial success, as a monumentally underestimated director. Many critics tend to regard him as something of a lesser filmmaker, adequate for immaterial mass entertainment, but relatively useless for anything that comes even close to approaching true art. As you no doubt have guessed, I take the completely opposite viewpoint, regarding him as one of the finest directors that Hollywood has to offer; one who, despite his occasional preference towards sentimentality, knows precisely what he wants in a movie, and constructs it in a way that is both technically admirable and unashamedly entertaining. 'The Terminal (2004),' likewise, is one of the Spielberg's most under-appreciated outings, an intensely-enjoyable, and occasionally whimsical, lighthearted comedy that is nonetheless able to pack an emotional punch when required. Filled with a likable cast of characters, and an atypical romantic hero in Tom Hanks' Krakozhian traveller, this is the sort of film that you can simply sit to watch and allow your daily problems to dissipate into the open air.If you were to choose any A-list Hollywood actor to portray a Russian tourist with little command in English, then I predict that Tom Hanks, despite his talent and multiple Oscars, would appear near the bottom of your list of potential candidates. However, not only does the character of Viktor Navorski work, but his personality is so intensely likable that he's one of Hanks' most entertaining creations. Hopelessly lost in an immense airport lounge, with no idea why he's even being detained there, Viktor wanders aimlessly throughout the hustle-and-bustle of the arriving and departing passengers, necessarily developing a haphazard, ad hoc existence for himself, making both friends and enemies along the way. Though Viktor's poor knowledge of English paints the deceptive impression of a dim mind, as his linguistic skills slowly develop, a vibrant personality begins to shine through his initially comical exterior, and a man of admirable humility and sincerity reveals himself. Catherine Zeta-Jones lights up the screen as Amelia Warren, a beautiful flight attendant who falls for Viktor, despite her obsessive compulsion towards wealthy married men who hold no future for her.The opening act of 'The Terminal' does an impressive job of accentuating the difficulties that arise when a foreign traveller becomes ""lost in translation."" Viktor's initial meeting with airport manager Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) is a hopelessly impossible conversation in which no meaningful understanding is reached by either party. When Viktor finally realises that a revolution has unfolded in his home country, his anguish at not being able to understand the full details is tragic and heartbreaking, especially when his cries for assistance fall on deaf ears. An incredible backwards crane shot, zooming out from Viktor's frantic form to reveal the vast expanse of JFK airport, is perhaps a visual reference to a similar shot in Fred Zinneman's 'High Noon (1952).' Whereas the latter demonstrates the haunting solidarity of Gary Cooper's character, Spielberg's shot shows Viktor equally alone and abandoned, surrounded by crowds of self-interested travellers who might as well be non-existent. Though Spielberg occasionally veers towards sentimentality, 'The Terminal' is an entertaining and thoughtful comedy/drama; sometimes the simple stories are the ones we find most refreshing.",The Terminal

(Given this shaky premise, it could easily have turned into a movie with too many so-so gags that play on the plight of foreign travelers.)""The Terminal"" plays on a note unlike many of Steven Spielberg's previous comedic efforts, a note that's actually quite funny. Spielberg, who also directed Hanks two years ago in ""Catch Me If You Can,"" reuses some of the conventional comedic elements that were present in that movie.Spielberg, like Hanks, seems casual and takes an Everyman approach to his material (which is somewhat sensitive, pending on your ideological bent about U.S. national security) in guiding his actors along this interesting ride through an airport terminal.Tom Hanks is at an all-time great here (with a perfect Bulgarian accent too), playing the stranger in a strange land to perfection, and the thing about it is, he's not even really trying.One sequence that I found to be particularly funny, is when Viktor returns airport baggage carts to the machines for quarters, and uses the change to pay for food and books.

It's got the seed of an interesting story, and no shortage of talent to see it through, but fails to click in even the most remote sense. It's baffling to me that it's Spielberg in the director's chair here, because The Terminal is so bland, run-of-the-mill and pandering that it feels like the work of a tentative first-timer who's terrified to let the material breathe. The entire cast is painted with the broadest of strokes, from Hanks's childish, confused stranger in a strange land to Stanley Tucci's ridiculously scheming US Customs official, and I quickly grew tired of their telegraphed games.

71,Chris_Docker,"Quirky, but eminently entertaining if you allow it to be . . .",8,6 October 2004,"The Terminal 8/10This is a movie you'll love or errr . . . feel left a bit cold by - so maybe a few notes to help you decide which . . . ?The story is of a man stranded at an airport, his papers invalid for entry or exit, and ending up living there for a while (all this is based on a true story). The difficulty is getting a handle on it. Is it serious drama? Light romantic comedy? Deliberate slapstick? Is it meant to be realistic or not? If these questions are likely to plague you and make you unable to settle and enjoy The Terminal, it's maybe not the movie for you. On the other hand, imagine it was a musical - you'd have all these elements and no-one would really care. Perhaps the film would have been more successful as a musical even - as audiences we have a happy acceptance that includes a very wide suspension of disbelief when the people we are watching suddenly feel the need to break into song and dance - we are there to be entertained after all; and if you avoid pigeon-holing the film you might find it a very enjoyable experience indeed.Tom Hanks is superbly cast in the lead role. His home country (somewhere in Eastern Europe probably) has undergone a coup whilst he has been in flight. Consequently all documentation (visas, passports) from the country have been suspended - his papers are not valid for entry to the USA and neither can he be forcibly sent home. The puzzlement and isolation of a man who speaks little or no English and has no idea what is happening to him is poignantly portrayed. But rather than lead us into consideration of serious issues that might be raised, director Steven Spielberg drops to a minor key to develop a romantic comedy between Hanks and air-hostess Catherine Zeta-Jones. As an audience we have to let go of the desire to see it as a serious drama and just have fun, though with serious issues in the background. Spielberg, not my favourite director, almost redeems himself from his habitually apologetic political correctness over an incident involving a Russian (Where Hanks is brought in as a translator) who is trying to bring medicines in for his dying parent without proper paperwork. Realising that no paperwork is needed if the medicines are needed for veterinary purposes, Hanks feigns a mistranslation to get the Russian to say they are for his goat. In the face the heartless chief of security, it looks like a swipe at bureaucracy, suggesting the system cares more about goats than people - but this is quickly dispelled when another staff person says that America is after all, built on compassion.The original story is much closer to home - an Iranian refugee, Merhan Nasseri, landed at Charles de Gaulle Airport France in 1988 after being denied entry into the UK because his passport and United Nations refugee card had been stolen. He was not allowed into France and he did not want to return to Iran (his home country) - he was fleeing as a political refugee. He ended up living in Terminal One of the airport for more than 16 years. (He's now been granted permission to either enter France or return to his own country but he instead chooses to carry on living in the terminal. The film is professionally made, deftly crafting schmaltz with top acting, and a theme that, if not original, at least hasn't been done to death. It's unusualness is probably its biggest downfall - it wants to be mainstream but doesn't conveniently fit into a category. It also goes on for rather a long time - at over two hours there creeps in a feeling that you've been stranded watching his (however interesting) plight long enough and it's about time he got the girl and went out to celebrate. Personally I didn't get bored - only a little sad - not just from the soppy tear-jerker aspects - but from the feeling that more people should enjoy this movie than probably will let themselves.",The Terminal

The scenes pertaining to the airport is beautifully shot.Overall a light hearted fun movie to watch which also impresses. Must watch",The Terminal
75,juneebuggy,"A charming, simple movie that I can't say anything bad about",8,13 February 2015,"The Terminal is charming, feel-good and sweet, directed by Stephen Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks so really, how can you go wrong? I definitely enjoyed this, it wasn't perfect and won't leave any lasting impressions but its one of those movies that just makes you feel good. The entire story takes place in JFK airport (which I understand is actually a set) surrounding Eastern European traveller Viktor Navorski. Just as Viktor arrives in New York his country enters into a civil war and his visa is cancelled leaving him stranded in the airport. With limited English Victor manages to survive what becomes months in the arrivals lounge. Gaining employment, friends and even entering into a brief romance.Tom Hanks of course does a great job playing Viktor, his accent is addictive and he is a simple, sweet man. Personally I would have liked a bit more background on his life before JFK but for whatever reason his character is left vague and never fully developed. What really makes this movie though is not so much Hanks or Viktor but all the people he meets and becomes involved with while in the airport.The secondary characters here are fantastic; Stanley Tucci as the airport boss and bad guy -love to hate him, the baggage handlers (Chi McBride) & (Diego Luna) and (Zoë Saldana) as an immigration official. And wow did I ever fall in love with grumpy, paranoid, wet floor watching, plate spinning janitor Gupta Raja (Kumar Pallana), he stole every scene he was in.Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the love interest, she's a flight attendant who Narvorski tries to have a thing with but she's all tied up with a married man. I liked that they kept the romance as a side story and didn't turn this into a straight out romance.All in a pretty fantastic little movie that kept my interest, gave me some laughs and left me feeling good. 12/16/14",The Terminal
76,davispittman,A classic in my book,9,16 February 2018,"The Terminal is a classic film, a very unique one. I say that it is unique because I truly can't think of a another film like it. The plot revolves around Tom Hanks's character, a foreign man traveling from a country that is in ruins and now he cannot go back to his country because it no longer exists, but the airport can't let him go into America either, so he has no choice but to stay in the terminal. Stanley Tucci plays the man working at the airport who is basically in charge. He quickly becomes the antagonist in the film, and he plays that role well, Tucci has flexed his acting muscle in other great movies such as Devil wears prada, Julie and Julia, and more, and this one is no exception. Hanks ofcourse shines in the lead role, as he always does, I remember being amazed at the accent and how great he nails it, I also love how he portrayed Victor, his character. Hanks plays Victor with a lovability that's just undeniable. That lovability is crucial for this character, it must be expressed through him in order for the entire film to work in the way it's supposed to be. Then there's Catherine Zeta Jones. I absolutely love her and her character in this film. She plays a fight attendant that frequently comes to the airport that Victor is at, and he develops feelings for her. They have great chemistry together and I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen when they are together. Theirs isn't a grand epic love story, but it's a very sweet endearing one, and it works perfectly for the movie. The writing really is great and I love it has some comedy and sweet, touching moments. It's very balanced, and it makes for a great film.",The Terminal
77,slokes,"America, America",5,25 February 2007,"""The Terminal"" is the kind of film a director can make only when he owns the studio. A small-scale single-person story about waiting in an airport featuring big stars on a giant set, it is neither the best nor worst film Steven Spielberg ever made, but interesting despite its flaws.Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a citizen of the fictional central European republic of Krakhosia who finds himself stuck at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City when a civil war breaks out back home, effectively stranding him at the airport itself. There he makes do as best he can.""You have no legal right to enter the United States, and I have no legal right to detain you,"" explains the head of JFK's security force (Stanley Tucci). ""It seems you have fallen through a small crack in the system.""Tucci plays the film's heavy, one of several key elements of the film that doesn't really work. Yet this is not a bad Spielberg film like ""1941"" or ""The Lost World."" ""The Terminal"" at its best showcases Hanks' engagingly odd Latka-esquire character and Spielberg's bold attempt at melding French New Wave to Bill Forsyth at his early-80s whimsical peak. Even when the film veers into a logic-defying romance subplot between Hanks and an adulterous flight attendant played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, it never entirely loses you, and there are nice moments throughout that show why, even when operating at less than full steam, Spielberg is the greatest filmmaker of his kind since Frank Capra. He excels at pushing buttons his audience doesn't even know are there.I first saw this movie in a theater with a woman from Russia, who found the film much funnier than I did. An immigrant herself, I think she responded to Navorski as a doughty representative of the immigrant spirit of American culture though no immigrant himself (he plans to return to Krakhosia eventually.) As Navorski sets to work carving a life in the airport terminal, he wins support from a veritable melting pot of ethnic and racial types who find common cause in his welfare.There are some virtuoso moments from Spielberg, like a long crane shot that pulls to reveal Navorski as the small cog he is at JFK, but for the most part he keeps things simple. The script overplays its hand throughout, however. Navorski isn't just well-regarded by the airport workers; they stick photocopies of his handprint at their work stations and follow him like the Pied Piper as he walks to the front gate. Tucci's Frank Dixon comes unglued as he is lectured by a superior about learning from Navorski. The romance with the flight attendant drowns under a sea of artificial dialogue.The ending is rather weak, too. Though it references a cool bit of real cultural history, discovering the reason behind Navorski's visit doesn't really pay off for the story.Yet I'm a sucker for any film set in New York that references Tony Randall, Yeoman Rand, and ""Strangers In The Night,"" and finds the value and comedy of life even when stuck in an airport. ""The Terminal"" doesn't hold your attention like classic Spielberg, but it does reward it now and then.",The Terminal
78,MrFilmAndTelevisionShow,The Terminal,10,16 July 2021,"I consider this another Tom Hanks classic, I once saw this on a list of about 50 something Tom Hanks film, right at the bottom, I mean what! There was no flaws that I could find with this film, I don't often gives films a ten, but this is one that deserves it. The plot was gripping, the comedy was hilarious and didn't once fall flat. Everything about it was great. Tragically low IMDb score for some reason.",The Terminal
79,caspian1978,Modern Times / City Lights,6,18 March 2005,"This is one of those Spielberg films that are terrific but are not treated as so. Tom Hanks stars again in another Spielberg film. Once again Hanks gives an excellent performance. Pointing the finger at airlines, government, American is a post 991 world and humanity, The Terminal is too excellent to be treated as so. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Stanley Tucci also give great performances. Tucci showcases a true evil that can be seen in today's society. Although he is not the ""bad"" guy like most monsters in horror movies, Tucci is the force that keeps the hero from winning the day. Zeta-Jones does a great job reminding the audience that she is beautiful. Still, she adds to the story and helps bring out the best in Tom Hanks. It was interesting that in many ways, Tom Hanks plays Viktor like Charlie Chaplin. In many scenes, we see the Tramp in his walk. The people around him treat him as the wandering Tramp that by the end of the movie makes his mark on us all.",The Terminal
80,ShootingShark,"Sly, Charming, Highly Original Drama Of Stateless Man Waiting Indefinitely At An Airport",7,1 January 2008,"Viktor Navorski is a traveller from the obscure country of Krakozhia who arrives at JFK airport just as his homeland suffers a military coup and the US cuts all ties. Under law his passport is confiscated and he must stay in the airport building or risk arrest as an illegal immigrant. Viktor decides he will obey the rules and remain inside the terminal, but is determined to make the most of his enforced prisoner status.This is a typically brilliant, good-natured, engrossing character study by Spielberg, in his most playful Capra-esquire mood. Like Empire Of The Sun or Always, it takes a man in an extreme oddball situation who takes it on the chin and uses his resourcefulness, humour and compassion to help himself and others. Hanks is wonderful as Navorski, starting off as a bewildered schmoe who doesn't understand any English, panics at the news footage of his country's predicament, starts to adapt to his situation and make friends with some of the more lowly airport staff, and ultimately becomes a sort of minor rebel hero. He is well matched by Tucci as Dixon, the stickler-for-the-rules security manager who simply wants Navorksi to go away and be someone else's problem but won't consider lifting a finger to help him, and the supporting cast are a great collection of oddballs, particularly McBride, Pallana and Saldana. As ever, Spielberg's style is both delightful and effortless, aided by his regular cameraman Janusz Kaminski's dynamic, flowing photography, which glides round the airport's hectic daytime scenes and is quietly intense as Navorski spends his evenings sleeping in an unfinished corridor. The movie's big theme is that everyone is waiting for something - the only difference with Viktor is that it's more obvious, and the comparisons with Dixon are subtle and charming. There were some things I didn't like - the Zeta-Jones character is a bit boring and goes nowhere, the product placement is off-putting and the McGuffin with Navorski's tin of beans is perhaps a bit too typically sweet Spielberg fluff. These moments hardly matter though in such a fine character piece, with some terrific performances and an inspiring timeless direction. Extremely well written by Sacha Gervasi (The Big Tease), Jeff Nathanson (Catch Me If You Can) and Andrew Niccol (Gattaca), with an incredibly impressive main set by Alex McDowell built in an aircraft hanger in a small regional airport in California. This is a feelgood movie for sure, but an extremely well made one by one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.",The Terminal
81,dierregi,Contrived and over-sentimental,3,11 July 2017,"I watched this on TV some years ago and did not like it. A few nights ago it was on again and I decided to give it another chance. Hanks plays Viktor, coming to America from a fictional Eastern European country and finding himself stranded at the airport.A revolution erupted in his country and his passport is confiscated. Instead of being deported or arrested and because of the maniacal behavior of the airport security supervisor, Viktor finds himself living in the terminal.Hanks plays Viktor with a heavy accent and mannerism, but does not manage to make his character sympathetic. An eccentric who does not want to divulge the reason for his journey, Viktor finds support from airport workers and gets mixed in their life. He also manages to carry on a very unlikely love story with beautiful flight attendant Amelia (Zeta-Jones), but the love story feels contrived at best.My idea of airport terminals is that they are the quintessential passing-through area. My idea of nightmare would be to be stuck in one, so for me it is impossible to understand why Viktor decides to stay rather than taking his chances by getting out. This is linked to the reason of this journey, but it is also very contrived.Claustrophobic, pointless and annoying, especially when we finally get the revelation of Viktor's purpose in New York – yet another over-sentimental cliché from Spielberg.",The Terminal
82,rbverhoef,Delightful Spielberg comedy,8,10 February 2005,"If there is one director who can lift simple entertainment up to a level most directors only dream of it is Steven Spielberg. The best examples are probably 'Jaws', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' and 'Minority Report', working with genres like horror, adventure and science-fiction that show events normally not seen in normal life. 'Catch Me If You Can' is a perfect example of a film about human lives that could go wrong in many places with a lesser director, but never does. 'The Terminal' has the same quality. Both films are based on true but unbelievable stories. A lot of films based on true stories go terribly wrong anyway, not with Spielberg.Tom Hanks, one of those actors with also the ability to make things better than they normally are, plays Viktor Navorski, a man from a fictional country arriving on JFK Airport. While he was in the air a coup was committed in his country and therefore the new government is not recognized and accepted by the US, therefore Viktor's country basically does not exist. That brings a little problem, his passport is not valid so he can not enter the US. Of course going back to a country that does not exist is quite impossible as well. Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), the customs official, tells him to stay in the International Arrivals Lounge until he is beeped and told what to do. Dixon is hoping he will leave and try to enter the US anyway so it is no longer his problem, but good guy Viktor obeys.A solution to this problem is not easily found, apparently, so Viktor lives in the Lounge for a long time. In this time he befriends people, even starts loving a flight attendant named Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The Dixon character becomes the villain, sort of, although Spielberg makes him a real character with real grounds on which his actions are based on. Tucci finds the perfect note for this characters. There are some subplots, mainly to support Viktor's story, but they are handled with care. One of them in particular has to do with the guy who arranges the food for the planes, Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna). He loves the girl who rejects Viktor's request for entering the US every single day (played by Zoë Saldana) and makes a deal with Viktor. He gives Viktor food, Viktor contacts the girl and learns things about her. Of course these scenes are probably there to provide funny moments for Hanks, who plays his Viktor close to perfect, but the scenes never feel like that. They just play like they belong in this story and they happen to be funny.All the little stories are played the way they should. Even the Zeta-Jones plot, one that seems obvious in what direction it will go, is handled in such a perfect way you keep wondering what will happen. That Spielberg is a good director and Hanks a good actor is a given. Here they prove it once again in a delightful comedy that plays, another impressive fact, on a very large set that looks perfectly like an airport. Yes, really delightful with a lovable leading character and a lot of lovable supporting characters in a feel-good story for everyone to enjoy, which is occasionally very funny as well.",The Terminal

84,triple8,Hanks and Spielberg do it again-another winner!,10,5 July 2004,"I've seen some really good movies in 2004 but so far, this maybe the best. The Terminal is an incredible fairy tale of a movie-it's quietly captivating, rich in interesting colorful characters and superbly acted and directed.Tom Hanks as Victor Navorsky is quite simply entrancing to watch. He is an amazing character actor and in The Terminal he again creates a character who is instantly embraceable. You care about Victor and want things to turn out OK for him as much as his friends in the Terminal do.This is a movie that actually got some bad reviews and I'm baffled by why. Although, I usually can see flaws in even the movies I think are 8's and 9's there isn't much to be critical of here. Some people have said it's to ""feel good"". That it's lacking in reality. I don't necessarily see those as negatives, there are many good movies that are feel good or unrealistic, just as there are some bad ones. The Terminal has a lot that's likable about it. Firstly, there's Hanks himself and I will admit if any other actor had played Victor it might not be the movie it is, Hanks is simply amazing, you forget who he is within the first five minutes. I won't mention everyone by name, but the rich array of supporting actors/actresses were all good as well. It is an unusual movie that really isn't either a straight comedy OR a straight drama-it perhaps falls through the cracks of genres but I'd call this mostly a heartwarming and completely absorbing character study of one man's attempt to make a life for himself in an airport terminal. It's a very different type of movie-for all the strategically placed product adds, there's something quietly uncommercial about Terminal and watching it is an interesting experience. The movie is about 2 hours and you get a lot in those two hours. For me what was striking was how genuinely interesting this movie turned out to be. I'm one who finds airport terminals fascinating anyway-all the hundreds of and thousands of people rushing about to hop on a plane and start some new adventure....but to actually live in a terminal-an interesting (and rather strange) concept-Hanks acting here is quiet and understated and at a level surpassing merely ""talented"". He manages to make nibbling a cracker fascinating. I would give this a 10 of 10 and know there are many who may think it's not for them but I found this movie to be a beautiful fairytale of a picture and hope at least Hanks gets an Oscar nod. I also hope that skeptics give this movie a chance-as good a movie as any Hanks film I've ever seen. 10 of 10.",The Terminal
85,Seraphion,A touching story in a funny way,8,11 September 2014,"This movie's opening is quite slow, introducing the environment and the general rules within it. It doesn't wait long and the main character and conflict is introduced very nicely with all the technical jargon in the dialog making it heavy and looking serious. But slowly the story builds on itself well, depending on the elements of Viktor's hardworking nature and lucky encounters. The side conflicts really help the movie builds up until it reaches its finale conflict. The funny little things is what I like from this movie. The comedic moments don't come from any jokes or dialog punch lines commonly found on comedy movies. It's rather made up from all those little things depicted being done by someone with a culture gap and thus also has some degree of culture shock. The acting side is really nice. Tom Hanks can really get into character portraying the man stuck in a hard situation but refusing to break from his nature and code. Stanley Tucci gives the antagonist in his not such hostile role a nice touch, keeping his well known knack for the bad guy roles but still maintaining the approachable presentation. Catherine Zeta Jones also give quite a nice performance in doing the romantic sweetener part.",The Terminal
86,ctomvelu1,Amazing,8,3 July 2011,"A charming throwback to the Frank Capra era of filmmaking. Tom Hanks plays an eastern European come to visit New York only to find himself detained at the airport's international terminal as his country's government is toppled by civil war and he has lost his citizenship. He lives in the terminal, and finds various ways to feed himself. He speaks some English and eventually learns more by studying magazines and watching television. He also makes friends with various airport characters, including a janitor and a stewardess. The plot is based on a true incident that I suspect was much less charming and endearing in real life. The script is pure, delicious fantasy. Hanks is brilliant and thoroughly believable as the baffled but resourceful immigrant while Stanley Tucci as the airport's security chief does wonders with what could easily have been a one-dimensional role. Director Spielberg no doubt played a role in keeping everything on track. Highly recommended, especially to those who loved the not-dissimilar ""Moscow on the Hudson"" with Robin Williams. By the way, the sets are absolutely amazing. I assumed the movie was filmed in a real airport terminal until I read here that the whole thing was shot on sets built in an old hangar.",The Terminal
87,rosscinema,Interesting premise is handled amiably,7,5 July 2004,"This is loosely based on a real event and it makes for a fascinating story but even though I do recommend this film there are several things that just don't work. Story takes place at the JFK Airport in New York City where Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) has his passport taken away after his country Krakozhia is involved in a civil war and the United States fails to recognize it. This means that Viktor is allowed to stay in the terminal until things get better in his country but he is not allowed to set foot outside the terminal doors. Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) is the new security chief and doesn't know what to do with him and slowly he gets irritated by Viktor's dilemma. Viktor roams the terminal and gets to know everyone that work in all the businesses and meets a stewardess named Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is dating a married man.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Viktor helps a baggage handler romance INS Officer Torres (Zoe Saldana) and becomes friendly with the head janitor Gupta Rajan (Kumar Pallana). He also starts a flirtatious relationship with Amelia until she finds out what his real situation is and she becomes disenchanted by men in general. Frank keeps asking people what is in the peanut can that Viktor carries with him and eventually it is learned that he is trying to get the autograph of jazz artist Benny Golson.Steven Spielberg can be both praised and blamed for this film and it does possess both the best and worst of his talents. The cinematography is by the great Janusz Kaminski who not only supplies the shots of the terminal but makes the audience believe that this is actually someone's home, which it has become. Spielberg had the set of the terminal built on a sound stage by Alex McDowell and it's one of the most impressive things about the film. Hanks while not completely believable does give a good performance and even when he doesn't do much in a scene you can't take your eyes off of him. If that's not star power than I don't know what is! The best thing about this film is watching how Hanks character manages to survive living in a terminal and this part of the story is fascinating to watch. Also, there is a very good performance by Pallana as the janitor who makes the best of a rather small and quiet role. But there are several things that just don't work in this film and one is the so-called romance with Zeta-Jones who in reality would not give Viktor a second look. Also, the romance with the baggage handler and Saldana is completely unbelievable and are we really suppose to buy the fact that a hot chick like Saldana would be a Trekkie? And then they get married in the terminal? The script lays the sentiment on pretty thick as we learn about Viktor's peanut can and that he's in America for his dead father. Tucci's character could have been a much more interesting but the script just wants him to add the adversity for the film. The film ends with no emotional payoff but I still do recommend this effort by one of the great filmmakers in history and starring one our finest actors. It could have been a much more fascinating film but what we do get is more than enough.",The Terminal
88,Galina_movie_fan,Enjoyable and Uplifting Fantasy,7,3 October 2005,"I did not want to watch this movie first - I don't like the claustrophobic movies where the fun has been made of the characters who are awkward foreigners that can not speak English. Spielberg's ""The Terminal"" has got it all but I've came to like it. Technically, it is great - the work of Spielberg's set decorators' and cinematographer's is superb. After a few obligatory jokes based on the main character's total puzzlement and confusion regarding what is happening to him, film starts to look at that man closer and finds a lot in him to admire. The most important for me was the part when we finally find out why Victor Navarsky (Tom Hanks), the citizen of the fictitious Eastern European Country Krakozia came to New York City, NY, USA. The story behind his arrival is simple, sweet, and touching.I did not like Catherine Zeta Jones in the movie - her strength and her weakness are the same - she cannot forget how beautiful and sexy she looks on the screen. Sometimes, it works perfectly (""The Mask of Zorro"", ""Chicago"", and ""Intolerable Cruelty""). Sometimes, like in this movie, it does not work at all. Another detail - I don't think that making the villain of huge proportions of Stanley Tucci's character was such a great idea. It is not exactly clear why he is determined to make Victor's life even more confusing and miserable with the tenacity deserving better purpose. It was not exactly necessary to make a hero and saint of Hanks' character, either. With all the negatives, ""The Terminal"" for me is an enjoyable and uplifting fantasy - sentimental, of course and not perfect but fine and touching.",The Terminal
89,Kamurai25,"""A Good Watch To Movie""",9,19 June 2021,"Great watch, will likely watch again, and do recommend.I should be able to recommend this just based on ""Tom Hanks trapped in an airport"", especially given how popular ""Cast Away"" was.I really love what they did with him being foreign and trap in an American airport, but being hard-working and intelligent. I'm sure there is a ""Larry the Cable Guy"" version of this movie when it's a useless American trapped in another country that would be much funnier, but clearly a worse movie.The progression of Hanks' character is wonderful, and while there are definitely components of this being a romantic movie, it is refreshing to see a movie that can hold the character's romantic motivations in parallel to the story's motivations and allow them to both be and be separate.Stanley Tucci also does a great job, though its as a very unnecessary villain. Yes, it's a guy doing his job, but the character is oddly motivated for someone trying to score a promotion: something they specifically point out in the movie.My point is that not only it is a well-made, well-performed movie, but it manages to be something larger and highlights problems with us a humans, society and bureaucracy.",The Terminal

I have a hard time expressing just how much this movie irritated me on a story and plotting level. I kept telling myself, ""Relax, for God's sake. It's a FANTASY and a PARABLE about patience, waiting, and home, and also (again) about America and about one little man's attempt to persevere against the odds in the face of an uncaring bureaucracy.""I also kept telling myself,""Look, a lot of this movie is just an excuse to play out the half-baked notions any long distance traveler gets...what would it be like to actually stay in a huge place that is intended as nothing more than a waiting zone, that attempts to provide the comforts of home while at the same time being more sterile and impersonal than any home could ever be? How would you cope? How would you pass the time? What minor comforts and pleasures would you manage to finagle from a place of tiles, fast food, newsstands, vending machines, indoor/outdoor carpeting, vinyl seats and indifferent strangers? What would it be like to live like a mouse in the walls here? What hidden sanctuaries and hideyholes would you find as you explored?"" And I kept reminding myself, ""Look, Tom Hanks is great in this. He's as appealing as usual in an ego-less noble ""Everyman"" role. There's not a false note in his entire performance (although it's an easy role to play.) And Jones is fine, and hits just the right notes. And the supporting character actors are, well, whimsical and charming and wistful etc., just like they always are in a Spielberg fantasy setting. Hell, even Stanley Tucci, who I LOVE as a character actor is great, even if he plays an officious creep.""Nothing worked. I don't care if its a fantasy - there is NO WAY that even an officious bureaucrat would leave someone to starve (in a very public way) in the middle of a major metropolitan airport. Even if he was the most officious, rigid prick in the Western Hemisphere, one call to the N.Y.Times, the Wall Street Journal, ""60 Minutes"", etc from one of the many ""little people"" that Hanks made friends with would bring such a sh*tstorm of public indignation down on Tucci that his career would be toast in 1 hour. And Tucci would know this. So he could put in 5 minutes of work and solve the problem ""under the table"". One call to the State Department asking to grant him asylum at the Embassy of a neutral nation...one temporary visa to a nearby airport hotel under house arrest,with an Air Marshall to keep an eye on him...one appeal to the Red Cross or the ACLU...ANYONE...could have resolved the problem and kept Hanks' character safe and comfortable (and out of the public eye) until they knew what to do with him. So the fact that not one of the 'little' folks that supposedly came to know and love Hanks ever made that one phone call to help him...that Tucci, whose very job depended on keeping things clean, safe, and orderly in his airport, couldn't make a judgment call based on decades of experience to assist an obviously harmless and inoffensive man...that kept grinding into my thinking like a stone in my shoe, and kept me from enjoying all the cutesy charming sentimentality that Spielberg was slathering on by the barge-load. Otherwise, it had some nice moments. I especially liked the dining scene between Hanks and Jones on the balcony pavilion overlooking the concourse. And I appreciated that Zeta-Jones eventually chose to resume her life with her former beau, which rang true to the choice a women in her position would almost certainly make for her own emtional survival.

91,eric262003,Light Romantic Comedy With Spielberg Like Charm,8,13 March 2016,"Unlike good friend George Lucas who's spent a grand portion of the last two decades fixated on creating more interpretations for pointless ""Star Wars"" incarnates like if there was no tomorrow, cohort Steven Spielberg has arbitrarily took different avenues in the film industry to exhibit his versatility as a director and in ""The Terminal"" he shows just how dynamic he is as a director and after almost 45 years in the film industry, he still manages to come up with a wide range of topics and enlightens us that there is a world out there besides ""Star Wars"". Just like his previous outing before ""The Terminal"", ""Catch Me If You Can"", the subject matter has a humble idea brewing along, but the subtlety by Spielberg along with the likable characters make this one like ""Catch Me If You Can"" an enlightening character study that will leave you glued to your seat. ""The Terminal"" could very much be a comeback to Spielberg's early roots when he used to direct more artsy like films, or he may just be doing light, stylish pictures so that he can prepare himself for his next big-budgeted film ""War of the Worlds"". But for what this movie stands out, we'll just have to sit back and enjoy the ride.Tom Hanks, who has been a favorite performer of Spielberg's stars as Eastern European born Viktor Navorski who came from the fictitious country of Krakoshia and arrives at John F. Kennedy airport in New York City. When he arrives in America he receives the news that his country is embarked in a bloody war and is unsafe to return there. With the government there being overthrown, his country is now just as good as being obsolete which makes Navorski's passport next to nothing. In others he can't go home because he has no home left plus he can't enter America because he has to go through a lot of hurdles to get through. In simpler terms this man has no place to call home to. Viktor's first hurdle he must conflict with is a Homeland Security Officer named Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) who tries to simplify things to our uni-lingual immigrant that in our enter the country, he must have tons of paperwork he must undertake and must be completed. Days have gone by and Krakoshia has not let up and a homeless Viktor has now taken residence at Gate 67, Frank now has dilemma right under his nose. Frank feels the only solution would be is to get himself off the hook and let someone else take the Viktor situation off his hands. He gives Viktor approval to leave the area in praying he'll be incarcerated by the immigration officials. Being raised in Communist born country Viktor is oblivious to the government policies and to just patiently remain at JFK airport. This leads to the expected friction between the uptight Frank and the wedge that Viktor has made himself to be towards Frank. With Frank determined to make Viktor's stay more laborious than one deserves, Viktor progressively befriends several employees at the airport which includes the introverted food service worker named Enrique (Diego Luna) who'll offer Viktor food if he can get more info on a fellow employee he's secretly smitten with named Dolores (Zoe Saldana). His other friends include a cargo handler named Joe (Chi McBride) and a custodial worker named Gupta (Kumar Pallana). Viktor eventually gets a job and gets romantically linked to a flight attendant named Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The characters depicted here is where the comedy factor is featured and at times it feels at most improvised by the cast which speaks volumes knowing the Spielberg is behind the camera. Hanks does a wonderful job here and captures a sense of likability like one of his most enduring characters in the 1990's namely Forrest Gump. Zeta-Jones has a very limited role here, but she excels well here as love-confused character in a vulnerable position. Normally I cringe when Stanley Tucci ends up playing hateful characters because of his reputation of overacting them. Sure his villainy here is portrayed clichéd, but here he's playing it more subtle and that's refreshing coming from Tucci. Granted Spielberg can overthrow us with overly done schmaltz, but here the schmaltz was limited here and that makes the film all the more enthralling. The characters are low-key but developed enough to get to know them and his light direction doesn't give us any indication that this movie is directed by a legend in his craft. The script was done by ""The Truman Show"" writer Andrew Niccol as he succeeds in keeping the script tight with no heavy-handed stuff to catch you off guard while he succeeds in keeping it unconventional. The final scenes feature little surprises that will shock you in some way to the point of refraining from any kind of contrived Hollywood formula. Overall, ""The Terminal"" succeeds in being more truthful in showing how developed countries like the United States reacts towards foreigners who want to start a life in this country. The film fends itself nice through the characters and the interactions between them. Its a film that charmingly demonstrates paranoia, insecurity, xenophobia that manifests within the diversity of the American people. This movie can show a sweet side to a rather serious subject without feeling cheated.",The Terminal
92,valadas,Unplausible but good,7,2 October 2004,"Out of this unplausible story of a man forced to live in an airport for several weeks (or months?) because of a law gap, Spielberg makes a nice and humane movie with a few successful situation gags, a solidarity chain among simple people, a sentimental tale hidden in a peanut can and a few drops and romance between our man and an air hostess hit by existential troubles. Well you must also take for granted a few other unlikely things such as that despite the fact that when the main character came into the airport after landing, he practically didn't know a word of English, after a few days he talked passably well and that he managed to change the space of an airport door into a bedroom for him without nobody seeming to notice it for months. Anyway the most important feature of this movie is that simplicity, honesty and solidarity triumph over bureaucracy, inhumanity and injustice in the end.",The Terminal

And ninety eight more such piffles all gifted to the dim-bulb viewer by no less than Steven Spielberg who should crawl away in shame at having directed this travesty of a movie. Right up there on my Worst List of all time. Tom Hanks with an atrocious accent plus the added insult of losing and finding his Russki type English every sentence.

95,dunmore_ego,In-Terminal-ble,4,11 September 2005,"Cast Away meets Perestroika in ""The Terminal"", a movie which cannot decide whether it wants to be a drama, a romantic comedy, or just a silly waste of time. Unspooling like a film student's exercise in padding, one has to beat oneself about the head to comprehend how the world's arguably greatest director and the world's arguably greatest actor ever acceded to participating in this mundane project. Forget plot. Forget realistic human behavior. Forget empathy with the characters. But for a few moments which sparkle with the genius of the mega-powers involved (such as the scene where the camera drives home the hero's alienation by panning away from him, showing us his insignificance amidst the madding crowd; also, the ""promise"" fulfilled is a moving affair), the movie is a herky-jerky mish-mash of pish-posh. Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks, sporting a darn good ""Russian"" inflection) alights at JFK Airport just as his (fictional) country of Krakozhia slides into a military coup. As a result, all Krakozhian passports are suspended and ""unrecognized"" by the U.S. Government; in effect, Navorski cannot go home, nor can he enter the United States - hence, Homeland Security Officer Dixon (the marvelous, multi-faceted Stanley Tucci) relegates Navorski to the confines of JFK Terminal, hoping that he will exit ""illegally"" and become S.E.P. (Somebody Else's Problem). Innocent Viktor, though, chooses not to exit, thereby remaining Dixon's responsibility and causing him insufferable agita. While squatting in the Terminal, Viktor's adventures make us realize just how much more enjoyable it would be to watch paint dry.I, like many others on this planet, have seen every one of Spielberg's movies (except ""Always""  n.b. chick-flick!) and I think it's safe to say that not even in the irritating ""Lost World: Jurassic Park 2"" are there so many instances where we, the audience, ""fall out"" of the movie so painfully. The ""falling out"" starts with Dixon's first meeting with Navorski. One wonders how Dixon squishing a bag of potato chips over Navorski's jacket will allow Navorski to allegorically comprehend that his country is in political transience. This scene's deeper message is that government officers like Dixon are so wrapped in their jobs that even a language barrier cannot curb their adherence to verbal protocol. Rest assured, I get it. But inserting that juvenile chip-squishing act removed me from the movie  it was gratuitously Three Stooges and all I could think of were the oil stains that Navorski's jacket would forever be residued with. Other sequences also offer deeper messages overlaid with trite screen writing, such as the ""medicine-for-goat"" sequence (which almost succeeds  until Dixon recites a statute word-for-word for the viewer's benefit), or the ""juggling waiter"" scene (performed by a character who has just been trying to boost Viktor's chances with his date - now jeopardizing them with his intrusion). How could the great Spielberg allow so many of these jarring sophomoric idiocies into this movie?Filmed on a gargantuan movie set which could have stamped out Liberia's deficit, stranded Viktor realizes he needs to find: a) food, b) shelter, c) something named Wilson to talk to. The movie's numerous, obtuse sub-plots provide all three. In one exceptionally inane sub-plot, Viktor intercedes between a shy baggage-handler and the INS officer he worships from afar. Whimsical teens clasp their breasts and sigh deeply  but how many stalking baggage-hounds have those whimsical teens dated recently? That Cyrano de Bergerac vamp only goes so far before you have to reveal the Dork Death you really are That romance led to a contrived marriage, whereupon I ""fell out"" yet again. Most prominent of the sub-plots is Viktor's romance with stewardess Amelia (a pore-less Catherine Zeta-Jones), who carries so much obvious emotional baggage, she should have 'Samsonite' tattooed on her forehead. Incessantly nattering about Napoleon, incorrectly deemed ""far-sighted"" by the desirous Viktor, the fact that he meets this neurotic slattern whilst she is arguing with her adulterous lover about leaving his wife should have raised red flags immediately. (Guess Tom Leykis isn't broadcast in Krakozhia) Subsequently, after all the energy Viktor expends on this ""romance"" - including building Amelia a fountain! - it amounted to a waste of time (when she declines his love for her married adulterer's) and a wrongful investment of the audience's emotions. The film lost our Trust. Viktor and Amelia's parting scene is also the worst ""falling out"" example: in a pub, patrons clamor around Viktor, talking to him directly, He ignores them, while Amelia backs away from him. In the real world, if a stranger abjectly pays you no mind, your first instinct is to find others to direct your attention to  but these extras continue blathering at Viktor, the ""rhubarb audio"" progressively getting quieter as the poignancy between Viktor and Amelia grows more intense, thereby dumping us headlong into the Real World, where ""extras"" blather in movies simply to create atmosphere.In assimilating his English from travelogues, television commercials and baggage-handlers, Viktor becomes far too cognizant of English vernacular; of words and concepts which one could never glean from those lowbrow sources. Thus, communication becomes ""easy"", and the sinister atmosphere pervading Viktor's alienation is diluted. Can we expect anything more from Spielberg these days? After ""Jaws"", he has only colored *within* the PC lines; the world is good and kind and rewarding - Oops, I've fallen again. Dixon's boss commits a grand ""fallout"" offense when he advises Dixon, ""Compassion  that's the foundation of this country."" I believe he was referring to the pilgrims compassionately liberating the land from the Native Americans. Or was he speaking of the land-owners who compassionately bull-whipped their African slaves? Maybe he meant the Union and Confederacy compassionately disemboweling one another during the American Civil War?Mr. Spielberg: I've fallen  and I can't get up.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",The Terminal

Instead, he must wait at the JFK terminal until his country restores order.The film is genuinely funny and feel-good, there are moments as well were I really felt bad for Victor, stranded in a country were he had no idea of it's customs...You genuinely get behind Victor when he tries to put together two people, and making the best use of the Terminal. The other thing about the film which is quite amazing, are the different characters, the very funny Gupta, the beautiful Dollores, the lovable Enrique and the vile Frank Dixon, the man you love to hate.The one aspect I thought the film needed work on was the character, Amelia...She was whiny and annoying, the end was a little off for a Spielberg movie, which kind of ruined it, but still a wonderful movie to pass the time.",The Terminal
99,TheUnknown837-1,What a wonderful movie!,10,20 September 2010,"Steven Spielberg's ""The Terminal"" is in my honest opinion, as fine and funny a comedy as any ever made. By adapting a similar approach to a French filmmaker that Spielberg admired and taking a style nostalgic of Frank Capra's best, he created an extraordinary little film that is very humorous and rich with quality and depth. I have continually regarded Steven Spielberg as the finest director working in Hollywood today and one of the all-time masters of his craft. ""The Terminal"" exemplifies his range of talents as he can make harrowing epics like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan,"" thrillers like ""Jaws,"" exercises of awe (""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""Jurassic Park"") and he know how to make a comedy that can not only generate a few genuine laughs, but make you grin and warm your heart. And that is what he accomplished with ""The Terminal."" Instead of a slapstick would-be laugher with tiresome clichés and aggravating characters, Spielberg reverts back to that wonderful era of sweet, inoffensive gentleness with charming characters and fascinating scenarios. His star is Tom Hanks, playing a man from a fictional Eastern European nation. Hanks arrives at a New York airport terminal on the same day his country is embroiled in a war and as such, officially ceases to exist. Because of this and a complicated reason explained by the immigrations official marvelously played by Stanley Tucci, he cannot leave the terminal and must live there until further notice. Without a country and with few belongings, Hanks's character of Viktor Navorski begins to adapt to life in the terminal, getting to know the employees, and befriending a beautiful but unhappy flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones).This is a wonderful, original premise inspired by a true story. Mr. Spielberg's production designer Alex McDowell constructed a life-sized set of an airport terminal using jet hangars and the detail is absolutely extraordinary. It is nearly a sin that McDowell's name did not appear on the Oscar nominees list the following year. But the real genius in how this set is used goes to Mr. Spielberg. When he started out as a filmmaker, Spielberg was regarded as the expert on lenses and lights. He can do that and direct drama efficiently at the same time. The way he creatively uses lights and camera movement is absolutely fantastic, creating a sense of joy and humor in the physical elements of the picture as well as the story. The floors and ceilings are so wonderfully lit that it makes an airport terminal, usually thought of as being dull and boring, seem like a beautiful paradise.But Mr. Spielberg's true genius is the way he directs this story and directs his actors. Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Hanks make a more than effective team and wonderfully construct this character, who is not made into an utter bumbler or aggravating, but as a lovable, optimistic man who is making the best out of what he has. His character reminds me of characters played by James Stewart and Joe E. Brown in the good old days. Mr. Hanks does not go around punching people's lights out or running around naked as a lot of comedians these days are reduced into doing. And yet, when using his accent, he never goes over the top. He never strikes a false note. It's one of Hanks's most sweet and pleasant performances since ""Big"" and ""Forrest Gump."" Also enthralling about the story is the way Hanks (and we) delve into life at the terminal. What goes on when one works there. We get to know the people, such as a lovesick employee (Diego Luna), a loyal but unsure security chief (Chi McBride), and a suspicious janitor (Kumar Pallana) with a past.However, the most enchanting and wonderful scenes, the ones that remind me so much of Frank Capra's classics, are the moments between Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is enchantingly great as the flight attendant he befriends. It is truly fascinating to watch the friendship between these two wonderfully constructed and acted characters develop into something very pure. Zeta-Jones is absolutely wonderful in her role and her character is not a cut-out or two-dimensional. She is not slutty or provocative. She is a three-dimensional human being with an involving story. Just the same as the character played by Hanks. Mr. Spielberg is an artist. The great critic Gene Siskel once said that great directors play their audiences like a piano. In these moments, Mr. Spielberg does better. He plays on our hearts like he would a violin. And he's pulling on the strings to produce something beautiful.""The Terminal"" is one of the highlights of my recent movie-going experiences. I loved every single bit of it. When I first saw the picture shortly after its released, it absorbed me and drew me in hook, line, and sinker. Now looking on it for a second time, I can only say that I've come to adore it more and that this shall mount up as two viewings multiply. What a wonderful movie!",The Terminal
100,Victor Field,I don't know when I'll be back again...,7,25 November 2004,"Steven Spielberg has never made a bad movie (and yes, that does include ""1941""), but he has produced one or two - ""Joe Versus The Volcano,"" which was one of the first times he and Tom Hanks appeared on the same credit roll. ""The Terminal,"" along with being a change of pace from ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brothers,"" proves that they've come a long way from that leaden comedy and ""The Money Pit"" - but it's not a highpoint for either.I'm not saying this is a loser; admittedly this movie does suffer from an inability to decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama - the scenes of Tom Hanks' Krakhosian traveler viewing civil unrest in his country on the airport's TV screens sit uneasily with his gathering luggage carts for cashback, for a start. Plus the situation he's in is treated quite seriously, notably with the official who's the closest ""The Terminal"" has to an actual villain - played by Stanley Tucci, in the movie's best performance as an official who's a nice guy one moment and determined to get Hanks out of the airport at whatever cost the next.This inability to find a proper tone is partly Spielberg's fault - he seems afraid of being accused of being too sentimental this time around, although if ever a storyline could have done with more emotional pull (not so much in the relationship between Hanks and flight attendant Catherine Zeta Jones* as with the reason why he's in America in the first place) this is it - but screenwriters Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson deserve more of the blame, especially the latter (whose questionable storytelling abilities also hobbled ""Speed 2: Cruise Control,"" ""Rush Hour 2"" and to an admittedly lesser extent ""Catch Me If You Can""). A distressing amount of subplots never seem to have a proper buildup or payoff (like the catering guy in love with Zoe Saldana), and a lot of it is too fragmented to have an impact; the climax and finale just don't have the effect they should.The shame of it is that this movie is often perfectly watchable - finely acted, amusing and touching, and well shot and scored by Janusz Kaminski and John Williams respectively (not to give anything away, but music plays a key role in the movie). DreamWorks built an entire airport lounge for the movie (most of which was shot in Montreal rather than New York), but the good news about ""The Terminal"" is that it's not the sort of movie where you leave whistling the scenery. The bad news about it, though, is that you don't leave with much about it on your mind - worth seeing, but nothing about it lingers the way, say, Jennifer Garner playing Go Fish with Leonardo DiCaprio in ""Catch Me If You Can"" does. This would make a great inflight movie.*And the end credits finally prove that there IS no hyphen in her name.",The Terminal

Doubtless the screenplay plays fast and loose with the true story on which it is based, but who cares.

It is becoming increasingly clearer that Tom Hanks is ascending to the ranks of our foremost actors today.

What make's ""the terminal"" special is all the elements movie has got, and by element I mean all the stories it comprises of. The main story is of the man (Viktor Navorski) stranded at airport, who wins everybody's hearts. There's a story of an Indian man, who has been long working on airport, since murdering police official in India who thinks of Viktor as an agent. There's a story of a troubled couple, the women from which loves to read, for whom Viktor falls. There's another story of two young person's falling in love and getting married, all with help of Viktor. There's story of a person carrying medicine for his father not permitted to go any further because of airport rules and Viktor tricks the main authority by helping the man. Winning hearts of officials, finding way to gain money are others.The story revolves around Viktor who is there to fulfill his sentiments related to his Father. The movie is what I call lovely. In the end the purpose of Navorski is fulfilled. The best part about the movie I liked was the napoleon story that women conveys to Viktor and drug incident.

105,gregsrants,Endearing. Spielberg scores again!,8,20 June 2004,"`Welcome to America, almost' That is the line uttered by Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) to the recently arrived Victor Navorski (Tom Hanks) in Steve Speilberg's new film The Terminal.  The film, set almost entirely in a New York airport, tells the story of Victor's attempts to gain entry to America after his European nation goes to war while in transit leaving him without a recognized country or visa required to enter Stateside.  Standing in his way is the incredibly self-serving Frank Dixon who wants nothing more than for Victor to leave the airport, thus leaving him in the hands of federal officials.  But as days pass without Victor taking various bait as laid by the airport brass, Frank's nemesis becomes his crusade and to the bitter end he is determined not to let Victor get the better of the unfriendly rules and regulations he strictly enforces. As days turn into weeks, Victor befriends various workers within the terminal including an Indian man who enjoys over-waxing floors to watch travelers slip to his amusement and a young airport employee that trades Victor food for information on a young INS agent he has intentions of asking out.  Victor soon uses these friendships to his advantage after meeting a beautiful flight attendant named Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is self-admittedly bad with men and looks to use Victor as a stop over conversation aide to hide her grief in her own decision making abilities. 
Under the watchful eyes of the airport cameras, Frank watches some of these events unfold including Victor's luck at getting a contract job with an airport renovating crew.  Not knowing how to rid himself of Victor's reluctance to leave, Frank does everything from threaten those that are closest to Victor to overtly lying to Victor giving him a false impression that no persecution will occur if he leaves the airport at a certain time of day.Directed by Steven Spielberg based on a screenplay written by Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson (Catch Me If You Can), The Terminal is one of those wonderful films that requires you to suspend belief in a situation too unbelievable to be true, but too magical to be ignored.  Tom Hanks is particularly believable as he puts on his Meryl Streep hat and nails an accent that if not handled properly could have been if not embarrassing, definitely distracting.  By mixing his new linguistic talent with stereotypical European hand gestures, Hanks is endearing and completely engrossed in the role of a foreigner that goes through an incredible transformation including using his time in the airport to learn how to read, speak and understand the English language.  But as a perfect compliment to Hanks tenderness and naivety is the evil Tucci who in terms of Spielberg films, outdoes even Ralph Fiennes in Schindler's List and Danny Glover in The Color Purple as the most cruel and ruthless villain that he has ever tried to put on screen.  Tucci as Frank never waivers from his intentions and his tunnel vision geared towards what he hopes to be an inevitable and well-deserved promotion.  It has been a long time since I have watched a film and actually hated a character for their actions towards an innocent bystander, but Tucci delivers a knockout punch that should be reviewed again when nominations for little gold statues come out later this year.I did make a mistake before seeing The Terminal in that I read other reviews before actually previewing the movie myself.  Although most reviews have been more than favorable, local papers designated the story as unbelievable' and therefore underwritten'.  Huh?  A movie brought to you by the same director who has endeared us with dinosaurs and aliens has made a story that is insupposable?  The notion of a man living inside a terminal for months is possible and then should be based in a more realistic situation?  Pleee-eazze!  What is more believable than a man looks to fulfill a journey as set out by his father (I have to leave this one in an enigma to hide what is really a touching reveal and ending to the film)? 
The Terminal is another notch for the belt that is Speilberg's legacy. Sure, the brilliant films of Schindler's List, Jaws and Saving Private Ryan are arguably better, but if Stevie decides he wants to spend the rest of his life making 4 to 4 ½ star movies then the movie going public should continue to bow in thanks for all his contributions.  A strong recommendation is therefore granted and a longing for Spielberg's next attempt at celluloid.  For any director than can keep us in a movie theatre for two hours making us yearn to stay in an airport terminal longer is a craftsman of remarkable talent.www.gregsrants.com",The Terminal
106,Ruskington,Good clean fun but a missed opportunity,7,20 May 2020,The Terminal comes mighty close to being a truly memorable movie but is let down by some unnecessary soppiness and directorial indulgence. Tom Hanks gives Navorski a rather childish persona that is somewhat cloying and arguably a little insulting. Hanks has enough charm to maintain Navorski's likeability but I really feel this was a missed opportunity in character development. The supposed romance between Hanks and Zeta-Jones is pretty farcical and doesn't play out well. The whole charade takes an unnacceptable amount of time and makes the movie laborious towards the end. This is still a very enjoyable wholesome film but it could have been so much more.,The Terminal
107,Rogue-32,Shawshank without the redemption,3,21 June 2004,"The Terminal starts out with a shaky premise and proceeds to get shakier and shakier as it goes on (and on and on).  It seemed to me like Spielberg was counting on Tom Hanks to be so engrossing that nobody would notice how stupid the movie is.  The good news: Hanks is great, completely at one with his character and thoroughly believable throughout.The bad news: The film really begins to go seriously downhill when -=- SPOILER ALERT -=- Stanley Tucci's character is outsmarted by Hanks (there's medicine and a non-existent goat involved) and from here, the film starts turning into a third-rate rehash of the superb movie The Shawshank Redemption, with Tucci's character becoming increasingly angered by Hanks, to the point of trying to sabotage him at every turn (just like the sadistic warden did to Tim Robbins in Shawshank).  But there's no redemption here, just an unbelievably contrived sequence where Tucci orders his security people to stop Hanks from leaving the terminal, but of course the head guy sides with Hanks and lets him depart, in the corniest possible way, while Tucci semi-foams at the mouth (he's not really THAT perturbed, you see; the script tries to play it both ways, telegraphing to anyone in the audience with half a brain that this is a pathetic ploy to drag the film out longer by creating a completely unnecessary conflict).  -=- END OF SPOILERThere's a ton of other stupid stuff going on as well; I can site a couple but not all (it would make this review much too long) - one of the guys on the food staff employs Hanks (who is making MORE MONEY than Tucci by mid-film, doing 'under-the-table' construction work, totally inconceivable at an airport) to help him woo the woman who constantly stamps Hanks' form ""REJECTED""; that's ok, that's cool and charming, but it's thoroughly implausible that she -=- SPOILER ALERT =-= winds up MARRYING this guy, without seemingly getting to know him whatsoever. And Hanks himself begins a relationship with a flight attendant (played by Zeta-Jones); she's yer basic hopelessly-devoted-to-a-married-man sadsack, written as a total cliche, as all the characters wind up being.  -=- END OF SPOILER  I want to point out that I came into this movie totally open-minded; I generally like Spielberg as a director and I think Hanks is brilliant, and I'm also a huge fan of the Tuccinator (as I affectionate call him).  I was willing to suspend disbelief for the basic shaky plot because I thought the film would at least proceed with some sort of intelligence once the premise was set up.  But it's like Spielberg didn't really know what the heck kind of film he was making -- it doesn't really work as a fantasy because there are too many elements of attempted realness involved, it doesn't actually play as a metaphor because Hanks actually has an agenda (involving his father), and it certainly doesn't work as a drama, what with the half-heartedness of the characters' convictions (Tucci's character in particular).  It's not a comedy either because nothing really funny happens. It's a mess, really, and by the time the unbelievably unsatisfying ending comes around, my feelings had shifted, as you can see from what I've written here.

It's about the closest thing I could see as a sequel to ""Forrest Gump"" without actually seeing tom Hanks play Forrest Gump again. He plays Viktor Navorski, a Bulgarian national from a fiction republic who lose his country in the air and cannot return home, but without a new reclassification, he can't enter the United States so he has to live in the world of the airport terminal. This sequence is highlighted by very convincing CNN scenes of his war-torn homeland. He gets by living by his wits and the kindness of other people, encountering and touching on the lives of people passing through, much like Forrest, and they touch his life in return. The mystery of the can he carries around makes for a good and worthy sub-plot. George Takei appears in the movie where one character is a Trekkie. Catherine Zeta Jones has a wonderful role as a potential love interest that surprises by not having her end up with Tom, a cliché ending that otherwise would have been too predictable.",The Terminal
109,rainking_es,"Tom Hanks, THE MAN!",7,18 October 2005,"An extraordinary real story (a man trapped in an American airport because of some absurd bureaucratic troubles) turned into sort of a romantic comedy rather unimportant. Quite funny and so tender. That's Spielberg! That's Hollywood! Steven runs away from any kind of social-politic commitment and he focuses on giving the audience just what they want: some smiles, some tears, nothing too deep...Tom Hanks takes the whole movie over. He shows off his huge talent playing the main role, a character that's in every single frame of ""The Terminal"". HE IS THE MOVIE.So, what we got here is a perfect made movie where everything it's been so well cared (we're talking about a Spielberg production). Nice for a Saturday afternoon (although we expected something else from the man who made Jaws, AI or ET).*My rate: 7/10",The Terminal
110,itamarscomix,Another half-baked film from Steven Spielberg,4,24 May 2005,"It's been over a decade since Spielberg had his one-two combo in 1993 with a groundbreaking futuristic action film (Jurassic Park) and a truly beautiful historical drama (Schindler's List) and, unless you count Saving Private Ryan (which, in my opinion, has several ingenious scenes but is too long and has a lot of filler) it's been that long since we've seen a truly memorable offering from the great master of the 70s and 80s. That's not to say that he made a bad film; there's some to be said for Catch Me If You Can, Minority Report, Amistad and, to a certain extent, AI as well; but none of these show any sign of the brilliant and original spark of the genius who created Close Encounters, Jaws, ET, Indiana Jones, The Color Purple, Empire of the Sun, or Duel. On the contrary - Spielberg seems to have created a monster he cannot control, and each film he makes seems, at least a bit, like a cruel parody on him, as he employs every Hollywood cliché that he himself invented all those years ago. The Terminal is no exception. Spielberg's third collaboration with Tom Hanks - who (apologies to the hordes of Hanks fans out there), be he an astronaut, a boy in an adult body, a detective, a con artist or a refugee from a war-torn country, will always be Tom Hanks - which, like the other two, is based on a true story, is by far the weakest of the bunch. The film starts out with a great and fascinating premise, as a biting satire about the cruelty of capitalist bureaucracy, and as long as that is the subject, it's both funny and touching, as it shows the way the Uncle Sam treads all over the little man. Spielberg, however, doesn't manage to fill more than thirty minutes with that concept, and soon enough we find him swimming towards the safe and known shores of physical humor and romantic comedy. The story about the man forced to live in an airport is of course a terrible stretch, but it gets across and manages to convince; once Catherine Zeta Jones steps in is when the story becomes unbelievable. The film soon turns into a cheesy, unconvincing romance with some really bad dialogue, and loses all its uniqueness and originality. Obviously, The Terminal has its moments; it's Spielberg, after all, and is entertaining at the very least. I expected more, though. In all likelihood this is Spielberg's worst movie, or at least the worst in some years. This one is good for a video rental, no more.",The Terminal
111,TheNorthernMonkee,entertaining enough film with positive message,7,13 July 2005,"SPOILERS Most people in Western civilisation have spent at least part of their life waiting at airports. Weather dependent, socially dependent and reliant of countless other variables, air transport is one long story of delays and cancellations. Based upon the story of a man living at Charles De Gaulle airport in France, 2004's ""The Terminal"" takes great pleasure in trapping a foreign accent voiced Tom Hanks in JFK Airport for a long period of time. Often entertaining and constantly reminding us of how life can be, this film is a pleasant experience with a positive view of life throughout.Viktor Navorski (Hanks) is visiting New York for the first time. We say he is visiting, however after his home country is engulfed in civil war, his passport and right of entry is withdrawn. Now, fallen through a loophole, Navorski finds himself living in the International Lounge at JFK Airport, a citizen of nowhere.Right from the start, ""The Terminal"" gets into the point at hand and introduces us to Navorski. Well played by Hanks, Navorski is a kind hearted foreigner with a mission to achieve. Unfortunately though, he is stuck in the airport, mainly due to the magnificently malevolent Frank Dixon (played with ease by Stanley Tucci). As Navorski settles into his new home, we are gradually introduced to a number of individual characters who are easy to watch and who grow on us as the film continues. Characters like Diego Luna's Enrique Cruz or Kumar Pallana's Gupta Rajan. All well acted and delivered, these characters are superbly written for the screen and thoroughly enjoyable tow watch.There's little wrong with ""The Terminal"" actually. Decently acted, written, superbly directed, and with a good soundtrack, it fills all the necessary criteria to be a great film. Unfortunately though, it just never really makes it into the memorable films category. Perhaps the one main reason for this is that it's just too 'nice'. It's fun, it's entertaining, it's incredibly positive about everything it does, but it never feels gritty and never feels like it has much depth. It's an incredibly superficial film which will make the audience smile, but which will never really challenge us. If this is what the audience is in the mood for, then the film is worth watching, but if you want anything even slightly deep, then your better off elsewhere.Together for the third time (""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Catch Me If You Can""), director Steven Spielberg and star Tom Hanks are in part responsible for an entertaining film with a good heart. Often entertaining and well acted, ""The Terminal"" is a sweet little affair which will make you smile. Unfortunately for those wanting substance though, it is an incredibly superficial and shallow film. Never really showing depth or any sort of grit, it is a timely reminder of how films can be good in a mundane sort of way. Worth watching if you fancy being cheered up, but not the sharpest film around.",The Terminal

The Terminal seems to be Steven Spielberg on auto-pilot, with an inexcusable amount of product placement which would make any movie-goer want to leave in the middle of the film (an example of this occurs when Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones are in a 2-shot talking to each other, with a Starbucks RIGHT in the middle of the shot - of course, you would realize that a Starbucks in right there). Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones also give so-so performances, as if they realize the script is just an average one. Oh well.

Because Spielberg simply has reached a point in his career and has a ability to make without back thoughts, good movies, he simply knows the recipe. Starring Tom Hanks as a Russian this movie kicks off smoothly offering what the movie has to offer; charming and well acted conversations and a airport set scene.THE TERMINAL isn't the ordinary Spielberg movie in many ways, and if you don't have the guts to see Hanks making up his accent, this is a very straight forward tail about a guy who's stuck in nowhere land. Though it's a original idea, there's not really much original ideas inside it or magnificent things happening here - but still; Spielberg and company keeps it a very charming and entertaining movie.Tom Hanks is a Russian who's stuck on the international terminal; without possibilities to go back to his country in war or to New York City laying just outside the airport walls. So he has to live there until he gets clearance to enter NY or back to where he came from. But off course; this bad English speaking guy do get into different kind of situations that makes the airport security pretty fed up but in the same time, fascinated by the guy.Tom Hanks acts well, very well actually. He is so relaxed and amusing that it all works so much more well than I had expected, brilliant photography and fine music as always in Spielberg films, this movie has very much working before it really has started just because of it being a Spielbergian motion picture, though it's very far from his best movies.

115,tonypeacock-1,Interesting bit of comedy drama from Spielberg,6,30 April 2020,"Director Steven Spielberg collaborates with actor Tom Hanks in this comedy drama from 2004.Hanks plays Eastern European Viktor Navorski a resident of the fictional state of Krakhozia. Navorski is refused entry to New York when his homeland undergoes a military coup/war during his flight to the U.S. His passport is therefore not valid and the head of the border police orders him to stay in the International Departure Lounge of the airport!Armed with broken English, a few food vouchers and a pager in case he is needed by the authorities Navorski makes the lounge his home for months whilst the war is still raging. Along the way we meet a few other characters who regularly work in the terminal.A side story has Catherine Zeta-Jones appearing as a United Airlines hostess who Viktor develops a relationship with. I found some of these scenes distracted from the main story and were just included in the film to allow the casting of Zeta-Jones.Hanks is an actor I've never particularly endeared to but he plays Viktor well. I was a bit uncomfortable with the border authorities attitude towards someone with little to no English vocabulary skills! Apparently the story is inspired by the story of an Iranian refugee stuck in Paris Charles De Gaulle for years! I couldn't think of any worse situation. I hate airports at the best of time. They are just shopping malls!Spielberg is not particularly known for his comedy is he? In this film there are several perhaps inadvertent comedic moments such as Viktor looking into security cameras and pulling faces or staff playing cards for items of lost and found items! The film is pretty unique in my opinion. I've not seen a film like it before or since it's release in 2004. Interesting.",The Terminal
116,grahamsj3,A bit underrated,8,21 February 2005,"Tom Hanks sure has a knack for picking the right scripts. Or perhaps Hanks makes the film. I'm not sure, but this is another Hanks success. This is the story of a foreigner who, while in mid-flight to the US, becomes a man without a country when his country falls in a revolution. He therefore does not now have a valid visa to enter the US, nor can he go home since he never actually entered the US. He is forced to live in the airport terminal. The film really doesn't give the viewer a sense of how long he's been there until, at one point, someone mentions 9 months! Hanks is befriended by nearly all of the airport workers and manages to survive very nicely through ingenuity after an awkward start. He falls in love with a flight attendant, the gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones. Look for very good acting from the entire cast and a well-written story and screenplay. The only weakness I saw in the film was that his character, who arrives speaking very little English, seems to learn it fairly quickly. Then we find out how long he's been there, so it's not that hard to believe after all. All in all, an enjoyable film and well worth a watch.",The Terminal

The story is amusing as Tucci plays the compleat bureaucrat whose stick-to-the-book attitude holds Hanks prisoner for month after month.  The entire movie takes place in a terminal and goes from there. This movie touches on a favorite Spielberg theme, i.e., lack of communication.

Once again, he proves to be one of Hollywood's most talented actors. I will admit though that his Russian accent was a little ridiculous. The supporting cast also adds diligence to their characters. I feel though that the other great talent came from Stanley Tucci (the potato chip scene he delivers is so darn hilarious) as the security manager. My only complaint though is that the movie seemed to drag a lot, but it did keep my interest. The atmosphere in the movie also is rather syrupy and silly, I mean, the idea of keeping a foreigner stuck in an airport over an incident in his country? Sounds a little far-fetched to me.

120,bopdog,"Textured and deep, life-like and worthy, but not a ""funny"" comedy as it had been advertised to be",6,6 September 2004,"""The Terminal"" was advertised as a comedy, but it wasn't at all funny--- It had texture, however,and some depth, and addressed some issues of human life that may be important. It is a worthy artistic piece, so overall it was a good movie nonetheless.One of the movie's qualities--- and both a strength and a weakness--- was the evident lack of single purpose, or, perhaps, obvious point. That is, it was unclear what the movie was actually about, and it was equally unclear what the movie was trying to say. Was it saying governments are mean? Borders are bad? Individual humans are mere victims at the whim of political and social powers? I sure couldn't tell what the movie folks thought about the issue, and that was a bit ""deflating"" as far as my emotional involvement went. That might also explain why some readers here, for example, criticize the movie for being over-long and/or boring.On the other hand, raising such issues, especially in today's security conscious borders, is important. And raising the issues and providing clear and strong answers would have been a disservice to the audience. Leaving the questions unanswered, and simply percolating along, and the audience free to make up their own minds--- or at least give the matter some serious thought--- was a rarity in movies today, and a welcome bit of respect for us from Steven Spielberg as the director.An example of the disjointed vibe some folks have mentioned--- What was Catherine Zeta Jones' character doing in this movie? What was her character's purpose, and place in the scheme of things? Dunno... and that was a bit disconcerting. On the other hand, isn't life frequently like that? Don't we often encounter diverse and dis-connected phenomena, and attach what purpose to those things as suits our own little world at any given time? I think so--- The other characters were equally non-seqeutious--- but also equally plausible in the world of the central character, played by Tom Hanks.Overall, then, I liked this movie well enough, even with a touch of disappointment after finding that it was wasn't, as it had been advertised, a funny comedy.",The Terminal

It is one of the worst big-budget movies I have ever seen. Cheesy rom-com set in an airport in the age of TSA. The Tom Hanks character harks back to Forrest Gump, so if you looooooved that movie, then you might possibly find this one tolerable. I myself hated Forrest Gump, but this one comes close to being that bad. I harbor some doubts, in fact, as to the genuine directorship of this bottom-feeder production. Spielberg´s name is on so many projects, it could be that an assistant director did the heavy lifting here. An assistant director of substantially lower intelligence than Spielberg himself, who has churned out genuine masterpieces such as Schindler´s List, Munich, and Minority Report. The Terminal is not even in the same league as any of those works and is indeed so bad as to be embarrassing. Even if the plot and the characters and the clichés and stereotypes were not already bad enough, the musical score was pure torture to suffer through.

124,virek213,Culture Shock,8,3 July 2004,"Loosely based on a true story of a Middle Easterner stranded in Paris, THE TERMINAL is Steven Spielberg's latest film, and he manages to pull off something of a miracle--a series of comical moments integrating themselves into a good story.Tom Hanks, who was superb in previous Spielberg films SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, is once again sterling in his role of Victor Navorski, a native of the fictional East European country of Krakozhia who finds himself totally stranded at New York's JFK Airport when his country falls victim to a political coup.  The airport's homeland security chief (Stanley Tucci) can't get him on a flight back; and because the U.S. government doesn't recognize Krakozhia's current (if temporary) regime, Tucci can't even allow Hanks to take one step out of the airport's International Arrivals Terminal.  Thus, Hanks sets up ""home"" at Gate 67 and subsequently makes life for Tucci and his security guards a living, comical hell, with his constant misunderstandings of American culture and political protocol, making friends with some of the airport's behind-the-scenes people, and attracting the eye of a romantically confused flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones).Spielberg's ability to get laughs from this film's situation far exceeds the below-average attempt he made twenty-five years ago with ""1941.""  Yes, there are some slapstick moments, but they are better integrated into the story and are not the ENTIRE story, as they had been in ""1941.""  Hanks and Spielberg, who have become our era's equivalent of James Stewart and Alfred Hitchcock, are of course matchless, and Zeta-Jones isn't too bad herself. Tucci makes for a very solid kind of heavy, and THE TERMINAL also pokes political holes at what constitutes ""Homeland Security"" in the post-9/11 world we find ourselves living in now.Highly recommended for its quirky style, THE TERMINAL is yet another reason to treasure Spielberg as a cinematic American treasure.",The Terminal

126,lawprof,A Record May Have Been Set for Product Placement,9,18 June 2004,"Steven Spielberg says he wants to lay off the heavy stuff for a while and do some comedies.  ""The Terminal"" is a terrific step in that direction with stars Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Stanley Tucci turning in outstanding performances in a story that easily might have fallen semi-flat. (It's actually a drama/comedy by the way.)Hanks is Viktor Navaski who arrives at JFK (not really-it's a great mock-up) from his native Krakozhia only to find that his entry is barred because revolution has toppled the government, the U.S. has not recognized the new regime and the second-in-command of security for the international building, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) won't let him leave the place. Dixon has a potted view of immigration law on his side.  The virtually non-English-speaking Navaski needs to get to Manhattan for a reason only disclosed near the end of the movie.What follows is a wildly impossible tale of a guy who spends about nine months in the terminal, making friends, learning English, getting a paid-under-the-table construction job and enjoying a troublesome dalliance with Amelia, a beautiful but definitely mixed up flight attendant.  That's Catherine Zeta-Jones, radiant and captivating as ever.Navaski becomes friends, in a mutually dependent way, with an assortment of airport employees, each a lovable stereotype.  His relationship with Dixon becomes increasingly adversarial.  Dixon starts off as a typical bureaucrat whose underwear is two sizes too small but as time passes and he seeks promotion to top honcho, Navaski being viewed as a possible impediment to his advancement, a streak of pure meanness emerges. And Tucci is great as a truly little man in a job much too big for him.Much but, happily, not all of the plot is predictable.  There are a lot of good lines. And a couple of surprises at the end.What makes ""The Terminal"" work?  Very fine acting by the three main characters is one reason and the supporting cast is good too.  Hanks is amusing but also believable as a guy unfortuitously in the wrong place at the wrong time - at first.  The hint of a flowering relationship between Navaski and Amelia is, unusually for a story like this, quite adult.Special kudos go to Hanks's dialog coach.  The star's Krakozhian accent is flawless.John Williams won't garner an Oscar for this score but it's a nice one.This film approaches the Holy Grail for product display and screen marketing.  The terminal has all the shops one would find at a real aerodrome and no opportunity is wasted.  Every major chain - books, food, electronics, clothing, you name it - seems to be represented as is United Airlines (since there's no humor about crashes or hijackings they felt safe, I guess, having their logo everywhere including on flying machines).I thought before seeing ""The Terminal"" that it wind up being a ""6"" or possibly even a ""7"" but in fact it's a 9/10.  Thanks Mr. Spielberg, Mr. Hanks, Mr. Tucci and Ms. Zeta-Jones for making two hours in a movie theater on a hot, humid day speed by rewardingly.Can't wait for the special features on the DVD release.",The Terminal
127,movieguy1021,The Terminal: 8/10,8,27 June 2004,"I'm a Steven Spielberg fan. His movies always have some sort of annoying staple to them: they almost all involve annoying precocious kids, they all have a happy ending, and they all go on for too long. But I respect him, and I think he's a very talented director. And now it seems like this guy can do no wrong. He's in the works for Indiana Jones 4 and Jurassic Park IV, and he came off of the hugely entertaining Catch Me If You Can to go onto The Terminal, a light, enjoyable, and surprisingly funny movie that is Tom Hanks' best role since Forrest Gump or before. Add Kumar Pallana (Pagoda from The Royal Tenenbaums) and Catherine Zeta-Jones in an underdeveloped role, and you've got all of the makings for a good movie.Viktor Navorski (Hanks) is an immigrant from the fictional country of Krakozhia whose country, once he lands at JFK, erupts in a civil war and a military coup. His passport is now invalid and he's not allowed to leave the airport without it. Therefore, he has to live at the airport until he can leave. Barely speaking a word of English, Viktor slowly becomes adapted to living at Gate 67 and meeting many of the people who work there, including flight attendant Amelia (Zeta-Jones). Meanwhile, airport bureaucrat Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) does everything he can to make Viktor someone else's problem.The airport that was created for this film is, I believe, the largest working set ever created for a movie. And I tell ya, I would love to be stuck in an airport like that. With product placement everywhere and a flight departure/arrival board that seems about 40 years too old, it does seem great. Seriously, though, making a set like that and making it all work is amazing. Making use of it to its fullest potential is even more amazing. It seems like The Terminal has everything-a great set, cinematography, acting, script, directing. I've already talked about the set. Let me go into the others.The cinematography by Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski is really great. Almost all of the shots are done indoors (on the aforementioned set), and many of the shots are sweeping ones done inside. Everything's so precise and very beautiful to look at. Hanks, as an Easter European immigrant, does an amazing job. He actually does seem to be this person, and convinced me. His mannerisms, language, and accent are all perfect. It's either his best work or second to Forrest Gump. The script by Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson is great, also. It's very funny, much funnier than I expected. Zeta-Jones' character doesn't have much to do, but her mediocre work is balanced with Hanks' amazing work. The script has the right amount of pathos and comedy, a coherent, flowing sense to it, and, well, is just overall great. And lastly, Spielberg's direction. He seems to show some restraint here, and doesn't go for his usuals I mentioned earlier as much. There's no children, but there's a happy ending and a bit could have been taken out. The ending was just kind of there. Nothing that exciting. But The Terminal is a surprising movie-one that almost needs to be seen to be believed.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for brief language and drug references.",The Terminal

131,Offworld_Colony,"When I first watched this film, close to its release, I was swept up in its negative buzz and remember finding the movie cheesy and boring.",8,17 February 2020,"Recently, for whatever reason I read an article about filmmakers' careers post-9/11, in particular, Steven Spielberg's; And while War of the Worlds is him coming to terms with the trauma of the event, The Terminal is his initial response of international love and unity in a time threatening the opposite from all sides. The international supporting cast of colourful characters is neither too generic and plain nor too stereotypical and cliché, they are the sort of flawed weirdos you find in life, and you learn to love them because they don't actually fit inside a box you've built for them out of your initial prejudices.Tucci is not a moustache-twirling villain, and even when he's lost, literally outside of the airport work environment, his humanity shines through. He's a fascinating relatable sort of figure, his self-interest is frighteningly accurate to those times when you've (had to) value career or workplace rules over the human element, you feel sorry for his inability to relate to Viktor due to his career requirements. And the film ensures it elegantly explains the rules and logic as to why Viktor can't leave and clearly outlines the motivations of Tucci's 'villain' character.Zeta Jones, initially out of place, actually seems to be channelling the screwball comedy elements of the script. And even though Hanks' performance is close to Eastern-European-Face, it's earnest and layered and it feels nothing like the actor we usually see. He portrays a bumbling charming oaf who is also a skilled creator and a romantic, he has hidden layers and complexities shown to those who have the time, or have the foresight to ask him.The set and extra work should be applauded for its background realism, it's a real piece of art to make it feel natural. So set in this fake place, The Terminal is a fake story about possibly a fake man, but it's 100% real in its sentiment. Even the fact that it's set in an airport so close to 9/11 screams that Spielberg wants to tell you it's ok to see humanity in these places so soon after. It's a film about prejudice and misunderstanding, about how silly borders and checkpoints and glass doors and forms and rules can be and how much they separate us, it's about how similar we all are in essence, and moreover it's about love. The world needs more of these kind of movies, sadly, now more than ever.",The Terminal
132,DavidSim240183,Home is wherever you find it,8,25 February 2006,"I've never really given much thought to what goes on at an airport, beyond the fact that you just wait until your flight arrives and then get the hell out of there. But The Terminal, directed by Steven Spielberg, paints an interesting picture, and crafts a compelling story out of the exploits of one immigrant who finds that an airport has become his home away from home.Apparently based on a true story, The Terminal reunites Spielberg with Tom Hanks for the third time. Hanks plays foreigner Viktor Navorski, who has come to New York's JFK airport from the fictional country Krakosia. But while in transit, Viktor finds himself the victim of a bizarre twist of bureaucratic fate.War has broken out in Krakosia, and Viktor's VISA has just expired. That means he can't go home, and since Krakosia is a country not recognised by the USA, Viktor cannot leave the airport. Now trapped between two worlds, Viktor begins the slow process of turning JFK airport into his home.There is something inherently fascinating to this film, which is what drew me to it. Is it possible to make a life for yourself within the confines of an airport terminal? Tom Hanks explored this territory before in Cast Away, where he had to make a life for himself on a desert island. Hanks admirably rises to the challenge here with relish, where JFK has become his own personal stomping grounds.The Terminal is quite logical in the way it explores Viktor's predicament. He speaks hardly any English, and manages to pick it up gradually from the televisions and travelogue books from the airport's various shops.He pays for food from finding loose change in pay phones and trolley carts, and eventually gets work on a construction crew. Viktor slowly becomes almost like a permanent addition to the staff, and an expected sight. He starts to make friends with the personnel at the airport, who become almost like an extended family to Viktor.He plays matchmaker between a janitor and a clerk, diffuses a potentially dangerous situation with a confused foreigner, and ultimately, falls in love himself. Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is an air hostess who comes and goes through the airport from time to time. Although she is unaware of Viktor's unique situation, they strike up an unlikely romance.The Terminal is at it's most effective during the first half of the film, as Viktor gets to know his new home. And I love the little details. Co-written by Andrew Niccols of The Truman Show, there are times where it has some of that film's brilliance. There are some fantastic subtle gags such as the cameras watching Viktor, and looking the other way when he gets suspicious. The eyes of the airport are on him always, trying to frustrate his every move, and like Truman, it is always gratifying watching Viktor come out on top.Hanks brings some of the innocent charm that made Big so entertaining to this role, and it's always interesting to watch him strike up friendships with airline personnel. I suppose because it's difficult to imagine them as people with lives, rather than just faceless drones behind a counter.One thing that makes The Terminal worth the price of admission is the sheer amount of time and effort that has gone into recreating an actual airport terminal. It was converted from a disused hangar, and includes over 2000 extras. It is so huge and multilayered that it's a marvel to behold. The sheer amount of shops and restaurants could be interpreted as product placement, but I suppose that's unavoidable, and as I said, the film makes the attempt to flesh out the people who work in those places.Inevitably for a Spielberg film, things eventually come to an uplifting ending in the vein of Frank Capra. But by that time, Hanks has won us over with his bumbling goofiness that we can't help rooting for him. Also Stanley Tucci makes an impression as the head of operations, who is always trying to find ways to get Viktor out of his airport. It's a good role because he treads a fine line between a complete villain, and a hassled bureaucrat who is in much of a bind as poor Viktor.If the ending has a fault, it's Viktor's motivations for coming to America in the first place. The payoff is a little unsatisfying, and his romance with Amelia just peters out without even an explanation. But despite these minor flaws, there is still much to savour here. Although not a perfect film, there are times where it manages to create feelings of dislocation, pleasantly reminiscent of Lost in Translation.Overall, a fantastic performance (as well as accent) from Hanks, some fine ensemble playing, and one of the most truly extraordinary set-pieces in recent memory make The Terminal an amiable and sweet tale of a man without a country.",The Terminal
133,AvidClimber,The Terminal — Endearing romantic comedy set in an international airport,8,4 January 2013,"The Terminal is an endearing romantic comedy with a slavic foreigner, played by Tom Hanks, trapped in an international airport due to an uprising in his fictive home country. That is an unorthodox setup. Add to that an uptight by-the-book security officer unhappy with those complications, and a beautiful female flight attendant, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, trapped in her role of mistress, and you get an idea of what's going to happen.It's an improbable, but possible, situation that gives rise to a number of comical scenes, very well played by Hanks. He's very believable in his role, showing a lot of work. Nice camera shot, transitions, soundtrack, and editing. Steven Spielberg knows his work. Zeta-Jones is perfect for her role, and is simply beautiful.The end had a few change in direction, which was appreciable, and even if it got a bit rosy, it was still pretty solid.On a side note, I thought I recognize our Montreal Mirabel airport, and after checking it out, it turned out to be so.Good entertainment, see it.",The Terminal

135,hokeybutt,When Spielberg Is Bad He's Very Bad...,4,11 July 2004,"THE TERMINAL (2 outta 5 stars)Wow... when Spielberg goes wrong, he *really* goes wrong.  I just found this whole film so artificial and unconvincing and uninspired.  None of the supporting characters (neither their dialogue nor their actions) seem even the slightest bit real.  Yeah, yeah, it's supposed to be a ""modern day fairy tale""... well, even fairy tales need to have people in them... and not these fake representations of humanity.  It's like that stupid boy with the fishing pole in that annoying Dreamworks logo... it's a fake, idealized image of some kind of movieland childhood that never did exist in the real world.  I think this movie would have been a lot better if it wasn't being so ""cute"" all the time.  The best scene is one where the head of airport security (Stanley Tucci) has to come to Tom Hanks' ""man without a country"" to help him translate for a crazed, knife-wielding foreigner.  I think the relationship between Hanks and Tucci needed to be a lot more adversarial to make the movie work.  Mostly, it's on the level of Hogan against Col. Klink in the old ""Hogan's Heroes"" shows.  Tucci's character is merely dislikable when he should be despised.  And Catherine Zeta-Jones?  What kind of fake, ludicrous, nonsensical hook-up is this?  What could anyone possibly see in this neurotic adulteress?   And why, oh why, do all Spielberg's latest movies have to keep going on and on after the perfect fade-out moment? Well, at least this one only goes on ten minutes too long... unlike Minority Report and A-I which went on for at least a half hour than they should have.",The Terminal

Alas, as it is we get on top of it not one but two baffling romances (one ending in a wedding after literally no relationship, one weirdly melodramatic: ""Just stay away from me, Viktor"") and an out-of-nowhere climactic plot point that's only introduced with 20 minutes left.",The Terminal
137,kdnor2011,Better than I expected.,8,1 June 2012,"Now I actually didn't expect too much from this movie, I basically just got it because I am trying to catch up on my Spielberg movies. I was just hoping for a fun little movie that I could maybe get some good laughs at, but it would be much more than that. That's kind of what happened with Catch Me if You Can, another Spielberg movie starring Tom Hanks. For most of the movie it was pretty much what I expected, but in the last half-hour, it began to exceed my expectations.What didn't I like? Well basically there isn't much bad in the film, there is just very little that's great. Although I think the film's biggest flaw is the main character, Viktor did get extremely annoying at times. It was frustrating trying to get him to communicate while he was learning English. No offense to foreigners here, but this went beyond a language barrier, this was borderline Mental Retardation. It was almost as if Hanks was playing Forrest Gump again.As for the things I liked. Well of course the direction is great, as well as the acting. I officially believe that Tom Hanks is the most likable actor ever. The dumbest thing a movie could do is get him to play the villain, because it wouldn't work. ***Warning, the rest of the paragraph contains spoilers.*** But what I loved was when it seemed they were going to go for that Rom-Com third act misunderstanding. Where the woman gets mad at Viktor for not telling him he lived in a Terminal, and it seemed like she was going to leave, and they would spend the rest of the movie moping. But they didn't. After 30 seconds of anger, they talk and she forgives him. That was brilliant! Also the villain really became a complete a**hole in the end before redeeming himself. By the end I had a smile on my face.The Termianal may not be the best from Spielberg, or Hanks, or even from the two of them together (Saving Private Ryan). But it actually exceeded my expectations, enough to where I would give it a 7.5/10.",The Terminal

140,mOVIemAN56,I didn't really buy the romance but was truly fascinated by the rest of it,7,1 July 2005,"The Terminal is another co-operation work between director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks. Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) is an Eastern European just arriving in New York. Just as he gets off his plane he learns that his country has broke out into civil war.Viktor attempts to leave JFK Airport but is not permitted to go into the city or to get onto a flight home. Viktor must now wait patiently for the war to end so he may enter the city. Viktor takes up residence in an unfinished terminal while the newly appointed director of the airport Frank Dixon becomes ever frustrated by Viktor. Viktor is able to find ways to get money and uses his skills to earn a job actually building the airport. As Viktor slowly begins to adapt to the store he befriends and interesting group of guys. One he helps to get a date with a security guard, another he plays poker with, and the third believes the man to be a CIA agent. Viktor begins to enjoy life in the airport but never forgets the promise he made to his father.As Viktor lives and works there he becomes attracted to the flight attendant Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The film is truly a tale of how waiting patiently eventually pays off. Even though the film is highly intelligent and flows very well the romance I thought was not needed. I saw no connection between Viktor and Amelia.Tom Hanks however brought the movie out of the dust. His acting job is fantastic and the heavy accent makes him sound completely different. Hanks does give one of his best performances of his career. The film is highly emotional at some scenes including the first day Viktor is stranded in the airport and the scene where he translates for the desperate immigrant with the drugs.I thought the film is a bit updated version on Hanks earlier successful film Cast Away (2000) and is almost as good. I thought it was good. The end scene does get a little corny and the romance scenes aren't to strong but well thought out. The film has a good story, a good cast, and a strong message which made it very good.The Terminal.

141,Okonh0wp,"One of Spielberg's more lightweight projects, stays in place with style",8,23 October 2005,"Spielberg can make a great story out of anything with his packages of sounds, sights, and story lines that elevate his work above that of mortal filmmakers. That being said, it's interesting to see him working his magic here on a story so devoid of movement. By that, I mean that compared to Jaws, Raiders, of the Ark or Schindler's List or even a more lightweight contraption like Catch Me if you Can, this isn't a movie where a lot of things happen. This is a slower paced movie that's really about the characters and the nuance of the arena and what more fascinating arena is there than an airport? On that level, the movie is meticulously crafted and sells the setting. Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a man from a fictitious country who through a bureaucratic glitch is trapped in John F. Kennedy Airport. It's based on a real-life story about an Iranian man who flew to Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport as the Iranian revolution occurred and found that the country listed on his passport was no longer in existence when he landed, and interestingly enough the man is still there. Historical accuracy is not this film's priority and for that matter, neither is any kind of realistic portrayal about the way an airport is run. The film is, more than anything, an abstraction: it treats the airport as not just the place we've all been through, an intermediary point on a longer journey; but as a state of mind as well. Because of that, unanswered questions about why Navorski's friends don't ever seemingly go home at the end of the day or how flight attendant Emilia Warren (Zeta-Jones) can have so much free time for a full-fledged romance on her layovers don't really need answers. The movie surrounds its protagonist with a traditional nemesis in Stanley Tucci as by-the-book airport official Frank Dixon, a love interest (Zeta-Jones), and Chi McBride, Diego Luna and Kumar Pallana as various airport employees who serve as his entrouage. In some cases, particularly with Tucci's character whose actions are seemingly guided for no other reason other than to be the opposite of those of the protagonist, the film seems to be trying too hard to fit square pegs into round holes. In the end, however, the story ties together leaving you with a warm feeling that in this case is well-earned.",The Terminal

His most popular and his most acclaimed films did not do much for me but his last 3 films, including The Terminal, has changed my mind.  The Terminal might be Spielberg's most human film to date.  I thought it was very funny and the characters did not rely on cliches.  The style of this film harks back to the days when you could not always count on a Hollywood ending.  I think that is why so many people were disappointed.  If the film ended the way of most Hollywood films, then people would be complaining about how predictable it was.  Also, many critics are complaining about excessive product placement.  The movie takes place in an airlines terminal.  The people who are doing the complaining are not giving suggestions on how not to have name brand products in this type of setting.

145,flingebunt,Your terminated sucker.....it would have been better in French.,5,9 June 2005,"Based on a true, and still continuing story of of Merhan Nasseri, and Iranian refugee living in an airport in France, this movie moves the location to New York.Which is a pity, because because there story is too French to be true about America, especially in the current climate.Tom Hanks plays another Forrest Gump type character. Victor is an innocent abroad, trapped in the International Waiting Lounge of New York airport because his country is having a civil war and his passport and visa are no longer valid (This is rather unlikely and the real story involves lost documents).So there is the first mistake, we can't put ourselves in Victor shoes, so we can't share his fear and frustration. Can you imagine traveling in another country and losing your documents (I heard of someone being stuck in Russia for 3 months after losing all his money and passport).Then the script is rather dull. There is a lot of potential, but why does airport security want to victimize him like that. France is a bureaucracy but America isn't. France will ignore someone, but America in the current climate is more likely to lock him up than let him roam around freely (law or now law, his is not a US citizen, rights don't really apply).There could be a great battle of wits, a great love story a exploration of the farce of International law....instead it tries has none of these things and has very little.It doesn't even make much of an effort to deal with the issues in America (Interestingly all the security people are either white or black with American accents, representing the false face of America, while the little people of the airport are all races and colours, all accents and represent the real America).Not a bad film, but could be much more. I think the real problem is that Spielberg, with his minimal approach to story telling, fails to direct comedy well.My final comment is that I was a stateless person for the first 10 years of my life. A movie like this should make everyone feel scared by letting them understand what this actually means. But in this it fails, so ultimately the movie is just 128 Minutes of very light entertainment.",The Terminal

Spielberg and Hanks have worked together before (SPR, CMIYC). We're definitely in safe hands. Viktor Navorski (Hanks) is a Russian man stuck in limbo. The terminal at JFK, New York becomes his home for the foreseeable future. He's not allowed to enter the country or go back to Russia, due government collapse. Viktor strives off the basics; collecting trolleys for quarters, gathering intel for a man in love and having to deal with the jealous manager Frank (Stanley Tucci).

I had the same feeling about ""Cast Away"" and it turned out to be a good movie. The question was, ""Can Tom Hanks pull it off again?"". The answer is a resounding YES! It works because the characters are so compelling and the stories are so interesting. The plot has plenty of levity, too. It makes a nuanced statement about the absurdity of bureaucracy without going over the top. Mostly, though, it is about the adaptability and resilience of some people.I thought the writing and direction were exceptional. Cinematography was good as well, even though nearly all of the movie was shot indoors. I have one minor complaint. The antagonist in the movie started with some depth and progressed toward more of a two dimensional archetype. It wasn't enough to ruin the movie, though and wasn't to the degree that is could have been.This is a very good movie with exceptional work by the supporting cast.

This time he is great as a man whose a fictitious country is in a kind of war (or something like it) which keeps him from coming back home and stepping out of JFK airport. Once he doesn't speak English he cannot communicate with others, and his creativity is the only instrument he has to make people understand him.

I don't think the film did a good enough job of suspending my disbelief because it took forever for me to get into the film and I wasn't trying to resist. A lot of story lines weren't very well kept together and most of the characters were a little hard to believe. So the writing wasn't very strong. On the other hand, the direction and the acting by Hanks was pretty strong (Hanks gets better the more he gets to speak English). I think it kept the film from becoming a waste of time.

151,Pookyiscute,One of the best films of the year,10,7 January 2006,"It may not have done well at the box office, but this light romantic comedy, is more than that. In fact, I don't even think you could really call it a romantic comedy. It's more a drama about real life, and as far-fetched as it may seem as a realistic story, it could happen, and is cleverly told as a tale.Arriving at JFK one sunny afternoon, Viktor Navorski (Hanks), goes to the customs booth to get his passport stamped, so that he can enter the land of the free, and the home of the brave. Coming from a country which has been made up for the film, but is similar to an eastern Europe-Russian-Ukranian sort of a country, he does not speak more than a few words in English that he has written down to help him around town. He goes to the head of the airport's office, to speak to them, or more accurately to have them speak to him, and they tell him that because there is a war going on with his country, he does not ""exist"". Until the war in his country is resolved, they cannot allow him to enter the country, but they also cannot allow him to travel back to his homeland, either. He is a resident of the terminal, now. He is given food vouchers, but they can only last so long, and only has the luggage he's been carrying around and the clothes on his back.The story-line as I said, may sound unreasonably unrealistic, and it may even sound boring, but it is anything but. It is a beautiful piece of work. It will make you laugh, cry and touch your soul at certain parts. It is a human drama, that is not to be taken lightly. It is one of the best films I've ever had the privilege of seeing, and I don't think I could ever get tired of watching it.Cathrine Zeta-Jones co-leads with Tom Hanks, and plays the beautiful stewardess that he has fallen in love with.

It should be given applauds for the imagination and cleverness that it carries, and everyone involved in the film, whether it be the cast, crew, director, writer or cinematographer, should be complimented on their work.I recommend to everyone.

154,D_Burke,"Excellent, Underrated Film- The ""It's A Wonderful Life"" of the 21st Century",10,26 January 2009,"""The Terminal"" is a movie that opened in theaters in the summer of 2004, quickly disappeared, and has sort of gotten a bad rap ever since. I saw it on DVD in November 2004, shortly before Thanksgiving, and absolutely fell in love with the film. I say it's the ""It's A Wonderful Life"" of the 21st Century because the two films have a lot in common. They were both directed by A-List directors, had an A-List actor as the lead, are feel good films, initially didn't do as well at the box office as they should have, and would not seem out of place when played during the holidays. In at least a decade from now, this film will be considered a modern day classic. Mark my words.So why was it so great? First and foremost, Tom Hanks played Viktor Navorski so well, and sold every scene he was in. Hanks never played a foreigner before, or at least not one that didn't speak much English. Here, he pulled off something not many other actors could do. Not only did his character not speak very much English, but you could really see in Hanks' eyes the fear, confusion, and oblivion of being stranded in a foreign country with little means, and through no fault of his own. There aren't many other American actors who could do that good a job at acting the role so convincingly.Stanley Tucci was also relatively flawless in his performance as Frank Dixon, director of the Homeland Security branch of the JFK Airport. Tucci has a difficult role here as the straight man, not to mention the occasional bad guy in some situations. However, Tucci never misses a beat, and this role could be regarded as his best so far. Often times, I found myself wondering why Frank Dixon wanted Navorski out of the terminal, then towards the end didn't want him to go to New York. I'm sure there's an explanation somewhere, but this one plot inconsistency didn't ruin my enjoyment of the film at all.The interactions between Frank Dixon and Viktor Navorski are classic, and often times very funny. Probably the best scene between him and Hanks, besides when they first meet, are when Hanks is brought in to translate for the Russian immigrant with pills for his father. Very few scenes make me laugh and cry at the same time, but that one is one of them. It's just a truly remarkable and poignant scene.Also noteworthy in scenes with both Tucci and Hanks is Barry Shabaka Henley, who played chief officer Thurman. Henley is one of those character actors whose name isn't known, but you immediately see him and say, ""Yeah, I remember him. He was in 'Collateral', and he was also in 'What's Love Got To Do With It'"". He's a good actor, and really shines in this movie.Additionally, Catherine Zeta-Jones was pretty good in her role. Her character kind of came and went, but she played well opposite Hanks and there was an interesting love story there until the end. Chi McBride, Diego Luna, and Kumar Pallana also provided some great comic relief, but also scenes of heartbreaking poignancy.Apart from the acting, the set design was incredible. Research shows that the movie was shot almost entirely on a set, not in the JFK Airport. If I hadn't researched that fact myself, I wouldn't have known. Some may argue that showing the stores such as the Sharper Image, Burger King, and Borders were shameful product placement, but they really added a hugely realistic element to the movie.For a movie with a moderately big budget ($60 million), it's surprising to me that the DVD release of the film (at least initially) has a nice menu, but no special features whatsoever. There's no ""making of"" documentaries (although one did air on HBO prior to the film's release), no director's or actor's commentary, and no deleted scenes. Regardless, it's a DVD that I make it a point to watch at least once a year, if not twice (and I watch a lot of movies, mind you). It's just that good. Besides the acting and the set design, the movie just tells an excellent story. It has not gotten the credit it deserves yet, but it will soon. It's a superb film, and I highly recommend it. Easily one of the best films of this decade (2000-2009) so far.",The Terminal
155,anhedonia,Unrealistic scenes from an airport mall,5,23 June 2004,"As the end credits rolled I wondered how much of Andrew Niccol's original idea remained in the final cut. I maybe wrong, but something tells me Niccol's vision might have been sharper, edgier. Because ""The Terminal"" comes off as just too fluffy for something he'd devise.Although the film's inspired by the true story of an Iranian immigrant who's lived at Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport since 1988, Steven Spielberg's made a slight comedy that doesn't contain an ounce of reality. It's occasionally amusing, if 25 minutes too long.Tom Hanks' Viktor is a lovable lug. He waddles through the international terminal at JFK Airport and ingratiates himself with the people. Hanks fits the role well - then again, he could play these earnest guys in his sleep. It's nothing we haven't seen from him before.Catherine Zeta-Jones does capably as Amelia Warren, a flight attendant who keeps bumping into Viktor. The problem with Zeta-Jones is that whatever role she plays, be it a cat burglar or a musically inclined jailed murderess, the audience is always aware that it's the Zeta-Jones on the screen. She never wholly envelops a role.Throughout ""The Terminal"" I kept wondering what another actress, one with more dramatic depth, say, Michelle Pfeiffer or Uma Thurman, might have done with Amelia, how much more resonant and engaging the Viktor-Amelia relationship might have been.There's some fine supporting work from Kumar Pallana as Gupta, the Indian janitor, and Barry Shabaka Henley, as an airport security officer.Despite some giant plot holes, the film works when it occasionally delves into the other world that exists within the airport - this subterranean netherworld of baggage handlers, construction workers, food service people, janitors, customs officials and late-night poker games.But there aren't any moments in this film that feel real. This is all fantasy - from improbable romances to lapses in logic to the ""Oh well, aw shucks"" denouement. (By the way, this film has too many endings.)This JFK airport doesn't seem as frenetic a place as it should be; the only bit of anguish is early in the film when Viktor rushes from one TV screen to another looking at war footage from his homeland and being unable to find out what's happening.Spielberg gives the film such an airy feel that he misses golden opportunities to comment about how airports have essentially turned into malls where planes fly out and land, as well our treatment of immigrants these days, especially if they're Arab. There's absolutely no sense of a post-9/11 America in this airport. One line of dialogue briefly hints about the issue: Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), the acting chief of airport security, says, ""They've detained so many people there's no room anywhere"" when he fails to get Viktor sent to a federal detention center.""Compassion is the foundation of this country,"" a character tells Dixon. We know that's not always the case post-9/11. But this film is so enraptured by its manufactured whimsy that it doesn't care to probe the issue any deeper, even in the background.One thing you will notice: how prominently Burger King, Borders and United Airlines feature throughout the massive set that was built. Ya gotta love product placement. (Maybe it will help United crawl out of bankruptcy.)This comedy doesn't pack huge laughs. Instead, it opts for occasionally amusing vignettes that might make you smile. It's not a terrible way to spend time (""Connie and Carla"" anyone?), but it could have been much more rewarding and less disappointing, considering the tremendous talent involved in front of and behind the camera. A bit more reality and a little less fable would have worked wonders without losing any of the story's magic.",The Terminal
156,tributarystu,Light induced,7,13 September 2004,"As crazy as it may sound this really is another movie with Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. America's lovebirds come together for this peculiar and amusing, even though a bit light, comedy about a man who's stuck in...you guessed it, the terminal. The premise sounded incredibly good, albeit I forgot to think it all out a bit: how COULD you do this both funny and intelligent? And, furthermore, how did this fit in Spielberg's schedule?Well, it seems it fit very well. Catherine Zeta, Tom and Steven got around for a few days of filming and put together this nearly satirical comedy. It was just what Spielberg liked: big actors, interesting script and a movie for the whole family. So he lowered his magic wand and made it into another Forrest Gump. The comparison is a bit rough, but you might see a glimpse of Forrest while watching and listening to Viktor Novorski: a naive, a bit clumsy, sincere and good-hearted guy who, due to his lack of certain language skills, leaves the impression of being a bit...behind. Unfortunately his traits fit the profile I was talking about.The first fifteen minutes is where I found the best scenes of the film, but do not fear, for scattered throughout the film you shalt find others. Ideologically speaking, I really couldn't add up the parts of this here production: the story of a homeless and unwanted man, the great human spirit within and the less than redeeming love story. It feels strange. The so called love story is the absolute low point: it's distant and shallow, something Mel Brooks might call ""love uninspired"" (talking of which, I ask myself how a guy who could barely speak English, was able to read books about Napoleon which were thousands of pages long). Catherine let me down, because I expected a bit more from her performance, but in the end it's so short that it doesn't even matter. The terrible guy in charge, senor Dixon (Stanley Tucci), is the pain in the buttocks, total opposite of hard working and high spirited Novorski whose sole purpose it is to annoy us.And what's the basis of the journey, you might ask. It definitely can't be something normal, can it? Well I fear that although it wants to be different, the whole story is short of genuine.The movie is weak. But! it is fun to watch and relaxing, feel good material. It might be a disappointment coming from Spielberg who, it struck me, gave a strong impression at times that a beam of light can take you from America to Honolulu and back, but it really depends on whether the croissant really does come from Romania or not. I'll have to check this out one happier day. In the meantime, where could one go with the speed of light? 6.5/10",The Terminal
157,MovieGuy109,"Pretty nice, well-meaning movie",7,22 October 2011,"Steven Spielberg comes off a bunch of science-fiction yarns to this romantic comedy. Acceptance is the key to this light-hearted, simple-minded film. There are countless flaws in the storytelling like what is Hanks' country, which is never mentioned. The movie itself is like a puff of cool air on a hot summer day, nice but forgettable. Yet Spielberg seems to understand that this is just fluff entertainment and unlike countless movies like this it does not take itself too seriously. That ease in storytelling and makes this piece of fluffy romantic comedy an enjoyable affair that you cannot help but get swept up in.",The Terminal

159,jackgdemoss,Light-hearted comedy that did not stand the test of time,5,25 September 2021,"2004 was peak Tom Hanks stardom and this casting choice embodies that ideal perfectly. It was jarring at first to see him in this role and it took me out of the movie. That being said, after about an hour even I had succumb to Hanks' ever-impressive ability to sink into a role.With the above praise in mind, this movie was still not a great watch. The first 20 minutes were actively frustrating as the language barrier bit that was attempted was far too drawn out. The rest of the movie has some fun elements and one particularly hilarious delivery on a joke by Hanks, but otherwise fails. This is comedy that simply didn't age well.",The Terminal

Would have been great to see him return to the airport and have a big goodbye with the staff having fulfilled his goals.
Still a wonderful movie.",The Terminal
161,Brogan,Another enjoyable film from Mr. Spielberg! (Possible Spoilers),10,12 June 2004,"There is something that I was educated about Steven Spielberg 13 years ago right before HOOK was released. Not every Spielberg film is going to be a classic. When there is a new and upcoming Spielberg film, audiences are anticipating for it to be another classic, like JAWS, RAIDERS, E.T., etc. I, at least learned that not every Spielberg film is going to be a classic. The film however, is at least going to be good. That way my expectations are not raised that high. And when a movie like SCHINDLER'S LIST, or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN come along, I will be pleasantly surprised, and wind up loving the film.The past ten years, Spielberg's films range from the classic (SCHINDLER'S LIST, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, AMISTAD, & MINORITY REPORT); underrated and deserves at least two viewings (A.I. & LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK); and highly entertaining (JURASSIC PARK, and CATCH ME IF YOU CAN). Spielberg isn't trying to make every movie a classic, he's trying to at least be entertaining. With that said, Spielberg's latest film, THE TERMINAL, falls under the highly entertaining category.TERMINAL tells the story of Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks), a immigrant from a fictional Eastern European country who is visiting America for the first time. When Viktor arrives at the immigration office at the New York City airport, he is informed to report to the office of one of the Homeland Security chiefs, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci). Dixon informs Viktor that his home country's government is under attacked, Viktor's visa into the U.S. isn't accepted, while Viktor can not return to his native land. Dixon's solution is to have Viktor wait at the airport, possibly illegally sneak out of the airport onto American soil, and have immigration officers worry about Viktor's fate.Viktor, however decides to at least apply for a travel visa, with the immigration office, getting rejected at every visit. Viktor knows that he can't return home and doesn't want to break any laws, decides to wait for a legal approval to enter into the U.S. While waiting, Viktor meets and befriends some of the airport terminal employees. There a shy food server (Diego Luna) who's secretly in love with one of the INS officers (Zoe Saldana) . Gupta Rajan, the rude janitor (played by Wes Anderson regular Kumar Pallana) who thinks that Viktor is possibly a intelligence officer, while he takes pleasure watching the dashing passengers ignore the ""wet floor"" signs as they slip on the wet floor. A baggage handler (Chi McBride) who sees Viktor as being harmless. And Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an airline stewardess who has dated several men (including married men), yet finds normal attraction in Viktor.From taking my Spielberg/Lucas class a few years ago, analyzing the themes and subtext messages in Spielberg's films, TERMINAL is more or less a film about a man moving into a new neighborhood. Similar to previous films done about a new figure moving into town and changing the lives of everybody (CHOCOLATE & THE MAJESTIC as recent examples). TERMINAL does follow that familiar plot element. Except, this time the hero doesn't move into a town, but an airport terminal instead.Yet, like a town there is a assortment of personalities: the timid and shy young man who loves the girl who is so caught up in her career; the humorous and cool older man; the grumpy and misunderstood elderly gentleman; the antagonist who sees the hero as a threat; and the very beautiful woman that the hero falls in love with. If it sounds like a Frank Capra film, then no surprise it is. However, remember that Spielberg was highly influenced by Capra-Corn.I enjoyed the performances in TERMINAL, with Hanks proving again that he is one of the greatest actors working in cinema. The first 30 minutes of the film, Hanks does a fantastic job playing Viktor as a man who doesn't understand or speak much English. One scene that stands out with Hanks' performance is when Viktor finds out for the first time about a military coup going on in his homeland from the cable news reports. Hanks gives a marvelous performance with his character showing pain, anxiety, fear, confusion, and sadness all at the same time. I mean, darn it, that scene had me in tears when I was watching it, you can't help but feel sorry for the guy.The supporting performance in TERMINAL are also quite good. Stanley Tucci gives another good role playing the man who insists that he is doing the right thing, despite being the only person who thinks that. Diego Luna, Chi McBride, Kumar Pallana, and Barry Shabaka Henley do all give superb performances. I did feel that Catherine Zeta-Jones also gave a good job, yet I personally would have like to have seen more of her character.The amazing thing with TERMINAL is the set design, reconstructing the airport terminal. Since Spielberg couldn't shoot at a real airport, he constructed a fictional terminal from a airplane hanger. And looking at the terminal, you would think it was real. I knew before hand that the terminal was only a set. Yet, I did enjoy overhearing other audience members whispering to each other ""is that LAX? Kennedy? or Logan Airport?"" Set designer Anne Kuljian and Production Designer Alex McDowell did a fantastic job creating a realistic airport terminal. With the arrival/departure reader board with the flapping letters & numbers; to the massive amount of stores and restaurants. The terminal features Borders Books, Burger King, Sbarro Pizza, Nathan's Hot Dogs, Discovery Channel Store, Hugo's, and even a Verizon Wireless Phone store (it's only fitting since the Verizon spokesperson is the co-star of the film. On a side note: it would have been funny to see Zeta-Jones' character leave the Verizon store shaking her phone and complaining that particular store's cellular phones do not work. But since this summer has been filled with massive special effects extravaganzas, it is nice to see a film again that focuses on characters and not visuals. So far, I would say that THE TERMINAL is the most enjoyable film this summer (along with HARRY POTTER & THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN). Like the past summer's from the previous years, it is fun to see big lavish movies like SPIDER-MAN, PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN, MINORITY REPORT, and X-2. But then it's very comforting that plot/character driven films like ROAD TO PERDITION and SEABISCUIT are also released. And that is exactly what TERMINAL is, a highly entertaining plot/character driven film. It is not a Spielberg classic, but it is very enjoyable and entertaining. And that's good enough for me! ***** (out of five)",The Terminal
162,j-lacerra,Squirminal,1,27 January 2005,"This is clearly one of the worst movies you will ever have the misfortune to see that stars a masterful actor (Tom Hanks) and was turned out by a respected and fantastically successful director (Steven Spielberg).Here the ridiculous premise is populated with the usual suspects: government officials that are either evil, incompetent, or both; workers who are just too stupid to be believed; spoiled and uncaring Americans. The only exception is the pretty immigration clerk (someone Saltana), whose pretty brightness shines through Spielberg's attempt to make her a mindless bureaucrat. The Indian janitor is just annoying in his stupid suspiciousness, and his luggage and food handling buddies make Cro-Magnons seem like geniuses.No, not a single character to like or identify with. Even Hanks, at his skillful best, cannot breath any sympathy into the character of the moronic Navorsky.Why, when the Feds find Navorsky cannot understand English do they communicate with him exclusively in that language? Why are they trying to starve him into breaking the law? Why was Catherine Zeta-Jones even in the picture? Why is every person walking through the airport so uniformly ignorant? Does Spielberg really think so poorly of his fellow Americans? After the first five minutes, I was looking at my watch and wondering if the movie was ever going to end. I squirmed through the entire first hour and finally said to myself, I don't care about any of these people, and life is too darn short to waste on this piece of garbage!",The Terminal
163,GirishGowda,Really Funny and Moving,8,20 May 2010,"I didn't know that this movie was directed by Steven Spielberg until the final credits came on screen. Though this movie has come so many times on TV, I only watched it today. I wasn't interested in it all that much before. This is a really funny and moving film.Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) from Krakozhia enters into the US JFK terminal. Before leaving for New York, there comes a news that there is war going on internally in his country. So, now he is a citizen of nowhere and has to stay at the airport till there is peace in his own country. In the terminal, he struggles for food, place to sleep and meets good people and falls for Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is an air hostess. But Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) does everything he can to get Viktor out of his airport and hand him over to the authorities. He makes close friends in Gupta Rajan, a sweeper, and Enrique Cruz and another man. Why does he want to go to the Big Apple so badly? And will his romance with Amelia have an happy ending? And will he take the bait of Frank Dixon? The shot in the beginning where the camera zooms from Viktor's face to show us the entire lounging area is so heart-breaking. Even though he's surrounded by people, he is all alone. Directed by the visual effects master Steven Spielberg, this is quite different from the other films he has directed (atleast the ones I have seen). He addresses the discrimination that some outsiders face in the US. Viktor is very funny in his childlike innocence. Sometimes he reminded me of Mr. Bean. Tom Hanks portrayed Viktor wonderfully. Stanley Tucci is a great actor and he does justice to his role. In the ending scene, you can actually see that he is happy for Viktor. This is the man who did everything to make Viktor's life at the airport miserable. Though nobody will keep an outsider for 9 months in a terminal, it was a good fantasy film. Catherine Zeta-Jones, God this woman doesn't look a day over 25 years; she is so beautiful. She conveyed everything that her character felt through her eyes and tears. I was pretty moved by this film. One can't, but root for Viktor and hope against hope that he gets what he wants. Dolores Torres (Zoe Saldana) is a security authority at the airport and she also has a sweet love story. I recently became her fan after Star Trek and Avatar. She is extremely talented and beautiful. All I can say, this film will not bore for you even for one second and it is very entertaining.8/10",The Terminal

Here he plays the role of Viktor Novorski who arrives at and is held at JFK airport for political reasons he cannot leave the airport now, he is not allowed to enter and visit New York, he cant go home either, he cannot even be sent to prison. He is a nowhere man. This film should make the ideal family movie. America thinks way to highly of itself. And I happen to hate bureaucracy more than anything else.

There is a lot about the movie that made me go, ""Wait a minute..."" but all in all, it was a good story and I was able to overlook many of the sillier events.  Tom Hanks is so good that I kept forgetting that he's not really an Eastern European.  I had read that his accent left something to be desired...I don't agree.  I do that that Catherine Zeta-Jones had a distracting accent, however. Sometimes she sounded like she had a slight southern twang and other times that was absent. This was a largely character driven story, and I thought that all of the actors did a great job.  I cared about the airport employees--and Stanley Tucci had us laughing so hard at what a jerk he had to be.  I didn't find it slow at all...maybe just a bit more quiet.  It's not slapstick, although there's quite a bit of slipping and falling on a wet floor, if that's what makes you laugh (I have to admit I did laugh at the people falling down...).  Not the best movie I've ever seen, but not horrible as many reviews have complained.  I recommend this one to those who enjoy a good story.",The Terminal
167,mr_popcorn,"McCheesy's take on ""The Terminal""",8,26 August 2008,"While Viktor Navorski is en route to the U.S. to fulfill a wish of his late father's, there is a coup in the Eastern European country in which he lives. When he lands at JFK, he learns that his country is no longer recognized by the U.S. so he cannot enter - and he can't go home either, because all planes to his country are canceled. While waiting in this limbo, Viktor takes up residence in JFK Terminal and learns another definition of home.Okay first off, this is not Spielberg's worst film ever as some people might tell you. I think ""War of the Worlds"" is his worst or even the newly-released ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"". Admittedly it is not his best film ever. 'The Terminal' is a film in-between if we're talking about Steven Spielberg's film slate. The dialogue and the script wasn't that bad and I wouldn't consider Tom Hanks' accent as rubbish. The story will hook you from the minute it starts up until the end. Spielberg and crew has managed to balance a fine line between the dramatic parts and the comedic timing without one overlapping the other. Tom Hanks' portrayal as the man from the fictional country Krakozhia was effective in my opinion. His likability as an actor was effortlessly transitioned in his Navorski character.'The Terminal' is an 8.",The Terminal

Only Spielberg could make a movie like this, filmed entirely at the airport that he built completely from scratch including all the stores. Tom Hanks is spectacular in this movie while barely speaking english for the entire movie.  Catherine Zeta is simply wonderful and gorgeous as usual.

170,gazineo-1,Castaway in an airport,6,24 September 2004,"'Terminal, The' is another encounter between Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. This time, Mr Hanks plays a tourist from western Europe who has to stay inside the airport of New York because his country of origin falls in a cruel Civil War and the government fall under the Revolutionary forces. So, in good International Law Terms, Mr. Viktor Navorski (the parsonage played by Hanks) is a completely 'not wanted' visitor in USA. Many reviews said that this movie is a kind of protest against the American intolerance against other nations of the world after the grievous events of September 11. And that would be the great idea of Spielberg: to make a popular and blockbuster movie that goes against the course of the political moment in USA. Maybe it's true but the force of the message - in this particular case - is not so evident or strong to make 'Terminal, The' a political movie. In fact, the movie resembled sometimes a bit like some Frank Capra classics. A simple-minded story with a simple-minded character involved, against his will, in a difficult and pathetic situation. In this way, Spielberg made a routine movie, with a competent although not brilliant story.'Terminal, The' has a uneven narrative, with some good moments and some others not so compelling. The support cast gives great moments, especially the old janitor, he too a foreigner who came from India. But the love affair between Vicktor and Amelia, a beautiful steward (played without bright by Zeta-Jones) is far-fetched and just boring. Another problem is the character of Dixon, the Supervisor of the airport, played by Stanley Tucci. Although Tucci is a correct actor, his character is almost unreal in his insensibility and bureaucratic attitudes. 'Terminal, The' in my opinion is far from a masterpiece or even a movie that deserves a special attention. Tom Hanks, maybe the best American actor in activity, made the show like always. Now, he's a castaway imprisoned inside the walls of an international airport. But again he made us fly away with his rare talent.",The Terminal

It's full of simplicity, sweetness and humanity.After Spielberg made us jump at Saving Private Ryan and Jurassic Park, and after he made us afraid to go into the water with Jaws, and after he made us cry with E.T. and Schindler's List, the famous director decides to settle down. It wasn't a bad choice.The Terminal is something you can just sit back, watch and enjoy. You don't have to rack your brain for answers to the twists. You won't have to cover your eyes and the gore, or worry about crying in front of your friends. All you have to do is watch.The Terminal is a simple movie, but in a good way. It doesn't use CGI and action scenes to cover up its simplicity, like some other movies. It knows that it is simple, and easy to understand, so it's easier to watch.The Terminal doesn't overdo anything at all! The jokes keep humane and sweet, without profanity, sexual references, stupidity or unnecessary buildup. It doesn't try to be the best film you've ever seen, but the result may be something close. It's creative. The storyline is new (while not exactly perfect) and the characters are fun. Tom Hanks uses his acting skills and creativity to play Viktor Navorski, who uses his creativity to survive in the airport. He meets people and he helps them with their lives, and eventually changes the airport a bit.The film is funny, but also romantic. Viktor falls in love with a struggling woman named Amelia. You have no choice but to smile at the sweetness.But, that's not all. The Terminal is touching, and you will feel passion and warmth in your heart when you watch. It may be a bit melancholy at first, when Viktor arrives at the airport, and is scared, but later becomes romantic. The ending is touching too. The happy ending will make you smile.I know I am mostly copying Roger Ebert, so I'll add in something original.The Terminal is also about how the man changes the airport. After the line ""You can learn something from him"" (Of course, it's talking about Viktor.) the film shows the impact of one man in one place. His sense of justice and good-heartedness changes the airport in a small way. Tom Hank's performance is Oscar-worthy. There haven't been many feel-good films since his famous ""Forrest Gump.""

The unintentionally funny part is him learning to speak English in 2 days.

Then I remember that, no, I don't consider myself a cynic, so it's something wrong with the movie. And boy, is there a lot wrong with this movie. The first 30-40 minutes are actually quite good. Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, an immigrant from a fictional Eastern European country named Krakohzia who finds himself with an invalid passport upon his arrival in New York, and since he cannot set foot on America soil without a working passport, he is confined to the airport for an indeterminate time period. Hanks is, of course, great, and the swooping camerawork that follows him through the gigantic terminal with all the flashing lights, fast food and souvenir stores is excellent. We can feel Viktor's confusion and helplessness, and the hints he picks up about how to make life in an airport more tolerable are amusing. Then the movie begins to wander, aimlessly. Lame subplots are brought in to pass the time, like Viktor playing matchmaker for a friendly airport employee (Diego Luna) and a predictably tough-on-the-outside, tender-on-the-inside INS agent (Zoe Saldana). This subplot is weak to begin with, then is dropped entirely for nearly an hour before wrapping up in a nauseatingly cutesy way. That's the other major problem: the sappiness. Spielberg's always been eager to lay on the sappiness in many of his films, and it really kills ""The Terminal"". A very good and intelligent film could have been made with this story and cast (which also includes Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci, Chi McBride and Kumar Pallana), but after the promising beginning it heads right into sappy, cliched, unrealistic nonsense. Interestingly, it's loosely based on the true story of Iranian refugee Merhan Nasseri's experiences at France's Charles De Gaulle airport. I'm guessing that's VERY loosely. That is, unless Nasseri became a working class hero for the staff, had fun foiling the fussy jerk in head of security (Tucci) and had a starry-eyed romance with a flaky stewardess (Zeta-Jones) complete with cornball speeches in front of a gleaming, hand-made water fountain. Yeah yeah, I know it's supposed to be whimsical. I still say there's a big difference between whimsy (which requires intelligence and a light touch) and a movie like ""The Terminal"" which irritatingly condescends to the audience by turning what could have been a fascinating film into a pandering, phony, mush-fest. Hanks and Zeta-Jones are both quite good, but the movie itself is a huge waste of time. After the overrated ""Catch Me If You Can"" and this mess, maybe Spielberg should stay away from comedy.",The Terminal

Viktor Navorski is visiting New York in homage to his late fathers memory, collecting a missing musicians autograph, to complete his fathers collection of autographs. (The description of the film describes him as an 'Eastern Immigrant' for some reason - he was visiting the U.S. not emmigrating to the U.S.) Due to political upheaval at home, he is made a person of no nationality. He cannot step outside the airport or he will be arrested but he can stay in the airport. Alright we can swallow this in the name of artistic license.The nasty airport boss wants him gone, but clever Viktor learns to earn his keep within the airport helped by sympathetic employees. All along I kept thinking Viktor would turn out to be something great, a nobel prize winning physicist or something. That the nasty airport boss thought he was picking on a 'little guy'. Only to be revealed to be a big man. But no, he's just a foreign ordinary guy trying to obtain the last autograph missing in fathers jazz musicians autograph collection. Fair enough, if rather boring. Catherine Zeta Jones wanders in an out of the airport as a slut Stewardess embroiled in an affair with a married man. she becomes friends with Viktor. OK, but again rather boring. The nasty airport boss keeps trying to 'get' Viktor but with the help of sympathetic airport employees he makes it outside to get his autograph and his countries political upheaval settles down again. It's not terrible, just boring, certainly disappointing offering from Hanks/Spielberg",The Terminal
176,oshram-3,"Good, but could have been great",7,19 June 2004,"The names Spielberg and Hanks are nearly synonymous with quality films, and certainly when teamed together (Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me if You Can). I was a tad surprised a movie like The Terminal was being released in the summer  when I first saw the trailer about a month ago I assumed it was a fall release  but this film ought to do well no matter what the season.The set-up is simple: Hanks plays Viktor Navorsky, a simple man from one of the break- away Russian Republics whose country collapses while he's in mid-air. Once he arrives in JFK, they don't know what to do with him; they can't send him back, and they can't let him in. He's a man without a country, and customs boss Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) is a die-hard by-the-book kind of guy who is determined not to break any laws in his handling of Navorsky's case. Along the way a stewardess falls into Viktor's life (literally) in the form of the dazzling Catherine-Zeta-Jones.The premise is somewhat thin, so we must rely primarily on Hanks to carry the picture by himself, which he's already proven he can do (Castaway, et al), and here he does not disappoint. Hanks is charming as Navorsky, who is a simple man caught in a complicated puzzle with no idea how to get himself out. Viktor makes friends with various workers at the terminal, and his interactions with them are amusing; he helps bring one couple together, and he gets to know another fugitive from a foreign land. His semi-relationship with Amelia (Jones) is very well done and thankfully has a few twists in it to make it a little unpredictable.Spielberg also does a lot with a movie that, let's face it, only has a few different sets, even if one of them is a sprawling mall complex. Unlike Viktor, we never feel confined by the movie, but we begin to see the airport as a self-contained little world, much as Viktor does. He continually turns adversity into opportunity, which helps to explain why being confined does not bother him so much.But Viktor is a little too good. He's honest, hard-working, helpful, unassuming  he's everything we Americans like to think we are but rarely manage to be in reality. As is usual in a Spielberg film, Viktor's benevolent attitude toward people ends up coming back to him in spades, and he ends up being a sort of unofficial hero of the terminal. But Viktor never breaks down or has a moment of anger (which would be natural in such a case) and his optimism never fades, not even for a second. While it's a nice performance by Hanks, Viktor's just a little too good to be true.Stanley Tucci also does an excellent job, but like many authority figures in Spielberg films, he's a little two-dimensional. He alone grows increasingly personally annoyed with Viktor's successes, one after the other, and he constantly tries to thwart the man. Dixon is the opposite of Viktor, a man unaware that his own negative actions will come back on him; but that rings a little hollow in a situation where Viktor is such the everyman that people can't help but be drawn to him. Only someone inhuman could fail to respond to the perfect Viktor, and Dixon's increasing anger comes off as a bit petulant after a while.The film is certainly worth going to see; there are some very funny and touching moments in it, and one sub-plot's resolution pleased me greatly toward the end. Hanks gives a winning performance and both Tucci and Jones are able to match him, no easy feat. But the film's a shade too black and white to be an emotional powerhouse; even one scene of Viktor losing his temper, even if he were all alone, would have helped. The Terminal is an enjoyable film, certainly worth going to see, but honestly I expected something a little more complicated and a little less obvious given the magnitude of the talent involved.",The Terminal

178,jrfranklin01,Stuck like Chuck,7,30 June 2004,"Can you imagine spending nine months or more stuck in an airport?  I can't stand even walking through them much less living there.  For Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) in The Terminal that is exactly what he has to do - live in an airport.  Due to some international fiasco between his home country and the United States, he cannot be granted a VISA and allowed into the country.  They cannot return him home either due to a rebellion that is going on. Therefore, he is stuck in the limbo land of a catch 22.For something so simple as a story about a guy being stuck in an airport, Steven Spielberg delivers quite a great story.  How bad can a guy's luck get when he is forced to bathe in a public restroom?  Or when his bed is made of a bunch of seats?To make matters worse he falls in love with a flight attendant, Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta Jones) who seems destined to pick the wrong men in her life.  What occurs thereafter is serious of comedic misadventures of a man who tries to occupy himself in an airport as best he can while under the watch of a ruthless airport security overseer (Stanley Tucci).This movie is an upside-down love story, a tragedy, and above all else a comedy.  Aside from an unexpected ending, it delivers a nicely told tale of a simple man's delayed journey to America.",The Terminal
179,noizyme,"Sweet, tear-jerker that sums up Hanks' performances",7,24 November 2004,"Tom Hanks is known as the character-actor that brings out the kid in us through his performances on screen, and this movie is no exception. Hanks plays a foreign visitor from Krakozhia, which happens to not be recognized by the U.S. government at the time due to war in the country. Because the country is not recognized, he cannot get a visa into the U.S., so Hanks is forced to sleep in the terminal of this New York airport until further information is gathered for him. He meets people who work in the airport and tries to get a job when he finds a girl who steals his heart and leads him on a path of discovery in the American culture of work and friendship.This is a sweet movie, like most of Hanks', with a lot of endearing moments for his character when you see his willingness to stay and change with his surroundings. I think some people saw this as a political film, largely because of the specific laws involved with releasing foreign visitors to the U.S. soil, and the timing to put this movie out after all of the talk of war, elections, and trusts being juggled around was a bit controversial. I loved the idea of showing how much trust to give this man and allowing him to stay in a terminal instead of locking him up for actions that he never made against anyone.The movie looses touch with reality (making this a great sob-film by tugging at the IL' heart-strings) when it gets around the end, and all this man wants to do is one simple thing and then wants to leave the city. That didn't really appeal to me. And, as great as Catherine Zeta Jones was in this film, Jones had almost uncanny expressions like those used by Meg Ryan in all of the movies the her and Hanks were known for. That felt a bit eerie, I must say.Overall, I gave the pretty typical vote of 7/10 (like most are giving it at this time of writing this) for the sweetness, timing, acting, and originality. Definitely rent this now that it is on DVD (although don't expect much from the special features right away...the copy I have doesn't have that many.)",The Terminal
180,Pavel-8,A Terminal-ly ill script grounds the best efforts of Spielberg and Hanks.,5,16 March 2005,"Steven Spielberg. Tom Hanks. Catherine Zeta-Jones. This movie can't miss. Right? Right?! Um...wrong.""The Terminal"" has a promising premise. Based on a true story, Tom Hanks is Viktor Navorski, an Eastern European immigrant stuck in the terrestrial version of Dante's limbo, a New York City airport, after a civil war breaks out in his home country. All he wants to do is fulfill a nebulous mission, but standing in his way is the airport's expedient head of security (Stanley Tucci), all of which sets up a standard fish-out-of-water story that has its moments but ultimately falls short.Mildly reminiscent of ""Cast Away"", Hanks occasionally shines as a character out of his element, as his attention to small things and everyman qualities allow the viewer to play along as he scrapes by in an airport. (Besides, who hasn't been stuck in an airport for what seems like forever?) However his selective understanding of English raises eyebrows with its convenience, which is perhaps the overriding problem with ""Terminal"". Similarly, everything is simply too conducive to the direction of the story, without providing a foundation for such progression. Need two people to fall in love? Oh look, they happen to share a quirky passion. Need to jump ahead days or weeks? Thirty seconds of filler should suffice. Plus the partial truths and misunderstandings create the feeling of a teen comedy with a grown-up cast. ultra-realism isn't necessary, but too many decisions and communications (or lack thereof) are simply too implausible to take seriously.In less capable hands, ""Terminal"" would have been unbearably buttery due to such faults; but the solid lead work of Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones, accompanied by good-as-usual supporting actors like Tucci, creates at least marginally interesting characters. Overall though, the characters hit one note and little more. Those notes are usually played well, but soon grow monotonous. Director Steven Spielberg's uncanny, sometimes grating, ability to generate emotional power also contributes to the enjoyability, which doesn't reach full speed until the final act, despite the attempts of John Williams's pleasantly upbeat score to zip the movie forward.This is because the motivation of Hanks's character is absent for first 90 minutes of the film. The idea is presumably to lure the audience along while wondering why, but the question is staged as a side attraction rather than the main event. Once revealed, that story arc finishes strong, but the film is then so far behind that it can't catch up, like a late but futile kick down the stretch of a track race.Like its main character who is limited by his surroundings, ""The Terminal"" perseveres with what meager sustenance it has, but in the end not even the prominent talent of the participants can launch the movie past its mediocre story. The script surely looked much better on paper than on screen, and the movie reflects that, promising so much yet delivering so little.Bottom Line: A major disappointment. 5 of 10, and that's generous.",The Terminal

So, what was wrong with this one......Well, apart from stupid jokes (wet floor, c'mon Steven, what were you thinking?), was the whole story boring and portrait u.s. office workers as morons, who obviously forgot to call a translator. I mean, since Victor is coming from one of the ex-USSR republic, he surely speaks some Russian. Anyway, after classic like E.T., Schindler's list and Indy, I surely expected more intelligent story and not some typical Hollywood fairy tale for less demanding viewers.

184,billion_mucks,Spielberg's Wrong to Boot,5,6 January 2008,"After watching this movie I sat and thought, on my personal taste, how Steven Spielberg was unfolding badly in his lasts movies: ""Catch me if you Can"", ""Munich"" were over the top, somehow unimportant and blurry in their conception. And I thought on his good movies, ones that made him King: ""Jaws"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Close Encounters"" ""A.I"" and so on. And I've realized how he directs better on atmosphere and terrain, not specifically on characters. How would you explain such a flat, unengaging relationship on screen between Hanks and Zeta Jones, dipped into an absurd, contrived relation? And the fact that we buy those thin characters as profoundly painted or widely written? That there is a suspension of belief on them letting Hanks in the Terminal, on the demeanor on Stanley Tucci's behavior? Im not gonna say it is a nice picture on bureaucracy edges.Nowadays, the world is filled with forms and papers, with rules and legislations, and making a story like these (besides it is based on facts) is not original but interesting. ""The Terminal"" is an experiment on people that are ""stuck"" in a place, on their limited environment. The fact that Spielberg chose to deepen into the characters, and just delivers a thin hologram of them, converts the movie into a disappointing failure.",The Terminal

186,FilmSnobby,"Gee whiz, it's Spielberg's worst movie yet!",1,7 July 2004,"Although I've never much liked Steven Spielberg's films  (*Jaws*  being the sole exception), I've never confused my dislike with his ability to please a crowd.  The man is undoubtedly a showman . . . I suppose my quarrel is with what he shows us.  Even while despising his sentimentality, I've always grudgingly admired his sheer filmmaking competence.  In other words, I would never give his movies a 1/10 rating.Until now, until  *The Terminal*.  This is, without equivocation, the worst film of his career.  It has absolutely nothing to recommend it.  They should pay US to see it, really.  First of all, the movie has to set some kind of record for relentless product-placement.  You thought Hanks shilling for FedEx and Wilson Sporting Goods was tacky in  *Castaway*?  Wait till you see him scarf down his seventh Burger King greaseball sandwich in  *The Terminal*.  Wait till you watch him wander aimlessly, over and over, past Sbarro, Starbucks, Hugo Boss Outlets . . . but this is a hint to stop, because I don't want to be the pot calling the kettle black.  Basically, Spielberg & the Gang at Dreamworks came up with the most brilliant ""synergy""  concept yet:  base the story on some nut who was stranded in Charles de Gaulle Intl. Airport in France, make up a bunch of  ""dramatic, funny""  stuff about this character, and bingo! -- you got over 2 hours of CONTINUOUS ADVERTISING.  One retail outlet after another, panning slowly on the big screen.  Hanks can't escape the Terminal, and neither can the targeted audience!  It sometimes helps, when viewing a film, to know the reasons WHY a film gets made:  please remember that DreamWorks is having a bit of financial trouble, lately.  Not a LOT, but some.  The TV shows never materialized; the music-unit was sold off to some other conglomerate; and, worst of all, their movies have been stinking up the box-office for the past couple of years.  In fact, their last major  ""hit""  (if we must call it that)  was  *Gladiator*.Hence, *The Terminal*  gets dumped on an unsuspecting public.  Make no mistake, kids:  Spielberg did this hack-job with the hopes of covering his own studio's backside.  It is no coincidence that the only element in the film which looks as if any effort was applied is the set of the airport terminal itself.  Indeed, it's an astounding set, the best of its kind ever built, and deserves an Oscar . . . but remember the set's main function:  to hawk Starbucks and the like.  And since this is the movie's main function (with the  ""entertainment""  part hopefully taking care of itself under the auspices of popular showmen like Spielberg and Hanks), it should really come as no surpise that the airport-set is awesome.  There's money to be made, and burgers to be sold.As for the other aspects of the movie -- you know, the stuff we usually talk about, like the direction, photography, acting, story, and so on -- only the most pedestrian efforts are exerted from the principals  (Spielberg, Hanks, Zeta-Jones).  In the direction category, you would never guess that Spielberg was behind the wheel.  The story has terrible pace, the camera-work is nondescript  (except when panning slowly across yet another advertiser's logo), and the script is devoid of the  ""magical moments""  the director has occasionally pulled off in his other films.  In the acting category, Stanley Tucci tries his damnedest to give an honest performance as the head of security at the terminal, but the script betrays him by making his character, for no clear reason, more villainous as the movie wears on. Tucci's hung out to dry, mouthing dialogue.  As for Hanks and Zeta-Jones: watching them here only made me consider how much I enjoyed them in separate films by the Coen Brothers  (*Intolerable Cruelty*  for Z-J; *The Ladykillers*  for Hanks).  I ended up wishing that I was watching either one of those films again, which, not surprisingly, were directed by artists instead of a huckster.",The Terminal
187,jaredpahl,"The Art of Sincerity, Craft, and Optimism. The Terminal is a Delightful Grown-Up Crowdpleaser.",9,10 April 2020,"Around film buff circles, the question of the best filmmakers alive seems to invariably lead to names like Nolan, Scorsese, Fincher. My answer is the same it's been since I was 8 years old. The ""corny"", ""obvious"", ""uncultured"" pick; Steven Spielberg. When I posit Steven Spielberg as the greatest living director, there are plenty of films I could use for example. Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, E.T. But the one film I would choose for my thesis is 2004's The Terminal. Why does Spielberg's frothiest comedy prove him as the greatest filmmaker working? Because it illuminates pure directorial talent. When the subject is as inherently powerful as the horrors of warfare or the tolls of human suffering, you may not notice the quality of movie direction. If you really want to see why Spielberg is uncommonly skilled, you have to strip away the extra storytelling weapons. Take the mundanity of, say, an airport terminal, and watch how he makes it appear so magical, sparkling, and alive.The Terminal stars Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorski, a common traveler from the fictional Eastern European country of Krakozhia, who finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. The place happens to be New York's JFK airport. The time? Smack dab in the middle of his country's civil war. Krakozhia is no longer, and little does Navorski know, he's legally trapped in the airport until the war ends. It's hard to describe the elevator pitch for The Terminal. It is based partially on a real life figure, but Spielberg takes the bones of that story to indulge in a Carpra-esque Hollywood entertainer. The Terminal is a lot of things, all of them delightful: a fish-out-of-water comedy, a crowd-pleasing romance, and a tear-jerking character piece. The dramatic pull of the film takes shape, we realize, in the form of Viktor Navorski's mission to get the autograph of a famous New York jazz musician. But that's not exactly what the movie is about.The story serves as an outlet for a collection of aforementioned fish-out-of-water scenes. Now would be a good time to highlight Hanks, who contributes heartily to the value of these scenes. Considering his talent as a dramatic actor, we tend to forget that he is one of the very best light comedians. Here he gets to go full Hanks ahead on the comedy. With his endearingly dorky Eastern European accent, Hanks delivers a winning one-man-show performance, pitched at just the right angle for the tone Spielberg is working with. Tom Hanks is someone who knows how to play broad without sacrificing sweetness.But more impressive than Hanks, or any of the other great supporting performances (Catherine Zeta-Jones reminds one of the classy Hollywood starlets of the 40s and 50s, and Stanley Tucci is an endlessly watchable baddie.) is Steven Spielberg's direction. He had an entire airport terminal set built specifically for this movie, and the way he populates, stages, and moves his camera around it, is deceptively virtuosic. Because again, nothing incredibly special happens within the terminal's confines. No more than a series of routines that we see through the puppy dog eyes of Hanks' character. And yet, every moment of The Terminal is invigorating. It's just light entertainment, but the way Spielberg carries us through it visually, it feels life-giving. There are shots here, of tiles on a bathroom wall, of tv monitors, or common bookstore facades that are as exciting as anything in Blade Runner 2049, Interstellar, or any other ""most beautiful movie ever"". There is a sequence where Navorski figures out how to acquire change to buy fast food, and it's electrifying. Others can try, but no one else can make that claim. Steven Spielberg could literally direct Hanks making a sandwich and I would be on the edge of my seat.The film is quite long. It would be unforgivably tedious and indulgent had it been directed by anyone else. But the greatest living director deserves to indulge. I could watch The Terminal for days. In all it's cheesy, earnest glory. It's a real delight. An old-fashioned crowd-pleaser that most people are scared to take a swing at in this century. Maybe that's because no one else has the directorial swagger of Steven Spielberg. Stripped of everything except a couple of great movie stars and a professional comedic screenplay, he shows how invaluable his cinematic instincts are.

Through his foreign eyes Viktor allows us to see the irony of our rushed and ridiculous American lives. He also changes the lives of just about everyone he meets. As Viktor himself discovers, everyone is waiting for something; everyone has something they're yearning for in their life. Yet it is those of us who stop waiting and just soar who truly are happy.And much thanks for that has to be given to the amazingly talented cast. Tom Hanks is brilliant as Viktor; You know it's a great performance when you completely forget about the actor and just see the character. Catherine Zeta-Jones is spot-on as a truly selfish and love-desperate woman who has realized what love really is for the first time. Stanley Tucci is excellent once again. However, it is Kumar Pallana as the janitor who reluctantly befriends Viktor who stole the show for me. Really, there's not a bad performance in the film.Steven Spielberg's legendary directing is superb, and we feel like we truly know the character's and have lived this amazing story right alongside them.

Directed by Steven Spielberg. Of course when the movie came out I seemed spectacle that a movie that takes place in an airport could even begin to be mildly entertaining. Yet in the hands of Steven Spielberg he makes it great, and contains that artistic appeal.

These two questions will summarize my complaint: 1.) Why why were the I.C.E. agents talking to Navorsky when they knew he could not understand English? and most importantly, 2.) How did he know to stay in the airport terminal when he could not understand English?The director (Spielberg) did not care enough about The Terminal to patch these holes. I think it's ridiculous to waste movie-goers' time. Besides this major complaint, I also found Hank's character dull and un-compelling. I am not knowledgeable in affairs of immigration and customs, but I find it difficult to believe that I.C.E would create such an uncontrolled situation by releasing this man into the terminal without employing an interpreter to inform him of his situation. It's too bad, because with an intelligent script re-write, we could have had something special.",The Terminal
191,clydestuff,"Entertaining throughout, but doesn't add up to much",7,26 July 2004,"Having been around a few airport terminals in my time, I can safely say that it's a place that I only visit out of necessity, and sure is hell would never think of living in one.  I've been lucky enough not to have been stuck interminably in between flights or delayed more than a few hours, and will be eternally grateful to the powers that be for that.  I can't imagine having to spend a whole day in an airport, and the thought of having to take up residence in one for several days is almost as abhorrent to me as the thought of having to clean out a construction site porta-pot. 
In The Terminal, our mythical hero Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) from the mythical land of Krakozia lands in the not so mythical J.F.K. airport. While Viktor was in the air, getting from there to here, Krakozia undergoes a coup.  Because of this, Viktor technically has no country to return to, and since the U.S. doesn't recognize the new mythical regime, his passport and visa are no longer valid and are confiscated by mythical security chief Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) who then tells Viktor he can't leave the airport and enter New York City and must not leave the International Arrivals Lounge.  Of course Frank expects Viktor to do what just about anyone else would and leave anyway, but Viktor does as he is told and stays at the airport, and stays and stays and stays and stays and stays etc.  It doesn't help matters that Viktor doesn't understand but a few words of English, that his money is no longer any good, and that it takes him about five minutes to lose all of his food vouchers.  I think it's called having your back up against the wall.Viktor finally makes a few friends at the airport including a janitor, a food service worker, an INS agent who stamps his permission to leave with a big red declined every day, and develops a crush on the beautiful Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an airline hostess having an affair with a married guy (Michael Nouri).  How Viktor copes and learns to live is kind of sweet, often funny, and sometimes sad.  The fact that we buy any of this at all can be laid squarely on the shoulders of Tom Hanks who gives a remarkable performance as Viktor.  Not only does his accent stay consisted, his broken English never falters one bit as he learns phrases by comparing his Krakozia tour book to the exact same one written in English.  He keeps Viktor consistent throughout, a simple man whose one desire is to be able to enter New York to fulfill a promise kept in a peanut can he carries from place to place.  Viktor is the kind of person Frank Dixon doesn't understand, can't understand, and yet in some small way perhaps envies him because he is able to relate to people in ways that Frank will never be able to.Of course much of what happens in The Terminal is far-fetched (although supposedly loosely based on a true story) but since this is fairy-tale land I guess it's supposed to be.  Viktor acts as a go between in helping develop a relationship between the INS agent Officer Torres (Zoe Saldana) and the food service worker Enrique (Diego Luna), both of whom end up being devout trekkies.  Relationships have been built on less though as witnessed by Amelia who has been hanging out with the married guy for several years waiting for him to leave his wife.  As Viktor develops his own relationship with her, it is both touching and sweet, and we root for them.  Viktor eventually does find a job at the airport in a sequence that seems written more out of convenience for the plot than any other reason.Credit also has to be given to the writers and Spielberg for being able to pace a two hour film that takes place in an airport terminal in just the right way so that it is interesting and seldom bogs down.  I never felt like it was two hours which is saying quite a bit when you think of what two hours at the airport really feels like. There are some truly warm and fuzzy moments in The Terminal, some pretty good laughs, a few good enough if not spectacular performances by the cast (other than Hanks who is excellent), and several entertaining characters. Yet when it is over, you'll still leave the theater asking, `So what?'  A lot of the reason for this is that we get an ending you'll find only partially satisfying.  Some may quibble that if Spielberg had given us everything we wanted, than it wouldn't have been true to the story or the characters.  In answer to that I can only say hey, if you're going to give us two hours of what is basically a modern day fairy tale, you can at least give your audience what you know they want to see.  If a totally satisfying ending is good enough for Mother Goose, it should be fine for Spielberg's fairy tale as well.  I still may have left saying, `So what?' but I would have felt better about asking the question.  All in all, it's an entertaining enough way to spend two hours, but it's just one of those films that in the end isn't memorable enough to make it worth a trip to a theater, yet is good enough that you would probably want to watch it on DVD in the comfort of your living room at some point in time.   And if the only thing I can recommend is that people see your film on DVD, I have no choice but to give you my grade and for The Terminal that's a B-.",The Terminal
192,jackjack-2,Entertaining even though unreal,6,18 February 2005,"Another enjoyable Tom Hanks movie even though the plot is a typical fairy tale as is often the case in a Hanks' movie. Basically, Hanks, a foreigner, arrives at a New York airport but due to no fault of his own, his passport is revoked but because of a revolution in his home country he cannot be returned. He is not allowed into the US so he is confined to one terminal. One of things that makes this movie unreal is that Hanks can't speak or read English yet the Airport authorities never get an interpreter and talk to him only in English, which is fine for English speaking audiences and doesn't waste time doing translations in the movie but would never happen in real life. The story revolves around his life in the airport terminal and the suspense is whether or not he will ever get out of the terminal and if so, how.The subplot is his romance with an airline hostess, Catherine Zeta-Jones. Unfortunately, she adds nothing to the movie. Her acting was par for her which is sub-par and she doesn't really fit. While Zeta-Jones is not beautiful she is too glamorous for today's generally homely hostesses, And for an airport which is usually full of hostesses she is the only one that appears.But despite its flaws, the movie keeps moving and it is entertaining if one ignores its unrealities. The ending though is weird and not particularly satisfying.",The Terminal

196,frankwhat,"Treasure, The",7,26 November 2004,"This was a little gem that snuck right up on me. It sounded like a terrible idea for a storyline and Tom Hanks has been in some bad movies lately even though he's always great in them. However as soon as I started my screening I instantly got sucked in and was eagerly awaiting to see what'd happen next. It was also neat that it was actually loosely based on a person in real life that has lived in an airport in France for a very long time now. I just may have to go visit him someday, well probably not but if I make it too 100 years old it'll be on my to-do list. Then again I doubt he'd still be alive...oh well there goes that plan! Overall it was really an uplifting movie and it had a lot of warm-hearted moments that were perfect for the Thanksgiving holiday weekend! The acting was first rate with only one exception with that being Catherine Zeta-Jones. She sucks! But despite her, everyone else did wonderful and since it had a big cast this more than made up for it. I'm surprised this sunk at the box office, if I knew then what I know now I would've laid off calling it 'a stinker!'. Tom Hanks is absolutely hysterical playing a good-natured foreigner and did a perfect interpretation. I worship this guy as an actor and can't believe how far he has progressed since his early days. Whatever he did, I gotta do!Final Travel:Movies: I would've but then again it's one that the big screen wouldn't have heightened the effect of.DVD Purchase: Multiple viewings would be improbable.Rental: You'll adore it!!",The Terminal

Since Viktor came here, everything changed. His arrival brought vigor to the building. But the customs officer did not like him and tried everything to get rid of him. Due to his honesty, kindness and optimism, he won the game. After Viktor helped a man who carried the medicine that was for his sick father, he became a hero. His action won everyone's heart except the cold-blood officer.Life just likes a trip. You will meet different people in the journey. Viktor was unlucky, but he was lucky at the same time. He had a short love story with a beautiful stewardess. His friendship with other three men was impressive. What the old man did for Victor was really amazing. In the end the black guard took off his jacket and put it on Viktor, everyone was on Viktor's side (of cause except one guy), that pushed the film into the climax.No doubt Tom Hanks proved his value with convincing performance. I think even the fussy critic can not say anything wrong on him. Although he won the academy award (the best actor) for Forrest Gump(a wonderful comedian, Tom was great in it), I would rather vote for this role. From the role, I can learn much.One of the best movies in 2004. 9/10",The Terminal
198,Derek237,Feel-good,10,8 July 2004,"It's funny how Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, two of Hollywood's most powerful men, who could literally do any movie they want, end up making something like The Terminal. Instead of reaching for new heights of film-making like including the latest in special effects, or new original ways of storytelling and editing, Spielberg goes back to a simpler form. That in itself is surprisingly refreshing. Filmmakers try so hard to be inventive and change the typical form of the classics, that when someone finally does go back to that Capra or Wilder fashion, it ends up seeming original. That's what The Terminal goes for. A movie about characters, not plot. About emotion, not CGI. It's a true heart-felt piece of work. It's funny, it's cute, and it always keeps you interested.Tom Hanks leads an exceptional cast as Viktor Navorski, a man stranded in JFK airport, not welcome in the U.S. and having no country to come home to. Throughout the experience he makes friends, a love interest, and a rival. He changes all of their lives, of course. That's to be expected from a movie like this. Tom Hanks is totally believable, accent and all. It's a performance well worthy of an Oscar nod.I loved The Terminal for many reasons, but one big reason is it's simplicity. And more importantly, because it is good at being simple. It doesn't contribute anything new to movies, it doesn't try to. It is what it is. A great, feel-good film. Something that is getting rarer and rarer these days. Sometimes you'll want to see a gritty, wrenching melodrama, but other times you'll want to see The Terminal.My rating: 10/10",The Terminal

Tom Hanks is once again outstanding, boasting an accent so convincing that you literally forget it is Tom Hanks! His character, an immigrant from Kreckozia (or whatever it's called)is about as whimsical and delightful as characters come: he is simple (not too abstract), credible (in his dealing with the predicament he finds himself in), and laudible (his emotions are real, his happiness is real, everything he does is completely genuine). This is such a fascinating, if lamentable story: a man becomes stranded in an airport due to the termination of his home country which nullifies his legal residence anywhere, who ventures throughout the terminal trying to lead a normal, busy existence, while making friends and occupying himself. And what an execution! This is funny, genial, and amusing entertainment, featuring practically every element to contrive a delightful, hearty story. My only major complaint is the romance between Hanks and Zeta-Jones, which becomes overwrought as well as redundant towards the end. Overall, an interesting, delightful, and heartwarming film that reminds us that the greatest of things can be discovered in the most unlikeliest of places: in this case, a wonderful film, set inside an airport! ***1/2 out of ****",The Terminal
201,JimD73,The Terminal Takes Flight Due To A Spot-On Tom Hanks,7,4 February 2005,"Plot: 1.5/2.5: Viktor Navorski (Hanks) is a citizen of Krakozhia, a country near Russia, who is travelling to New York. While he is in the air, his country is thrown into a coup, and is no longer recognized as a nation, for the time being. This creates problems for Navorski. He lands and the airport finds his passport is invalid. Airport bureaucrat Frank Dixon (Tucci) informs him that, because he is no longer a citizen of any nation, he cannot enter the United States of America. Also, he cannot go back to Krakozhia. He has fallen into a crack in the system. The only place he can go is the terminal in the JFK airport. This is the story of how he waited for his country to get out of hard times so he can finally step outside. Of course, it isn't just Navorski hanging around. He meets stewardess Amelia Warren (Zeta-Jones), and they find, despite obvious differences, they are quite alike. He has numerous run-ins with Indian janitor Gupta (Pallana), who thinks Navorski is a spy. He also tries to get information for Enrique Cruz (Luna), who supplies Navorski with food in exchange for information on immigration officer Torres (Saldana), whom he is smitten with. He also has a need for money to pay for food, and needs something to do to pass the time.The premise itself is interesting. Being stranded at an airport terminal uncertain of whether or not you'll ever go home, with Dixon being a great add-in. It could have made for great stuff, but unfortunately, it manages to screw itself over. The sideplots, for the most part, are utterly stupid. While I liked the bit about how he got a job and everything, the side plot about Cruz and Torres ends up exactly as we were hoping it wouldn't. I could hear a little 'LAME' echoing around in my skull. The sideplot involving Warren seems to be just a diversion to make the movie take up a full two hours, and Navorski's reason for going to New York is really half-assed. That being said, this does have a lot of heart to it. Navorski is an incredibly sympathetic character and Dixon is an incredibly unsympathetic character. If this movie had been 1 ½ hours instead, the plot would have been great. As it stands, it tries to do too much and branches way too far off course.Comedy: 2.4/2.5: The Terminal is a very funny movie. It's not like it cracks jokes or anything, so it's not as gut-busting as, say, Meet the Fockers. It does have a sweet, pitiful humour to it, thanks mainly to some great set-ups and an out-of-the-park performance by Hanks. It does slow down at the end, but still holds up enough to make it very enjoyable, whether Navorski is getting hit by quarters or walking around in a bathrobe.Acting: 2.5/2.5: Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump) is absolutely incredible as Navorski. The accent is spot on, the mannerisms are spot on. Even the progression as he learns English is noticeable. This is the second time this year he's done a completely different voice (the first being The Ladykillers), and he once again nails it. Tucci (Big Trouble) is hilarious and great as the airport bureaucrat from hell. Zeta-Jones (Ocean's 12) gets a nothing character, but that's the scripts fault mainly. A special mention is in order for Kumar Pallana, who is hilarious as the obsessive janitor.Entertainment: 2.3/2.5: This is the type of movie just about everyone can enjoy. Teenagers may say they thought it was too 'sweet', but in reality, they loved it. I can see people poking holes like it was Swiss cheese, but I doubt anyone will really see this movie and not leave with a positive feeling toward it.Total: 87%: The Terminal is one of the best movies of it's type ever made. It's the type of sweet and kind movie that everyone pretends to be sick of but really likes a lot. Hanks deserves a lot of credit, as the weight of this movie falls almost entirely on his back, with only Tucci taking any other credit. I really can't see anyone having an overall negative view of this, so I recommend the Terminal to the world far and wide.",The Terminal
202,gottogorunning,fun film,8,9 August 2005,"Although I should not have been surprised, Spielberg and Hanks, had greatness written all over it. But I got suckered into a lot of the bad press around the film and suppose I judged it before I had watched it. Anyway, I have now watched it and I liked it.I thought the first half of the film was absolutely fantastic, the humor, the acting, the character development - they were all good. I thought the second half of the film suffered a little from becoming a bit over emotional, the love story seemed out of sorts and the way the entire airport staff seemed to know every thing about everyone else was a bit far fetched, I worked in an airport for many years and knew virtually no-one from outside the people I worked with on a daily basis, but maybe that's just me! But I forgave the film these slight nuances and allowed myself to enjoy it. I don't think Hanks or Spielberg will win any more Oscars, but it was a very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours on a Sunday night!!",The Terminal
203,Gambitt,Flies on sentiment; Grounded by reality,5,20 January 2008,"In the Terminal, Tom Hanks plays Victor, a traveler whose mythical East European country is overthrown while he is in transit to New York City. Upon arrival at the airport, he is told that his visa will not be honored and that he may not return to his homeland because he has lost his citizenship. It's loosely based on a true story, but the plot seems especially implausible in this day and age. You can tell it's going to take a mountain of sentimental handholding to overcome this bureaucratic mess.Every movie is allowed to exploit a few moments of disbelief or coincidence, but the Terminal features an endless chain of unlikely occurrences. If you forget to turn your brain off and you have any experience with air travel, romance, or people in general, then you'll find yourself annoyed by this silly, incredulous movie. Mostly you'll question the irrational behavior of the characters. You'll constantly wonder why characters respond the way they do to events in this movie.The relationship between Hanks and Amelia, a gorgeous airline steward played by Zeta Jones, is highly contrived. Amelia several times mentions how bizarre she is behaving whenever she spontaneously asks Viktor out for lunch having just met him. But merely acknowledging a plot hole does not patch the hole, and the movie plods on inexplicably.*Spoilers ahead* I had to step away from the television for about 15 minutes. As I was leaving, Victor had conversed with Amelia two or three times, and he was helping an airport food worker and an immigration officer become acquainted by relaying messages back and forth though the two hadn't actually met. When I got back, Victor and Amelia were apparently dating in his airport apartment, and the two airport workers were getting engaged (and then married 20 seconds later). That was some 15 minutes!Stanley Tucci's character is reduced to a sputtering megalomaniac of Disney super-villain proportions, evilly obsessed with the destruction of Victor. I could almost see him shaking his fist whiling cursing those meddling kids.Overall, the movie pretends to offer a profound statement about persistence, friendship, loyalty and humanity. Instead it comes off as a silly, shallow, empty romantic comedy.",The Terminal

I especially love the sequence were Victor is pushing carts back into the racks and earns a bunch of quarters afterwards from the machine on the rack.My only complaint, however (and this is rare for me as far as Spielberg's concerned), would have to be the ending. I didn't like it that it just ended with him going back to the air port in a taxi after having gone to a jazz concert. I think that they should've had one last scene with Victor and Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones). And it could've been anything. They could've talked, they could've had dinner together, anything.

205,matlefebvre20,A story of sealed items,7,28 December 2006,"Comedy has never been Steven Spielberg's specialty. ""1941"" was the only serious comedy made by Spielberg and it became one of his biggest failures. Other than that, Spielberg infused his other movies with subtle touches of humor, but it was essentially a small tool that helped to keep contact with the viewer.""The Terminal"" is by far the greatest straight-forward comedy ever directed by Steven Spielberg. The genius of this movie is that it turns a very serious and worrying situation into an avalanche of errors and funny situations, just like Kubrick turned nuclear holocaust into a big farce in ""Dr. Strangelove"".The always excellent Tom Hanks stars as Viktor Navorski, a man from Krakozhia who wants to get an autograph from famous saxophonist Benny Golson for his deceased father who was an avid jazz fan.However, the situation becomes more complicated upon his arrival at JFK airport. Viktor learns that a coup occurred in his country and his passport is not valid anymore. Thereby, he cannot penetrate in America and he cannot return in his country neither. The only solution is that he must live in the international transit lounge until another solution becomes possible.Viktor speaks very little English and he doesn't completely understand his situation. Anyway, he settles himself into the airport (Gate 67, to be more specific) and a new life begins for him.Sometimes, we believe that an actor gets a couple of big roles and then, he only becomes a name. Tom Hanks is not that kind of actor. He won Oscars for ""Philadelphia"" and ""Forrest Gump"" and he got notable roles in ""Apollo 13"" and ""Cast Away"", but his role in ""The Terminal"" is one of his greatest.In a sense, Viktor Navorski looks like Forrest Gump to me. His language is not clear (for different reasons) and his situation makes the other 'normal' people looking the same way.An airport is a very ordinary place. Ordinary and almost dull, especially for regular travelers. But Spielberg transforms this boring place into a fantastic environment, almost like a country inside a country. We discover the type of people working there, what is hidden behind every door and the very characteristics of the building.Ultimately, the airport becomes a destination itself.""The Terminal"" is a story of sealed items. Of course, there's the airport which is Viktor's prison for a long time. But there's also that special peanut can, which is the fuel of Viktor's travel. This blue box intrigues not only the characters, but ourselves as well. And when we learn what it contains, it becomes the most heart-warming moment of the whole movie.Also heart-warming are the scenes when Viktor is about to leave the terminal at the end of the movie. We see the bunch of friends met by Viktor and they follow him like fans who follow a rock star.This is the kind of story that we all love. A man wants to get a very little thing and he gets it, but he also gets much much more that he wanted to get. And this element is well-highlighted by Spielberg and the tens of characters.So, ""The Terminal"" is a very comical movie, but it is also serious and it's a perfect display of what is good in ourselves.This is definitely a movie to grab, before it flies away.",The Terminal

207,Critical Eye UK,Mr Deedski Goes To New York,3,7 May 2005,"Mean-spirited indeed(ski) would be he who criticises a movie for its timing. But then again, I am. So here goes: Spielberg did everything and more in Terminal's 2-hour plus running time in 'Amazing Stories', the 80s / 90s feel-good TV shows that managed the same yearnings for innocence and the American Dream -- but in 40 minutes or less.A lot earlier than that, and almost certainly before the majority of reviewers here were even born, Frank Capra did the same. But with a stronger script. And a better cast. And -- and this is the clincher -- a far greater sense of timing.For 'Terminal' is at least 60 years too late. The feel-good to which it aspires, the whimsy which it (laudably) seeks to celebrate, has long gone from any scenario involving the uncomprehending stateless trapped in the aspic of a hostile world.Truth is, it's difficult to think when such a scenario was remotely heart-warming anyway. Unless I missed some great hit-of-the-season show like 'Ellis Island: The Laugh-In'.With sets, art direction and special effects to emigrate, if not die, for, 'Terminal' certainly has a heightened sense of reality. But other than that, it's stupefyingly empty, a vast and expensive transit lounge of half-formed ideas ground under the footsteps of a script that moves so clinically from A to B that it seems no more than a mechanistic reprise of elementary screen-writing -- you know the primer I mean, where 10 pages in this happens and 20 pages in this happens, and the hook gets baited not a moment later than halfway down page 38. . .With 'Close Encounters' and 'ET', Spielberg showed true genius as a film maker capable of chronicling humanity's endearing panoply of hopes, dreams, fallibilities and fears.With 'Terminal', he has Tom Hanks doing a Chaplinesque shuffle.There's no humanity here. No relevance (as Capra had). And seemingly no understanding of the real obscenity of small lives shattered by big bureaucracies. Everyman does not live in this particular terminal, only a cast of characters unearthed from Capra's back-stock, all of them increasingly over-drawn and thus increasingly over-wrought.Calling this 'a masterpiece' is like calling a painting-by-numbers canvas a genuine artwork.Come on, Spielberg. The creative genius you have as one of the finest film-makers of this or any other generation cries out for something far, far better than this. Do us all a favour and find it quickly, before people start to wonder if your talent has left the departure gate once and for all. . .",The Terminal

Victor doesn't really understand English, but learns it by purchasing and borrowing books from stores, his character is so hilarious and lovable that it makes the film all that much better.We get introduced to other interesting characters like Gupta Rajan (Kumar Pallana), Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna) who takes interest in Dolores Torres (Zoe Saldana) and Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is interested in Victor Navorski, but has a lover. Victor is stuck in this terminal for a total of nine months, Dixon trying to make him escape just for him to get caught by security guards (Victor doesn't fall or it). Hanks then smartly figures out a way to get quarters to pay for Burger King so he can eat quality food, however Frank ends up making restrictions so only the guards can do it.Hanks' character ends up getting a painting job and takes Warren on a small date, they both throw their beepers into a nearby lake. After nine months, Victor has been hiding the reason he wants to come to New York, he tells Amelia that his father who passed away, had a wish for his son to get all three (or four) signatures from Sax members and the last one is Benny Golson.

210,chrstphrtully,Oversentimental and Contrived Film Saved by Marvelous Hanks Performance,7,26 June 2004,"SPOILERS HEREIN!!!Although Steven Spielberg is rightly considered to be one of the greatest (if not the greatest) filmmaker of the thirty years, his films sometimes have the tendency to overplay their sentimentality and rely excessively upon contrivance to deliver an upbeat story.  The bad news is that ""The Terminal"" is no exception to this tendency.  The good news is that Tom Hanks is the star, and his enormously charming and natural performance makes the film remarkably entertaining.Victor Navorski (Hanks) is a visitor from a fictional Eastern European country who, upon landing at JFK, learns that the government of his country has been deposed and that his passport and visa are no longer valid. Because of this, he cannot neither return to his home country, nor can he leave the airport.  The martinet-like Homeland Security chief (Stanley Tucci, who does remarkable things with a badly written part) wants Navorski out of his airport, and even at one point attempts to facilitate Victor's escape -- though Victor doesn't quite get the point.  Consequently, Victor effectively lives at the airport, sleeping at one of the gates, and proves surprisingly resourceful at providing for himself by collecting luggage carts (for the quarter deposit) and working as a contractor on the repairs to the terminal.Although the film contains several scenes that are genuine comic gems, the screenplay (by Sascha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson) unfortunately resorts to largely one-dimensional and two-dimensional characterizations, as well as wild implausibilities (for example, how does Navorski continue working as a contractor in a federal airport AFTER Tucci learns what he's doing?) to sell the story.  Tucci in particular draws a short straw in this respect, given a character who alternates between understanding, blind officiousness, and outright cruelty with little or no motivation.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is no more fortunate in her rather inscrutable role; like Tucci, she gives it the best she has, and comes out somewhat the better for it, if for no other reason than her character is more likeable.  Of the other crucial supporting characters -- a crusty, Indian janitor (Kumar Pallana), a black baggage handler (Chi McBride), Tucci's chief of security (Barry Shabaka Henley), a Hispanic caterer (Diego Luna), and the young customs officer whom the caterer is attracted to (Zoe Saldana) -- only the last two are written as marginally, three-dimensional characters.  Spielberg himself doesn't resist the temptation to take every opportunity to milk the story or its characters for audience approval, making Victor nothing less than a veritable saint. While this may make the audience feel good, it comes fairly close to making the film ring hollow.Which brings me to Hanks.  Like James Stewart, Hanks has the uncanny ability to infuse any character with a sort of genuineness, and to do this without effort.  This genuineness is what makes us root for Victor throughout, whether he's struggling to make a meal of crackers and condiments, facing off against Tucci or, in one of the film's best scenes, calming a potentially dangerous passenger.  It is a truly wonderful performance, and all the more impressive because the script gives him less than optimal material to work with.On the whole, a delightful film to watch, with some major script and directing speed bumps along the way.  Thank God Hanks knows how and when to step on the brakes.",The Terminal
211,tml_pohlak_13,A delightful surprise,10,12 May 2009,"""The Terminal"" is a delightful little comedy from Steven Spielberg's directorial chair. It centers on the plight of Victor Navorski (Hanks), who becomes stranded at the airport when his country erupts into a bloody civil war, where he meets Amelia Warren (Zeta-Jones).I found the movie's plot to be fascinating, full of interesting possibilities. Tom Hanks delivers a top-notch performance, and he really has some fantastic chemistry with Zeta-Jones. But when it comes to Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), I really have to give the writers a hand here. What a temptation there would be to make Dixon a sadist, an unsympathetic caricature of corruption, bent on Hanks' elimination from ""his"" airport. But no. Dixon insists Navorski must break the law. ""I'm not gonna lie"" he says, ""especially to get rid of someone like Viktor Navorski."" He's a man so caught up in bureaucracy, he's become completely indifferent to the immigrant's plight, evidenced when he refuses to let a Russian man take medication home to save his ill father, because the man hasn't got the proper forms. Critics have focused almost exclusively on ""The Terminal""'s romance between Viktor and Amelia, but when examining the movie a little closer, you can see that it is in reality a scathing political commentary by Steven Spielberg in the guise of a light romantic comedy. It critiques how, as a society, we have forgotten about the immigrant's plight in place of stricter, xenophobic security.Of course, now I'm making it sound as if this film were not funny at all. Au contraire! The situations Viktor gets into at the airport are hilarious, Spielberg's comic relief working overtime. A true Hollywood rarity this is: a comedy with thought behind it. After the dreadful toilet humour ""comedies"" of late (such as the ""American Pie"" or ""Austin Powers"" films), we can take relief in the quirky humour ""The Terminal"" has to offer. I sincerely believe this film has the chance to become a classic.",The Terminal

213,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of The Terminal,6,19 June 2004,"Remember a time when back in the mid-1970s when Steven Spielberg was a young inexperienced director out in the middle of the ocean with a broken down mechanical shark shooting a movie many had predicted wouldn't make a dime at the box office? Thirty years later Spielberg is laughing all the way to the bank while all his naysayers and critics grumble away in disgust and dismay. In that nearly three decade career as a director, producer and studio owner, Steven Spielberg has laid claim to some of the most celebrated feature films of all time including Close Encounter of the Third Kind, the Indiana Jones series, Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, and Saving Private Ryan. And if box office numbers have any say in anything it's that Spielberg hasn't slowed down just yet as both Minority Report and Catch Me If You Can, both of which were made within the same year, grossed a combined $300 million domestically. With no signs of slowing down any time soon, Spielberg is sticking less with features that once made the most business sense and more with projects that peck his interest the most, this time around with the concept of airplanes in The Terminal.The story for The Terminal is actually based on the true story of Merhan Karimi Nasseri who was banished from his home country of Iran in 1977 and traveled from one European city to the next seeking refugee status only to lose his briefcase in France forcing him to remain trapped in Charles de Gaulle airport where he remains there to this day. Upon arriving one morning into JFK International Airport in New York City, Viktor Navorski discovers that his homeland of Kakosia in Eastern European has become embroiled in a military coup led by rebel forces. Since the country of Kakosia no longer exists and a military embattlement has engulfed his homeland, Viktor is refused access to the United States since the government no longer recognizes his Kakosia passport or anything related to that country and will refuse to do anything with him until the war in his country is over. Until that time, Viktor Navorski can not pass the front doors onto American soil and must live within the terminal both day and night waiting for the war to end. In the meantime, Viktor befriends numerous airport personnel who request service from him to perform separate tasks in exchange for food, money, supplies, and anything else he might want while he waits for the doors to America to open. Within a nine month timespan, Viktor Navorski discovers friendship, romance, and the true realization of the American Dream without having to leave the confinement of the airport terminal building. The story for The Terminal plays much like another Tom Hanks film, Cast Away, only this time there's a lot more dialogue  too bad there isn't much substance behind those cleverly divulged words. Unfortunately the film suffers from its own unbelievable story line in that many of the scenarios that occur within the course of its two hour time length are so over the top that it is hard to take anything from them seriously. And despite having a relatively happy ending, most of the subplots that occur within the feature wrap up too neatly which, once again, derives a bit from the film's sense of believability and realism.As was said earlier, The Terminal plays like Cast Away in that Tom Hanks is the main focus of the film and that is all that truly matters when it comes to the bare bones approach for movie-goers but if you rely on more supplemental supporting characters to add to the entertainment value, you aren't going to find that here. Tom Hanks never fails to do wonders with the material that is given to him, even the rather bland and weak components presented with the character of Viktor Navorski. There are moments where you are suppose to feel sorry for this man but unfortunately he is played out so much like a running joke at times that it is hard to keep a straight face in some of the film's more serious moments. And what's worse is that that running joke becomes less humorous and more annoying as the feature goes on thus eliminating potential connection one might have with the character and the actions that occur with him on screen. One character that does not seem to work well at all is Amelia, played by Catherine-Zeta Jones, the female flight attendant Viktor falls in love with. There is a point within the film where the audience is meant to feel sorry for the character after she admits she is tired of waiting for the right man to come along in her life  then we remember she knowingly had a sexual relationship with a married man. How do you feel sorry for a person who blatantly trots around the world having promiscuous relationships openly with married men and cares only of herself and no one else? And her relationship with Viktor Navorski, in the end, becomes pointless as just when she seems 'destined' to be with him, she ends up going back to 'dating' the married man she had earlier in the film. That combined with the lost connection the audience has with the character of Viktor Navorski results in an ample void in the film's emotionally driven message.Overall, the arrival of The Terminal signals not a new surge in the creativity of director Steven Spielberg but rather it announces blatantly that the world famous director may have finally been brought back down to the level of mediocre filmmakers after spending so much time at the top. The film suffers severely from a rather predictable and emotionally confused script that wraps up nearly all its loose ends but leaves its audience scratching their heads wondering how the conclusion they received came about. The hard part is deciding what The Terminal actually is, a comedy or drama  there is enough evidence to support either side, and that is its problem. It's great that Spielberg introduces some well induced humor into the rather lifeless storyline but sadly he bunches too many gags into one time period leaving the audience confused when the direction of the film takes on a more serious tone. This is not to say that jokes that used in the film don't work well, they do, it's just that there are too many of them that they end up outbalancing the film's dramatic moments thus resulting in an uneven presentation. With both Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can and The Terminal coming off as less then impressive, especially compared to the superb work he's most known for, this should be a wake up call to the director to get his head out of the clouds (namely off the concept of airplanes) and back to the sci-fi and fantasy genres he works best with.My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C)",The Terminal
214,Genkinchan,He figured out the quarters,9,15 May 2021,This is one of the funniest movie I watch of Spielberg.. I literally laughed so hard at every scene with Tom hanks in it from his conversation to his action. Tom Hank's played a very believable Eastern European Citizen with the accent etc I don't think the movie deserves so low in the rating..Quoted by The man itself I wanted to do a movie that could make us laugh and cry and feel good about the world.. I can proudly says you make me laugh maybe cry a bit and definitely feel good about the world after watching this movie.. Thanks Mr. SpielbergThis movie at least deserves 7.8-8.0 on IMDb rating.,The Terminal
215,Ryu_Darkwood,"Silly movie, despite its good intentions",6,28 June 2007,"Despite that this movie has a heartwarming undertone, my cynical side just can't cope with this ultra-sweet film that tries to deliver a true message on a wrong way.The protagonist, a refugee being stuck on an airport due to inhumane bureaucracy, is a totally clichéd version of a real immigrant. He doesn't have anything in common with anyone really wanting to build up a life in the United States. And that's my biggest problem with this movie, the total lack of any realism in the main character played by Tom Hanks. At the end we see his true reason to go to the U.S.A. and believe me if I say that it's an anti-climax of epic proportions to see the silly reason of why this guy has to endure all this pain to set foot on American soil. Add up the completely senseless love-story around Catharina Zeta-Jones, as always being too artificial with her stunning beauty but failure to act natural, and you get a very silly movie.But like I said in my introduction, it has an important message to give to its audience. I also believe that immigrants build up America, and the rest of the western world for that matter, and that they should be cherished for their efforts instead of despised as happens too often. In Holland we recently had a political wave that tried to tune down Immigracy. It created a lot of sad stories of people that build up a living in our country but had to leave due to inhumane bureaucrats. This being said, I must add that positive stories about immigrants are important to tell. Spielberg had a good point by making this movie, but he should have made it more conform the truth...",The Terminal
216,persian-belle,Inspired by the true story of an Iranian man,7,13 December 2019,This was inspired by the true story of an Iranian man stranded for years at the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. Search it and you will see. I guess Spielberg decided that an Eastern-European man at the JFK airport would be a more interesting story for the mostly American viewers.Tom Hank is a fabulous actor. He saves the day anytime. He was able to be his great self who can make you laugh and cry at the same time. Cast Away and Forrest Gump are examples that bear witness to that.7/10 from me. It could have reflected the real story and also been given more purpose and meaning (the plot as a whole).,The Terminal
217,kismit,Pretty average stuff for Hanks and Spielberg,6,19 June 2004,I was having doubts about whether this film was must see in the theatre or if it could wait for the rental. I assumed incorrectly that it would be more than a smarmy romance comedy because of Spielberg's involvement. You could have plugged Billy Crystal into the Tom Hanks role and not missed a beat. Lightweight stuff. I emjoyed it a little more the Lady Killers but but I wish I had waited for the video. Just a paycheck for Hanks.,The Terminal
218,segacs,Fanciful and disappointing,4,21 February 2005,"Steven Spielberg had a mega-hit with E.T. in the early 80s... and, with few exceptions (e.g. Schindler's List) he's been remaking the same movie ever since. It seems with The Terminal that he's proved himself incapable of making much else.This time, Tom Hanks plays a man from a remote Slavic country who is trapped in a New York airport terminal when a revolution in his country invalidates his passport. A wholly unrealistic premise, except it's based on a true story. The problem is, instead of using the true story as a real basis for an important film, Spielberg instead tries to turn a serious plight into a fanciful fairy tale.Tom Hanks, who is an eminently capable actor, gets very little chance on screen to develop his character into a true human being, distraught and frightened as anyone would be under these circumstances. He never seems frustrated or fed up with the bureaucratic red tape that is essentially holding him hostage. He is unbelievably patient, choosing to adopt a happy-go-lucky existence paying for food with quarters from the cart return machines, making friends with airport employees, and chasing romance with a flighty stewardess played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. You never really understand Hanks's character's motives or inner thoughts. He's just this inexplicably resourceful, patient, plucky man who arouses some curiosity among the people around him.Stanley Tucci, also normally a capable actor, plays the bad-guy immigration supervisor who has made it his personal crusade to keep Tom Hanks from setting foot on American soil. This lends an air of incredulity to the whole thing, because you get the sense that Hanks is not being kept prisoner due to a bureaucratic mix-up, but due to a small, petty man who would never have so much power in reality. Language barrier or not, it is completely unrealistic to think that anyone would simply sit in an airport for months without trying to contact diplomatic channels, other immigration offices, or even his family or friends back home.The acting is appalling, unfortunately, considering the talent lined up in the movie. There are some fun peripheral characters, but they just adopt the stereotypes of amusing foreigners without ever seeming real. Catherine Zeta-Jones is ridiculous as Hanks's love interest, playing a character that anyone in their right mind would run away from in a heartbeat. The romance between the two is phony and contrived.Most importantly, this movie had a chance to really say something - about immigration laws, about red tape, about institutionalization... about pretty much anything. Unfortunately, it chose to turn itself into a piece of fluff. And uninspired fluff at that.Highly disappointing. 4/10.",The Terminal
219,Geff,Simply Awful and CONTRIVED,1,4 July 2004,"It was an awful and boring and painful experience. I was so bored and angry throughout the film. I am still angry. It shows how Spielberg and Hanks and Zeta Jones can use their money and advertising clout to suck us all in. They make their money and stick us with two hours of their contrived and silly ego trip. Give me a break. This film is really dopey. It will tick you off. Avoid it. The beginning is boring and stupid. It is based on the idea that this dope(Hanks) can't walk through two doors to get into the United States. With 40 million illegal aliens in our country, this is just sooooooooooooooooo stupid. Really stupid. Stupid. And the ending is an insult to your intelligence. Stupid, also. Stupid is as stupid does.

220,Geff,WARNING: VERY POOR-QUALITY FILM DESPITE THE POSITIVE COMMENTS,1,9 July 2004,"I have just read the comments regarding this horrendous film called The Terminal. It proves that Spielberg, Hanks, and Zeta-Jones must have a million relatives who belong to IMDb. Anyone who sees this film and actually likes it knows nothing about film quality, casting, screenwriting, editing, musical score, and characterization. This film is a joke, and the makers of it are laughing at you if you saw it and said that you liked it. This film has no credibility. The music is dreadful. The actors are miscast. The screenplay is laughably stupid and on a 7th grade intelligence level. The ending is unbelievably stupidly written. It has so many flaws that one can tell that the movie-makers did not care in the least about something called EXCELLENCE. This film shouts, ""We don't care, but you idiots will like it anyway."" What else can I say to warn people off? If you see it despite my warning, and you hate it, make sure you warn others by commenting here on IMDb. Remember that.",The Terminal
221,timothyhilditch,"An adventure we have all taken, before taking off into the clouds",6,29 October 2021,"Tom Hanks gets stuck in New York city terminal when a coup takes place in his country. I love the realism the first half of the movie has; the everyday struggle he goes through to survive. But this changes half way through into fantasy, the plane takes off and reality gets left behind. Giving in to the fantastical romantic element and creating a villain when really there shouldn't be one. Apart from this change in storytelling the movie is pretty lovable, what bad things can you say about Tom Hanks? Excellent soundtrack by John Williams.",The Terminal
222,asenkron,The Terminal gives us important lessons about loyalty to a promise.,7,24 September 2007,"The Terminal's theme is an extraordinary wherever you look at it. The JFK airport does landlordness to a unusual visitor who run after a special target. According to the story, an Asian man who is Viktor Navorski, wants to realize a promise that he gave to the father. The promise which Navorski works to realize is a deficient sign that wasn't only written a Jazz Legend Benny Golson who shares the same photo with Navorski's father like other Jazz masters. Upon his father will, Navorski must complete all the signs of people who take part in a special photo. Only Golson must be completed by him, but Golson lives in USA and Navorski goes a long trip. As a coquetry of faith, while he passes JFK's border, the government in his country is removed by rebellious people and his country is removed also from the list that USA accepts. In this condition Navorski happens stateless and JFK foreigners department seize the Navorski's position. Navorski starts to live in JFK as forming a living area with the hope of USA's accepting his country as a country. He waits for a long time and acquires good relationships with airport staff. Then the time turns and he reaches his purpose.I think there is a light similarity between Castaway and this film by the direction of survival effort.This amazing story got me amazed. Almost the whole story take place in an airport. Hanks' innocent behaviours fit in with his role like ""I am an Englishman in New York"". I didn't find so effective the performance of director. The time of it is too long as two hours.In spite of some long and boring scenes, The Terminal is worthy to watch. Because Viktor Navorski doesn't terminate his hopes about his target.",The Terminal

So now he must strive to survive in the terminal but with forces working against him will he ever get to live out his dream to see New York City? Will he ever be allowed to go home? We shall see...This movie is a very imaginative and funny comedy and is very much a feather in Tom Hank's Cap. His acting job was very much suited for this film and though many critics say that it was over the top I believe that he was quite convincing in his portrayal. I really enjoyed the chemistry between the actors and the film was very smooth and easy to follow. The only problem with this is that the end could have been better, but I'll let you sort that out.

225,moviefan2003va,Delightful,9,28 November 2004,What a truly delightful film. I grew up with the two Toms being the major movie stars. Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise. The former stars in this movie and the fact that he has played such iconic roles as Forrest Gump completely left my mind when I saw him in this role. Hanks put in a very convincing performance. He captured the humanity of his character and sold us on the idea that he is Viktor Navorski. It is a shame this movie did not do better business. Perhaps it should have been released this time of year. All the supporting cast is wonderful. There is foundation to the characters and characters are used to drive the story. Never thought I could be interested in a movie that takes place entirely in a terminal. That was until I saw this movie. 9/10,The Terminal

228,richard-pullen-1,Good.,7,27 September 2004,"I liked ""The Terminal"", don't get me wrong, it was a cute movie with plenty of charm (to be filed with ""Catch Me If You Can"", ""E.T."" etc) but I'm thinking Monsieur Steven Spielberg is due a BIG film with the acclaim that surrounded the likes ""Schindler's List"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"".Tom Hanks is probably the finest actor around right now (subject to opinion) I see him as our generations Cary Grant or James Stewart! I thought the 'accent' would annoy me during this film but I was wrong it was fine.FACT: People dislike Catherine Zeta-Jones FACT: People will not see this film because Catherine Zeta-Jones is in it ... It's like why people didn't watch ""Jersey Girl"" because Jennifer 'Anaconda' Lopez was in it ... It's a shame because Z-Jones isn't in ""The Terminal"" that much at all and her her input is okay aswell! The entire supporting cast in this film are very good, Stanley Tucci is a damn good actor!This is a fine film that yes can be considered ""Lovey-Dovey""(!) but Spielberg creates something more than a romantic comedy here but a whole community!!!",The Terminal

The story is quite interesting, the acting very good:Tom Hanks does an excellent job and Catherine Zeta-Jones is also very good! The music by John Williams is of course very good.

232,StarCastle99,Spielberg and Hanks - It's Magic Time,10,21 June 2004,"Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks may just be the best director/star team going. Once again they light up the screen with a terrific quirky portrayal of a man stranded at JFK because his country no longer exists. Hanks character is mesmerizing as he goes from a ""not acceptable"" to the hero of this city within a city. Spielberg, as usual, has crafted a superb visual experience. His patented crane shots sweeps the architecture of the Terminal, giving us an extraordinary view of this world within a circle. John Williams score once again proves he is the dean of film composers. All in all, this is the best film I've seen this year. Hanks gives an Oscar level performance, Spielberg will undoubtedly be on this year's DGA ballot. This picture could shine come next year.

233,eragonbookfan,Happy 10-Year Anniversary!,8,13 July 2014,"First off, I want to mention I love airports & airplanes! They're my favorite means of traveling. When I first saw this, I was 12 years old. I remember begging my Dad to watch the Incredibles again (even though it was gonna be in Japanese) but he insisted otherwise. So I went a long with it, seeing as how my Dad is a big Tom Hanks fan, just as I have become. ;) We watched this flick as a family and a whole bunch of friends - I remember it like it was yesterday. Boy, did everything work together & right in this flick. It had everything it needed to be a good film! First off, Tom Hank's foreign accent was very convincing - after all, he is a great actor! Stanley Tucci is great at playing the smart-alack-y & unlikable airport bully - liked him in ""Beethoven"" too. Catherine Zeta-Jones is excellent, as always, as the love interest; though actually I think she's prettier in the ""Zorro"" films.A lot of the supporting characters are quite colorful & memorable too. Need I mention the beautiful Zoe Saldana? When I was sitting there in the theater, I was just captivated by how pretty she looked; and 10 years hasn't changed that at all. ;)I enjoy the product placement as well; store after store. lol. John Williams' score is really memorable, beautiful, and uplifting too - I often listen to the main theme of the movie.I also give credit to this movie for introducing me to Benny Golson.So many scenes & lines in this movie still make me feel a range of emotions to this day.Some of the memorable lines include: ""Bite to eat."" ""I hate the Tuesday!"" ""Do you have an appointment?"" ""He chit."" ""So we 'Cher' the panties?"" ""I wait!"" ""You touch it again, I kill you."" ""Goat."" ""I am delayed... long time."" ""Get lost."" ""What time? Dinner time.""Amazingly, the entire ""terminal"" set was built inside of an old aircraft hanger! Kudos to Steven Spielberg for always proving to be amazing & creative.I think my favorite scenes in this film are when Viktor finds out about the Quarters, when Viktor starts ordering from Burger King, when Gupta tells his story about India, the end credits with all the autographs of the people who made the movie (that was very unique), and when Gupta manages to stop the airplane with his mop! (Seriously, the music in that scene was really gripping my heart - I thought Gupta was gonna get killed by the plane.)The only downside I've got with this film is the language - often times language takes me out of a film (whether it is 4-letter words or blasphemy). Plus, Tom Hanks' past is a little depressing, regarding how he wrote a beautiful letter at 16 years-old of how much he loved the Lord, and wanted to serve Him with his life; then he went off to college, studied false philosophy (i.e. Darwinian evolution) & likely destroyed his faith; as of now, he stars in movies with little or no morals. I'm just saying I feel sorry for him in that area.But overall, people can enjoy this film! Great time, no alcohol required, and worth buying on Blu-Ray.8/10",The Terminal

236,Zoopansick,The epitome of a fake Hollywood movie,3,27 June 2004,"If you ever want to see an example of what modern independent film makers point to when they talk about superficial and false Hollywood movies see The Terminal. The Terminal is a highly implausible and manufactured story of this guy stuck in a New York Air Port for God only knows how long. This movie presents the audience with a series of unreal characters and situations and tries to pass it off as drama or romance. Consider the character that Stanley Tucci plays; why does he hate Victor Navorski so much? Is he really jeopardizing his chance to move up in the ranks? Is he even that annoying? It's really none of those reasons, the only reason he hates him is because the movie requires a villain. Just like the movie requires a stupid romance based on chance meetings. The Catherine Zeta Jones character is really pathetic too. She complains about being forced to wait for this guy for 7 years and being a stewardess for 20 years. Well it's her own fault. She choose to have an adulteress affair with a married man, and chose to keep waiting on him (here's a tip girls, if you have been going out with a married guy for more then 5 years and he hasn't left his wife yet, he isn't going to and you are getting played). I guess I can forgive her being a stupid character, because guess what that's not even the dumbest romance in the movie. That dubious honor goes to the one because the cute girl at the passport approval desk and the Hispanic guy who drives the food cart. In this whirlwind romance the guy wants to ask her out but is afraid to (ok nothing too out of the ordinary yet)...so he asks this guy from eastern Europe who has been stuck in the airport (and who he hardly knows) to find stuff out about her so that they can fall in love. The girl apparently just as stupid gives Tom Hanks all sorts of information and then without ever meeting the guy agrees to marry him after Tom Hanks gives her a ring. I don't know about you all but if I was working a desk job somewhere and some guy from Eastern Europe (or from anywhere really) starts asking me questions about myself and then one day gives me a ring and asks me to marry this other guy who I have never seen before in my life, I would have to respectfully decline. Along with this romance the movie has other stupid characters including this old Indian janitor (and just between you and me I wanted to see him get deported, and if Spielberg had any balls left show the 7-7 prison cell that old fart would be living in for the remainder of his days). The reason Tom Hanks came to America is a mystery (and I won't spoil it for you) but it's really stupid and definitely a movie contrivance. There are far more ridiculously implausible scenes in the movie, and none of which are very funny or heart warming. The Terminal is a movie with a ridiculous plot that could be found in a movie from the 20s or 30s without the charm. It's hard to believe that the guy who brought us such films as Jaws, Jurassic Park, and Schindler's List is reduced to this.",The Terminal
237,Scorching,Good performance by Hanks!,8,9 November 2004,"The Terminal is the latest movie from Steven Spielberg and stars Ton Hanks, Catherine Zeta Jones and Stanley Tucci. In this movie, which is based on a true story, a man (Hanks) is forced to live in an airport he has just arrived in when political turmoil engulfs his country and his visa is revoked. What happens next is a funny mix of events as he tries to cope with his new home and the people around it. Along the way he encounters the cruel airport manager (Tucci) and a beautiful stewardess (Jones).Well I think the highlight of the movie is definitely the performance of Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorsky. His great Eastern European accent really made him more believable plus of course his usually solid acting. I believe he really carried the whole movie. Stanley Tucci is felt also had a good performance. There is just something about this actor which makes him fit bad guy roles to a T. What I found not very good about the film was the basic screenplay of the movie. Yes it was funny but not much in terms of substance. I also felt they could have shown more of the interaction between Viktor & Amelia. C'mon 20-25 minutes is definitely not enough. The sub-plots were OK but again perhaps less of that could have been included.",The Terminal

His performance as the helpless traveller and not understanding english really hit me emotionally. His accent and acting is one of the best with Forest Gump.The originality and concept is fantastic. Cinematography, while being confined in an airport tried everything it had to offer. All the side characters gave a believable performance. It felt like watching a family living in the airport. Stanley Tucci was great as the antagonist.Well the love story felt frictional and could have been executed better, the ending of Viktor only coming to New York for a signature felt more of Feel Good movie trope.",The Terminal

I also think Steven Spielberg is a good technical director who often needs someone to tell him when a story has actually played out and not to add an unnecessary 15 minutes to it... But somehow this film resisted the fatal flaws of it's two creative heavyweights (Probably because of the script which was charming and didn't allow too much faffing about from Hanks or a (overly) sentimental ending to be wrung out by Spielberg.) Overall created a lovely little gem that I am sorry i resisted seeing for so long. The main reason it works is because it is such a simple premise told in a really simple way.

240,josephrygaard,Before Watching: The Terminal (2004),7,2 December 2019,"""The Terminal"" (2004) is a well-rounded and entertaining movie about getting stranded on an airport (and a few things more). If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:The Terminal is as said above about a man who, thanks to peculiar circumstances, finds himself stuck in the JFK airport. Even though the premise doesn't wear an aura of joy and happiness, this movie still manages to create one, much thanks to Tom Hanks great acting and the ingenuity and character of his role. Some supporting side characters also contribute greatly to this, to in the end produce an original and captivating piece of lighthearted (and sometimes poignant) fun.The only major flaw that can be perceived lies within the antagonist, the stern and cold-hearted airport supervisor. A lot of decisions taken feels extremely unwarranted, and even though they are to some degree necessary to push the narrative forward, can ultimately feel very uncalled for or scripted. This doesn't detract enormously, but it still something that could be relevant for few. All in all, The Terminal is well-paced, entertaining and most definitely a charmingly watch.My personal grade: a simply great 7/10.

241,KevinB12,A waist of time and film to me,1,16 March 2010,"I am extremely disappointed in this movie to see Tom Hanks stranded in the airport. The customs are treating foreign people unfairly because there are so many foreign people man and woman wanting to come to America because they want to see the whole country. For the customs at the airport to treat foreign people unfairly is prejudice and total discrimination. Would they ever do this to the most beautiful woman from Paris, France? If they did that to her, she would be very disappointed to the customs who treated her unfairly. I do not care about America's strict rules. They are unfair, total discrimination and very prejudice to me and most of the foreign people. To be honest with you, this is not the kind of movie I would watch for any reason because of this total unfairness.",The Terminal
242,katydid4819,The Terminal Hits Home,8,27 June 2004,"Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have a good track record when they team up. Not that each does not have a good record of his own, but putting the two talents together has, twice in the past resulted in success. Their latest effort, The Terminal, although a strong production, lacks something the other two possessed. It is reminiscing of Catch Me If You Can. Both feature a main character that plays the mouse just a little smarter than the cat. In Catch Me If You Can, the cat and mouse comparison is more obvious whereas in The Terminal, the cat in not trying to catch the mouse, he's trying to get rid of him. This time around Hanks is playing the mouse instead of the cat. He's a man who has become a citizen of no country during his time in the air and therefore, is forced to wait out his homeland's problems in JFK airport. Although the movie is based on true story, Spielberg and his crew have decided to leave all actual details out of their telling. The country Hanks' character, Victor Navorski, was from is fictional and whereas the man the story is based on resided in the airport for 15 years, we don't know whether or not Hanks waits out the problems for weeks, months or years.
Still, the story is not dependant on small details as is more a study of the survival of a man in a most unnatural habitat, waiting to go home. How long can you live on saltines and condiments (aka free food)? Where do you sleep? What do you do all day in an airport? The screenplay takes liberties in addressing these questions (there just happens to be a whole gate under construction for the entire duration of his stay), and if the screenplay had fallen into wrong hands, The Terminal would have been terminated. There are still moments when the film skids along the lines of disaster but usually the colorful cast brings it back to safe ground. Actually, the characters are the most believable aspect of the film. Most likely it's because they are all well acted. Hanks plays the entirety of his character arc seamlessly combining elements of the lost boy form Big, the father from Sleepless in Seattle and the resourcefulness of Forrest in Forrest Gump. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the brunet version of a blond, but it's not her fault. The male screenwriters cast her as the damsel who's in distress about life. The cast is completed by Stanley Tucci, Diego Luna, Kumar Pallana and Zoe Salana, each taking on a unique part that round out the character study of that makes up Victor's friends.
The movie is neither a drama nor a comedy. It effectively mixes the two and creates a touching, unique film about what we do for love. ***/*****",The Terminal
243,John K.-2,"Been there, done that, didn't take quite as long",8,12 September 2004,"I'm surprised to see this film scoring higher votes from a U.S. audience than an non-US audience, because parts of Viktor's experience are uncomfortably familiar to anyone who's ever been through U.S. immigration.  The unfriendly interrogation followed by an unsmiling ""Welcome to the United States"", the determination of U.S. officialdom to stick to the letter of the law, the need to answer leading questions in a certain way (""Have you ever been a Nazi? Are you a drug dealer?"" Yes, these questions are on the infamous light green form), and even the difficulty of figuring out how the public telephones work, all reminded me of my own experiences - and I speak the same language! (well, mostly :-)). So those people who criticised Spielberg for ""not knowing where the film is going"" are missing the point -- the true theme of this film, to me, is how outsiders see America, through the microcosm that is an airport terminal.As for those people who criticised parts of the plot as being beyond belief, I have to agree -- I can't believe so many people slipped over on a wet stone floor in New York and didn't try to sue the airport (half :-))[End spoilers]",The Terminal

If it's saying anything, I had forgotten about it until I pulled up Terminal with Margot Robbie and Simon Pegg that I absolutely loved!!!Tom Hanks is my favorite actor. Simon Pegg is right behind---- huh?! Anyway, this movie bored the hell out of me. I didn't think it was possible to dislike a Hanks movie and I discovered his work with Bosom Buddies and Bachelor Party when I was a teenager. Both were absolutely absurd but I still hold an affection for them. Oh, ones 1st and 2nd time.....
The cast was great but it was just dull and I felt detached from it. I would rather be trapped in an airport than sit through it again. But.... I did because my husband had never seen it so I was a good sport and had another go around. Yeah.... I used it against him later when I made him watch my favorite, the original Twilight Zone series but it was an epic fail...he loved it and now watches it.The accent Hanks used was awful and the otherwise delightful Catherine Zeta-Jones was bland.

247,mswatsoninc,The Terminal (2004),3,24 December 2004,"This film just screamed ""Oscar! PLEASE, I WANT AN Oscar!"" for Tom Hanks. It's films like this that make me think he's giving Robin Williams a run for his money as the highest priced whore in Hollywood, with Nicole Kidman and Jude Law running a close third and fourth, respectively. Meaning, each of them seem to be in any film. Good, bad, or indifferent, each of them is turning into the cinema's version of the Bible in American hotels...they're in every drawer.Give him an accent and a few closeups with teary eyes and swelling violins and we're supposed to be moved. Oh, I was moved, all right. Boredom has the tendency to make one fidgity.This film moves slower than the Macy's checkout line at Christmas. It only took about five minutes to realize this was an award vehicle for Hanks, and what seemed like six hours to endure it. Think Robin Williams' turn in ""Jakob the Liar."" Catherine Zeta-Jones gives a forgettable and insignificant supporting role as the ditzy Napolean loving flight attendant that we are supposed to believe would be happy with a Sbarro's pizza rather than a candlelit dinner. Stanley Tucci plays the ""mean old airport man"" with one loud note throughout. Of course, the rest of the cast represents airport staff that we are also supposed to believe care enough to a) notice Hanks's character and b) become endeared towards him--to the point that his actual ""departure"" from the airport would shut down operations to go see it. Anyone who's ever had a long lay over at JFK knows what a laughable premise this is.A huge disappointment to Spielberg fans.

He is as always the best in the business. He shows to all the new actors who put more faith in stunts and Special Effects that it is not the real case of entertaining people. As an actor it is always ACTING which makes people felt the presence of an actor.

250,tohu,Much Better Than They Say!,8,22 May 2006,"For a long time I avoided this film, quite irrationally reacting against the early hype in the way we all do sometimes. Then one day I saw it on cable when there was nothing else to watch, so I gave it a go. There is a pleasant joy about being proved wrong about a film, about the wry realisation that you have been stupid enough to delay enjoying a really interesting motion picture experience.What happens is that Hanks and Spielberg do what they have done countless times before - individually and collaboratively - and draw you in. All they need is the ability to create believable characters in an interesting real-life situation and a setting we all recognise. Sounds simple. It's not. But this film plays like a masterclass in how to do it.There is a lightness of touch about the film, exemplified by the incidental music and by Hanks' winning charm as the lead character who stays relentlessly positive in the face of the kind of un-feeling bureaucratic intransigence that is designed to wear people like him down. Despite all the odds, he never doubts that he is going to get into New York City, and so neither do we. And that spirit of belief that benign destiny will prevail slowly infects not only the rest of the airport, but the audience as well. To that extent, it's a 'feel good' movie.There are some lovely individual touches too (watch out for when Viktor gets X-rayed - and then photo-copied!), and Stanley Tucci's turn as the uptight, officious airport security manager becomes a wonderful comic creation, without ever losing authenticity. But there are serious themes here too, and they are not smothered in saccharine - except perhaps in the last 20 minutes (when let's face it, it's acceptable). Spielberg's class allows the film to effortlessly dip between the tragi-serious, the laughably mundane, and OK the downright silly at times, without ever losing its pace or the logic of its simple plot.There's not much more to say about this film without spoiling it. You don't need a deep understanding of international politics to understand it, just an interest in human beings and how they behave in reaction to the situations and people around them.Watch it. You'll like it. And you'll never look at an airport terminal in quite the same way again.",The Terminal
251,loydmooney,ridiculously personified,1,11 February 2005,"Its more nodoze a la Spielberg. What a bad bad bad director. Even though I did not know who directed this until nearly the end and checked the DVD I had checked out from the library. So at least I did not have to ask for my money back. Hanks lets his accent jump around like a ping pong ball, and the only reason I kept watching the thing was to see just how bad it would get. Probably, and this is only probably, Spielberg wanted to go after no calorie Kafka with this, kind of a ho ho combo of The Castle and The Trial thrown in. Though this baby makes Welles Trial a bloody masterpiece, and that movie is plenty bad enough. But I should throw in a proviso here: even Jaws never frightened me. Robert Shaw did a lot more than the shark, he is such a fine actor, so I am still waiting for Spielberg to scrape together ten minutes of continuous celluloid that I can enjoy. For those of you who can, rave on, more power to you. Even Schindler's List struck me as a crafty shuck, carefully avoiding the real horrors of the holocaust, though in all fairness, thus far only Resnais's Night and Fog approached them. Wait. Nearly forgot. There were a few moments in Catch Me If You Can that I thought were well done. Just the sort of territory that might make Spielberg work: the De Caprio character a figure of fantasy taken from the canvas of reality, though greatly hoked up by Spielberg. But at least it was a fairly enjoyable movie. However that's just me.

252,schmimic,"Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a Russian stuck in an airport terminal when his country ceases to exist.",9,23 April 2005,"Starring: Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci Imagine that you're flying to a foreign country where you really don't know the language all that well. While you're in the middle of your flight, there is a war in your home country and the government is overthrown. Essentially, your country ceases to exist. When you get to the foreign country, they won't let you in without a valid passport, which you can't get without a country. So they tell you that you can't leave the airport terminal. That you have to wait there until further notice.That's the situation that Viktor Navorski (Hanks) from Krahkohzia (yes, it's a fictional country, and I don't have the first clue how it's spelled) finds himself in.The Terminal is an absurdly amusing comedy/drama that's all the more entertaining because you have to wonder, what if something like this actually happened? Is it possible? I really don't know, but I'd hate to think that someday I'll be out touring the world and get stuck in some foreign terminal for nine months when Canada stops existing.So since Viktor has nowhere to go, he makes a life for himself at JFK Airport in New York City, unable to go into the United States and unable to fly back to Krahkohzia. He makes a room for himself at Gate 67, an abandoned gate that is in dire need of construction. Without the ability to buy food (Krahkohzian dollars are not really worth anything in the States), Viktor has to find alternate means to feed himself. Soon he discovers that when you return baggage carts to their stalls, you get a quarter as a small reward. So he runs around the terminal collecting a whole bunch of them so that he can feed himself.We don't really find out until very close to the end of the movie just why Viktor came to America. But he does finally accomplish his task, and his country is reestablished and he gets to return home.We all knew the ending from the beginning of the movie.

254,unbend_5440,"Loved the airport survival stuff, but....",7,18 June 2004,"The Terminal is, at the same time, one of my favourite movies that I've seen this year, and a partial disappointment. It just further proves that there has yet to be a single movie released this year without considerable flaws. I don't want this to come across like a negative review because I really did enjoy The Terminal a lot.This is obviously a great premise. The movie jumps right into things with Victor being detained, Victor having communication problems as they try to inform him that he has no country, and of course, as you already know if you've seen the trailer or any TV spots, Victor is forced to stay in the airport. The scenes that played the best, the moments that I felt were the best of the movie, all happen in the first hour. All the scenes of Victor adjusting to life in the airport was enough for me. The segment with him returning the carts for quarters was the point when the movie seriously took off. All the way through his quest to find a job, the movie really had me won over. Those airport survival scenes were more than enough to hold together this movie. I wonder why The Terminal needed to introduce a love story (if you can call it that) and formulaic elements near the end. It's the introduction of these things that lost me. This was an interesting and moderately original entry in Speilberg's career before he decided that it needed a formulaic story. Stanley Tucci's character that's constantly out to get Victor, that was just typical and lame. And call me crazy, but I think this movie could have done without the love story. Very out of place, not to mention the fact that this ""love story"" never goes anywhere. There's a very unfulfilling end to it. I also don't see the point of the twist where Victor gets the temporary Visa. That idea was dropped from the movie and never used. It was a waste of time that overly-complicated things. I wasn't too crazy about the final showdown as Victor tries to leave the airport. It would've been corny even in a Frank Capra movie. That's the major problem here. Spielberg started it out as a movie based in reality, and half way through he turned it into an almost fairy tale Capra movie.But, minus these complaints, like I said at the start, this was one of my favourite movies of 2004. It also enforced my belief that 2004 is a year when everything will disappoint, even on a small scale. Tom Hanks puts on a great show. He always does. Some of the supporting cast is good, but the characters are poorly handled. I liked the very last scene of the movie. I loved Janusz Kaminski's Cinematography. He's one of the only DP's that's daring enough to blind the audience with light. I really loved John Williams score, as always. The biggest praise I will give is for the scene where Victor translates for the crazy Russian. Every contribution to the execution of that scene was perfect. That was a memorable cinematic moment. I wish the last 30 minutes had that kind of delivery. I do believe that Spielberg is one of the most consistent Directors working today, and he does direct The Terminal well, however I can't help but fantasize about what this movie would have been like had Andrew Niccol handled it, like he was originally supposed to. I have a feeling Andrew Niccol would have brought a lot more originality and focus overall.",The Terminal

Not only him, but Tom Hanks as usual are both magnificent. This movie is the true work of creativity, making it unique and so different from other theatrical releases. I enjoyed a lot watching this movie, and even my father who doesn't have habits at all to watch movies, had a seat and watched this to the very end.The Terminal is the story about Victor Navorski, a traveler from a foreign country who needs to get a plane to New York. I won't spoil what he wants to do there, this is something which is only explained at the last 30-40 minutes of the movie. But something goes wrong and because of that, Navorski unfortunately can't leave the airport and enter the big city. Neither can him get a plane back to his country. He manages to live in the airport by doing many things which, of course, are very creative and fun to watch. But the only problem is that they're unreal.The problem with this movie (which has been the only thing which made me not rate this movie with a 10 stars rating) is that at most times, it's very unreal. These are things you surely would put at the bottom of the list of things that are very likely to happen in real life. Sure this is a movie, a story, but sometimes it's almost so unreal, it almost makes us feel we're watching some sort of a fantasy in the present time.Well, there's not much to say about this movie, without spoiling some stuff, so I'll quit it here. All I have to say is that this is a great movie, with great performances (specially Tom Hanks'), a great direction and great scenarios.

263,skad13,One of Spielberg's and Hanks' finest hours,10,15 June 2004,"Review of THE TERMINALby STEVEN BAILEYIf Charlie Chaplin was still alive and creating, it's easy to imaginehim making a light comedy as richly satisfying as ""The Terminal.""Just as Chaplin used to take a prop and wring every possible gagout of it, Steven Spielberg's prop is a New York airport terminalfrom which he extracts every story possibility. And Spielberg'sChaplin is Tom Hanks, who takes a potentially show-offy, MerylStreep-type role and turns it into a movie character for the ages.= Hanks' role is Viktor Navorski, a European immigrant whobecomes a modern-day ""man without a country"" when his nativeland gets embroiled in a revolution. Viktor can't return homebecause his country is under siege, and he can't legally enter NewYork until his country's new leadership is recognized by the U.S.So Viktor has no choice but to live in the terminal--much to theconsternation of Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), whose chances ofbecoming the terminal's top dog are jeopardized by Viktor'sconstantly being under foot.= The movie's premise is laid out pretty flatly in the first ten minutes,which begins to sink one's hopes. But it's as though Spielbergwants to get the mandatory stuff out of the way quickly so he canexplore all of the possibilities in his huge playtoy. And he spinsViktor through every facet of the terminal like a colorful top,involving the terminal's quirky workers in his meager existence.= In that sense, ""The Terminal"" is a lot like ""Being There"" (1979),where Peter Sellers played an illiterate simpleton on whompoliticians projected their needs and desires. But Hanks is farfrom a blank slate. His body language, physical comedy, anddeceptively simple dialogue speak volumes. Chaplin regrettedhaving to give up silent movies because he felt that his ""LittleTramp"" could not express himself uniquely with sound. I thinksomething like ""The Terminal"" would have been an effectivesolution.= That's not to belittle Hanks' winning co-stars, especially CatherineZeta-Jones as Viktor's potential love interest and Chi McBride asone of Viktor's many supporters. They all give Spielberg's work thesheen of a big, beautiful dream.=",The Terminal
264,ikizdevran-882-254684,Life is Waiting.,8,1 July 2018,"Directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones, ""The Terminal"" is a drama and a romantic-comedy. After reading the summary, you may get the feeling that this is another classic film of these genres, but it is not. There is a perfect balance among the genres of the film, as well as its characters and their feelings. ""The Terminal"" is the story of Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) who is coming to New York to fulfill his father's wish. While he was on the air, his country has fallen in a coup and his passport and visa are not recognized by the American Government. Therefore, he is not permitted to go back to his country or enter in United States. His only place to live is the terminal.Viktor Navorski evolves into a natural hero during the film. The more you watch him, the more you believe in him because he doesn't pretend to be someone else. He is natural and law-obeying person. He has a strong personality and a character. When he comes to USA he doesn't know any English, and, therefore, he fails to understand why he is not permitted in the country or why he can't go back. He is an ambitious guy who starts learning English day by day. Tom Hanks, as Victor Navorski, doesn't try to speak perfect English as the film progresses. He keeps talking with his accent until the end. This makes us believe in film's naturalness, and this little detail creates perfection for ""The Terminal.""The collaboration of Hanks and Spielberg in ""Catch Me If You Can"" and ""Saving Private Ryan,"" brings experience to ""The Terminal."" You get the feeling that they really understand each other while watching the film. Steven Spielberg wants to introduce Navorski as a natural character, and Tom Hanks is there to do it. Confusion in his eyes and his accent are the key points of Tom Hank's performance as Navorski. ""The Terminal"" is a character based film. Its success and perception are strictly based on the performance of the leading actor. That's why their experience with each other is critical. In many scenes, you understand what is going on just by looking at the face of Victor Navorski. The other characters, even the main officer of the airport Frank Dixson (Stanley Tucci) who wants to get rid of him, is not a bad character. Everyone has some certain respect for each other. The film doesn't try to be funny, it just happens by itself. That's why Terminal is a self-flowing, natural film.The story is said to be inspired by 18-year stay of Mehran Karimi in Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, but still, ""The Terminal"" is an original story. It doesn't have a plot. It is just telling the story of an unlucky man and his determination. There is a huge difference between the first and the last scenes in the means of character development. He comes to the airport as an unknown stranger and turns out to be a hero with his strong state of mind and for being the middle man in the love story between Enrique (Diego Luna) who is responsible for the delivery of the food, and the visa officer Dolores (Zoe Saldana). He also helps a man who is not allowed to take medicine to his father in Russia. These incidents are there for the picking by Navorski on his way to being a hero.Its natural flow is the strongest point of the film. You feel like an ordinary passenger in an airport, watching everything with your own eyes. The only difference is the man who is stuck there. It is amazing to see the adaptation of human nature to even the most unrealistic circumstances. Even though it is not critically acclaimed, ""The Terminal"" is still a well-made film that is aware of its place. It takes its time for digesting everything. You feel the easiness of the scenes almost all the time. Even though the story takes place in an airport, it doesn't share its speed or agitation. Once I have stayed for 8 hours in an airport and I know what it means to be stuck in a place which has very limited services.The cinema is going towards a full digitalization. We get to see a lot of special effects and less talent each year. There is an opposite setup in ""The Terminal."" As I said, it is purely based on characters, also most of the film was shot in a set. That huge airport is a set constructed by Alex McDowell, Production Designer of the film. The camera has liberty of showing whatever it feels like, because everything in the set is part of the film.

Not every movie can do that, no matter how hard it tries. People wept while watching ""Big Fish""; I thought, ""If I were stuck next to Albert Finney's character on a train, I'd weep, too."" That is to say, I didn't care. Maybe I'm a hardcase, or maybe not; I wept at the end of ""Edward Scissorhands."" Go figure.Now here is ""The Terminal"" with Tom Hanks in his most likable role, in my opinion, since Forrest Gump. Some have said he's TOO likable. ""The movie is too formulaic."" ""Too silly."" ""Sappy."" ""Too sweet."" ""Not up to Spielberg's best."" You know what? Not all of Spielberg's movies can be ""Schindler's List."" Or ""E.T."" What you have here is a movie that made me remember what it was like to have a good time at the movies and leave feeling good about the world in general. This movie was literally a breath of fresh air amid the noxious fumes of hate and war and fear that pervade our society nowadays. Too silly? What's wrong with a silly movie every now and then, AS LONG IT MAKES YOU CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS? I don't mean ""Scooby-Doo"" silly; I'm talking ""Say Anything..."" silly.I found myself caught up in Viktor's world and the friends he made in the terminal. I was moved when he explained to Amelia why he carries that damn peanut can around. I was moved again when Gupta selflessly provides a (possible) way for Viktor to leave the terminal. I found myself physically rooting for Viktor when he arranges a private dinner date for Amelia on the ""terrace."" What else can you wish for in a film? I have but one complaint. As moved as I was by his romance with Amelia, I didn't think it was absolutely necessary. The story was involving enough without throwing a love story into the mix. But Spielberg makes it work well enough that I didn't care too much.All of this is to say: Do yourself a favor and rent ""The Terminal."" Unless you're an incurable humbug who thinks Spielberg should stick to war movies and nothing else, in which case this movie will do nothing for you. For everyone else, check it out. Come on. It'll be fun. Remember fun?",The Terminal

This movie has its ""cute"" moments, but tries too hard. Mr. Speilberg (Steve you're one of the best directors out there, but romantic comedies just aren't your forte) couldn't even save this stinker!

And it was such an excellent film !! Tom Hanks was outstanding, almost every character seem to have a story and meaning and is not just a person who walks in the background and the dialog is interesting and so meaningful. The drama that was created throughout the film was absolutely great, the comedy scenes were hilarious, and the movie was so enjoyable I'm definitely gonna watch it again soon. Overall, this film is for the Tom Hanks fans, the Spielberg fans, for those who love comedy films and for those who like dramatic comedy films. This movie shows that Hanks and Spielberg have an outstanding chemistry. If this movie's underrated, then it's one of the moest underrated comedy films ever.",The Terminal
269,speedy-droid,A Wonderful Character Study,8,24 August 2016,"The Terminal is a wonderful character study, which is something with which Tom Hanks seems to be intrigued... Forrest Gump, Cast Away, The Terminal, Bridge of Spies, etc. He does a very good job with it, for the most part.First of all... The premise of the film is unlikely. A person in the situation of Hanks' character -- Viktor -- would not be treated/ignored in the manner show in the film, especially post-9/11 (the film was released in 2004). I know -- I work in the travel and transportation industry. However, that is not really relevant to the point(s) that the film appears to be trying to make, so a little suspension of belief in this regard is acceptable.Just for the Record: In the real world, Viktor would swiftly have been removed from the airport, and probably would have been granted temporary asylum or somehow returned to his home or an intermediary location. At any rate, he wouldn't have been allowed to wander around the airport for weeks or months, when the authorities knew his situation from Day One. In that respect, the film is just a caricature of U.S. bureaucracy. That situation was necessary for the plot, so the filmmakers had to use a little ""artistic license"" to create the situation which they wanted.So, then we see the Character Study. A foreign national, who doesn't know English, is suddenly trapped in an unusual situation in the USA. He's not an accused criminal, but he's trapped. How would he respond? According to the film, he does so by reverting to his own culture and personal morals. That makes sense. When we feel afraid and isolated, we almost always revert to our basic instincts and base culture. It helps us to feel safe and comfortable.Viktor does that. He looks for ways to sustain himself, he helps other people as he was (probably) taught to do as a child.The only real issue that I had with the film was the somewhat manufactured relationship between Viktor and Amelia (Catherine Zeta- Jones). That seemed to be a bit non-sequitur.Overall, a very good film that explores humanity and emotion very well.",The Terminal
270,chriskylie,Too sugary sweet for my tastes.,5,16 August 2020,A surprisingly light weight affair for Spielberg; light in both tone and content. What starts as an interesting concept quickly loses traction as characters lapse into pantomime stereotype and the plot unravels from sweet to implausible to utterly ridiculous. The movie is largely saved by Hanks' Everyman charm and if there is a standout in The Terminal it's a showcase for Hanks superb comic timing and physical comedy.

272,Exeron,Hard to decide...,7,1 May 2008,"...what to say about this film.The Plot- Original as it seems, the movie still contains a lot of American clichés. Like ""Hollywood happy ending"". Exaggerated love scenes and so on. But yet there's something about this movie that forces you to not hate it. Deep inside i thought like ""Man this is pretty silly"" But the movie charmed me to enjoy it after all. But some things in the movie still made me think ""That makes no sense"". But the movie was funny, it had humor & Drama, which is a perfect combination, so give it a shot.Tom Hanks, tremendous acting as always. He does the Russian accent pretty well, and i notice that he did his homework when it comes to learning Russia.So we got, Good acting and a funny movie (at some points sad). You think that would be enough? Unfortunately this movie is ruined at some points, some things that make you stop like it for a moment and then later on you love it.I was pretty confused and didn't know what to vote...it leaned towards to an 8 but there were to many points at the movie that i thought were pretty unnecessary and ridiculous. So The Therminal get's a solid 7...nothing more nothing less.If you want to get entertained, rent this then.

273,filmbuff20,"Fun, warm and engaging with Spielberg written all over it.",7,28 April 2009,"Inspired in part by a true event, The Terminal tells the story of Viktor Navorksi (Tom Hanks), a native of the fictional Eastern European country of Krakozhia, who flies to New York to keep a promise to his father. While Viktor's plane is in the air, there is a military coup, rendering his native country unrecognised and rendering Viktor with an invalid passport and no where else to go. In short, he is unacceptable. Unable to leave the JFK transit lounge or to fly home, Viktor settles in the airport and begins to find new ways to make money, amuse himself and make friends while learning English. In the process he meets Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a troubled flight attendant whose relationship with a married man is beginning to take it's toll. She finds solace in Viktor's friendship, and Viktor develops that inevitable crush...First of all, the obvious. Spielberg had production designer Alex McDowell build an entire terminal from scratch in an unused airplane hangar. The finished product is extremely impressive, even more so if you know that bit of trivia, so it should stand to reason that the star of the movie would be the set. Not so, as Spielberg proved with Jurassic Park, character and performance can work with technical brilliance rather than be outshone. The evidence of this is in Tom Hanks' mesmerising performance. Hanks infuses Victor with the same childlike wonder as that of his characters in Big and Forrest Gump. He loses himself in the role, from the accent right down to the walk and the blank expression, to the point where you can actually forget you're watching Tom Hanks. Although amusing early scenes have Viktor struggling with the language barrier, it's never at his expense. He's portrayed as a character with obstacles to get over and his resourcefulness in getting over them, never as an object of ridicule. In contrast, Catherine Zeta-Jones' character Amelia is not as likable as one would expect from a love interest, possibly because her character was not originally intended that way and during filming the chemistry between the two made it clear that the connection should be somewhat romantic. She isn't unnecessary, but she does give the impression that she is there solely to develop Viktor himself.However, the other supporting players, Enrique (Diego Luna of Y Tu Mama Tambien), Gupta (Kumar Pallana) and Mulroy (Chi McBride) as airport employees never fall into the trap of 'annoying comedic padding' and are always amiable, funny and touching when they need to be. This motley crew formed a friendship during filming and it radiates off the screen. The role of workaholic immigration officer Frank Dixon is realised wonderfully in the hands of character actor Stanley Tucci. A flawed and complex creation, Dixon serves as the antagonist of the piece, trying desperately to get a promotion while trying to get Viktor out of his terminal so that he can be someone else's problem. Like Hanks' Carl Hanratty of Catch Me If You Can, it's difficult to label Dixon a bad guy. He's just doing his job, heartlessly and efficiently but is visibly conflicted about what he has to do, following the rulebook stubbornly and ruthlessly. The humanity that Tucci brings to the role elevates him beyond the usual moustache twirling villain.On the directing side, Spielberg fills each of his frames with goodies. He has an entire airport set to play with and he uses every inch of it with a boyish delight. Despite the enormity of the set, it would still have been easy for it to become claustrophobic, but there's always something pretty to gawk at, Spielberg achieving the seemingly impossible task of making you want to live in an airport terminal. Spielberg has deliberately shied away from all out comedies since his flop '1941', but this movie's comedic element shows that he's gotten over that, flitting effortlessly between action blockbusters, sci-fi and serious historical movies. The only drawback is the overt sentimentality that dominates the last third of the movie. Some would say that this movie earns it's right to be sentimental, but it becomes a tad uncomfortable. Spielberg has been unfairly labelled as a sentimental director, due no doubt to films such as ET, Always and AI, but these people fail to realise that most of his films, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Jaws, Duel and Minority Report to name a few are at their core dark and disturbing in places, so Spielberg earns his right to lash on the weepies once in a while.Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski's lighting and use of colour is always magnificent, but here he fills each shot with wonderfully rich golds and blues and his style, which has always complemented Spielberg's sleight of hand direction, has never been more suited to his director. The main feat achieved here is the use of artificial light doubling as daylight, something which the average film-goer won't notice, but without it, the illusion of the set would have failed.John Williams' music is from the same ilk as his Catch Me score. Viktor's theme is an eastern European influenced riff in the form of a mischievous clarinet at the forefront which is instantly memorable and is the kind of theme that'll play a loop in your head for hours afterwards. It adds a further lightness to the film which in turn adds considerably to the overall feel good factor of a film already warming the cockles.THE BOTTOM LINE: Spielberg has created another 'dessert' of a movie, which occasionally gets a little too sweet and sickly for it's own good, but is engaging enough that it always ensures you'll want to come back for that second helping.",The Terminal

I was always interested in this story. I knew in advance that this film was loosely based on it, but I also knew that they changed many details to make it more palatable for an American audience (Iranian??? no! France??? no!). Instead, make the main character a simple-minded pseudo-Russian, put it in New York (NEW YORK!! America!!), and instead of a story about a refugee, make it a story about collecting an autograph from a jazz musician.The whole thing is frivolous and clichéd. Tom Hanks' accent is straight out of a bad sitcom from the 80's. So is the ""ooh ahh, I love America, land of freedom, so much better than Russia"" shtick. Old, tired, rubbish... not to mention the 'romance' between the border official and cargo man. It's called stalking! This movie is just a dumb fairy tale. Probably the best audience are people who've never heard of Merhan Karimi Nasseri, and just want some junk food for the mind. This is it.In the DVD extras, I was hoping perhaps to see some reference to Mr. Nasseri.... but there isn't a single one. The authors didn't even acknowledge the inspiration.

Spielberg wasted his time on this one.  Not highly recommended.

It has got one of the weird stories of all times and yet it has been characterized in an all too wonderful manner. The story was inspired by a real-life incident; however the script was modified so as to not match the actual incident itself, which is why i found this movie very very entertainingHaving said that, i would not call this a movie without life, this movie has lot of heart in it and in fact many times you would really feel moved by the innocence and ignorance displayed by the character. My family was in tears in many occasions and I wouldn't blame them for that. The end was really heart-warming finale however such episode of a stranded passenger without his fault in an airport is a situation that can only mean disaster and here despite being hero of the movie Tom Hanks is not spared.The movie starts with a picture of JFK in its busy hours (which is always) and then an arrest just to show the audience the airport commanding officer is sharp, all set for the hero's arrival which based on his purpose of his visit should have been a cake walk but not so. From thereon the ordeal begins, first for the airport officials to make Mr. Victor understand what kind of deep crap he is in and then his flexible adaptability to counter attack the situation takes over. He turns every stone to make sure he survives as long as it takes and complete his missionI have watched this movie at least 5 times and still there are a few scenes I could watch again and again. Those are the moments the director proves his brilliance and Tom Hanks his ace performance; and trust me there are so many. With every such short burst Tom Hanks starts creeping into your brain and when you think everything is resolved you would expect a standard trip with Kumbaya, but not to be. The director keeps you engaged until the last minute and even though his mission to visit America was very simple, yet noble the characters that are put in place in utilizing the hero with his best abilities (innocence). Of course the hero benefits from every possible source and wins our hearts with it.Surely you cannot ask from the director or lead actor from more, this has got all the right ingredients of a well-accomplished movie. Catherina Zeta Jones, though has a very minuscule screen space, has justified her role and delivers a knock-out punch.

Tom Hanks, in this Steven Spielberg production, was one of the unlucky person whom was denied access to the United States of America, and had to stay in the airport. During his stay, he got his way through by his usual acts of living skills. He got his way around, knowing people, getting away most of the time from problems, only to find himself landing into another problem. His acting skills definitely put laughs in the cinema as we watched him acting out so naturally as what a foreigner would do if they would visit another different country. Catherine Zeta-Jones is stunning and beautiful, and the part of the movie where it had romance, began from there.

The plot is slightly more of a parody of Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away: Tom Hanks was once stranded in an unknown island. In The Terminal, he's once again stranded, this time however, in an airport in New York City. Viktor Navorski (the role that Tom plays) comes to America to accomplish one thing that his father has requested before he died but due to conflicts and government overthrow in Krakozhia, his visa and passport are no longer valid in the US, forcing him to stay put within the terminal. To make matters worse, Navorski's English proves to be a pain in the neck, often causing misinterpretations and confusion. But there lies the brilliance of Tom Hanks: every gesture and expression he made in each scene is naturally flawless and hilarious. As in any Spielberg film, the editing is smooth, the camera angles are creatively used in a rather dynamic way and of course, bits and pieces of clever gags to make sure that the audience don't get bored easily. If some speak of some miscast in this movie, well, that may be half true. Catherine Zeta Jones plays her role nicely, Stanley Tucci fits the role of the 'villain' extremely well and the rest manage to give The Terminal a sense of magic even if it isn't obviously there.I just only hope if Mr. Spielberg spends more time with the romantic relationship between Tom and Catherine but the rest of the production is plain exceptional.

Did he not have a job or family back home that he had to get back to?No one came to visit him at all in 9 months.Then he finally gets to leave and I just didn't get the sense of a happy ending that was expected. Wr don't know if he got the signature.Also with Ms Warren it just didn't really end the story she just smiled and walked off.I think it could have been good but I just wasn't emotionally invested in the storyline at any point.,The Terminal

292,Good-Evening-Clarice,AWFUL!,1,12 June 2004,"I can't believe Hanks, Spielberg and Zeta-Jones teaming together would result in such a horrible film. I know they were going for a light and funny feel, but they got light and empty-headed instead. Forget the Oscars, this does not even qualify for mindless summer fun. Completely unbelievable, with Hanks' accent so terrible it was the only comic relief throughout a very flimsy plot. Basically, the concept is not all that intriguing but if played for comedy it's even worse. A big let-down. I don't know if this will be a big hit, but I bet it won't. I never believed in any of the characters; none felt authentic. And why would you make Catherine look frumpy in a movie? Grade: C-.",The Terminal
293,jessejace,"not what i expected, but then again, what is?",7,24 December 2004,"Spielberg has made so many ""oh my god that was so powerful and believable and IMPORTANT"" movies, that now he can't make a whimsical bit of fluff without people saying, ""Oh my god, that was so unpowerful and inconceivable and TRIVIAL."" This movie feels like Catch Me If You Can, and requires a similar amount of suspension of disbelief in order to be enjoyed. Tom Hanks plays a foreign guy who learns to speak English in record time by reading a travel pamphlet. He falls for Catherine Zeta Jones, who is still beautiful as ever, even when playing a stupid, despicable flight attendant.But watch out for the ""evil"" airport director! I say airport director, but he should have been referred to throughout the movie as the ""final boss,"" because he seemed more like King Koopa or Sephiroth than a person existing in real life. How do you seriously explain his petty vengeance against Tom Hanks' character? That was the main issue that stuck with me throughout the film. The Evil Airport Director's role as fascist overlord of JFK Airport just didn't jive.There is also an important plot point near the end that made no sense to me whatsoever. It involves the final trumping of the Evil Overlord via an Indian janitor whose catchphrase, ""DO YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT?"" failed to make the Japanese audience at the theater where I watched Terminal laugh even once. I won't give it away, just watch the movie and then send me an email explaining what the hell happened, because I don't get it.This is not an important movie. It has no massive revelations or cathartic outpourings of wisdom (although it comes close, in a scene where Evil Final Boss asks Tom Hanks why he wants to enter the US. I half expected Tom to slap himself on the forehead and say, ""You're right! Why indeed!"" and get on a plane to some country where foreigners DON'T get treated like garbage). But I won't rush to condemn Spielberg for taking a lighthearted prance down Fluffy Fluff Lane for the sake of box office numbers.

294,tipplerunkus,Spielberg's comic masterpiece.,10,23 June 2004,"Steven Spielberg has proven himself to be equally adept at at number of different genres, but comedy has been the one genre wherein success eluded him - ""1941"", his one flat-out comedy, was also his one complete artistic failure. ""Hook"" was a largely comic fantasy, but was neither entirely a comedy nor entirely successful (though it is a better film than some of it's most vocal detractors have implied). ""Catch Me If You Can"" was, before now, the closest Steven had come to comic success - but that excellent film is really as much drama as comedy.While ""The Terminal"" has been marketed as a comedy-drama, this really is a true comedy, with some dramatic elements. Unfortunately, our society has been dumbed down to the point where people think comedy means ""Austin Powers"". Here, Spielberg had succeeded completely at creating another classic, and Tom Hanks creates the most endearing character he has played since ""Forrest Gump"". ""The Terminal"" is hilarious, touching, fast-moving and entertaining, and the biggest stretch Spielberg has faced since ""Schindler's List"". It is one of his most character driven works to date.Sadly, we have reached an appalling mentality among many filmgoers, especially those who congregate on the internet, wherin any upbeat movie that makes you feel good is trashed, regardless of quality. Anyone of even moderate intelligence realizes that there is room for many types films, and a truly well-made ""feel good"" movie which is not shamelessly manipulative or contrived can be a great thing, which is exactly what ""The Terminal"" is, along with being the best film of the summer.",The Terminal

296,colinjbooth,Perfectly pleasing production.,10,9 October 2004,"Expectancy for the new 'Spielberg' movie nowadays is awash with mixed emotions. Gone are the days when a ticket guaranteed a show unmatched in storytelling, style and bravado. After watching 'The Terminal', Spielberg's 3rd collaboration with Tom Hanks, maybe i feel the magic could be coming back. I enjoyed 'Catch Me...' and thought 'Minority...' was a flashy overwritten but ultimately enjoyable yarn, but i long for the days of 'Jaws', 'Raiders...' and, yes, even 'ET'. 'The Terminal' as far as i could see, was perfect. The tone was playful and witty, the script knowing without being smug about it. The Direction was outstanding. The production design astounding, and the acting just terrific. Hanks avoiding the label of 'dodgy accent' by pitching his performance just the right side of understated. Zeta Jones, played her smallish role well, and was a fine distraction. Stanley Tucci was a magnificent Officious Obstacle, and made a character which was almost likable out of one which, by a lesser actor, would have been a boo-hiss villain. The set is amazing, as real as any airport. An amalgamation of every Terminal you've seen in a seamless blend.The terminal itself is occasionally laugh-out-loud funny.It is romantic and feel-good without veering into schmaltz. The music, which i forgot, was low-key and unobtrusive. There is, in short, no reason to not give this movie a shot.",The Terminal

If you take a Tatiesque, deadpan approach to comedy, putting in some corny, off-putting drama story about the protagonist isn't gonna work. It feels like a betrayal, in fact. The first hour of this movie or so is very entertaining and, although it trusts way too much on its ability to get natural laughs from the audience (and it reiterates some ""funny"" situations too much), it still manages to create some hilarious moments with a great sense of pacing.Then it goes horribly downhill. Victor Navorski starts learning English, and we discover that what he has to say is not interesting at all, in facts it reads like a deleted scene of ""Forrest Gump"". A romance with Catherine Zeta-Jones comes out of the blue, and we can foresee the ""romantic comedy"" strategies of delaying the kiss and having a convoluted and pointless discussion before the final reconciliation. So, it doesn't end in a happy hug.

I have always liked this ""one filming location"" -styled movies also. That's part of why I like Tom Hanks movies in generally. (Like in Cast Away, Green Mile, Forrest Gump) They don't have bunch of filming locations and are quite slow paced.But about the movie itself. Pros: It's good. I have ALWAYS loved Tom Hanks and it's definitely one of my favorite actors. Of course, it did good job in this movie. It's quite slow paced and funny occasionally. It was very enjoyable to watch. The story behind Viktor Navorski was intriguing.Cons: The thing that distracted me was how quickly he learned to speaking English. Okay, he was living 9 month total in the terminal but still.. Well, not a big minus. And the other thing was about that woman.. I really was hoping that woman chooses Viktor. Oh well, those ""little"" cons take 2 star away but rest of the movie was very good.

There is nothing in this film that is less than good. The acting is excellent and Spielberg's direction is effortless and undistracting. Except for a few over the top transitions and cuts the flow and blocking of scenes is the very definition of understated excellence. Can't anyone appreciate this anymore because it is in fact quite rare. Very few Directors have this much assurance in technique and it should be savored.

Well, in this case it turns out to be quite a lot. I had low expectations for ""The Terminal"" and was pleasantly surprised. First of all, the set is great. This film looks and feels like a living terminal. Spielberg comes through as director as well. How do you make filming inside an airport terminal interesting? Spielberg manages to do just that. But all of this would not matter if there was no story or characters to base it on. And without providing spoilers, lets just say Tom Hanks once again pulls off a film sustaining role. It helps that he is given a quality script to work with. Add to all of the above an unexpected group of protagonists, and antagonist and a little romance, and what more could one ask for from a night out at the movies. My only qualm is that ""The Terminal"" is over sentimental at times. And of course, it is a drama - no action here. A fine film nevertheless.  8/10",The Terminal

I think this is his worst movie, by far. Compared to 'The Terminal', 'Minority Report' plays like 'The Third Man'. The movie is naturally technically perfect. Why was it made? I speculate the movie wants to be a very subtle and noble piece of art concocted to denounce the oppression of a pure but honest European guy by the cold and not humane American administration. The end result is so simplistic and exploitative that I found the movie simply insulting and hateful. The only word which comes to my mind is trash. As for Tom Hanks' acting, which I usually love, well...no comment. A final note: the character of C. Zeta-Jones ends up fulfilling all clichés about (female) flight personnel; does not that say it all?Do not degrade yourself by watching this movie.",The Terminal

There were some wonderful moments, albeit too few and too far between.  The supporting characters often stole the show, and Ms. Zeta-Jones really didn't need to stretch her acting chops much in this role.  The most interesting aspect of this movie was the closing credits with the actual autographs of the actors and principle crew written across the screen.

308,Luluhalabaloo,Simple children's fable uselessly made into PG-13,5,21 May 2005,"This movie is exactly what I expected. A foreign traveler is forced to stay in the airport while his passport/visa is sorted out. I heard of the story a long time ago and found it interesting even then. But, I suspect that the real story is stranger than fiction as usual, and finally am disappointed with the film for a number of reasons.Tom Hanks is good in this film. He looks the part: a simple, fretful, not particularly stunning individual who cannot speak the language. But I wonder if there wasn't a bit of stereotyping that is somewhat passé here, which become tiresome rather quickly. In fact, all the characters seem to have been a product of generic outlining, without nuance or distinctly humanistic individualism.For example, Amelia the Stewardess fit into most of our collective impressions of what a stewardess is all about. As in Catch me if you Can, the Stewardess is a pretty, young, somewhat vapid but adventuresome girl who is not a mother, a daughter or a wife. I wonder if Mr. Spielberg has something about stewardesses! But to be serious, Amelia was a not a disappointment as she acted the stewardess stereotype. And her final act had nothing to do with ""sacrificing herself"" for Viktor, but rather as an apology for hurting Viktor by returning to her married lover. And that's all, folks.I loved the Indian Janitor. He was funny. One wonders how many times people throw up in the middle of floors judging by the number of ""wet floor"" signs appear in obscure, right-in-the-way places. From now on, I will look for the janitor watching! But some questions: so why did he walk out to get caught? He didn't know that security knew what he was all about  which brings me to a second question: why hadn't they deported him till now? The Indian came to America to escape what he had to face back home. It was cowardly, and he knew it, but lived with it and became wary and unfulfilled. Viktor retained his dignity and honesty but not admitting he feared his homeland in order to get out of the terminal, and this was inspiring to the Janitor, and he decided to do the right thing and head home. I don't believe he ""sacrificed"" himself in order to keep Viktor from being deported. And that says more about Viktor's character, and the janitor's for that matter, than the ""sacrifice"" idea.The romance between the customs agent Torres and Luna is funny  first, her name  Torres, from Star Trek Voyager - and she is a ""trekkie"", as is he. So now we know that they are riding on a different cloud than us, and that ""trekkie"" thing is apparently pretty darn important. So love at first ring shouldn't be so strange  it's just that she doesn't ""look"" like a typical ""trekkie"" convention goer, I guess, and usually girls that stunning don't go for immigrant food handlers...but maybe that's just observation and experience talking. It certainly was optimistic! Viktor's ode to Amelia of the fountain was just plain weird. Why didn't it work? Because it represented how the relationship would never work, I suppose, or foreshadowed how he would never be able to make the relationship work, but it seemed like a big waste of film time  I didn't get much out of it, and frankly, it looked ugly.And then, finally, Viktor's reason for coming to America  to get a signature for his dad. A lot of money for a poor country guy to fly to America for one hour or so to get a signature and fly home. Now that is the most unrealistic thing I have ever heard. If you are going to work all your life (which judging by Viktor's clothes and demeanor, it looks like he wasn't wealthy) for a ticket to America and then stay for an hour, that was just plain unbelievable. Perhaps it was supposed to smack of the chicness of Catch Me if You Can, but it failed and wasn't a surprise ending.This wasn't a film that really caught the real story behind the strangeness of a scenario where a man is caught between countries. It didn't catch it and exploit the ludicrousness of the situation, or the comical take on it either. The film seemed to straddle between children's fable and simplistic entertainment. From the simple no-goodness of the security chief to the simple sweetness of the big security guy, this was not a film that would tickle anyone's intellectual funny bone, and frankly, I don't think it was intended as such. If the few swear/sexual words uttered by the inglorious Amelia and the drug smuggling scene were cut out, this could have been a good teaching movie for kids.",The Terminal

The start is nice enough with Viktor being trapped at the airport and trying to figure out what to do. But then a whole lot of Hollywood clichés come rolling in and even the good performances by many of the actors didn't quite save the movie from little mental groans in my head. It felt a bit as if the script writers and other movie makers had tried to recreate a feel-good movie from more innocent times. It surely worked for many people but did not quite work for me. Individual scenes made me laugh at loud, some others made me just wince slightly as another layer of sugary-sweet feel-good dressing was added to a formula recipe.",The Terminal
311,jsc173,I'd Hoped For Forrest Gump,8,25 June 2004,"The Terminal is a good movie, but only because Tom Hanks is so bloody entertaining when he has a character to play whom you fall in love with at first sight. In this case, that's Viktor Navorski. Catherine Z-J is not particularly believable as a United Air Lines flight attendant who can't make up her mind. In that regard, the characters are a bit like Forrest and Jenny, but you could like Jenny as a person. You definitely don't like Amelia. In the first half of the movie, Stanley Tucci was mostly likable, but then he grew confused about who he wanted to be, too. The standout ""goofball"" in the movie was Kumar Pallana, who played Gupta, a lovable Indian janitor who had a perverse sense of humor, a surprising talent or two, and a strong sense of doing the right thing.I guess what bothered me the most about the movie was that only one person (Amelia) ever asked Viktor (Tom) why he wanted to come to New York City. His reason for being there was something that one of his buddies could easily have taken care of during the months he spent living at JFK. In fact, once you find out why he was there, you have to ask yourself whether he needed to be there at all. Hanks - 10; the movie itself - 6; averaged - I give it an 8.",The Terminal

Perhaps they should have just utilized some existing political situation. In cases, some actors clearly over acted and while that ""medicine"" scene was well written, the ending of it was not quite satisfying. A lot of other stuff will also not make much sense.

Right off the bat we get into Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) character. The way the movie progresses is unbelievably perfect. **The Terminal** gives offers fun and comedy for the whole family to enjoy.This movie reminded me of Finding Nemo. The way out there is a world underneath the ocean matches the way there is a world in this airport. Viktor Navorski goes through a lot of phases and emotions throughout the movie which makes this film stand out. Tom Hanks portrays Viktor Navorski in a brilliant manner. The emotions he shows from start to end makes you feel good and bad. Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) played a good role, although I didn't know what to think of her at times. She was a mystery character throughout the movie, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) played a great villain/enemy type character. I loved how he did everything in his power to prevent Viktor Navorski from leaving the terminal.This is without a doubt one of the greatest movies written. What the characters go through, discovers, finds, shows, loves, and does are mixed into one great film. Steven Spielberg did an outstanding job on directing what could be one of the best films of the year, if not, thee best. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that's this original and unique. You can go into detail Viktor Navorski learns the US ways, and he quickly adapts to its system.The Terminal is a movie that'll shock you. It turned out to be a great film.

Plot didn't have any momentum going for it -super saccharine cliche - Literally shocked to see Spielberg's name on it. Quite a disappointment.

Based on a real life story, the movie shows how language can become a barrier and also how it can be overcome once you have the right attitude. Survival instincts of a man trapped in no-man's land are so sharply showcased in this motion picture.A beautiful picture painted of the adage  where there is a will, there is a way out, and there certainly was a ""way out"" for our hero Victor (talk about the perfect name for your hero- victor indeed)! The movie keeps you guessing; the elements of suspense, thrilling moments that one would associate with Steven Spielberg (the director) are there.The fictional country of Krakozhia is well represented by Tom Hanks and he delivers the Bulgarian language smoothly; not that most of us know Bulgarian, but it is hard for an English speaker to pretend he doesn't understand English  so in that context its great acting.Tom Hanks looks young and handsome, and interestingly even though this movie came in 2004, he looks younger than in 2002 (""Catch me if you can""). And after Castaway, most of his movies seem to portray him getting into all sorts of problems and his coming out of them.Catherine Zeta Jones is a confused American woman who can't choose for herself. She and Hanks has something going, or so it seems, but we gather that in the end, she can't make up her mind at all. Now, I am not for male chauvinism, but her role had major flaws in it. However, she does excite us all with her appearances now and then.The end was rather surprising  shocking may be the right word, with all the interest and chemistry generated by the lead woman (Catherine Zeta Jones), as Shakespeare would have aptly named it, much ado about nothing. Or a blown experiment, even. But that's the story, to like it or not like it  that's left to you.Rating  7.5/10 (for its suspense mainly).",The Terminal
319,arlened324,See Hungry Man staring at people scarfing down Big Macs - Hilarious!,3,4 July 2004,"Directed by Stephen Spielberg. Enough to steer one to their nearest Cineplex. Advertised as an endearing comedy...No mention that this film is based on the plight of a real human being who was held at the Charles De Gaulle (sp?) Airport for some 15 years, and was paid some $100,000 by the Spielberg people to use his plight as the basis for a fictional piece of garbage. The documentary I saw on CNN mentioned that the gentleman was now free to leave the airport, the glitch having been solved, but that his mental state was so fragile he still remained at the airport. Supposedly he bought some new clothes and books with part of the $100,000 he was paid.No, it's not funny to see a hungry man watching airport travelers scarfing down burgers while he picks up the scraps.

What a gal...Yes, this could have been a good movie but it needed good and honorable (and honest) people to write it.Waste of talent and money. Insulting to the real man caught in this dilemma.Oh, yes - the set is Academy Award worthy. Yes, Tom Hanks is delicious and Stanley Tucci a vicious authority figure - what else? Catherine Zeta Jones is beautiful, if confused (as the written character).What a dishonorable, disagreeable, and dishonest story. Where are the writers?",The Terminal
320,tanjotasu,Speil-Hanks-berg has dunnit again!!,10,19 June 2004,"I walked into The Terminal expecting a light comedy with a romantic twist. While being all that, it turned out to be a intricate, deep movie about human nature. While people try to come into the US to make their lives better, by any way possible, Tom Hanks plays a character who follows the rules. Stuck in the JFK terminal due to the fact that his own country ceased to exist while he was in air. The movie is strong due to the realistic performances by everyone involved in the process. It was funny at times, but mostly it just presented the innocent characters on a platter. There were some scenes when people around me couldn't stop laughing, while I was touched. It is an awesome movie with great performances. Tom Hanks has another Oscar coming his way!10/10",The Terminal

322,matpinckney,Best film of the year...,9,24 September 2004,"(Warning - This review contains some spoilers) How refreshing. A new Hollywood film that doesn't seem like a new Hollywood film. The only connection here is that it's a product of modern cinema, but it has absolutely nothing in common with other new releases.A lot of modern films have a certain '2-dimensional' quality to them. They appear flat and weak, with the cinematography appearing uninspired, rather, just a way to see the action.'The Terminal' on the other hand is a wonderful addition to the times. The story is vibrant and heart-wrenching. There are touches of strong humor, sadness, realism, individualism, and friendship, along with many other themes. The acting is top class throughout, with special credit going, of course, to Tom Hanks. This film is just more proof that he is one of the greatest actors of modern times. There is a real vulnerability to Viktor Navorski, and yet, a certain strength as well. The acting is superb. We empathize with the character. He can project such humor, and also such intense sadness and isolation. Wonderful.Catherine Zeta-Jones is also fantastic here. Her character takes the film away from standard film conventions, and introduces something new. She fits perfectly into the role of Amelia Warren, and acts as a wonderful contrast to Hanks. The two are strong when with each other, and equally strong without.The friendship that forms between Navorski and the other workers adds a wonderful element to the film. These scenes provide some of the most heart-wrenching moments that we see. I have my own little soft spot for Gupta Rajan (played by Kumar Pallana), and the way the character is portrayed. Very well done. (Also, a mention for Frank Dixon, played by Stanley Tucci - wonderful).The cinematography is soft and subtle, unlike a lot of modern cinema, which provides a welcome change in pace.Overall, this film is without a doubt, the best film of the year that I have seen so far. Everything from visual to sound to subtleties - everything is put together incredibly well. We are left with a truly amazing, inspiring, little film.",The Terminal
323,semaj1968,Charming Spielberg/Hank comedy,8,22 January 2018,"I watched this again recently with my 16yr old son, who enjoyed it he was laughing and smiling throughout. 
I explained to him this is based on a trued story of Merhan Nasseri who lived in Frances main airport for 18 years which in itself is remarkable. I've seen a few negative reviews on this movie and personally I don't see why. They made the movie their own and in a comedic style and for me they pulled it off, yes of course you have to suspend belief with the likes of Zeta Jones who looks stunning in this falling for Viktor (Hanks) I mean would Zeta Jones fall for a much older guy in real life.....oh waitHers is a tragic character and I dare say there is some woman who are like that, keep falling for the wrong guy and keep going back for more.
The other sad character was played by Diego Luna stalking, yes lets be fair stalking Zoe Saldana and getting Viktor to get info from her then eventually presenting her with a ring. She still had no idea who was interested in her c'mon this is really where you have to suspend belief.Give this movie a go it's up there with ""Catch me if you can"" another Spielberg/Hanks movie as an easy watch that is quite charming and sweeps you up.",The Terminal
324,smorris200,Surprisingly good...,8,14 February 2005,"...although I should not have been surprised, Spielberg and Hanks, had greatness written all over it. But I got suckered into a lot of the bad press around the film and suppose I judged it before I had watched it. Anyway, I have now watched it and I liked it.I thought the first half of the film was absolutely fantastic, the humor, the acting, the character development - they were all good. I thought the second half of the film suffered a little from becoming a bit over emotional, the love story seemed out of sorts and the way the entire airport staff seemed to know every thing about everyone else was a bit far fetched, I worked in an airport for many years and knew virtually no-one from outside the people I worked with on a daily basis, but maybe that's just me! But I forgave the film these slight nuances and allowed myself to enjoy it.

Unfortunately, it got lost in the shuffle between Farenhieght 911 and Spiderman 2. Plus it wasn't promoted or advertised very well. I never saw a commerical or preview for it.I saw it twice in the theater, and once now on DVD, and I plan to purchase the DVD in the near future. Great story, great acting, great cast, funny, moving, GREAT camera work, cinematography, and direction. The film makes you really feel for the main character Viktor, and really hate the protagonist Dixon. You cheer on Viktor in his quest to get to New York, and in his romantic pursuit of Amelia. The supporting characters are hilarious, and well developed. Kumar Pallana is brilliant as Gupta. He deserves a best supporting actor Oscar. Viktor has two very touching moments: 1. when he reveals to Amelia the story of the Planters can of ""Jazz"" and why he is waiting in the airport 2. when he presents the fountain to Amelia, and tells her he is ""waiting for her"". Great performances all around, family friendly, and a real feel good story you're guaranteed to enjoy.",The Terminal
326,imdb-5032,Might as well peel an onion,1,5 February 2005,"Tom Hanks plays guileless eastern European character who defeats New York airport security through sheer charm.Projects a self-serving image of foreigners as hysterical naifs, whose emotional incontinence adorns them with a human warmth that calculating Americans ostensibly have lost.Spielberg pays a patronizing homage to the Slavic temperament by scoring some vaguely Slavic-themed music and by having Hanks utter a few lines in a charming but unintelligible gibberish dialect that's about as authentic as Taco Bell.Very sentimental in a highly manipulative way.

He makes a decision to live in the airport until the time is ripe and he meets several people working in the airport. Novarski isn't a good English speaker at all; however, he manages to communicate with American with rudimentary English and to find a way to earn a living by himself. This film proves that language is not the most important elements when we make a reliable relationship with people from different countries. If I were in the same situation as his, I am wondering how I would take a measure to live out in the airport, which is incredibly beyond description. This film is not included just how Novorski lives out in the airport, but also his love and comical factors, and the reason why he comes to the U.S.A all the way.",The Terminal
328,stodmyk,... I felt like I'd been in the THEATRE for nine months,5,10 July 2004,"Widely publicized and reviewed, it hardly seems necessary to recount the premise for this one. For tradition's sake, here goes: The Terminal is about Viktor Navorsky, a man forced by bureaucracy to live in an airport terminal for months -- his country, the fictional Krakozhia, has been the victim of a bloody coup during his flight, leaving him with no homeland and no international recognition. He begins with no English whatsoever, and finishes with a high-paying job, friends, romance and an impressive command of the English language.Parts of this film work, and work well. Tom Hanks is one of the most likable guys in Hollywood, both on- and off-screen. Spielberg, no matter how much you lament his success, is a proven storyteller. He pushes buttons like no other filmmaker on the planet. Whether you appreciate her acting chops or not, Catherine Zeta-Jones has a kind of on-screen shine like few of her peers. And the talented Stanley Tucci, at times, is able to inject some feeling into the one-dimensional bureaucrat responsible for Navorski's stay in travel limbo. All of those things help to make bits of The Terminal palatable -- unfortunately, Spielberg neglected to use the editing parts of his skills with this picture. All the scenes that don't quite work, the ones that usually end up in the 'deleted scenes' portion of the DVD, that drag the story or give unnecessary distraction for a bit of character development... They're all here in the theatrical release which clocks in at a way-too-long 128 minutes.The screenplay uses every hackneyed script tool that focus groups approve of: snippets of dialogue, charming at first, repeated at key points in the movie to be pithy, insightful or condescending; unlikely combinations of ethnic characters in supporting roles; the unwavering, nasty antagonist who wavers in the end; the heartfelt quest eventually fulfilled; and the gorgeous love interest where real life would serve up, if any, a wholly average human specimen. These elements are introduced in such a formulaic fashion that not a one surprises. Each step of the way is overly choreographed, and unfortunately, well-telegraphed. If I could see the future like this at the casino, I'd be a rich man.Only in the United States could someone become trapped by regulations for such a long time without someone saying, ""wait a minute -- the rules weren't meant to do THIS."" (The fact that many people believe this movie is based on a true story is testament to the sometimes amazing incredulousness of US Customs & Immigration.)Only in the United States could so many powerful, talented people get together and make this much of a bore out of this much potential.",The Terminal

Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) is a foreigner from the fictional land of Krakozhia, and he has come to America with nothing but a map and show the world you can make anywhere a home, even a man without a country. This film is a great turn for Tom Hanks, the plot is so original and sweet that it was made into an amazing movie. This is my favorite Spielberg movie besides saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. The Terminal was a genius piece of work that had me laughing the whole time and crying at the end. I am a man, and I am telling you, get yourself checked if you didn't enjoy this because people, only Hanks can take something as annoying as living in an airport and make it look awesome.

And this film really cemented my love for him. I honestly think that without Tom Hanks I would have hated this movie. It's a stupid, stupid idea. It makes no sense and is really contrived. BUT (and this is the biggest 'but' of all time) it works because Tom Hanks is so unbelievably charming.He owns this role, after a while you almost forget that this is Tom Hanks just wandering around an airport for two hours. And it's important to remember that this is just Tom Hanks walking around an airport for two hours, BUT IT WORKS SO WELL.And because Tom Hanks is so great, you really connect with the other characters and feel the emotional weight of all the scenes. You want these people to achieve their goals, even if they are incredibly stupid.Stanley Tucci serves as a great comedic antagonist. He's the villain you love to hate and he adds so much character to what could have easily been a one-note villain.If you're in the mood for a fun, heartwarming movie, then I couldn't recommend this enough.",The Terminal
333,rupertbreheny,"Nice set, shame about the pathos...",7,6 September 2004,"Tom Hanks is on his usual affeable form, but Spielberg turns up the schmaltz just a little too much, as is his want. A glut of contrived side stories adds more fat than the lean frame can handle. Some unconvincing romantic asides just distract from the core of Hanks' resourcefulness, in an odd mirror image of Castaway's self sufficiency theme. At over two hours in length, this sweet and charming tale outstays its welcome. However the endeavour is saved by an impeccably mannered performance from Stanley Tucci who adds depth and intrigue by way of his confounded terminal manager.",The Terminal

Stanley Tucci plays a complete b@st@rd so beautifully, the film would have been a failure without him. The love story was the weakest part of the script, unfortunately Catherine-Zeta Jones' love interest character didn't sparkle as some of the other characters did, indeed it was the only weak link in this story, but it's important to state that it was weak only in contrast to the other characters.

As it is banal. And we see, they have met, have talked, have fallen in love and have run up. In an original way. Hanks is excellent, at what not as usually. It is always excellent, but in this film it was pleasant to me most of all. Even more than in Green Miles and Forest Gampe. Michael Duglasa's wife also played charmingly. Such beautiful woman already in itself an ornament of any film but if it still has actor's talent this already brilliant show. Other actors also have not spoil impression about a film.

Accompanied, of course, by the requisite ""uplifting"" orchestral surges.Plus it assumes (or rather affirms) that we are all ignorant of anything in the rest of the world. I watched this with an eastern European immigrant friend and was embarrassed for my country. How can we spend tens of millions making such tripe?

This is a movie that one can easily pick apart for any number of reasons, all argued persuasively on this site...everything from the annoying product placements or integrations, hokey story lines, underdeveloped characters, changes in tone and character motivations ...Looking back on the movie, it is far from perfect, and yet....As I watched it, The Terminal earned a certain good will, and I did willfully suspend my disbelief for it.  I give Tom Hanks much of the credit for this  (Who else could've pulled this off?  Robin Williams, Jim Carrey, I don't know) because if you don't like his character and if you can't see the movie through his eyes, this movie will go nowhere (no pun intended on his Victor's plight).  The other acting was fine: I happen to think CZ-Jones is very talented and not only beautiful, and she did fine with what she had to work with.  The almost romance btwn her and Hanks is just okay.  The support from Tucci and the rest is on the whole. very strong.A couple more observations:  To me, the comedy worked so much better in this movie than the gravity.  I thought that the scene where Victor is called in to calm down a passenger is heavy-handed, the 'quickie-marriage was a bad end to a decent story line, and Gupta's surrender was also too shrill a momentBut having said all that, if I rated it element by element, it may get a 6/10 at best ...but as I watched it, it was an ""8"", for Hanks, for his support and for a few great laughs!

Unfortunately Tom Hanks as a Slavic character wasn't very convincing. His accent wasn't bad, but he didn't quite nail the cynical and slightly paranoid Slavic mentality. The pseudo-love story with Catherine Zeta-Jones was contrived and hardly believable.
The airport terminal surroundings looked terrific, but no way would someone in the pre-security lounge be allowed into the secure baggage handling area, even in 2004. Tucci was great as the petty and mean border security official Dixon, but it's a mystery why they assigned an Anglo-Saxon name to an ethnic Italian actor.

339,Ron_Solina,A very much needed schmaltzy excursion.,7,28 April 2018,"When somebody says they're a visiting tourist upon arrival in an airport, is there ever really need for them to explain their itinerary to a complete stranger?As long as they don't have any bombs strapped on them or they're not gonna unleash a deadly virus or don't plan to do mass killings, smuggle drugs, commit unspeakable horrors etc. in the destination country, why bother stating their reasons for visiting? Unless they are a market research company trying to survey the traveler, people will gladly accommodate that. There are people who don't want to hold up the queue, and there are some things that cannot be explained in a short paragraph (including my simple APPROVAL for this film), and not to mention the variations in people's communication skills. As long those visitors are willing to return home, it's none of people's biscuits whatever they do there that's conforms to whatever in the tourist destination is acceptable and LEGAL. Or people could just easily lie and say they're going to whatever is that country's equivalent of a Disney World.Mr. Speilberg and Mr. Hanks in the early-noughties have reached the point in their careers where they have already acquired artistic gravitas. For Mr. Hanks, having escaped being typecast as a actor doing just light and screwball comedic roles, and Mr. Spielberg for breaking away from just being labeled as a giga-blockbuster sell-out film director (not that there is anything wrong with that). Given it is the time in history where the US has just been involved in a full-blown war in the Middle East, not to mention, post-9/11 era, for them to collab in a cutesy but sappy drama/comedy involving a creepy old-ish-man-child-ish (perhaps just naive) having the exuberance of 12-year-old discovering unfamilar things for him for the first time, the audience would still be beholden to their effort, a much-needed optimistic escapist fare. But as far as Mr. Hanks is concerned, I hope this is the last of such comedic roles for him (Unless he would find it an acting challenge to up the ante in the cringe-inducing comedic schtick department, I would definitely not go check that one if ever that should happen). His take on the bumbling erudite prof wannabe crook in Coen Bros' laugh-out-loud The Ladykillers remake is him having a more matured comedic persona, and the one I kind of enjoy and prefer.And for Mr. Spielberg, it's obvious that this film could have been passed over to a less-experienced director but chose to do it himself perhaps as contribution to his country during the trying times, a gift to his fans all over the world, a straightforward film with absurdist undertones. Even at the risk of sounding like a suck-up, I'd still say that even though the film is based on the experiences of a real-life character who got paid for the rights to use their story, the decision of opting not to use the guy's real name and chosing instead to use a fictitious version of the person facing the same sticky situation showed remarkable prudence on the part of filmmakers.The airport set used is in the film is just spectacular. Never been into one (yet), but that film kind of raised the bar to what people's expectations of what an airport should look like, I guess.

Some fun concepts to play with though while watching the movie, which I highly recommend: Delay - Viktor is""delayed"" at the international terminal in New York, by Frank Dixon, who is in charge of guarding security for the US Immigration department. Who is really delayed? Dixon, representing the US? He follows fear based laws and meanness/revenge rather than simple heart based human kindness and common sense. Viktor behaves as a well adjusted adult making the best of whatever situation he finds himself in. Dixon wants to ""control"" everything as a frightened child would. His development is delayed/ arrested. Another undercurrent is love/acceptance vs. fear and control: Dixon must control; must have the spy cameras; he needs his army of docile ""bull-dogs"" Viktor ""creates"" an army of loving friends/family just by being a kind soul willing to sacrifice himself for the good of another. Playing fair/honest/real vs. playing dirty and corrupt: Viktor was genuine and even offered kindness to Dixon.

344,Win14Gipp,Check your logic at the gate,7,23 June 2004,"(As always, a warning: Yon be spoilers.) This film is a witty and likable send-up of American life in general and air travel in particular. In fact, it's the best send-up of travel since ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles,"" as well as a film Kafka would allow his kids to see.Tom Hanks seems to do his best work when he plays someone we should like, and he delivers once again as a foreign traveler caught in some bureaucratic cross-fire and forced to spend nine months in a terminal at JFK. (One wonders how different the movie would be if he had landed at a less-cushy airport -- say, Miami.) Most of his scenes are winners, primarily because Hanks also brings the best out of his fellow actors, particularly Stanley Tucci, the airport official who, for reasons that are not entirely clear, decides that letting Hanks enter the U.S. would be a personal defeat.Unfortunately, this film also has its flaws. First, Spielberg hasn't asked us to suspend this much disbelief since ""A.I."" (It takes less time for Hanks to gain a fluency in English than it does for Tucci to find an interpreter?) Second, even though Hanks and the equally talented Catherine Zeta-Jones sparkle in their scenes together, the resolution of their budding affair leaves you unfulfilled. (Would it kill ya to let someone other than Indiana Jones get the girl for once, Steve?) Third, when you learn the true nature of Hanks' mission, you're left shaking your head. (Trust me on this one.)But again, Hanks' performance justifies these flaws, even if it doesn't overshadow them.

Spielberg created a movie which makes you realize this simple life lesson without holding your hand too much or even trying to make the audience cry in a forced way.

Time progression was handled poorly, I think they said he was there 9 months but you would have never been able to guess that from the movie, I would have guessed 3 months tops.

I can only assume it has a ranking of 7 here at IMDb out of respect to Hanks and Spielberg. If it had been a different director and actor I think it would have the 4-5 rating it deserves. I give it a 4.",The Terminal

Tom Hanks must have said yes to this film without reading the screenplay. It is so bad, so unbelievable, so ridiculous. I watched it to the bitter end hoping that there might be something redeemable in the almost two hours...but no, nothing redeemable appeared. Boy oh boy, what a disappointment.That someone could be stranded in an airport and stay nine months, building a wall, sleeping in one of the waiting rooms night after night without being thrown out, that an airport manager could do the things that Tucci does in this film...well, I can't believe that anyone could buy the story of The Terminal.

355,PHeath60,They've done it again!,10,23 June 2004,"The Magic of Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks comes to life in ""The Terminal"" a seamlessly filmed story of Viktor Navorski, a man with ""no country, and No real identity (or so it seems)"". The story unfolds in a very lifelike replica of JFK or any one of today's airports across the country. Victor finds himself stranded in The Terminal after his country's government has been taken over by a violent coup. As time evolves, and Victor is not allowed to leave the terminal, he finds his way thru the day to day life of living in an airport terminal , and trying to make ends meet. He has no money, no way to contact anybody from his home country (try using a 10.00 prepaid phone card to call Krakozhia!)... Soon, to the chagrin of the security department at the airport, Victor is working, living and interacting with the the people who earn their living on the day today workings of the Terminal. This all sounds very commonplace as I describe this, but what is truly amazing is the story that is told just beneath the surface of this wonderful movie. This is partly a story of loyalty. Loyalty to good things, and to bad things, and what the consequences of them are. In the end, what is good, and true will come through no matter what the obstacles are. Truth prevails, patience wins, and a dream has a birth place...In, The Terminal.This is a wonderful movie full of laughter, humor, humility and some unabashedly shameful moments as we see people, mostly Americans at their best and worst. There are moments of tears, joy, and laughter. My husband and I saw this together, and the men of the audience truly enjoyed the movie as my husband did. This isn't just a ""chick flick"" it's a movie for anyone who has ever had a dream, or made a promise and vowed to see that thru no matter what. Enjoy Tom Hanks in another heart warming performance that will have you completely believing that Victor Navorski truly exists! Tom never lets us down! Saying that, I believe that Catherine-Zeta Jones was wasted in this movie..her role seemed superficial at best, and misplaced and out of sync with the entire pace of the movie at worst. She just doesn't seem to fit. I felt her performance lacked emotional impact in many ways..she just didn't seem to portray the character of someone struggling with the inner demons that are supposedly waging war within her heart and mind. I just didn't buy it....It could have been the writing for her script..something was just off with her character and performance. Fortunately, Tom Hanks can hold any scene and better yet, will anchor any scene all on his own, and will save the day as always, and in that fact, the impact of her performance doesn't cause as much of a problem as it would have if Tom had not been Viktor Navorski. Well, enough has been said, and I will leave you by saying that this movie is definitely worth the money that you spend to see it, and will be a great addition to your DVD collection when it comes out!! Enjoy the movie, and enjoy Tom and Steve on one of their lighter projects!!PJ Clearwater FL",The Terminal
356,datemaru,Holds ups mostly thanks to Tom Hanks,7,6 December 2014,"The Terminal is a guilty pleasure of mine. It's not a movie I watch often, but it makes me smile when I see it.The movie is loosely based on a true story about a Iranian guy who lived in a French airport for 3 years. Basically Tom Hanks plays Viktor, a middle age man who came from a small (and fictional) Eastern European country that falls into a state of civil war. Because of a coup by the military the old government has fallen and the United States refuses to recognize the new government. All this happens while Viktor is on a flight to JFK International Airport in New York City. Because of the situation is visa is no longer recognized as valid and the US is not accepting his passport and because of the war he has no way of going home. Viktor is effectively trapped in the international passenger terminal at JFK.And this is really the best parts of the movie. Viktor doesn't speak English and doesn't understand what he's being told and there is this great scene while he watches in horror news coverage of the war and not understand a word of it; just that war broke out in his country. Viktor literally makes gate 26 (which is out of service because of construction) his home. I enjoyed the movie the most watching him figuring things out like how to get money to eat, how he makes friends with the airport employees, or how he learns English. He's such an earnest and clever man that you can't help like him and that's what makes this movie work.The cons of this movie is the romantic subplot that is deeply unsatisfying and while does at least have some impact on the plot, leaves me thinking this didn't need to be here. The other thing is the movie is a shameless whore. It's almost funny how much product placement there is. Boss, Discovery Store, Starbucks, Borders, Burger King, etc. are visible at nearly every shot.Also the antagonist of this movie doesn't make sense. Basically it's this Homeland Security guy who just doesn't like Viktor. I think this might be some commentary on our system, but his superiors tell him he could learn a thing or two from Viktor and it just seems that problem is just with this one guy. He seems to make it personal. They don't take it to over-the-top levels.Still, Tom Hanks is really good and it holds up for me. If it comes up for rental or on TV it's not a bad sit.",The Terminal

After this movie, I upgrade him to be one of the greatest actor in my book.I think this movie is a continuation of the ""cast away"".

And the film delivers. Though many people feel that Spielberg and Hanks' heyday have been over for years, this film proves that they have still got it. I think the most impressive thing about it is that you lose sight of the fact that Hanks (cast totally against type as an Eastern European would-be immigrant) is playing the main character. He does such a good job of immersing himself into Viktor Navorsky that the actor is incidental to the character. Major props to Hanks for the performance, with a near-perfect accent and mannerism.

The true story this movie is loosely based on is not a really romantic one. Merhan Nasseri does live in an airport terminal, but thats about where the resemblance ends. The real Nasseri has been in Charles DE galle airport in France since 1988 and suffers from a fragile mental state and has since been granted leave, but has chosen not to. The actual story could make a decent film, There is a french version staring jean Roquefort. But this one decides to go the clichéd and predictable route instead. In watching this movie I got the impression that the ALL the characters were trapped and living in the airport, since Hanks interacts with them conveniently both day and night. And the unending string of factual errors was so much I decided that the story was taking place in some fictional world existing only in the film makers mind. the scene were the Indian janitor delivers his little catchphrase when apprehended by a swat team for delaying an airplane was just too stupid. this movie could have been something with the material at hand, but falls flatter than a meal voucher.",The Terminal

The Indian actor Kumar Pallana playing the janitor, who once appeared on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"", is the funniest thing in the movie. His juggling tricks during the formal dinner are hilarious.This film has a weak first half. It is all Tom Hanks with themes similar to his 2000 release ""Castaway"". With this film he is a stranded in an airline terminal instead of an island, bonds with a can of Planters Peanuts instead of a soccer ball, and deliveries an autograph instead of a Fed Ex package. There are several bits in the movie which are way too contrived: the carpentry miracles Hanks performs and the photocopies of his handprints among others. Hanks is good as the foreigner without a country and Spielberg is such an accomplished filmmaker that they come through with another entertaining film. This is not a great film, but it makes for a reasonably enjoyable two hours.",The Terminal

366,the_darkness_of_poetic_humor,Post 9/11 too much for me,5,24 June 2005,I felt convoluted somehow watching this picture. I also believe Spielberg is draining away his abilities to do movies and of course he is going to come back like a quick flash of lightning with War Of The Worlds (maybe). What I figured from the start after they were talking about Hanks character being a terrorist that I figured this movie would be post 9/11 and even though it wasn't towards the end I still thought it had a lot of elements containing 9/11 that wasn't very necessary. I don't know when they will ever do a movie about the events of 9/11 but I can assure you by watching movies like this and Strip Search with Glenn Close...hmmmm I just know a movie about 9/11 is coming but my thought is why? Why not make the film here in a couple of years and get it out of directors minds. I figured they have more stories out there now that as Hollywood stands right now in sequelpalooza as some people are saying. Why remake and not create originality when there is a lot left. Why isn't Spike Lee doing more movies that reflect and mean something(which I do have to say 25th Hour was pure Lee genius). Why is Oliver Stone doing crappy movies like Alexander when he can be doing Stone movies like JFK and Platoon....I would personally love to see Stone do a movie about Marilyn Monroe's death or O.J. Simpson..you know Stone breaks down walls or is it just the fact like right now in the case of Spielberg that our directors that have been entertaining us for years is just simply getting old and expired? Clint Eastwood is still rocking it and he has a movie right now in pre-production that I'm dying to see so I'm just discombobulated and I will be til' I start seeing movies get on the right track!,The Terminal

There are no weird ""Shyamalan"" twists or turns, no gigantic earth-shaking reveals at the end of the film. Just a fun, gentle story, well-told, with a soft, audience-pleasing ending. After all, Viktor Navorsky's held our rooting interest through the entire film. Why shouldn't he (and we) get what we want? And talk about supporting players...Stanley Tucci's Dixon is a wonderful airport administrator I loved to hate, and several of the day-workers, even some of the cops, who become his friends, make this a funny and sentimental fairy tale worthy of Spielberg's talents. The only downside is Catherine Zeta-Jones' character. As a romantic interest, she is so dysfunctional a person that I could not root for their romance to succeed. She is poison to Viktor, but he doesn't discover this until the end.Still, this is a great film of discovery. Viktor discovers America from inside an airport terminal, we get a glimpse of a great character as he learns to understand our culture and communicate his needs. And we get to discover just what's so important about that Planters Peanuts can Viktor carries around.",The Terminal

For this reason, he has to stay at the airport, as he cannot get into the country. A great variety of situations happen to him while he lives in the airport: from really hilarious to really sad situations.The movie is great, not only for the plot but for the acting. Hanks shows once again how talented he is, interpreting the lost Viktor in the huge airport. Personally, I think there's nothing to say against this movie: just perfect.

Spielberg directed this film? I find it hard to believe. I'm thinking it must be another person with the same name who conned the studio into letting him direct Tom Hanks.The high rating on IMDb is no doubt due to two facts: 1) Any film with Hanks/Spielberg, regardless of the movie itself, will start at a 6 out of 10 and work it's way up from there. I personally admire both of these men and part of me feels the same way, but I couldn't step over the countless holes in this movie.2) People who love this film are so desperate for an escape from their otherwise dreary lives that they will buy into every irrational plot development that unfolds.

378,bilweeler,Welcome to the United States of America,8,18 January 2006,"""The Terminal"" refers to the JFK International Arrivals terminal in NYC. Tom Hanks (Victor Navorski) arrives at the beginning of the film from the fictional east European country of Krakosia. Unfortunately for him, while he was in the air, Krakosia underwent a coup and his passport is no longer valid for entry into the US. He is a ""man without a country.""Victor speaks little English, and is denied entry into the US. He is told to ""wait"" in the International Arrivals terminal until it can be straightened out. Again, unfortunately for Victor, this will take many months, and he must learn to live in, and survive in, an airport terminal.Needless to say, all those among us who have suffered through flight delays and cancellations can relate to Victor's problems. At least when I get stuck in an airport, though, I can speak the language. I could give you a little more plot, but frankly, you already have most of it. You don't need much more information to get the messages here. Those would be:1. Sometimes you have to wait for what you want. Victor is a very patient guy. Catherine Zeta-Jones (Amelia Warren, perpetually single flight attendant), not so much. He's a better person for his patience. She has waited forever for her married lover, but will never get what she wants. And she is decidedly unsettled and unhappy as a result.2. Sometimes you have to forget the rules, stop being a bureaucrat, and think about the people and the lives you touch. Victor knows this. And we can learn something from him.Tom Hanks is the new Jimmie Stewart. He is literally ""everyman."" As an actor, he conveys more emotion in a foreign language than most actors with a full vocabulary and a convincing script. Of course, he has done this before. In CastAway he doesn't even speak for most of the film. But he conveys every conceivable emotion, every conceivable thought, all non-verbally. He is one of the most gifted actors you will see. Steven Spielberg is not particularly well known for making films like ""The Terminal."" There's no eye popping special effects. There's no ghosts, no sharks, no evil forces. It's basically Tom Hanks and the ""interminal"" waiting we all do. Not typical, but very well done.",The Terminal

381,Fidelios_Film_Central,New White Water Spielberg Film is Terminally Bad,3,14 June 2004,"I'll begin by saying what I yelled out at the end of the film, while some of the audience was applauding, 'I can't believe Spielberg made this load of crap.' Yes, you heard me right. Now, I'm a huge Spielberg fan. Minority Report was by far one of the best films of 2002, and I loved what he did with Kubrick's A.I., despite the cheesy Mission to Mars rip off of the aliens at the end. But I thought there wasn't much to Catch Me If You Can. It was a fine film, well-made, but just not much too it, anyone could have made it. So I kind of went into The Terminal thinking it was going to be like that. I bought into the previews thinking, hey, this cheesy high-concept could work, if done right-a man without a country discovers America in JFK airport; it will be a satisfying film. And I'll even admit I've been humming 'Leaving on a Jet Plane' for the last couple weeks.Boy was I wrong. The Terminal is an absolutely bogus Hollywood feature, aimed at pleasing the mass audience with dumb jokes, with a horrible script.Even while writing this, I still can't believe Steven Spielberg directed this load of crap; what was he thinking? Is Spielberg turning into Ron Howard (Ransom, How the Grinch Stole Christmas), or even Robert Zemeckis (Cast Away), doing big budget films just to make money?*****Spoilers From Here on*****Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski who's stuck at JFK airport because there was a coup in his country. In the beginning, he's taken to Frank Dixon's (Stanley Tucci) office and is told he must not step foot outside the airport doors. The problem is, Viktor doesn't speak any English, and they don't speak his language. This is the first part that leads down a long slope of unbelievability. I just can't believe they wouldn't have an interpreter at JFK airport. They wouldn't just let a man who doesn't speak English walk around the airport if they weren't sure he didn't understand what was going on. And if Spielberg is trying to criticize immigration into this country, he shouldn't be doing it in a comedic way, making a joke at the fact that Viktor doesn't know what is going on.He tries to get into the bureaucracy of the immigration laws by showing how Dixon wants Viktor to take advantage of a loophole that would allow him to leave the airport, but Dixon's character is played so bogus, that it's just not believable.And it really makes no sense why Viktor just doesn't leave. Is it because he just wants to follow the rules? Well later we learn he's learning how to break the rules, how to find the loophole, with the 'goat' incident. The 'goat' scene really makes no sense, because Dixon could just check and see if the medicine is for people or for animals. The whole motivation behind the scene is that he didn't want Viktor to show him up. And he just lets Viktor show him up.Again, this is just poor writing. The writers felt they needed a bad guy in the movie, when they don't, and made Dixon out to be the stereotypical bad guy, instead of making him seem like a real person. No wonder this is so poorly written, because one of the screenwriters, Jeff Nathanson, wrote both Rush Hour 2 and Speed 2.Dixon's anger at Viktor makes no sense. Dixon suddenly decides, that because he's angry at Viktor, he's now going to try and keep him at the airport forever. It's a stupid Hollywood device, the protagonist must have an antagonist, or you have no movie. No matter now stupid it plays out.I'd like to invent a new phrase and call this film: White Water Spielberg. The Terminal is a scam, it's bogus, it's whitebread mass audience appeal, with watered down stereotypical clichéd plot and story.A lot of the jokes are just plain dumb. Like the coins shooting out at him when he returns a bunch of pushcarts. They didn't shoot out before, just cause a bunch come out at a time doesn't mean they would fly out like that. It's this type of little detail that shows how much Spielberg has turned into the typical director hack sell-out. Stanley Kubrick, who Spielberg took over and directed A.I. after Kubrick's death, would never overlook such details.The audience was eating up the dumb jokes though, so I guess when you want to make a movie that will have mass audience approval, you have to dumb down the script and write down to the audience. This is done all the time, just not in a movie directed by Spielberg, I expect more from him.More little details ruin this film as well, like Viktor goes to Borders to buy travel guides on New York City to learn English when he has no money for food. Those travel guides, especially in an airport bookstore, are expensive, probably at least $10 a piece. And when they showed he could just barely afford a $0.75 burger at Burger King (which is also a false price by the way), how could he afford to buy the books. And later it's revealed the Head of Homeland Security Department at JFK makes less than $19 an hour. That's just under $40,000. I highly doubt that is possible. The subplot with Diego Luna, from Y tu mamá también, is too sentimental, and stupid. It's just not believable that there would be a wedding in an airport, give me a break.Finally the ending is tied up too nicely. Why would Dixon leave the others alone, once he finds everything out about them. Are you telling me the head of homeland security at JFK airport is going to let a known criminal, a criminal who assaulted a police officer, still work there, and not have him immediately arrested? Great, I feel safe traveling now.The sentimentality over-kill comes in once more when we learn what Viktor has in his peanut can, and why he came to America. We never find out anything else about him, if he has a family back home, what his job is. But his reason for coming to the US is just plain dumb.I am just dumbfounded that Spielberg made this film. I guess this is his Planet of the Apes, oh wait, no, that's going to be The War of the Worlds.",The Terminal

383,rmvieira,Spielberg + Hanks = WIN,9,30 May 2011,"Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) is a citizen of an Eastern European country who travels to New York when his country is suddenly struck by a coup d'etat, which invalidates his passport. When he gets to the terminal, Viktor is unable to get clearance to enter the US. Once the borders of his home country get closed after the overthrow he can't go back home either.Viktor has to improvise and starts spending his days and nights inside the terminal waiting for a political resolution. As time goes by, the protagonist is forced to find his way to survive, struggling to communicate and to make friends, while trying to work out a resolution for his unusual situation.A drama with a light touch of humor in which once again the Spielberg + Hanks combination is an utter success. The script is good and flows through smoothly, whereas Hanks gives us another amazing display of his talent. Navorski's unusual situation is based on a true story of an Iranian refugee stuck in Charles de Gaulle airport.",The Terminal
384,alw-2,Terminal case of the Blahs,2,19 June 2004,"One of the few (if any) movies Tom Hanks has been in that fails to meet expectations.  But that may not be Hanks' fault.  Terminal has no material to work with and offers absolutely no opportunity for Hanks to display his talent.  The movie does not follow the true life of the real person upon whom the movie is based.  The character is stranded for an entirely different reason in an entirely different airport with an entirely different ending.  It's offensive in that it uses the 'story' to denigrate American authority, showing it to be inhuman and unfeeling.  It suffers from poor writing, absence of any real story line, illogical relationships and unbelievable events.  Unlike the airplanes shown in the project just never gets off the ground.

385,kenalbertson,Serious Tom Hanks Overload,4,7 May 2006,"Maybe it's the nature of the films he selects. In any case, Tom Hanks is in virtually every scene in this movie, and in many of them he is alone. This was also true of Cast Away. In both movies Hanks strives to overcome a series of problems, some realistic, some contrived. A modern day rework of Charlie Chaplin's ""little tramp"" style of story telling. The movie is not bad, but when the story becomes subordinate to the movie star, it becomes a distraction and the whole production suffers. This movie is another valentine that Tom Hanks has sent to himself. If you go to movies to see the stars rather than the stories, then this may be for you.",The Terminal
386,mungo39,A film about waiting.,5,1 June 2005,"Funnily enough I saw this one on a plane, which is never the best place to see a movie, but I was in an 'airport' frame of mind, so the film managed to strike a chord with me. Flying is the ultimate process in which you spend time where you don't want to be in order to get where you want to be, and the related frame of mind is similarly restless. The focus of this film is on people who are stuck in the midst of this shiftless world, but stuck for differing reasons.Our main character, Navorski (played by Tom Hanks) has slipped into a 'crack' in the international immigration system, unable to get into the US, and unable to go home. He therefore has to live in the airport, waiting to escape into New York. He meets a variety of people whilst he waits. He befriends a man waiting for an opportunity to talk to a beautiful immigration controller, who in turn is waiting for love. He meets a cleaner waiting for the courage to face justice in India. He meets a beautiful air stewardess who is waiting for a good man. Navorski is waiting to fulfil his father's aim, for which he waited his whole life. His fate is controlled by a man waiting for promotion, and so it goes on.Navorski is a selfless and good person. He helps others whenever he is able, and the end result is that he is helped to his goal by those who he assisted along the way. Finally, he achieves his goal, completes the father's collection of jazz legends and goes home.The moral? Good things come to those who wait, I guess. I landed and went home, and I was much happier there.",The Terminal
387,don-lockwood,One of the worst endings in film,5,25 October 2005,"I'm sorry to fans of this movie, but I, like many critics, was sorely disappointed with the final product. Given the renowned talents of Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, this should have been a big hit and a smart film. Unfortunately for the audience, it is neither.The premise is striking, if seemingly implausible: A foreigner who lost his passport literally becomes trapped in an American airport. The set design is fantastic, as each room is instilled with its own unique feel, so that the audience, like Tom Hanks's central character, can begin to identify with the airport as his new (if hopefully temporary) ""home."" In addition, the character development is strong, and Hanks, who has previously proved he can pull off just about anything on screen, is delightfully colorful and out of character. There are a few good supporting turns, and, at worst, the movie always maintains a hint of the discovery potential in the airport, a simultaneously inviting and intimidating barrier to a new world.However, the film suffers from a plodding pace and a lack of unity that can bring together the several pleasant but meaningless subplots. The script tries not to be cursory in its character development, but its touches are never quite successful in engaging the audience's interest as well as their sympathy. Particularly, Catherine Zeta-Jones is, as always, an energetic star, but here she is relegated to essentially a supporting role and should have entered the storyline sooner and stayed with it longer. Even her general enthusiasm can't make up for the slower scenes, and Zeta-Jones, though on par with an old-school glamor/movie icon in everything that she does, frankly seems a little miscast here as the wronged wife to be pitied. Her chemistry with Hanks isn't strong enough, either.But the most appalling aspect of this otherwise skillfully made movie was its throwaway finale, perhaps the WORST film ending I have seen (at least since ""The Stepford Wives""). It's not a totally implausible ending, as in that aforementioned movie, but it's just as distasteful and disappointing. Hanks, after being green-lit to finally go home to his war-ridden country, decides to venture out into New York City to get the autograph of his dead father's favorite jazz legend (forgive me, I'm hazy on the details, but it's not like this ploy makes the dramatic tension of the rest of the movie seem worthwhile anyway, nor does it do much for character development). Catherine Zeta-Jones, who, when we last saw her, apparently feigned complacency with her boyfriend so as not to prevent Hanks from flying home as soon as possible, doesn't even return in the final scene! WHAT A COPOUT!!! Give the audience what they want! Granted, a perfect Hollywood ending might've seemed a little too predictable, even for Spielberg, but this film was billed as a light romantic comedy (released in the summer, for Pete's sake!), and it is neither very funny nor ever moving enough to qualify as pure drama. There is nothing worse in a borderline movie than a bad ending that lasts longest in the audience's collective memory. This production is at times enjoyable and never offensive, but its wrap-up is a complete washout that the filmmakers never should have approved.",The Terminal
388,rafaelrivera,Highly warm and entertaining. Great option at the movies!,10,27 September 2004,"The Terminal ***1/2 (out of four). I saw this film because i didn't found something more attractive at the theater's box office. I had seen the trailer before, and wasn't really much taken to see the film. But how big was my surprise! I definitively loved the movie! its really entertaining, it's been a while since I didn't had this much fun at the movies!!! Every thing starts when Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) a citizen from an eastern European country, arrives to the New York City Terminal and finds out that it has erupted a civil war in his homeland while he was in the air traveling to America, situation that left him off limits of the USA and not able to go back to his country, so this is how he becomes resident of the NYC Terminal. And although he doesn't speak a bit of English, he manages to keep it together and decides to wait for his permission to enter the States, and wait.... and wait! During this long wait of him, he meets the flight assistant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta Jones) and quite interesting people from the airport staff which includes airport official Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), Joey Mulroy (Chi McBride), Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna), Officer Ray Thurman (Barry Shabaka H.), Janitor Gupta (Kumar Pallana) and Officer Dolores Torres (Zoe Saldana). Every scene of the film we get to see great challenge situations for the pure hearted Viktor along with the rest of the characters (which felt that fitted perfectly in the story) and we really get to live that along with them.This warm and entertaining film's highly recommended and enjoyable for everyone. It may have some weak parts, but the whole final result will delight you! If you haven't seen it, this is your option at the multiplex in your next visit!!!",The Terminal

While she plays a character that is important to the plot, we don't see a lot of her and in the end the viewer is asking questions about her character.All in all it's not a bad little movie.

392,JaneSchmo,"short but accurate review of ""The Terminal""",7,11 June 2004,"I saw this movie yesterday for free so I'm not complaining but yes it IS a sappy love story between Catherine Zeta-Jones and Tom Hanks.And an unbearably whimsical,unplausible and contrived dramedy that really tested my patience.What is it with Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg in recent years?It seems as if they are taking a vacation from doing their usual serious and worthwhile films and turning to lightweight mainstream commercial projects.I mean,first year's ""Catch Me If You Can"" of two years ago and now this.Apparently,there really was and still is a man stuck in Charles de Gaulle airport.Read the article written last year in the NY Times if you want to find out about it because this is the sentimentalized,bare bones of the original story,love interest thrown in Hollywood version.Victor Navorski is a tourist from Krakozhia coming to NYC for a reason not revealed until the end.(Throwback to the time films,especially the Marx brothers ones used to invent countries so not to offend anyone)The government in his country is overthrown while he is inflight and as the U.S doesn't recognize the new one,he has a passport from nowhere and can neither step on American soil or go back(is this possible?)He is ordered to stay inside the JFK terminal and one of the frustrating things about this movie is that he could actually leave anytime he wanted to.I mean,even the obligatory bureaucrat running security for the airport(Stanley Tucci)just wants Victor to run away,solving everyone's problem.In short,the premise doesn't hold water.And yes,he meets a beautiful but troubled flight attendant.And yes,the airport staff is assembled of colorful ethnic funny characters(paranoid Indian janitor,love-struck Mexican,black family ma,tough young black female security officer,sympathetic cops,etc.)And yes,the mean man ruining everyone's fun is ultimately defied and left screeching at the cameras as Victor marches out,followed by a cheering crowd.There is one good reason to see this movie,though,and one reason why I'm ultimately giving it a thumbs up:Tom Hanks.I'm a giant fan,always have been and this is one of his best performances.Some people may complain that he is once again playing his usual Everyman character or question the authenticity of his portrayal. As a person with Slavic immigrant parents,I can attest that there are men exactly like this in the world.Hanks hits all the right notes as an alien in a strange country who doesn't know English and has to communicate with body language.He captures all the mannerisms and quirks of a Victor Navorski.What a great actor.",The Terminal

In Victor's case, it is not hours but days and maybe even months. So, he figures out the ""little things"" in the airport!

397,GGSteven_93,PLENTY OF FUN WITH HANKS IN THE AIRPORT!,7,6 January 2021,"The Terminal reunites Tom Hanks with Steven Spielberg after their highly successful Catch Me if You Can and delivers a completely different experience, but with similar success. While Catch Me if You Can, had a more serious tone and subject matter, The Terminal offers a much more light-hearted and feel good experience.Tom Hanks does a terrific job as Viktor, a stranded Krakhozian on the JFK airport, who due to his countries civil war is stuck on the airport for 9 months. Tom Hanks has plenty of chemistry with his cast, all the other actors pulling plenty of weight, especially Stanley Tucci, who plays the main antagonist. The rest of the cast shines too, with Diego Luna, Zoe Saldana and Catharina Zita-Jones also doing a terrific job. Though despite having plenty of chemistry with Hanks, their plotlines feel neglected. This is true especially of Luna's and Saldana's romantic sub-plot, which is way too underwritten and gets wrapped up way too easily and conveniently.Another element where the film suffers slightly is the pacing and the over-indulgent running time. Especially the first half of the film can be quite a though journey for some, as a quick montage of Viktor's adventures would've better served the film and maybe would've left some more space for some subplots to develop.Overall, the film was an enjoyable experience plenty of fun offered through the chemistry between the actors, though the film's pacing might be a bit of a turn off for some.

398,Scottfeinberg,Fine Film That Could Have Been Taken Up a Notch By...,8,20 June 2004,"POTENTIAL SPOILERSHi. I enjoyed this movie quite a lot, but I felt that some of the story's loose ends could have been tied (that fountain that Hanks built had to explode when they were kissing!) and some parts of the ending either improved (why exactly did Tucci have tons of pills in his desk or not get fired earlier for his treatment of Hanks by the copy machine) or clarified. Below is my suggested alternative. I'd love to know what you think---scottfeinberg@hotmail.com.Alternative Ending for The Terminal (2004):Tom Hanks leaves the airport, as he does in the film, with the help of the black customs agent who defies his superior, Stanley Tucci. He gets to the Ramada Inn where he is seeking the signature from the last person remaining from his father's old band. He gets there, only to be informed that the man has just left for a flight to tour in Europe. So Hanks, exasperatedly, must turn around and head back to the airport and certain deportation, in the hope of catching the band member before he is caught himself. As he re-enters the airport and tries to evade detection, he rushes around and searches, albeit unsuccessfully. He hops onto an elevator, and as it reaches the second floor and the door opens, he is greeted by Tucci and a sea of security who grab him, telling him sternly, `Mr. Navorsky, we're gonna need you to come with us.' He seems dejected as Tucci walks him through the airport, escorted against the traffic of travelers who have been cleared and are leaving the airport. Tucci then tells Hanks, `Victor, someone's been waiting to see you,' and he points out Zeta-Jones holding a sign with the limo drivers that says, `Victor' and then she shuffles to a second sign and says, `I'm sorry,' and then heads to a third sign that says, `Forgive me,' and then a fourth sign that has an arrow pointing to the right. A man steps out of the crowd, looks at Navorsky for a second, then smiles slightly and says, `Mr. Navorsky, my name is [band member]. Nice to meet you.' Roll credits.",The Terminal

One question? How did someone as completely STUPID as this guy ever manage to get on a plane in the first place?As other commentators have noted,it's not that he can't speak English;it's that he acts as if someone else has to tie his shoe-laces for him.Here he is trapped in a nightmare where the 'authorites'have grabbed up his passport,and he seems incapable of understanding that he is some very serious trouble.So what is the FIRST thing he does? Lose all his FOOD vouchers while BREAKING a total stranger's luggage(really you had to be there).

400,rht1369,As bad as a Disney Channel movie,1,2 July 2013,"This movie is really really weak in terms of its poor story and its childish jokes! When the movie starts there are a few good moments that give you the feeling that it may have a strong story.In this movie, there is this man who has problem communicating with people in the airport because he does not know the language. Unfortunate for him, he gets into a big trouble since his visa is not valid anymore due to some revolution in his country. Now this is the scene that I liked about the movie. When you go to a foreign country you need people to be friendly and helpful. However, because these problems are usually a part of the daily routine of the people who work at the airport, they do not care about you. And if there is nobody there willing to help you, you will eventually feel like a ghost because people do not see your problem.The movie had the potential to be a great comedy drama, but it suddenly turned into a Hannah Montana love story! The character of the chief officer in the airport reminds me of the bad guy in the Inspector Gadget cartoon series. His dialogs cannot get any worse. And what was the marriage at the airport? You cannot simply push a wedding into your screenplay just to make a movie happy!Altogether, if you change the cast of the movie to some teenagers it will be a perfect fit for Disney Channel.

Before long, I was rooting for him on both fronts with all my heart.I found the humor subtle and fun, and the growth and evolution of the main character compelling.

402,dyneshv,Driven by Hope,8,10 July 2005,"The day I saw this Film, I had already seen Collateral. There could not be a greater contrast between two films, and I could especially appreciate that contrast, since I had only 30 minutes between the two shows. Both Films are enjoyable, for different reasons. Collateral is a masterpiece in Film-making, something akin to modern Film-Noir. It is a thrill-a-minute film, with hope suspended for its duration and fear always present. The Terminal is a film which while duly showcasing various fears about Security and Terrorism, seems to swell with Hope from the word go; Hope that the Human race may one day understand that kindness and understanding can overcome anything.The Film deals with Victor Navorksi (beautifully played by Tom Hanks), a traveller from a (fictional) country called Krakozhia. As he arrives in New York, a civil war erupts in Krakozhia, which creates a diplomatic problem, since the American Government doesn't recognise the sovereignty of Krakozhia anymore. Navorski's passport is no longer valid and all of a sudden he is stuck between two worlds, Krakozhia and America, unable to step into either. Instead, the diplomatic impasse means that he is forced to spend his time in the Airport until his case can be sorted out. In some strange extended transit stay, Navorski literally becomes a a part of the fabric of the International Terminal, much to the anger of Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), the guy in charge of the Airport's security. Try as he might, Dixon cant find a way to get Navorski to leave his Terminal. Meanwhile, Victor adapts to his new life and begins to 'live' in the Terminal. He meets new people, like the Airport staff, all of whom try and help him and he eventually falls for Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an air-hostess, who's in a relationship with a married Pilot and who ends up forming a special bond with Victor. We get the feeling they're soul mates - She talks, he's a patient listener. It seems like a match made in heaven. It only adds to Victor's experiences inside the Airport where he gets to see American life in a confined space, thus enjoying America while still not technically in America. The film gives us an insight into the way Airports function in America today. There is the hovering presence of the Department of Homeland Security, the heightened post 9/11 fears about Air Travel and a slightly generalised attitude towards naive foreigners entering the USA. Navorski's story is shown compassionately and with a great deal of understanding, as are the little side stories about the Spanish Truck driver who's in love with the Immigration Officer or the Indian Janitor, who has a bit of a dark past. But the beauty is that these side stories never deflect from the main storyline, which meanders along at a slightly sedate pace, as Victor juggles his life at the Airport with his feelings for Amelia and his desire to help his new-found friends.This film was really the perfect antidote to Collateral, which, like I said is another form of film perfection, but also a film which leaves you cold and worried about the fact that Human beings could kill so easily. Here too, humans are shown to be uncaring and cold-hearted, but there is also hope and that is what drives this film - the hope that we may all understand each other one day.",The Terminal

408,filmmaker_nyc,A very bad movie from a master filmmaker,1,4 January 2005,"The Terminal is by far the worst Spielberg film so far. Not only the story is ridiculous  based on a true story that has a solid political/legal base  but Tom Hanks' portrait of this Western European man is also his worst work so far. Mr. Hanks - a good actor -being helped by the script and the Director portraits this man like a mentally challenge person, making this film extremely condescending towards Easter European people and foreigns in general. This is not a matter of language barrier or being in another country, is a matter of Mr. Hanks character's IQ. He speaks, moves, acts and reacts like a child or a grown man with a serious mental illness or simply like a stupid person, so the whole movie just doesn't work at all. Another problem is the Director wants us to believe that Mr. Hanks is an Easter European citizen only because he speaks with an accent; they should have made this movie with an unknown good foreign actor. On the other hand, the three characters that work at the airport and play poker to win stole objects are an African American, a Latino and an Indian man. If this is not racism, then what is this? Regarding the plot, it so unbelievable ridiculous that this movie can easy be science fiction. The true story on which this film is based on, it's quite different. It's a Hollywood obsession to change interesting stories to make then more ""American,"" making this last word sounds like more ""stupid."" Just to make things even worst, the only female character in the film is a flight attendant portrayed nicely by Catherine Zeta Jones; but in this film the character is having a relationship with a rich married old man another stereotype for the ""whore"" flight attendant it's just too much. This is just a very bad movie that insults the viewers with condescending remarks over non-US characters and stereotypes.",The Terminal

410,topdyke-1,Grossly Underrated,8,16 June 2008,"There is something about this movie that draws me to watching it again and again.In the 2000s era of American movies, we are flooded with cheap teenage exploitation horror films, and the God-awful calamity of recent Adam Sandler ""comedies.""But among them emerges this relatively low budget (for its time period) movie that exudes a feel-good aura, relying on the top quality of its writing, and the performances of Hanks and Zeta-Jones.The defining aspect of this film is Hanks' acting. His versatility as an actor is extraordinary. In ""The Terminal"" as he assumes the role of a tourist from the fictional East-European nation of Krakozhia with effortless mastery, down to the accent and mannerisms. As the film progresses, we see the characters develop in ways that are often overlooked in today's cinema. The depth of the acting and writing explores such themes as isolation, anxiety, and hope. Even the performances from the supporting cast are top of the line.You are doing yourself a disservice by not seeing this movie, one that I feel has been buried among the mess of crap-films that we are forced to endure.",The Terminal

And now I am saying this for the role ""Viktor Navorski"". Tom Hanks is exactly the one to play this role. He does it very well. You feel his sadness, joy, fun and anger. Hanks is not the only one, who was great. Catherine Zeta-Jones was also amazing. She succeeds in playing the honest, funny, sweet and emotional character. If you are a person, who has some bad visa experiences, you just find yourself in the movie. I was waiting for my visa to make my master in Germany. (I am from Turkey) Because of the annoying procedures I took my visa late and i had to miss the first university week. I thought I would miss also the second and third week. It was a nasty experience. You have a dream, actually a plan, you wanna do it and then just due to some visa Problem you cant do it. This is exactly whats happenin in this movie.

The first half of the movie I think is OK, but in the second there are a lots of rethorical topics, sentences and events like the marriage between the female cop and the airport employee or the ability of Victor in building a mosaic(!?). Or at the end, when Victor Navosky is on the taxi and answers to the driver that he wants to go home. I think that a real taxi driver would become a little angry listening to Navosky's destination!So, I think the movie would have been better if Spielberg had followed the romantic comedy rails.

413,lipsucka,Waste of time,3,21 June 2004,"Long ago, when Steven Spielberg was in his prime, he would lay down corny music to an already cheesy plot and the crowds loved it.  That was in the 1980s.  20 years later, no one wants to see Tom Hanks lump around in an abandoned airport like a confused dope while more of the same stupid background music plays.  If this movie would have been released in the 80s, I'm sure it would have been a hit.  It's got all the elements - a totally implausible plot, characters that no one cares about, that message about working class people of all different cultures banding together as one, that horrific music, and an unconvincing attempt at achieving some degree of reality. 
Spielberg needs to face facts - he has lost his mind.  He has lost any inkling of what real life is.  He is forever stuck in the 80s.  He needs to continue making sequels to Gremlins and Batteries Not Included.I will never see another Spielberg movie again and neither should you.",The Terminal

Krakochia cannot be identified as a country and therefore Navorski does not have a permission to walk on US soil or fly back home. Hours of waiting turn to days,days turn to months and before he even notices Viktor has a life in the Airport.Steven Spielberg continues his collaboration with Tom Hanks (previous was Catch me if you can) in a film that is not Spielberg on his finest and even not Spielberg-Hanks team on its finest but still manages to proof that Hanks was originally a comedian. Spielberg's old school humour relies on the odd circumstances of life in a busy international terminal and very much on physical comedy in which both it rather well succeeds. The weakest link propably is the ""romantic"" storyline that keeps going in circles and does feel a bit glued on although being quite realistic thinking of two strangers meeting in such circumstances. Catherine Zeta-Jones feels quite out of the place here and the chemistry between Hanks and her does not utterly convince.

The Terminal was also on the list of movies that I was watching during my 'Best Movies of All time' quest, and so I was excited to see it, hoping my expectations of this movie would not be crushed by watching it. Not only was I amazed by the brilliant plot, but I was hugely impressed with the cinematography, although it did chop and change from location to location within the airport with no real smooth transition between them, it was still quite spectacular. I have heard a lot of people call this 'A mediocre movie' with was 'Nothing Amazing'. With these people I would beg to differ. Spielberg has managed to direct this compelling drama and gel it perfectly with a love story. I have to say I was a little more than impressed by this movie. The concept is mundane, the idea is brilliant.",The Terminal

I really enjoyed the comedy side of the film. I enjoyed the supporting cast as well, Kumar Pallana as Gupta the Indian janitor is simply marvelous. Torres the immigration officer is a shining light. Barry Henley was dour and sobering as usual, but endearing. Diego Luna was a little hyper, but good. Chi McBride seemed exactly like his role on the John Larroquette Show. Stanley Tucci as Dixon was marvelous as well, he really has that knack for explaining a complete inability to be annoyed without being just plain mean back.

What did she do for him? Get him the one day emergency visa? And was it worth it? Because Dixon denies it to him by blackmailing him with his friendship to the people who helped him. It's his friends who turn it around for him (Gupta delaying the plane), and Dixon's own staff (which he turned against himself by being such a legalist) -- his top guy gives him his coat to go out in the snow.

Catherine Zeta-Jones is my favorite actress ever. She tops even Audrey Hepburn. She is amazing in this movie as well.The real fault in this movie is the poor ending. First off, why would Amelia (Zeta-Jones) convince Frank (Tucci) that despite the fact that she can get any man to fall in love with her, she would pick a practically illiterate man, Viktor (Hanks) to be with, only to leave him for another guy? Secondly, how could the scriptwriters not have Viktor and Amelia end up together?! The whole story seemed to build up to their becoming a couple, only to leave you with a broken-hearted Viktor, and a seemingly happy Amelia (Although, I think she'd rather be with Viktor than her married boyfriend)as the parting.

435,EqbalAnwari,The Terminal is more than just a joyfully juvenile comedy romance,8,29 July 2010,"It starts at JFK International Airport where upon his arrival, Viktor Novorski (Tom Hanks) learns that a coup has taken place in his home country Krakozhia (a fictional state name believed to be located in the Eastern Europe.) Viktor has very limited knowledge of the English language. He is barely able to answer airport's officials' repetitively bureaucratic questions.After he is stranded in the lounge, he struggles hard for his right to enter the US. But no body (airport staff/passengers) not only help him understand the news translation on TV, but also DO NOT facilitate the immigration process with his paper work.Amelia (Katherine Zeta Jones) plays her part as a flight hostess brilliantly. In parts you think she's made for the profession. Viktor and Amelia have a unique chemistry in this movie. The dialogue throughout the movie is very soothing no matter it's among Gupta and his co-workers accusing Viktor for being a spy or between Viktor and Enrique who wishes to win the heart of officer Dolores with the help of no other one but Viktor and or leading casts' history chat- specifically on Napoleon Bonaparte's genius and gallantry.The story is so well written. Viktor's adventure is to fulfill a promise and soon it turns into a survival story. In a scene, he goes from one store to another to make a living (three times meal.) At one shop, he's asked for contact details that much to everyone's surprise, he gives the nearby public telephone number and waits there for a phone call all day long and when finally the phone rings ""what are you going to do now?"" asks the owner of the shop rejecting him. ""I'm go to the bathroom"" Viktor replies.Clearly, this project is inferior to Spielberg's previous works such as Schindler List or Saving Private Ryan but needless to say, once again, he's paying attention to our deepest emotions as well. Imagine when it's peace again in Viktor's country, how hard he fights to fulfill his father's wish and then return to his home. It unfolds the curtains in front of the viewers' eyes and helps them to vividly see the twenty first century bureaucracy most governments adhere- the borderline mankind draws on their respective territories. It shows - the more - than - necessary formality of governments' departments which reminds us of Leo Tolstoy quote ""Government is an association of men who do violence to the rest of us."" It's about how Viktor copes with the unsettling conditions created by Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) who is the head of the airport and monitors the monitor room occasionally. Frank gradually becomes jealous or better said worried of Viktor because his inner self sees Viktor's popularity and patience larger than it actually is. It's as if he fosters a depravity inside himself the kind that John Claggart did in Herman Melville's famous novel Billy Budd. Claggart too was jealous of Billy's youth, strength and natural charisma. In concluding this commentary, the terminal is simple in the meantime a serious comedy that goes beyond the boundaries of the locations it's been filmed and repeats to thousands (well, HUNDREDS if thousands sound exaggeration) Viktors daily, weekly and monthly Viktors who are living in the third world countries and are being officially invited to wedding parties in countries rather their own- to a Western Country. Viktors who wish to fly to fulfill promises. Viktors who dream to embark on spiritual journeys, to make pilgrimage to the tombs of all those autonomous spirits- those literati and illuminati since middle ages instead faces severe tortures of bureaucracy since aviation facility or visa endorsement.Highly recommended to those with mildly humanitarian sensibility",The Terminal
436,timallen20,Predictable and Precious,4,11 July 2004,"I admit I saw this film with prejudice. I'm an enthusiastic fan of Spielberg, who I think has taken a bad rap from Hollywood snobbery, and Hanks, who I guess everyone loves. But this movie was quite bad in spite of the talent and my expectations could not overcome that.The plot became totally predictable. Not remotely believable and at the same time not quite fairy tale enough for me to put that aside. Not quite a comedy not quite a drama. I did laugh out loud several times but in the end it was just so contrived and precious I could not enjoy it.  
The writing was especially terrible. The interaction didn't work in too many places, and the chemistry between actors was missing. The antagonist role was also just too stereotypically bad. Tucci is another favorite of mine, and while he played it as well as anyone could, it was just the same old thing in terms of mean bad guy. The main love story came close, and then got lost in poor dialogue and bad character development choices. Be a comedy or be a drama. The tragic relationship problems of Zeta-Jones reminded me of a sitcom that decides to air ""a very special episode."" Also, I feel she was miscast here, someone older or just ""cute"" as opposed to stunning gorgeous would have worked better. But most importantly--I was bored. Watching Hanks with no spoken dialogue for minutes on end in Castaway was more interesting than watching his character bumble through his lines in this.

You would expect the movie to be a sure thing, unfortunately not this time. I sat down to really enjoy this movie and found myself increasingly frustrated throughout the film. This movie doesn't attempt to be fiction which is the source of my issues. It attempts to show us an extremely unlikely (yet possible) situation where a man is stuck between two countries at an airport terminal, but where it fails miserably is in the handling of the situation. I grew increasingly frustrated by the ways in which this ridiculous situation were played out. I never could suspend my disbelief of how ridiculous the whole scenario was and throughout the film I could not enjoy the laughs that came. I found myself mumbling out of frustration and heard many others in the theatre speaking out loud at their own disbelief of how the movie played out. I realize this review is weak in content, so let me say only that if you are expecting a Spielberg/Hanks masterpiece...skip this movie.",The Terminal
438,mcook128,Another Classic Hanks Performance,8,11 November 2004,"Tom Hanks has a knack. Somehow he can take the most inane sounding plots and make them work. In Forest Gump, he made the story of a slow, idiot savante memorable. In Castaway, he spent an hour and a half on a desert island with nothing but a volleyball, and yet we sat through it. Now, he takes a story which takes place entirely within JFK Airport and makes it very enjoyable and entertaining.This movie is not perfect, mind you. As much as I appreciated it, about 3/4 of the way through I definitely noticed that the movie had slowed. Not unpleasantly so, but noticeably.Also, as much as this movie was billed as a Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones movie, it really wasn't. Tom Hanks was amazing, and while he was certainly enamored of her, there wasn't much screen time or much screen chemistry between them. Instead of sitting there wishing they could finally be together, you may find yourself wondering why he's even bothering. Yes, she's certainly beautiful, but what else is there?All in all though, I really enjoyed the movie. All the actors turned in solid performances, and it was well scripted. Stanley Tucci and Hanks worked well off of each other and the supporting characters kept the movie flowing. The movie teaches you to have a little optimism in life, and make the most of a situation. Navorski gets a quarter for every luggage cart he returns and manages to have his own private feast from his rewards. One final <glowing> remark for Hanks. Nobody else could have played that role. Any other actor would have either lost our attention from the beginning, or overacted it like a high school Shakespeare production. Kudos to Tom.",The Terminal
439,918,Spielberg again,8,28 June 2004,"Spielberg AgainThough Spielberg is trying to break free, The Terminal continues the unchanged style he developed decades ago. A biography on Spielberg stressed how he wishes to gain acceptance from the majority through his films. The struggle of being an individual is usually handled by artists by declaring their differences, like Scorsese. This struggle of being different usually leads to personal cinema that reflects the artist, Scorsese's Mean Streets, James Joyce's A Portrait of an Artist, Picasso's many self portraits. THe artist declares how he and he alone sees the world. This is not the case with Spielberg who stresses the opposite. Instead of placing the focus on what's different the emphasis is placed on what is the same.Even though Hanks portrays an individual from an unfamiliar, unrelatable, unamerican country, he behaves in a fashion that gathers empathy and understanding from an American audience. This sentimentality is not what Spielberg believes but desires. His strength as a filmmaker does not lie in his appeal to the intellect, like Coppola, but to the heart. An appeal to a universal heart by displaying (whether he knows it or not) archetypes that strike an emotional universal cord with his audience. Atonement with the Father, Women as Temptress, Refusal to the call and many others.Spielberg turns an Indian janitor into a very familiar friend, and Hanks into all of us who have ever felt lost. This struggle for acceptance is not new to Hollywood, Chaplin did it in every movie. Beginning as the wimp who works up the courage to be the hero.The Terminal falls between Catch Me If You Can's airports and Always' characters and sentimentality. Its a good movie but not a great one.and though I'd prefer Spielberg to continue in the direction of Empire of the Sun and Schindler's List The Terminal does develop very nicely. The movie is a very interesting look at how an man survives in a new land. I wouldn't say it's allegorical but it does allude to many different ideas.Spielberg depicts everything from learning the language to building a bed out of chairs. Hanks is stripped of all of Maslow?s Hierarchy of Needs. He is forced to survive much like he did in Cast Away. Without food he begins to work by gathering carts for quarters. These quarters buy him food. This job is closer to slave labor than anything else and is replaced by another willing to do the job for less. By working with his hands he becomes a construction worker and moves up in status. After saving a man's father's life he gathers the support of what could be a rebellion who wave a copy of Hank's hand like a flag. Hank's rebellion allows him to enter America, or the place where his dreams will come true.What is maybe more interesting his Hank's decision to go back home. He journeys to the land to make his dreams come true and comes back down. But many filmmakers would argue that it's not what you show it's how you show it. Spielberg resorts to his classic ""ongoing lines"" such as ""do you have an appointment"", or ""one girl and two guys is a crowd"". Every Spielberg movie contains a set of ""on going lines"" for each main character and their consistency hints at the fact that it is Spielberg who is adding them not the many different screenwriters.(Jurassic Park- ""we spare no expense"")This is one of the methods Spielberg uses to develop an audiences' familiarity with a character. You feel like you know his characters because he allows you to learn a trait that is repeatedly proven true. And in this method is where Spielberg fails. Even though his style works he is not making any effort to change or invent new ways of communicating these ideas. He is only repeating himself. His cartoon type style doesn't seem to mature along with the heavy allusions and symbolism his mature story provides. It makes it harder to take the film seriously. Oliver Stone's telling of this story could have turned this picture into a possible award winner, while Spielberg who seems to be having too much fun won't earn any recognition at all. Though I don't think awards are in Spielberg's agenda for this movie, I still see his maturity as a problem. He wants to be serious but is afraid of losing his audience. Or maybe he just has too much fun.Spielberg has made what he had called personal cinema before. Amblin' or any film he made before being put through the TV system relies heavily on adult themes. But when he made Jaws he seemed to start a trend he would never turn back on, and one we would never stop paying him for. A movie like Duel doesn't seem like a Spielberg movie in any recent terms.The film The Terminal relies heavily on Hanks but for good reason. Spielberg seems to project himself through Hanks very well. Spielberg who is as famous for creating likable characters as he is for creating memorable sequences doesn't develop anything as memorable as Dicaprio teaching his French class but he doesn't miss all together either. Spielberg creates many sequences that seem like Hank's SNL skits. One scene involves Hanks and the airport's Supervisor trying to communicate to each other about his country which has ceased to exist. The skit taps into some of the all to familiar ""who's on first"" Abbot and Costello type miscommunication, all performed very new and fresh. Another involves Hanks making the airport a little more comfy to sleep in, something that could be found in a Keaton or Chaplin movie. And Finally another dinner scene between Jones and Hanks that seems to be Spielberg's take on Wes Anderson's movies as much as 1941 was a Landis film, A.I a Kubric film, and the Police car ride with Hanks telling his knock, knock joke in Catch Me if You Can a Terintino film.Hank's as well as these many sequences gives the story a Spielbegian heart, not the heart found in Schindler's List or even Catch Me If You Can but a heart all the same. The movie is very likable and any Spielberg/Hanks fan will be pleased. Many scenes made me laugh till I cried.Spielberg is good at pleasing his audience after... all he once said ""I am the audience.""",The Terminal

He didn't sound it or sometimes act it. And the accents he keeps doing aggravates me. Just like in Ladykillers.(Which was also a bad movie.) I can not believe Steven Spielberg produced this movie!!

441,lisawtgm,Delightfully Entertaining,8,2 January 2013,"This was another great movie by 2 of Hollywood's best. Spielberg directing and Tom Hanks acting. Rather then trying to make a ground breaking movie with all the effects and editing he decides to do a simple movie that focuses on storytelling. It is nice to watch a movie where we see a movie that is about the moments between characters and the emotions that are shown and felt. A great piece of film that is able to be funny and entertaining enough to keep you interested. Tom Hanks plays a foreign traveler who becomes stranded in JFK after the country he is from breaks out in civil war and ceases to be a country. Since all this has happened Viktor played my Tom is not allowed to leave the airport. During his predicament he winds up making friends, a love interest and a rival. When he has his new adventure he ends up changing the lives of all those around him. This movies does a great job of being simple without really contributing much instead it becomes about just about the interactions of the different characters. It was interesting how he was able to make some kind of home for himself while he waits his fate. What made this even more incredible was that the airport was built from scratch since for security reasons were not allowed to film in a actual airport. This was a very charming film that leaves a lot for reflection. The looks were very beautiful and elegant it should be a must see for a film-goer.",The Terminal

This is what you watch with the wife on a Friday night in with a takeaway and you want something easy to watch that you'll actually enjoy without needing to make an effort to follow.The weakness of Tom Hanks frankly embarrassing eastern European accent, the fact that Victor (Hanks) seems to be the only person on his plane who was held up and the fact that Catherine Zeta-Jones character seems blissfully unaware of the oddities of dining out at an airport for a date means there are plot holes big enough to drive a train through.However, all in all if you are able to sit and actually enjoy this overall very satisfying movie then you wont regret it. There are genuinely touching moments where your heart will go out to Victor, none more so when he is attempting to use a pay phone in the airport and no one will help him. If that doesn't even slightly touch your heart at his sheer helplessness then your definitely watching the wrong movie.All in all, while not ranking alongside the likes of Schindlers List and The Green Mile in terms of must see movies in a lifetime, this is definitely one that you wont regret taking the time to watch.",The Terminal
443,Dolphinjoy248,Hanks runs the show in an enjoyable film,7,6 February 2005,"The Terminal may possibly be one of Tom Hanks' best performances. True, it doesn't have nearly as much depth as the brilliant Philadelphia or the wonderfully moving The Green Mile. The Terminal is a simple film, based on true events. It doesn't sound like the most interesting film in the world; ""man gets stuck in airport"" doesn't sound very appealing, and basically that is the whole story, with a bit of romance thrown in for fun. But with names like Stephen Spielberg and Tom Hanks attached to it, The Terminal was always going to be a winner. Hanks plays Viktor Navorksi, who arrives in New York but then finds he isn't able to leave the confines of the JFK airport. There is a very moving scene when Navorski watches what is happening in his country on the airport monitors and is clearly very distressed. It's not all doom and gloom though, there are some great comedy moments, with Hanks delivering perfect comic timing, particularly in the scenes where the airport officials are explaining their rules and regulations. These are the best scenes in the film. I was in awe of how impressive Hanks was as Naborksi. Not for one minute do you not believe he is a pure bred Iranian, it is simply fantastic, with the accent spot on. Although the problem with Hanks being so good showed what a mistake it was casting Catheine Zeta-Jones opposite him. It is fair to say that Tom Hanks totally acted Zeta-Jones off the screen-and then some. That's not to say she is a bad actress(her Oscar for Chicago proves this). But when put alongside a pro like Tom Hanks, her inability and inexperience as an actress really shows. The chemistry between them is almost non-existent. There are a few tender moments as you watch an affection develop between them, but this is totally Hanks' movie and he carries it off superbly. It is mostly shot in JFK airport but is a lot more interesting than you might think, showing you just how much work goes into running it. The ending is very touching but you might switch it off having wanted a bit more. It won't go down in history as one of Spielberg's greatest efforts, but all the same it is a very enjoyable couple of hours.",The Terminal

Although based on what could have been a poignant story of a man without a country trapped in an airport by faceless bureaucracy, instead we get a movie with all the character depth of a police academy movie.One or two inane, illogical scenes might be written off to the ""whimsical"" nature of the movie--but this tripe is riddled with scenes that literally made me cringe. My eyes hurt from rolling them at the awful, cloying attempts at romance. My ears hurt from the insipid, unappealing characters spouting dialog that had all the verisimilitude of an infomercial. And then, there were all the ridiculous, contrived situations followed by more ridiculous, contrived situations. I had heard this movie was mediocre, but I was unprepared for the sheer torture of sitting through it.Please, don't bother to respond if you found this movie at all enjoyable. If that is true, if you found a shred of value in this train wreck of a film, there is no level at which I could engage you--we have completely different systems of taste, art, values.

Spielberg, as he tried in ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"", focus the plot on the way Americans deal with aliens, be them extra-terrestrial or humans. In Brazil, in a coincidence, ""The Terminal"" opened on the eve of September 11, in which we all remembered the terrible day for humanity in 2001, which triggered the return to the once well known paranoia with aliens that the Americans used to have (since Pearl Harbor?), what the same Spielberg tried to ""exorcize"" in the mentioned ""E.T."". Such paranoia has been insistently and extensively used by the current U.S. President to enhance American patriotism, at the expenses, in most cases, in similar or different circumstances, of people like the ""Krakhozian"" Viktor Navorski, a reference for all aliens that daily have  for ""business"" or ""pleasure""  to cross the gates of Immigration Offices in American airports. I wished the American ""silent majority"" that seems to support the current U.S. President - in his current efforts for a second term - could watch this movie and try to understand the beautiful humane message that Spielberg, with the support of a fantastic cast (Tom Hanks and Stanley Tucci are superb!) tried to transmit to all of us. Anyone who ever crossed - as an alien - the gates of Immigration Offices in the U.S. will catch immediately such message and be tremendously sympathetic to the poor Navorski I wouldn't say that this is the best of Spielberg.

And then the Stanley Tucci was very good, too. There are some very slow parts, making you wonder why you care.

This movie's premise is simple and unpretentious, and is the basis for a wonderful bit of story-telling.Sometimes we get caught in the wheels of circumstances beyond our control and we have to learn to deal with it. The terminal is a microcosm of life, the routine and the monotonous part of it that we can't seem to escape from. Hanks accomplishes the feat and goes beyond, playing the English challenged Victor Naborsky as he arrives in New York in order to keep a promise he made to his dying father. He is not bitter. He does not complain. He goes about making the best of a dreadful situation in his unassuming but humorous way.If you did not appreciate The Terminal the first time, may I suggest you watch it a second time.

I suppose that Spielberg felt that he would be successful in going for cheap laughs by creating this obscene American representation of a foreigner and I am sure that he did succeed with many people.

Hanks was absolutely fantastic in this movie--you forget who he is within a minute, and enjoy his utterly perfect depiction (including amazing accent!) of a stranded, bumbling-but-perceptive, idealistic-but-realistic, Eastern European man at the airport (indeed, it's a sign of a truly great performance when you focus on the character and NOT the marketed actor).The supporting cast--especially the actor who plays Gupta, the elderly Indian janitor--are also fantastic, and help create an incredibly rich palette of character types that help make this movie so delightful.And as cliché as the metaphor may seem, the themes of the airport ""Terminal""--of people always coming and going but never taking the time to wait in between; or of people who spend their whole lives waiting but never go anywhere--are well-portrayed and very moving, without disturbing the comedic tempo of the movie (I swear I felt so moved, but laughed aloud multiple times). There are also some underlying themes about the ""-cracies"": democracy, bureaucracy, hypocrisy, etc.Only annoying thing about the movie was the excessive number of product placements (Sbarro, Planters, Burger King, and so on)--though actually even this was kinda turned into a funny thing in a Truman-Show kind of way.-->BTW, this movie definitely had some The Truman Show overtones to it, with the possibly kind-hearted but impossibly pedantic little bureaucratic man playing god from ""above"" (parallels between Tucci's and Harris' characters). Other Truman Show themes included freedom within constrained parameters, paradox of innocent idealism combined with realistic survival (Hanks and Carrey's roles), and of society micro-cosmically represented in an isolated community (airport, TV set).<--Anyway, I highly recommend this movie!!! ~sone",The Terminal

I'd never think about referring to airport doors as an entrance to a city--as opposed to being, well, just an exit of an airport--or find a better justification for why foreigners or new immigrants in ""the promised land"" (welcome or not) could still be so attached to their home countries...even if (or maybe especially if) the latter is teeming with political and economic problems.And, of course, slipping on wet floors is always funny.Yeah, it IS highly unbelievable that a person could get stuck in an airport terminal for months, but I think that the feeling of being stuck in a certain time or place where Starbucks coffee and saltine crackers become a sort of staple food (figuratively, of course) is strangely familiar to most people. :)I've been trying to compare this movie to others I've seen, but it just won't work.

The concept of someone arriving to New York and having to stay at the airport, is not likely to produce any funny situations, but surprisingly in this movie it does. I can't figure out if it is because of the amazing qualities of Hanks, or the creation of sufficiently interesting encounters. In the end, I think, there are just a few actors and actresses out there who can be placed in any situation, setting or plot and succeed in making a great movie out of it. Hanks definitely is one of those. The role played by Zeta-Jones on the other hand doesn't remains pretty empty and little appealing. She doesn't succeed in adequately supporting Hank's part.

But Steven Spielberg treats his viewers as idiots and tells a story where nothing makes sense, expecting us to feel an emotion simply because the soundtrack is telling us to do so. Why does Frank Dixon hate Navorski so much? Why is the hot stewardess played by Catherine Zeta-Jones enchanted by him? If his friends were going to be fired, why did he go to New York anyway? Couldn't they find an old Indian guy who were a better actor? And if Navorski finally made to New York after all this trouble, couldn't he at least go to the Statue of Liberty or something too?

My reaction was, ""how could this be made interesting or funny""? An airport is such a sterile environment, what could the writers create over 90 minutes that would be funny? I was right. The movie was a bore. Millions of dollars were spent to recreate a sterile environment.The writers use the premise that immigration waits, paperwork, and airport security are funny. Let me tell you, my friends it is not funny & you have to wonder that maybe the ""evil"" Federal bureaucracy sweats out every day trying to make sure that threats to society do not make it into the United States of America. This is not comedy material, in my humble opinion.Now about the errors. Catherine Zeta-Jones, as the Flight Attendant,love interest is far too glamorous to have to fawn over the Tom Hanks character. In real life, a woman of that physical attractiveness & intelligence could pick & choose who she wanted. She would never be desperate. How about Tom Hank's accent & how fast he learned English. Was he taking a speed reading/speaking course that not only taught him to speak English but to learn the alphabet specifically since he was used to the Cyrillic alphabet in Eastern Europe. Can you imagine what a laugher this would be to Eastern Europeans? It is a transparent situation. Finally, you have to wonder why would Spielberg & Hanks lend their names to this movie. Have you have ever bought an appliance, computer, or car that was a brand name but learned that the quality or product had changed.

A straightforward plot, a clear cut hero's, villains, and conflicts, an an ending that doesn't fall into cliché, but isn't enough to run to the cinema for. What saves the film from mediocrity, though, is another virtuoso performance by Hanks and good supporting turns by Zeta-Jones and Tucci.In a nutshell, The Terminal is the story of Viktor Navorski. A man who, after his fictitious country is overthrown in a military coup, is forced to live in an airport terminal by the methodically by-the-book Frank Dixon (Tucci). As Navorski tries to escape from the terminal, he makes friends both of those inside the terminal and of those passing through (Zeta-Jones), all the while proving to everyone around him that compassion is reason enough to travel around the world.Hanks has been a mixed bag with his accents, but his Eastern European as done by Navorski will certainly garner him another Oscar nomination.Spielberg doesn't do anything spectacular here, but he manages to give the terminal a life of itself. From the running shops to the pictures of Viktor's hand prints after a touching scene, Spielberg once again immerses the viewer in a world that makes them wantto pay attention.

The plot to the movie seems interesting at first glance, but it's obvious that the writers had trouble when it came to making the movie into anything good beyond that. Tom Hanks is traveling to NY from his Eastern European homeland when a revolution breaks out and his country is no longer recognized by the U.S. He is therefore stuck in the airport, not allowed to enter the New York, and not allowed to fly out since they are forced to confiscate his passport.The movie then fills up the next 2+ hours with ridiculous characters and the antagonist is painted to be unnecessarily evil while hanks is continuously painted as a saint. Then a number of other characters are introduced just to fill up the time. If you think too hard about anything that goes on, this movie is just ridiculous: marriage proposals by people that have never met, Hanks is hated and dogged by the 'bad guy' for absolutely no reason, Zeta-Jones asks Hanks out on a date 30 seconds after breaking up with her 'affair' of 7 years, the food supplier seems to work 24 hours a day and is able to leave just about anytime he wants to talk to Hanks, an Indian janitor runs out to a plane to stop it with a mop because Hanks is such a savior,nobody can seem to understand that Hanks can't speak English and instead of getting a translator they just continue to waste their time talking to him... it goes on and on. This movie just wouldn't end and the loosely glued together coincidences just get worse and worse.This really has to be one of the worst disappointments I have ever seen. The ending just dragged, the relationship between Hanks and Zeta-Jones is completely vacuous and in the end just seems to act as another tool to show how saintly Hanks' character is.

I really wanted a cup of tea during the movie and got as far as the end of the sofa a couple of times but there just wasn't a time when I wasn't keen to see what each scene revealed. No spoilers here - you have to watch this film. It suits all ages and backgrounds, has few if any slow moments and perhaps the worst feature is Catherine Zeta-Jones (who is arguably the most beautiful woman in the world) so even that has it's compensation. If I'm honest it's not even her fault - she just has such competition in the film regarding acting and character.

The story was rather simple, a foreign man traveling to New York City for an unknown reason becomes stuck inside the international terminal at New York's JFK airport, and he begins to develop a relationship with the people around him as he waits to be able to leave. With such men behind the film and such a simple story, the expectations were different for all sorts of people. Film critics expected a Oscar worthy drama with some sophisticated comedy with realism in the development of its characters and plot. The average popcorn flick audience was expecting more of an entertaining slap stick humor movie. However, this is where the film succeeds and the people unwilling to compromise miss out. Steven Spielberg has created a light, heartfelt comedy that blends the perfect mix of slap stick and sophisticated comedy, with a plot that develops characters, yet takes twists and turns that, although sometimes over-the-top, keep the audience entertained and a movie with such a simple plot and setting interesting. The acting from Hanks is again noteworthy as well as the other members of a very well formed cast, and the moments the film has to offer can bring tears of joy and tones of laughter. The most impressive part of the film is the set, an entire airport terminal designed so realistically, that not one person viewing the film should be able to tell it is a set. This movie is an achievement for Spielberg and for cinema.

467,david_grothier,A really good famly movie,8,22 January 2006,"Very neat pseudo tear jerker playing on all the moving human emotion yet not losing the essential light magic touch of comedy.The movie was well put together, at least from my perspective, and is a clear indication of what a great Mr Spielberg can do when directing humans and not machines(War of the Worlds).Furthermore, it just goes to show class will always win through, no sex, no violence, no swearing, and no eardrum shattering horrible music that ruins so many films these days.In many ways reminiscent of the classic lightweights of the 1940s. I liked it and would recommend it as good family viewing.Tom Hanks is always a winner for me and he really settle into this part admirably, his accent, which is a difficult one to imitate was brilliant and Catherine Zeta Jones is just so darned beautiful! Put this with her great acting skills, and although we did not see enough of them together, you could feel the electricity all the way from Heathrow to JFK A really nice memorable film",The Terminal

469,DaSpaceman,Great story and acting spoiled by unbelievable screenplay and setting,6,25 April 2006,"I found myself alternately irritated and warmed by this film. The early scenes required to much suspension of belief - for example not being able to find a translator - the story would have still worked with one. Also the airport chief (or whatever he was) was just too mean and dumb to be believable. However, the film improved for me as it progressed, helped mainly by Tom Hanks' superb acting. The drama and romance was great, but sometimes too sickly. In conclusion a good story, good acting but the direction and setting could have been better. Seems I have this problem with many films I see!",The Terminal

I was so fond of the way that Tom Hanks presented the character of Victor to me, that i had to watch it again with my father. (My father is a major critic of films made in the west and let me just say hated 'Forrest Gump') but even he could not place Hanks in the movie until i told him at the end. 'The Terminal', i find is relaxing and romantically funny for no reason more then Hanks performance (oh, lets not forget the really hot leading Lady of 'Zeta Jones') the move is dark in places but the darkness is entertaining as we discover more about Victors daily habits. I think without noticing some basic errors in plot and scenes the movie is delightful and a must for DVD collections everywhere. 10 point rating for this...",The Terminal

Enjoy it!I think it's one of Steven Spielberg best movies. It has his way of showing emotions throughout although I don't remember him using light and shadows so well as in this movie. Tom Hanks made me eat my words: he is very credible as a foreigner and portrays very well a man of integrity and courage.It's a great story about how people with heart, passion and integrity can achieve more power and affect positively more people's lives than the duly appointed officials with all their titles and regulations will ever achieve in their lifetimes.",The Terminal
472,The_King_of_Carry_On,Awful,1,5 November 2004,"This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. It was also an in-flight movie which made the experience equally as awful. Catherine Zeta-Jones was wasted in this film and as for Tom Hanks he was completely mis-cast and his performance more embarrassing than anything else. Very poor.I was surprised that Steven Spielberg could commission such a poor script and content. The dialogue was totally banal. Overall then a 1 out of 10 for trying but it never recovers. Why did Tom Hanks character have to come from a dodgy Ex-Soviet state? THe stereotyping of the fake soviet country shown was cringeworthy stuff, haven't we seen too much Soviet War torn country stuff in the James Bond Films in the 1980s?",The Terminal
473,akiume,Stupid! Pointless! Unbelievable,1,23 December 2005,"What a waste of time! I know that Spielberg wants to try uplifting, positive ""people"" pictures, but this doesn't do it. The premise is so improbable. If this really have happened, the moment that someone realized Tom Hank's plight, the TV Nightly News would've been all over this. The ACLU would've represented Hank's character and he'd been let into America within days.There's lots of CUTE moments and weird characters, you could see Spielberg trying to flex his Frank Capra fingers, but he doesn't quite get it. Spielberg is still a great visualizer, but he needs to pick better scripts. Also, Catherine Zeta Jones' character is so unbelievable, she's TOO flaky. Stanley Tucci's character is so one dimensional: he's too selfish, too cold, too vengeful.Maybe Spielberg was trying to create a light fable about waiting in limbo and the great people you meet there. But as I watched this film, I felt that my whole life was in limbo, waiting for this film to end.",The Terminal
474,bimmergeek,Cast Away Redux,8,4 May 2005,"This is a great story that combines humor, drama and romance in parts that are likely to appeal to women wanting a romantic comedy and enough comedy and drama so that a guy wouldn't be embarrassed seeing it with his wife/girlfriend.In a sense, however, Tom Hanks is revisiting his role in ""Cast Away"" in this movie. The essential premise is the same: A resourceful man is isolated in a context where he is unable to get help from other people. The man must exploit his environment to rise above his circumstances of isolation.The Terminal, of course, is not exactly identical to Cast Away because of the presence of people. But I think the essential premise of the movies is the same.Hanks is superlative as the protagonist, who is immediately likable. His authenticity and ingenuity throughout the movie draws you in to care deeply about his plight. While Americans scream and throw tantrums if they are stuck in a terminal for 4 unplanned hours, Victor is in the terminal for 9 months. I found his perseverance, his patience, his humility, his adaptivity and his utter lack of demandingness to be inspiring. Watching Victor adapt to uncontrollable circumstances and insensitive airport personnel reminded me how good life is here and to be thankful for it.Catherine Zeta Jones is wonderful eye-candy but plays a character who I felt was inconsistent. She is a woman who can only choose poisonous men but is somehow able to respond to Victor with gentleness, intimacy and affection. Her sudden turn fits the initial premise that she can only handle poisonous men, but doesn't fit the tenderness she shows him earlier. And of course, the number of times they meet accidentally is sheer folly.The movie is shot with strong color themes. There are numerous times when the sets, lighting and scene color are themed with yellow, blue and green. I noticed a dominant green them while Starbucks was the featured product and I noticed a dominant yellow then when Borders was the featured product. If this is intentional, it is an interesting approach to product placement.Least important to me is the romantic theme but the women might like it. There are two romantic plot lines, both of which are improbable. Hanks and Zeta-Jones and two minor characters who get married after never having actually met one another. Completely absurd romanticism that bears no connection to reality but I guess it gives the ladies something to keep them emotionally connected to the movie.(Tangent: Why do so many romance movies depend on the random event that leads to true love? Does this reveal that finding love is nothing but sheer luck and that sustaining it is not a function of relationship but chance? Look at all the romantic comedies that are out there and you will see that the random connection is a dominant theme in them. Very odd.] Overall, I found this movie to be well-acted, the lighting and sets were excellent, the cinematography had great clarity and color and the editing was strong too. It is an engaging movie in spite of its plot line flaws.)",The Terminal

However lots of it felt unrealistic and very Hollywood-esque. For example, the entire romantic storyline felt quite forced for plot progression and it's significance to the story itself was rather minor as well. Same thing with his friend Enrique sending Victor to tell this woman that he has a crush on her and even had Viktor give her the ring! As far as we know she never had any idea that the mystery man was Enrique but she said yes to his marriage proposal when he didn't even ask her himself?

479,kennycbjr,The main problem with the movie,7,13 January 2005,"Here is the main problem with ""The Terminal"": It doesn't know what genre to be. ""The Terminal"" could have been a funny human comedy, and at times it works well on that level. However, there are times -- because of the absolute absurdity and unbelievability of much of the plot -- the movie sneaks into allegory and symbolism. And that would be fine. At other times, the movie becomes a harsh, realistic satire on immigration and human nature. And again, it could have been a romantic comedy. Had Spielberg picked a genre and stayed, any of those could have worked, but as a hodgepodge of genres, it is strangely unsatisfying.But the biggest problem is the amazing let down with the jar of peanuts. I was very interested to see what was in it, couldn't wait. ""What does Spielberg have in store for me?"" I kept thinking. Well, if you have seen the movie, you know how little drama or ethos was in the unveiling.Great acting, great set (unbelievable, actually), interesting story, badly put together.A low 7 out of 10, or high 6.",The Terminal

The script was creative, imaginative and unpredictable. Zetta-Jones and Tucci played their unrealistic characters in believable roles. The rest of the supporting actors were superb and won my heart. The timing, blocking and direction of the sets were as good as it gets and the music flowed brilliantly. This is a film for everyone of every age and race. The story lead us to believe that Victor and Emilia would eventually fall in love. I was impressed that Victor and Emilia just shared eye contact in the end as opposed to falling into each others arms and leaving together. The entire ending was filled with compassion with the police officer, the custom agent and the janitor braking the written rules. It is a film for all ages, races and creeds. Great job!

It's one of those movies that you know is going to improve every time you see it.I think what makes this work so well is the depth of every character in it. They're all three-dimensional. Even the antagonist, the security manager, comes off as a real person with real and valid motivations.Hanks gives a spectacular performance in what has to be an extraordinarily difficult role. Stanley Tucci as the security manager was also brilliant, worth of Best Supporting Actor. A note on the rating. The MPAA has declared themselves to be totally useless with this rating. PG-13? Are they nuts? I'm a pretty stuffy moralist, and this movie should be rated ""G"", suitable for general audiences. No violence. No profanity. (You think there is, but it's just your dirty mind.) No T or A. (Though does CZ-J really need to take her clothes off?) It's no racier than ""Casablanca"".

He can't return home because of the revolution and can't enter the U.S. because of the visa situation. What is created is a sometimes hilarious, sometimes thought provoking film that I was surprised that I enjoyed so much. Many reviewers compared Tom Hank performance to that of Forrest Gump and I have to agree. He can take an out of the ordinary character and make him into someone we laugh WITH and not AT as so many people tend to do with those that are different.

But when it really happened the man lived in the Terminal for 15 years. I loved everything about this film, especially the part at the end, it really makes you think that Victor has to go back without getting the autograph for his deceased father... But when he left the terminal to get the Jazz-mans autograph, Spielberg does a great job of doing exactly what the audience DOESN'T expect.

Too bad he learned to speak English for a travel guide in the time since he landed in the airport, and this other translator apparently moved to New York. Stanley Tucci probably played his part a lot nicer than the writer intended. He seems pretty likable, then he's randomly a big jerk. I did like how the Cathrine Zeta-Jones bit plays out. All of the side characters are alright, but some how the movie manages to focus on the too much, yet too little for what happens with them. A great performance by Tom Hanks.

486,ideas2many,Terminally over-sugared,1,16 July 2004,"Oh dear. A great premise for a movie, loosely based on the true story of the immigrant who was stranded at Paris airport due to diplomatic bureaucracy, however Spielberg reduces the whole story to implausible sugary mush.No doubt the director, famed for his heavy-handed and childlike emotional manipulation, thought he was improving the drama by adding a love interest in the shape of Catherine Zeta-Jones, but no one in their right mind could believe that such an attractive and well-groomed woman would ever fall for the shabby, caricature Russian immigrant as played by Tom Hanks. Such a waste of talent and money.Spielberg obviously believes that his audience has a mental age of 10, and an exceptionally low IQ, as that is probably the only target group that would enjoy this very silly and soppy romantic drama. Shame on you, Steven Spielberg, for offering adult cinema-goers this sugary pap!Hanks' performance is no worse and no better than his recent stint in The Ladykillers, i.e. mildly amusing in a cartoonish sort of way. If I were Russian I would be seriously insulted by the bordering-on racist portrayal. Miraculously, Hank's character moved from speaking almost no English to being extremely fluent within a very short period, and gaining a posse of bumbling friends within the airport. The genre should have been listed as fantasy rather than romantic drama. And as for the comedy aspect - I seem to have totally missed it, unless it's deemed funny to laugh at foreigners in a difficult predicament.With some character development and a decent script, this could have been an interesting film, however it's two leads were sadly wasted in this saccharine turkey.",The Terminal

488,loocirun,This is too cheesy to believe it,4,25 September 2004,"I saw this movie and I thought I would have to go and visit the dentist afterwards because of the excessive amount of sweetness on it. It is so sentimental that makes you throw up and you don't believe the story. The photography is well made, except for the scene of the fountain where the lights reflected on it go out of control and not to mention the fake water effect on the walls when the movie make us believe there was no water in the fountain. Except for that, the plot is okay but the way they handle it is too cheesy and they miss the whole point of it. The plot is quite simple: a foreign man has to stay in the terminal because for a moment there is no country for him to return and he has no visa so he has to live in the terminal until his situation is resolved. That's OK; and I know that films are fiction, but since this was based on a true story I don't think that the real man did get that royal treatment. Because, all of us that have gone to any of New York's airports and we are not American citizens, we are not treated with that delicate and kind treatment. As far as I know, no foreign person that has put a step on a NY airport has had any signs of good, even respectful treatment; so I was wondering, why were all the airport staff so nice with him? That is just no real! Anyway, about acting, I don't know about you but Tom Hanks, even if he did a decent job is horrible for comedy movies and not convincing as a Eastern Europe person; not to mention that when he was supposed to speak in the other language you couldn't even hear him, because he couldn't speak it. Then, Diego Luna, over here in Mexico the film company put him in the poster as a big role, when it has a secundary role and of poor quality of acting, considering his other roles. Catherine Zeta-Jones was OK, he didn't have a difficult part to play so she couldn't show her talent to the fullest. Over all, unless you are going with your couple to make out on the films or you are in the excessive cuteness mood, don't watch it!In my overall opinion 4/10",The Terminal

Tom Hanks was his usual charming self, Stanley Tucci was perfect as the evil head of the airport. Catherine Zeta Jones was believable in her role as the ill-used (by her married boyfriend) airline flight attendant. She wore minimal makeup, a plain hairstyle, and boring uniform which helped. This is a very endearing, uplifting story of everyday people who happen to work at the airport. The supporting actors were all great and so were the background actors.

The lack of a plot that makes any sense (it sort of has one, but a really dumb one) drags the movie out for longer than necessary. It has some very funny scenes, but just as many that really don't make any sense. Hanks puts on an unrealistic but funny character, including accent. I really hate it, though, when a movie is unrealistic. At least there should be a plausible idea behind what the characters do. Places and accents should be realistic. Don't make stuff up. Plus, does every movie have to have a love story? It's as if they have to throw one in there for good measure. This movie has more than one. And one ends up in a marriage after the first date. That's ridiculous. There's also a bad guy thrown in there for good measure.I've come to expect this kind of movie from Hollywood. Entertaining, but disappointing.

They are very superficial. The story line says that they are in love, but you can't see it when you look in the characters when they are not around each other.And the end was terrible too, because no sensible man is willing to wait such a long time for an autograph, which is hard to believe anyway because all the 57 jazz-musicians didn't die in all those years.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",The Terminal

Hanks role here is humble, modest, warmhearted, honest Viktor with nowhere to go, being trapped at the JFK Airport, whose country is in war. Character of Viktor is what makes this movie ""Great Emotional Comedy"", personality which could be seen rare nowadays, or could not at all. Personality with heart of a child, positively influencing people around him, personality which we all were once, but we changed with a time and maturity, personality whose honest and warmness should be a role model to all of us, especially to youth.That is the main reason why I liked and enjoyed watching this movie, Viktor Navorski woke up that child with a big heart in me.

501,WonKaiKo,An enjoyable film but a lost opportunity.,7,27 April 2008,"The one thing that struck me as truly bizarre about this entire film was the fact that DreamWorks never actually used the original story details that they (reportedly) shelled out around $250,000 for. As the old adage goes, ""true life is stranger than fiction"", and in the case of Mr. Merhan Karimi Nasseri, the (former) Iranian citizen who is the unsung hero of the real-life story which inspired this work, that is absolutely the case. The most important part of any film is establishing credibility in the opening segment but the reworking of real-life events that the scriptwriters gave to this film was just not credible. This is a great, great pity as it is a truly remarkable sounding story about immigration bureaucracy and mistakes, stolen credentials, a human-rights court struggle, and a 16-year confinement to the international transit lounge of Paris' Charles De Gaulle airport.It's every film maker's prerogative to instil whatever political or emotional overtones that they see fit into their work. And Spielberg definitely left his overtones all over this film, from the grossly overdone syrupy schmaltz in some areas to the ""politically correct"" and fantasy-style portrayal of immigration at United States airports regarding detainees. I myself have been harassed, strip-searched, and the contents of my baggage overturned by United States immigration on numerous occasions just due to the colour of my skin and the fact my name looks ""indian"". So the portrayal that US immigration finally has ""compassion for the human plight"" was nigh-on insulting in the light of my own experiences.However, contrary to other reviews posted, I still believe that Spielberg spent a great deal of effort on the visual and audio realism that is the reason for his well-earned reputation. I also believe he had to make some very serious judgements about how to interpret events in a real-life story and about whether those events should even be portrayed in the film in the first place. The facts show that Mr. Nasseri indulged in political activity against his own country within the confines of the United Kingdom, and that the British Government later (unrelatedly) denied his application for citizenship based on his claims of British ancestry. So, given the potentially hazardous material there was to work with, I think Spielberg did a good job in finding the likable aspects of a character that could have easily been unfavourably viewed by audiences. He also did a very reasonable job in emphasising the fact that life has a little humour even in the darkest of situations, and it is this for me that made the film quite enjoyable overall. As for the actors, Tom Hanks's attention to detail in language and character was excellent (care of a Bulgarian dialect coach), though a little cheesy in places. And the other performances, particularly Stanley Tucci and Barry Shabaka Henley, were good given the script they had to work with.Of course, the one problem you have with dramatising any truly bizarre real-life story is that you have to bring it within the credible reaches of your target audience if they are to make the leap of faith on their part to connect with it. This is Spielberg's forte and in this film he created a work that was enjoyable and believable for cosy, suburban households without the entire concept being lost on them. However, having purchased the rights to a story about a living person, you have to wonder what drives a director to literally ignore real-life facts in favour of an almost completely unbelievable plot rewrite. In doing so, he squandered an opportunity to make a legendary film while, at the same time, trivialising the events that mentally all-but destroyed a man confined to a terminal building due to an unfortunate incident at a railway station followed by 16 years of bureaucratic red tape.Would I recommend this film as enjoyable viewing? Yes. Then I would recommend going to a news website and actually reading the real story. At the time of writing, The Guardian newspaper (UK) article ""The man who lost his past"" has a one year feature documentary about Mr. Nasseri. I guarantee you'll find the real-life version a lot more fascinating.",The Terminal

The sad part is that it could have been ... should have been good. It's a fabulously quirky scenario, which could have been built into a Groundhog Day-esque story, if that is the way the writers wanted to go.Sadly, the writers didn't know *which* way they wanted to go, and must take most of the responsibility.The plot line fails to work coherently, and is poorly crafted, sometimes veering towards redemption movie, sometimes heading towards slapstick, but never (like the lead character) ever getting to any destination, I like cross-genre surprising films, but this film's only surprise is its lack of surprises . The characters are straight of out central casting. No cliché is left unturned. A special mention must go to Catherine Zeta-Jones for a performance of mind-numbing shallowness.

513,kentpaul_65102,Something New,9,25 June 2004,"Spielberg has taken a new step to making movies. He had never made a movie like this one in fact nobody had. ""The Terminal"" is a story about Victor Navorski, who is a tourist to New York City, from a fictional country called Krakosia(probably from the Polish city Krakow). On his way to the US, a war breaks out in his homeland. The US custom department would not allow him to enter American soil. He is forced to stay in the JFK's international transit lounge till the war comes to an end. He finds a job. He makes new friends. Plays as matchmaker. Helps a Stranger. And finally discovers America. This movie is acted almost everyday by visitors around the world, if not 9 months but to some extent. Reality is one of the strong points of this movie.

514,milbathepenguin,Not as bad as everyone keeps saying...,7,30 January 2005,"I had heard mixed things before watching this movie, and I was fully prepared to hate it despite my loyalty to Tom Hanks. I was thoroughly surprised, not just because of my low expectations, but because it's a rare thing to see a movie this tenderly crafted as well as acted.Tom Hanks' brilliance goes without saying. He obviously has mastered his character and it shines through every scene. An excellent counterpart to him is the devious Stanley Tucci who provides a surprisingly small amount of antagonism. Much of the film's conflict comes from other sources, such as the employees at the airport, Hanks' relationship with the stewardess (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones), or Hanks' simple techniques for surviving within the terminal.While it would have been very easy for the writers/filmmaker to become trite and boring, the film is masterfully shot and every scene feels important. Not only are the scenes visually beautiful, but there is an emotional resonance contained within them as well.In conclusion, there were a lot of different clichéd paths this film could have taken which easily could have ruined it. It didn't play up the touchy-feely aspects, it didn't overly pursue the love interest or make it become unrealistically pertanent towards the end, and it concluded the film with quiet satisfaction. Unfortunately, movie-goers are programmed to expect something big at the end of a film, and when something quiet and human concludes a film, it is looked at as boring and anti-climactic. This is anything but the case.Definitely worth renting and watching, at least once. If for nothing else than the expert cinematography and Hanks' performance.",The Terminal
515,jeremiah-senderous,Amazing performance from Hanks,8,27 March 2012,"""The Terminal"" is an enjoyable movie, and I was amazed at how well Tom Hanks maintained an Eastern European persona throughout the movie. How others and Victor played off each other was enjoyable to watch. However, the role played by Catherine Zeta Jones was not exceptional. For her to be in love with a married man when she can easily meet many others during her travels doesn't make sense. If the writers put more thought into her role, she would have had a great character to contrast Victors. As for Tom, some would argue that his Victor shows too much ingenuity while coping with being stuck in the airport terminal, but ask yourself, he somehow manages to go NYC from his Eastern European country and he is a skilled carpenter. I would say he didn't play Victor... he was Victor.",The Terminal
516,brownsea,The terminal is a must see movie,10,7 September 2004,"Tom Hanks stars as Victor Navorski who has just arrived in New York city from eastern europe, whilst in the air the government of his home country has perished in the wake of a rebelion. Victor's passport is now invalid leaving him unable to return home or enter America. Leaving him with no choice but to live in the airport's terminal unable to speak any English.The terminal from the start has a lot to live up to, being directed by the god like figure in the movies, Steven Spielberg, who over the past three decades has given us films such as Jaws, ET, Schindlers List, Jurassic Park and Saving Private Ryan. It also stars Tom Hanks, who in my opinion is one of the greatest actors of our time. Forest Gump, Cast Away, Saving Private Ryan and the Green Mile are films that really standout in my mind. With this mixture of talent you would be expecting something special and that is exactly what the terminal is, something special. From start to finish in the terminal you can not help but to be drawn to the character of Victor. Tom Hanks gives a standout performance that will touch the hearts of all viewers as he brings the character of Victor to life. Hanks is able to evoke so much humour and emotion from this character that it really makes the terminal a must see.It would be wrong to say that Hanks is solely responsible for making this film what it is. The support cast of Stanley Tucci's Immigration and security chief who can't do enough to try and get rid of victor, is excellent as always, in a role he seems to relish. also at hand are, Catherine Zeta-Jones, a stewardess who passes through the airport frequently, whilst passing through she meets Victor and then some what frequent encounters between the two begin to happen, gives an enjoyable performance. Kumar Pallana gives a very funny performance of a floor cleaner who loves to see unsuspecting travelers fall flat on their faces as the result of slippery floors.The terminal is a touching and very funny story that will keep you gripped on watching victor adjust and deal with his surroundings and his interaction with people that he meets. Victor manages to touch the lives of so many that he meets in the terminal that it keeps the story rolling along at a nice pace and at just over 2 hours doesn't make it seem too long. The set itself, Spielberg had a complete terminal built from scratch, is fantastic and makes you feel as though you are caught up there with the characters.This is a film that I feel is a MUST SEE, even if it is not the sort of film you'd go for.",The Terminal
517,starpacker1,"Excellent movie, based (I believe) on a true story",10,18 June 2005,"I just saw The Terminal, and I must say that it is one of the best pictures I have ever seen. The cast did a fantastic job of creating a very real sounding situation, and the acting of all was superb.I have seen how movie producers, directors, or whatever love to to use the line 'Based on a True Story,' and wondered why it was not used on this film. According to the movie's website, the story was the brainchild of a Mr. Niccol. Many years ago, I read a magazine article about a man stranded in what I believe was the Paris (Orly?) airport, due to a legal snafu such as Mr. Navorski ran into. It seems this person was stuck in the airport in Paris for something like 18 months, before his situation was resolved. I am sure that TT was a much better story than that lived by the man in Paris, but I have heard it said that truth is stranger than fiction, only because fiction must make sense.

I think people expected it to be poignant and extraordinarily believable. While it is not necessarily poignant or highly likely to happen, I did find it touching and, yes, believable.Before this movie came out, I saw a 20/20 that showed a man in this real-life situation. He was in limbo because for some reason he couldn't return to his country (a fugitive??) but he hadn't the appropriate documents to enter the U.S.So yes, I can believe it.I realize this isn't a ""Schindler's List,"" but it is a nice little gem with a good story, good acting, and a winning subtlety that I believe is overlooked by most of its critics. While the movie neither changed my life nor dazzled me with awesome special effects, a lot of the wordplay and slapstick humor made me laugh out loud, while other moments made my eyes well up with tears.Please give this movie a chance.

There was laughter and tears, and I believe identification with both the heroes of the movie (Viktor, Gupta, and Judge Thurman) as well as with the not so heroic (Amelia and Frank). John Williams music fits the scenes and moods perfectly, and while not on the same vein as Star Wars, provides the proper tone and background to heighten the films best parts.This is a good solid film with enough plot to allow for a good enjoyable 2 hours at the movies, and enough to take away to the water cooler on Monday.",The Terminal
520,christinarowina,The Terminal...IS TERMINAL,2,21 June 2004,I like Tom Hanks very much. I have loved him since the eighties in all of his offbeat comedies. Hell I even saw Joe Vs Volcano on opening weekend. This was such a boring movie though. I couldn't wait until it was over. Often times I wonder why I stay till the end and toucher myself. However paying as much as it cost to see a movie seems to commit you. My husband and I watched it as the ONLY people in the whole theatre. At least I could say gee this sucks..Without being hissed at. As much as I like Hanks..he wasn't enough to save this too long...Too Hollywood... movie. And I really can't stand that little twerp who played head of airport security or whatever. I guess it was more like Head of US Immigration in JFK. He is such a little jerk. Save your money.

521,jedimaster-7,Heartwarming Tale,8,26 November 2004,"When renting the Terminal I was expecting a comedy, which it is not. It is a heartwarming comedic drama. First off Hanks has to be one of the most versatile actors in the business right now, he pulled off the role of Viktor perfectly. He brings such warmth to the character, he really makes him seem so real and lovable. The supporting cast deserves credit as well, all of these characters are so real and lovable. The humor is more subtle and will not entertain the younger crowd. But this is a film to watch with your family, its such a moving piece and very enjoyable. But what hurts the movie is that in some parts it slows down and chugs a bit, but you can forget about that. The other thing I loved about this was the writing, one of the better scripts that a movie had this year. The only people I see hating this movie are the cynics, and who really cares about them anyway?For once I have a movie I can recommend to everyone, you will not be disappointed in this.

First of all, the menu items he suggests to the non-English-speaking waiter are not Egyptian, but more African. The decor in the restaurant is also more reminiscent of American-Indian, not Egyptian. I did laugh at the funny loss of translation between them, but for another 20 minutes the progression of the film seemed lackluster. 45 minutes through, however, there is a very funny bit when Hanks decides to start a bat-releasing business inside the terminal and offers free packages of sardines to every customer who wants a bat released. The whole cinema was in hysterics. All in all, aside from those hilarious sections, The Terminal was quite boring. The amount of gruesome violence, gore, and decapitating of passengers did not help to excite things whatsoever, and seemed totally unnecessary... I give this black comedy 4/10.",The Terminal

I thought it was a very funny, charming, and heartwarming film. This is a perfect film for a date night. It has something for both the men and women. The comedy and lifestyle of Victor keeps the men there (not to mention Catherine Zeta-Jones) and the ""love"" story and plot keeps the women there. This was vaguely based off a true story about a guy in France I believe that did something similar. It's impressive to see the different ways Victor earns money and simply lives in the airport. I definitely would recommend this movie. Hopefully this will at least get Hanks nominated for an Oscar (even though I think he deserves to win).",The Terminal
526,alystacat,Amazing faceted film with a lot of flaws,8,24 January 2014,"I love this film. There's a lot of flaws with it of course. i love Tom Hanks in this but I think they miscast. I think it would've been a lot better if it was an actual person of Eastern European descent. The subplots can be sappy. But the overall writing is amazing. There is a beautifully wrought sense of comradery and overwhelming odds. To me, I felt the airport was an metaphor for America itself. The security a metaphor for the government. Movies don't often choke me up but this one does, every time. In a way this movie was it's own version of Purgatory. I'm sure for some of the people watching it it seems as thus. But the underlying themes cannot be mistaken. Nonviolent peaceful resistance, making the best out of the most messed up situation you could possibly be in, and realizing all the people trapped with you have their own problems that need solved as well. A lot of people will say Schindler's List is Spielburg's best work, and I do agree for the most part. But if I had to choose between these two movies on a regular Saturday night? I'd pick the Terminal any day. And the Terminal really is as painful for me to watch as Schindler's List. The overall theme of dragging people down with rules, laws, and heartbreak over the name of some stupid security? It's just the fight against Nazism and totalitarianism in a different context. Ever notice how it feels that if Victor leaves the airport, he will end up in a concentration camp? I feel this way about the first half of the movie and by the second half I feel that the Terminal itself has become a concentration camp. The themes are easy to miss when shed in the light of a pretty flawed romanticomedy. Of course I read too much into it, as I always do. But yah, 2 thumbs up and a huge amount of respect for showing that the nice guy doesn't always finish last, that peaceful nonviolent resistance can really work, the woman you love isn't always going to be available and the answers to almost all your problems are in the local bookstore. Even if that bookstore is a sold out disgrace in a busy airport terminal. Adversity is something we all must face, all the time,especially in airports. Lovely film.",The Terminal

My favorite theme was probably how he lost everything, including his father, flew to NY, to finish what his father hadn't/ Love. That is another plot line. Also, how the flight attendent was included in the movie helped make is humouros, along with the serious points. And to be correct, I noticed that Viktor always never looked down in the move.

528,rphillips-4,Over-rated and awful,1,1 December 2004,"There are so many things wrong with this film I don't know where to begin. I'll start by saying that Spielberg and producers should be ashamed of themselves to make this film of such an awful, impractical, predictable, script that should have been presented as a tongue and cheek spoof rather than an overdone, gingerbread light comedy with sappy dramatic moments. The producers of this hackneyed film surely believed that all moviegoers are stupid enough to ignore plot holes the size of Antarctica, buy into situations that are so unrealistic that they are laughable, and be put under a spell by the script's trite gadget formulas that these screenwriters may have picked up at a seminar in Culver City. The Terminal has a heavy arsenal of anomalies, inconsistencies, and farces, and canards: Chinese tourists waiting a connecting flight to Disneyland in Orlando don't have cameras as they wait to board. So what? They are not in Disneyland yet to take pictures yet. There is no way any airport authorities would detain a ""nationless"" passenger to the confines of enormous an airport shopping mall where he or she would have the benefit to escape from a gaggle of fire exits in the fast food stations. Where was the B.C.I.S (immigration)? If Stanley Tucci's character was so resolute about having someone else deal with this airport refugee why didn't he just call him or her in the first place? By the end of the movie, Hanks seems to have achieved an enormous amount of revere and power in the airport by his recognition of a photocopy of a hand. Why? Because he tells a Russian transit in cryptic Bulgarian to convince airport authorities that the medicine he is carrying without approval will be used to help cure a goat somewhere in Canada. Need I say more.There is so much more: Catherine Zeta Jones' consciously neurotic character, who, for some reason, prattles on and on about Napoleon, which by the way, has no connection whatsoever to the story. She confesses to Tom Hanks about her lonesomeness and need for healthy relationship, which she finds in Hanks, however, for some incomplete reason (perhaps she was forced to do another exciting T Mobile commercial) that the producers may of had to quibble over, disappears like thief in the night and returns only for a glimpse as she gets out of a taxi, with a look of contentment on her face that tells us, ""see, I told you that I'm high maintenance"". And...?In the muddled 3rd Act we finally find out, without any consequential anticipation, what is inside the Planter box? Autographs from Jazz musicians. So what did we learn from this film? Jazz is good, being stuck in an airport is bad, being stuck watching this movie is the worst.",The Terminal
529,ionut_bican,Excellent Movie,10,4 January 2005,"This is a movie that worth watchin' from the beginning till end. Tom Hanks act is just great. One could say that Steven Spielberg is a historian, documenting human emotion on film for the past 20 years. With each new film, Spielberg addresses a different issue but never fails to incorporate the basic emotions that pulse through everyone's body. His movies are remarkably touching, realistic and passionate about human nature. In this film, The Terminal, Spielberg reveals a little bit of his own mind as he introduces the audience to Viktor Navorski.Hanks is brilliant as the Russian immigrant, bringing both subtlety and vigor to the character with his dead-on accent and genuine attention to Navorski's quiet lifestyle. Jones and Tucci add a desirable flavor of personality to the cast, but it's Hanks and his team of airport misfits (Chi McBride, Diego Luna and Kumar Pallana) who control the story's momentum. One of Spielberg's finest films to date and a definite Oscar contender, ""The Terminal"" is the perfect picnic away from a summer of big explosions and gaudy sequels.",The Terminal

What the hell could happen to make this movie a little bit interesting and less obvious? I had the sensation that a brilliant idea regarding the location for a whole movie (a terminal in the JFK airport) was up to finish in the most boring event in the history of the cinema. And than I understood I was wrong. As usual, Steven was able to bring the movie at an emotional level and ""poesia"" came out of the images.

This film does raise a lot of questions though: How can Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta Jones have accepted to be in it? What was Steven Spielberg on when he made this film? Are the writers two teenage girls? How much did the critics get paid to give it good reviews? I personally wanted Hanks thrown into a plane and deported back to war stricken Krakozhia three minutes into the film. It might have made for an interesting story line.",The Terminal
532,nefedor,Clearly the best movie I saw in 2004.,10,18 April 2005,"Reading the other reviews here I mentioned that the majority of the people who disliked the movie either didn't get the idea or didn't get to see a piece of art which cinematography is. The people, who came to see ""something funny"" or some cool but brainless action with fighting, races, shootings, killings etc found ""The Terminal"" boring. No surprise here: this move isn't for pop-culture audience, it's for people who can think and feel all hidden but beautiful turns of a movie. But there are many people who just stacked in facts they think don't make sense and blame the move to contain mistakes. That's learning English in couple weeks, made-up Victor's country and language, etc. These folks somehow thinks that the story of an airport adventure must be absolutely real, contain only true and recognizable facts and better be a documentary. They just don't see that unimportant things, who are just setting the stage, could easily be made in fairytale-like style and the movie like Terminal will only gain from it, not concentrating on ""how exactly that happened"". And finally, the most misunderstood point of the movie is the final of the Victor's love story as well as the box with signatures. That's because many observers have got emotional reflection but couldn't clarify the main idea of the movie, which this comment is actually about. This movie isn't about love or devotion, but about the conflict between the human personality and the system. It's the unique character of Victor which makes him deal with absolutely every situation he gets in in the airport and to become a winner, having love from everybody around him. He changes barking ""Next!"" officer Torres to a happy wife of his friend Enrike, who, once, even talks to him in his native language, forgetting the language difference. And that's why Amelia, who is definitely a part of her own system, a circle she couldn't get out, can't go along with him. And one of the most touching moments of the picture: small Indian man Gupta with a mop runs towards a huge monstrous plane (representing The System) which must crash him, but miracle happens: the moment he touches the plane wheels be his mop, the plane stops; the human is stronger and victorious over the System. That episode is so strong, I would compare it with ""Love is beautiful"", where the boy is standing in the middle of deserted concentration camp, and suddenly from behind the corner comes the real tank, promised him by his father, who is already dead... And being very familiar with US immigration system as well as arriving at JFK, I can say that the topic and the spirit of the movie is just right: I'm proud to live in country, who can recognize it's own weaknesses and make such a wonderful movie about it like Spielberg did.

Well, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed 'The Terminal', but I'm a romantic. If you're not, you're going to need a pretty thick rope to suspend your disbelief for this one. Eastern European Viktor Lavorski (Hanks) finds himself stateless and without citizenship when a military coup erupts in his country, during his flight to New York. As such, he is not admitted to the US, and must camp out in JFK. For months - during which time he gradually befriends most of the employees, and becomes a familiar figure shuffling around the terminal. At night, he teaches himself English by comparing the Russian and English versions of the same tourism guide, by the light of a miner's helmet which he wears to help him read. Always dapper and impeccably dressed - as we would be, if we were living rough in an airport - he soon catches the eye of air hostess Catherine Zeta-Jones, who asks him out. (I have spent many long hours in airports over the years, and never even SAW Catherine Z-J, never mind get asked out by her. Or, for that matter, by ANY air hostess. Which, incidentally, is their loss.) Anyway, in between his courtship by the alluring Miss Jones, he lays out a well-appointed apartment with bed and stereo in a corner of the building, builds a massive mosaic fountain within the terminal rest room, and wins the affections of practically all the staff in the eateries around the terminal floor. Not bad for an illegal alien with no English. See what I mean about suspending your disbelief? But hey, it's Hollywood. You can hang your disbelief on one of those big white letters up on that hillside. Once you do that - it's a fun movie.",The Terminal

Not a futuristic haven for Action and Sci-fi junkies or a prehistoric nightmare of animatronics but something new that this viewer was not expecting. Spielberg's talent has taken a new path in creating a mock real world that at no point did i think was unreal. The pin point perfect Cinematography as well as the always superb editing by Michael Kahn (Must be attached to Spielberg's hip at this stage with the amount of films they have worked on) topped off this movie for me and gave me an evenings entertainment as well as a fresh respect for the 'berg'ster.

537,kasperromarvengsgaard,This film is ''incredible''.,1,1 December 2019,"The accent Tom Hanks gets away with in this 'film' will astound you.
It was only 15 years ago that something like this was possible.
Meerkats would struggle watching this level of tackiness.
Blind-drunk Borat impressionsm stops in its tracks.
There's however ways to enjoy this film:
Surround yourself with folks that love to comment loudly on everything and remember to drink wildly. You know the types.If you were Russia and you watched this, you would probably have to ask the US gov for an extradition of anyone involved in this project. Chained. Muted.
''In a deleted scene, Navorski gets help using a phone card and says, ""Home phone, home phone!"" Steven Spielberg cut it because he didn't want comparisons to E. T. (1982) and the famous lines ""Phone home.""Which is because horse-antagonist-directing-Steve, is an actual auteur.
Most of Tom Hanks accent here would be out of place comming out of the mouth of a horse, but only barely. Because Tom is a good actorer, maybe even as good as that horse in that other classy film, the great Spielberg made later on.''As of July 2017, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have collaborated for 5 films. The Terminal is the only film in their collaboration which hadn't been nominated for Academy awards.''
This could be one of many reasons why that is:
''In the scene where Viktor and other people sing the Krakozhian national anthem, they sing the anthem of Albania in ""gibberish"" words.
Although Viktor comes from the fictional country of Krakozhia, the language he speaks in the movie is Bulgarian. The written material shown (the Fodor's guide and the magazine page with the jazz greats) is in bad Russian.''
Not unlike the accent which is bad russian aswell. The film is bad too.
The accent in this film is terminal. The film needed a dying horse.
It needed whipping from an archeologist too. Whipping a dead horse, is exactly what this accent was too.",The Terminal
538,garyfletcher-10536,Tom Hanks makes us all smile,9,14 December 2020,"Watch The Terminal for the first time and you'll instantly get that Spielberg feel to it. It's a film that makes you smile from start to finish.
The film takes place in an airport, and your instantly introduced to the main character, Victor Laborsky (Hanks), who can't get a visa into the USA. His own country is also at war and restrictions don't allow him to return their either. This leaves him stuck at JFK Airport until he can get his visa sorted, and thus the comedy of events unfold and bring us into the life of Victor Laborsky as he's stuck inside the walls of the airport.
Given any other main lead and you'd be forgiven for thinking this sounds dull, because is does. The one factor that changes that is that main lead is played by Tom Hanks. Savior.
He can do no wrong in this film as you first come across him stumbling into the airport with his suitcase, looking terribly vexed and lost at sea. You instantly smile and know you are in for a classic of a film. It's not till later in the film that you really start to appreciate Victor Laborsky as a character we can side with. The people he meets, the friends he makes and the characters that pop in and out of the airport throughout all have an impact into the outcome of this unique Spielberg classic.
Catherine Zeta-Jones is also in this film as hapless lover Ameila Warren. Seemingly always in a rush to meet her 'lover', Amelia first encounters Victor as she slips on a wet floor as she didn't notice the plainly obvious ""wet floor"" sign right in front of her. To be fair she was on her phone but still..
Victor's presence in the airport draws the attention of the airport staff, who recruit him into their midnight poker games where they play for lost items.
The whole films premise is just Victor waiting for his visa so he can enter the USA, and the calamity that unfolds as he makes JFK Airport his home for the foreseeable future. Every character is interesting enough to keep you watching as the film does have a steady pace to it, never giving anything away as to what comes next.
It works as a family film to get you through a Sunday evening in the winter, and it works very well.Verdict 9/10",The Terminal

One of the best actors out there in my opinion and I think this movie really tested his talents as playing someone who is foreign with such an accent must be pretty hard, but once again he did this to perfection! It's a great story and very heart warming as each character is believable. Plus more than a few belly laughs in there too. It's a light hearted film and doesn't take itself too seriously so I don't know what these 1/10 people have seen. It certainly can't be this movie.

I agree with you people that her character was irrelevant in the movie.Spielberg should had made the ending more happy. If he did use the cliché, boy gets girl in the end then it would have completed the whole picture. I really wanted to see Viktor win Amelia's heart in the end and he could of. The bit towards the end where Viktor was celebrating the end of the war in country, Amelia came to give him a Visa to go to New York. She said she was going and Viktor did not try to express how he felt about her. Didn't the mural he made from the bathroom toilet mean anything to her? If she knows that he is different from other men, (because he listens) then why doesn't she come back to him, instead she goes back to that guy with the wife. Does she not realise that she is making the stupid mistake that she is trying to avoid the whole movie? If she had no influence on Viktor then why put her in the movie. People even if they know that there is a happy ending will still watch it because its what they want to see.Now every time I watch the movie, I get really sad towards the end because the do not stay with each other in the end because the build up to their romance was so compelling and with twist ending it really stuffed up the movie for me.What do you think?

544,ico_mate_vt,"excellent plot, excellent acting",10,8 July 2006,"If have to be honest, when I saw the title for the first time, I thought that this would be just another lame comedy, but I was completely wrong. The film was fabulous, very profound and at the same time very entertaining. I think that this is tremendous story equally interesting for the Eastern Europeans and the rest of the world, but I'm sure that both sides look at the movie from different point of view. I'll give you mine. I'm 23 years old Bulgarian and when I was watching the movie with my father, we had completely different reaction. I couldn't stop laughing, while he was almost crying. And then I realized that he saw himself in Tom Hanks character. The fact that Navorski speak in Bulgarian, even enhanced the feeling. Tom Hanks did an excellent job, because he managed to show the world, how all Eastern Europeans over 50's feel when they go in United States. It would be very stressing, confusing and even shocking for a man coming from deep countryside of eastern country, who has never seen such a big airport, TVs everywhere(his first reaction was to try to turn the volume up manually), with very poor English, and on the top of all his country is in war and he is forced to live at the airport, where he must survive without any support, money and a lack of any kind of information(absence of interpreter). The thing I liked the most, is that with Victor Navorski, is shown the typical for Eastern Europe compassion, understanding, inventiveness, integrity, frank communication and simply to be friendly. Although Navorski knew that he will cause himself a lot of troubles by helping the Russian guy that he hadn't known, he lied to save him. Why he did that, this is something that Americans will never understand. In Eastern Europe, the people are not always kind and polite, but most of the time, they are sincere, real friends and help each other without looking for any kind of benefits. They keep their promises and will never betrayed their friends. That's why he decided to leave the USA without getting in New York and carry out his mission, just because he could put his friends in danger. On the other hand, the typical American behavior is also very well present. The security chief was always falsely smiling and polite, but in fact, he was cruel, heartless and the only thing he was caring about is how to get rid of him. When he caught the Russian guy with the pills. He didn't show any compassion, humanity or understanding, but only the stupid regulations were important. He didn't try to make even one step to find a better solution of the problem. I think that the conclusion is that we should make, is to look more like Navorski , to be honest, real, true friends, to help each other and care a bit more about the others people's feelings, to show some more mercy and compassion. The personal prosperity, success and wealth should not make you selfish and blind.

545,orion-37,Nothing special...,3,20 March 2005,"The premise sounded pretty bad, so I thought there must be something redeeming in this film to have attracted the likes of Spielberg, Hanks, Zeta-Jones, and Saldana... but apparently not.The movie is utterly uninteresting and poorly written. The situations are so contrived that it's nearly impossible to buy into any of the attempts to convey deeper meaning. It leaves plot threads dangling all over the place and the underlying messages are confused at best. And it's not funny at all.For a character-based film, it's shocking that none of the characters undergo any character evolution -- in the end everything is exactly the same as it was in the beginning, except that Hanks accomplishes his original goal. Whoop-ti-do. Under the tagline ""life is waiting"" you would expect more to come from the events within -- unexpected life changing events or deeply inspiring meaning. But you'd be wrong. There's none of that. If you try to get any deeper meaning out it, you've got to make it up yourself.I think the most annoying thing is that it COULD have been done properly without changing much. The actors were solid, and there was enough plot to work with. But instead they botched it at every redeemable chance. All in all, it is just pointless to watch.Signed, A Disappointed Film-Buff",The Terminal

I was moved by this story because I think that only if you ever were in a ""state of need"" you would resort to all the inner resources that make you a creative person. And so is the character of the movie. Viktor has everything against him : indifference, above all. Yet, his faith, his optimism, his commitment to a promise he had made, will surface the best of his qualities and make him a winner. His greatest victory is against indifference. His unwillingness to judge others is a sign of great maturity and spiritual depth. Viktor can be any of us, in a given difficult context. How would we react ? Screaming against injustice; taking out a gun and shooting; or accepting what we cannot change and actively trying an honest way out ? Spielberg and Hanks say the latter is the solution.

556,amalasaurusrex,The Terminal Film Review,7,21 August 2020,"Steven Spielberg's delicate comedy, The Terminal (2004) is a dramatic film that follows the story of Viktor Navorksi (Tom Hanks), an Eastern European tourist who lands at JFK airport and gets caught up in international politics.
When Viktor arrives at JFK in New York, a military coup d'état destroys his country and he finds himself caught up in international politics by being a ""crack"" in the system. Because of the coup, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), the director of customs and border patrol won't let him enter or exit the United States. During his temporary stay at JFK, he falls for a flight attendant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who may have feelings for him too, but he can't leave. While not a comedy by default, the elegance of the script creates humanity to any humour - dark or poetic.
Navorski is unlike anyone Dixon has ever encountered -- a man who is exactly who he seems and claims to be. With no hidden motives, he trusts, sometimes to the effect of winding up in comical situations. The immigration service, and indeed the American legal system, has no way of dealing with him because Viktor does not do, or fail to do, any of the things the system is set up to prevent him from doing, or not doing. He has slipped through a perfect logical loophole.
Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks convey cinematic skill as Viktor runs from television set to television set, in an attempt to see what is happening in his homeland, Krakozhia. As Hanks builds up Viktor's understanding of the situation, Spielberg draws in the severe and stern oppression of . This is effective because earlier in the film when Dixon was explaining to Navorski why he enter or exit the United States, Viktor was clueless as to what was happening and this scene makes it so that Viktor understands what is happening to Krakozhia.
The main conflict in the film is simple and effective. Cynical critics who do not see the movie for its lightheartedness may suggest that it is much too simplistic for a Spielberg movie considering his previous films such as Catch Me if You Can and Saving Private Ryan. Viktor Navorski and Frank Dixon do not like each other. Viktor's despise for Dixon develops over time as he notices the things Dixon is doing to try and get rid of him. Dixon on the other hand has disliked Navorski since the offset. The reason quite. Dixon wants to get rid of Navorski Dixon says ""sometimes you land a small fish. You unhook him very carefully. You place him back in the water. You set him free so that someone else can have the pleasure of catching him"". Eloquent in its dialogue and in its purpose, Spielberg massages the idea of how actively the blind eye is turned considering the events around the world.
This is only further highlighted where Viktor, being in no man's land still expresses a love for his country. Dixon attempts to make Viktor an asylum seeker by asking Viktor to be scared of the coup in his home country. Viktor turns around and says ""I am not afraid of Krakozhia. I am a little afraid of this room"". The irony here is just a snippet of the wit that Spielberg consistently weaves into the movie as comedy and tension ebb and flow in a remarkably cold green world structure.
Steven Spielberg travelled around the world to find an actual airport that would let him film for the length of the production, but could not find one. The Terminal set was built in a massive hangar at the LA/Palmdale Regional Airport. It was all built for the movie. Everything down to the last detail. That is rather impressive and makes you really appreciate the movie a lot more. The hangar, part of the U.S. Air Force Plant 42 complex was used to build the Rockwell International B-1B bomber. The set was built to full earthquake construction codes and was based on the Düsseldorf International Airport.
I would recommend The Terminal to all those that do not understand what it means to come from a country where people are not recognised. Examples include those looking to cross the border from Mexico, refugees from Syria and Venezuela. It paints a picture of what someone in Viktor's position would go through. I would recommend this movie to those that do not understand the displacement crises due to war and climate change for them to develop empathy for people all around the world who go through something like this.
This film made me consider how society is ill-equipped for something that can most definitely happen. This is a situation where a country had a military coup d'état and due to it, the revolutionised nation suspends travelling privileges in and out of its country. This is something that most people do not think of. It is a green world situation where everything just goes wrong for Viktor because of the selfishness of Frank Dixon. The idea of a revolution/coup d'état in a country when someone is not in that country or in another country at the time of it is perfectly plausible.
The Terminal is filled with other characters Navorski gets to know, such as Amelia the flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who is having an affair with a married man and finds she can open her heart to this strange, simple man. And Gupta the janitor (Kumar Pallanatucci), who leaves the floor wet and watches as passengers ignore the little yellow warning pyramids and slip and fall. ""This is the only fun I have,"" he says. And a food services employ (Diego Luna), who is in love with an INS official (Zoe Saldana) and uses Navorski as his go-between.
The film was well casted, starring Tom Hanks, Stanley Tucci, Catherine Zeta-Jones. But Steven Spielberg's casting of Tom Hanks was perfect. Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks are partners in crime when making movies like this. ""Catch me if you can"", ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Bridge of Spies"" were all movies done by both of them. All of which had above 90% in ratings. Needless to say that they both are remarkable at making movies.
While mostly well received, the movie does suffer from a diluting of the plot and muddled side stories. The side story of Enrique's love affair, while touching, is dispensable.
Furthermore, the resolution of the movie leaves many characters stuck in transit, not finding their own resolution. We do not know if Dixon did get promoted, nor the fate of Viktor's companions. The significance of jazz could have also been built in more sophisticatedly. Instead, when Viktor does meet the man he was looking for, the plot meanders out as opposed to leaving us wanting more.
While far less cuddly than expected, this unusual and elegant movie may fail to connect with some audiences, especially because the movie does not fit into the usual blockbuster hype that movie goers expect from Spielberg, but it proves that he is the most unpredictable director in Hollywood. No other director - actor combination understands empathy better than Spielberg and Hanks.",The Terminal

You have mixed 1000 languages, For example, Tom hanks is speaking at the guy with the ""pills"" in pure Bulgarian language, mixed with Russian accent, the other guy responds in Russian...total mess....If you want to make movie involving other nationalities, that Mr. Spielberg learn something about them or spent some money on language assistants!!! It's about money, isn't it?",The Terminal
566,davidmiklos,"Light-hearted, sometimes unreasonable, unrealistic, poorly acted except by Mr Hanks",3,25 March 2007,"'The Terminal' by Steven Spielberg is a rather cheap family movie with a dubious message. A man is caught in the midst of a changing political situation in his own country while arriving at JFK New York Airport and being left with no valid visa to enter the USA. For some strange reason he is shown the door to enter the International Lounge but not American soil. He is told to wait there and is willing to comply however long it may take. As you can expect passengers and crew come and go while the man with no country and almost no English accommodate himself to stay at the airport to the annoyance and amusement of the staff. He gets acquainted with some characters all quite out of ordinary. As the story unfolds, we learn that this unlucky delayed passenger has now lived at the airport for nine months and able to make a living there. We are also told that his only reason to come to New York is to get a signature from a jazz saxophonist to complete his father's treasured collection of such 57 autographs from other famous jazz musicians.And here's the message for you: if you are a man of principles, you will do this to honour a pledge to your late father then immediately return to your own country without causing too much trouble to the immigration authorities. At the time of too many suspicious immigrants and travellers this should be seen as a most welcome outcome. The other benefit is for Tom Hanks' fans only. He is quite outstanding in his part but stands really alone in terms of quality. The director sadly serves too many contradictory purposes and achieves nothing but a family movie easy to forget.",The Terminal

Many people are glad to see their friends again, many people say good-bye to their close people. John F. Kennedy International Airport is the one of the airport where we can see the dramatical movie.Viktor Navorski, a man from the of Krakozhia arrives at the airport and go to the gate to the entrance of America. But when he shows a past port, suddenly the officer let him to the room and says ""You cannot enter to here."" As his homeland's government lose their political power and the country has breakdown. Viktor cannot go back to Krakozhia but also he cannot enter America. He forces to stay this airport until the war calms down. He starts to stay all day (including night) in the airport which is very close to America, but very remote place at the same time. Few months later, the news inform that the war of Krakozhia is over. He expects to enter America, but he is not allowed. He can go back to his homeland, but he is not intend to do. He is saying ""I have a promise why I am staying here."" What is the promise? To keep his promise, he tries to enter America...This movie is a heart-warming movie. Viktor Navorski has hardship and his desire is dying. However he has very strong spirit and power to change the things to the better way. He makes friends and learning delight from this situation. And also this movie is romantic comedy! He falls in love with the woman who works as a flight attendant. Everything starts with despair, but he lives well at there. I can infer that he has a talent to adapt to any situation which occurs. His homeland, Krakozhia is not unreal country in this world but it is not an unrealistic movie I feel. It shows a touching movie to everyone. I like this movie very much.",The Terminal
570,rrodela92,"""So where are you headed?"" ""Home!""",9,12 October 2008,"Tom Hanks shines in this heartwarming, eye-opening film about the man who has fallen into the only crack in the U.S. customs department. Unable to return to a war-stricken Krakozhia and unable to enter the U.S. he is stuck in a never-ending no-man's land; a place where he doesn't feel welcome, doesn't feel wanted, and does not belong. A place he calls home, but we call the Terminal. This 2004 film, directed by Stephen Spielberg, stars Tom Hanks in the lead role as a Krakozhian immigrant grounded to the JFK airport, who has to learn to adapt to American culture without stepping foot on its soil. Tom Hanks accurately portrays a non-American traveler, and successfully places himself in the shoes of a lost immigrant. His lovable persona and barely understandable accent captivates the audience and has them willing to follow him to Krakozhia and back by the end of the film. His character befriends a motley crew of janitorial workers, and even catches the eye of a flight attendant played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. Together with his newfound friends, he discovers what it truly means to be an American and realizes that the home he had been searching for was just through the doors of gate 67. Viktor Navorski, played by Tom Hanks, isn't your average traveler. He can't speak, can't read, and can hardly navigate his way around a crowded airport food court. He shaves in the restrooms, parades around in a bathrobe, and feasts on saltine crackers doused in condiments. He is alone in a foreign country, hated by authority, and not trusted by the staff. The majority is indifferent towards him, ignoring his cries of anguish over confusion from the news, and not stopping to help him use the phone despite his pleas. He is unwanted, unwelcome, and unacceptable, but he is also ambitious. And through that ambition he finds friendship, happiness, and a little love on the side. Expert film critics Ryan ""the Rain Maker"" Rodela, and Justin ""Horse-whispering"" Holland each gave the movie two thumbs up along with a 4.5 star rating out of a possible 5. So whether you're waiting for a flight, or just sitting at home with nothing to do, the Terminal promises to take off, entertain, and land you with the perfect family film.",The Terminal

The Indian janitor steals the show with his performance - he has short, cutting jokes and an amazing gift for plate spinning. The evil character in the movie is very detestable, which makes everything work. Spielberg has come up with another great movie.

582,averydarkplace,"Spielberg, Hanks & Williams should have done better",4,29 June 2004,"When a project involves such giants as Spielberg and Hanks one would expect the best caliber from these two capable artists. What they've created instead is very average in many respects. The plot is forced and clumsy and the story doesn't wrap up in a satisfying way. This could have been a typical ""comedy of errors"" formula or a volley of wit vs. wit between Hanks' character and Stanley Tucci's. But there's only a hint of these traits. There's nothing inventive about the production, storytelling, or directing. Spielberg throws in the towel on this one. I don't believe Hanks as a doe-eyed lovable non-English-speaking punching bag who knows only enough English to be slightly funny. He's more creepy then lovable. There's nothing convincing in any of the relationships neither between Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones nor any secondary characters. The movie is more frustrating then anything. I don't believe that any normal human being caught in those situations would remain so meek for so long. And if anyone does then they deserve what they get. For me one of the biggest disappointment in this movie is John William's contribution. His decision to go small scale was good, but the music he wrote for this has no personality. If the creative team here were any other people I'd give this a 6 out of 10. But considering the quality of creators I give this a 4 out of 10.",The Terminal

How others and Victor played off each other was enjoyable to watch. However, the role played by Catherine Zeta Jones was not exceptional. For her to be in love with a married man when she can easily meet many others during her travels doesn't make sense. If the writers put more thought into her role, she would have had a great character to contrast Victors. As for Tom, some would argue that his Victor shows too much ingenuity while coping with being stuck in the airport terminal, but ask yourself, he somehow manages to go NYC from his Eastern European country and he is a skilled carpenter.

Sometimes a film is meant to entertain, and if we can find deeper meaning attached,so much the better.Do you suppose it was as simple as watching a polite man caught in an uncomfortable situation and seeing how he dealt with it? Manners are underused in this world. It was a touching film, and I and my spouse both enjoyed it. The actors did as they should do, they transformed themselves into the characters they portrayed.

Hanks should definitely be nominated for an Oscar. His accent in the movie and portrayal of the character was amazing. He was like a completely different person. Stanley Tucci was also great. His character wasn't exactly my favorite, but he played the part well. You might expect the movie to be boring because it takes place in one setting, but it is the exact opposite.

There is something admirable about the way he sees life. He isn't corrupted by America's insatiable greed.There were however a couple inconsistencies that made no sense. First, when Viktor helps the hispanic fellow meet the customs officer there needs to be a scene initiating a courtship prior to the marriage proposal. Second, the way Victor's flight was delayed at the end of the movie seemed unrealistic.I highly recommend ""The Terminal"". It's one of those movies that just makes you feel good and doesn't compromise your senses. Very little profanity (a few ""S"" words), no sex and no violence. Just maybe Hollywood is figuring out that you don't have to shock people to make a good movie.",The Terminal
589,saved4christ,Utterly engrossing,10,21 June 2004,"Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have done it again. These two individually can almost completely ensure the success of a movie, and together, they are simply spectacular. This movie is touching and funny in all the right places. It is a tribute to the craftsmanship involved in making this movie that Catherine Zeta-Jones has to take backseat, but her acting was delicately understated. There is no question that Tom Hanks is a fine actor, but he creates this character in such a believable way that the audience easily forgets that he is Tom Hanks, a face we all can recognize, and begins to see him as a foreign man. He gives us an intelligent and compassionate character that we can immediately sympathize with.In such a character-driven movie, the protagonist is almost as important as the antagonist, and Stanley Tucci in the role of Frank Dixon hardly slouches there. Though his motivation is clear from the beginning and he never strays from a normal human character, I found myself whispering curses at the screen whenever he showed up to make Victor's (Tom Hanks) life just a little more difficult. There are sweet moments, such as when the hard-nosed INS officer and the man who runs the food truck use Victor as a go-between in a blind love affair. There are heart-wrenching moments, like the very beginning when Victor sees news coverage all in English that tells of the war in his country and struggles to understand.

590,hillbroschemical,"Creatively done movie, with humor and a touch of humanity",9,22 June 2004,"'The Terminal' is a creative movie, providing the viewer with laughter, hope and a sense of humanity that is in all of us. With all the harsh, crass and fatalistic movies coming out of Hollywood these days this movie was light, uplifting and really funny. While it was not truly idealistic, it was based on true events that happened to someone at another time, in another country and in another airport. But really, unless movies are based on true human events or history, many of our movies are quite fictitious and leave a lot to be desired with regard to the story's plot and objective. In fact, Hollywood has been definitely gravitating towards the mighty, powerful special effects story lines and has loss the touch of human individuality the how people can reach out and connect with one another. A movie does not need to be totally realistic in order to convey this and 'The Terminal' does an excellent job of uplifting the heart and giving us pause to laugh and have hope.As usual Tom Hanks does an outstanding job, taking on a role that is challenging and then mastering it. Some reviews have considered the movie without any redemptive qualities and not worth watching. Unfortunately, this is totally wrong and I trust that movie goers will see this is a film well worth watching.",The Terminal

592,harrismh-1,Exhibits the heart and spirit of a smart independent film.,10,23 June 2004,"SPOILER***********SPOILER**************SPOILERTerminal is the story of a son's pledge to his father. Victor Navorski [Tom Hanks] deplanes at Kennedy Airport from his Eastern European home of Krakozia with a suitcase and a Planters Peanut can. He finds that---while in transit---his government has been overthrown and his passport is invalid.Officer Frank Dixon [Stanley Tucci] explains to Victor that he's only temporarily trapped in US Immigration hell. Frank gives Victor a fist full of food vouchers, a pager so he can be reached, and turns him loose in the airport 'transit lounge', a giant shopping center with a food court. A man without a country, Victor speaks no English, has no money or friends, and doesn't understand the 'system'; but he's far from stupid. Hours pass into days and weeks, and Victor sets up housekeeping at Gate 67, an unused part of the terminal under renovation. He sets about learning English, gets a job and creates a support group---always keeping an eye on the Planters Peanut can. Victor befriends an emotionally vulnerable stewardess [Catherine Zeta-Jones] and an airport romance blooms. Can Victor outlast the system, see the Big Apple and make his Dad's dream come true?Terminal is innovative, engaging, entertaining and has a highly unlikely storyline for a mass marketed film. This movie---playing to large audiences---is a joy to watch and exhibits the heart and spirit of a smart independent film dressed in Hollywood clothing. I say this even after being put on notice by a friend regarding minor technical inconsistencies. These can be overlooked if you're willing to believe an immigrant can live in Kennedy Airport. Two features make this movie sparkle and a joy to watch. First is Victor Navorski, a guy you've just got to love, who exhibits the immigrant motivation, ingenuity and desire that make our country great. Second is the supporting cast. Immigration Officer Dixon [Tucci] is a work-a-day guy just trying to stay out of trouble long enough to inherit his boss' job; he sees Victor as a threat. Zeta-Jones [as Amelia] constrains her star power and instead creates a superb cameo role as a stewardess with a cover girl persona and shattered romantic relationships; Victor is a soft shoulder. Kumar Pallanatucci [Gupta the lounge janitor] is a paranoid immigrant who sees CIA agents in the shadows and only talks to strangers after they make an appointment. Chi McBride [from TV's Boston Public] is a baggage handler who knows how to enjoy his work. Terminal is another Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg collaboration and looks to be as good as their earlier efforts; remember Catch Me If You Can [2002] and Saving Private Ryan [1998]. The story is cleverly cast as a comedy, not as a tragedy; and, the supporting characters are incredibly real and enduring. The film runs just a little over two hours, more than enough time for the plot to evolve.",The Terminal
593,diabloguy24,Tacky,6,23 July 2004,"*Spoilers*Okay I had to write an essay on this film and here it is:The Terminal: a film with a compelling title, a compelling story, and a compelling cast. In my preview journal, I have set high anticipations for the film and my movie-going experience. But is the movie truly worth the hype? The Terminal, although a decent feel-good comedy/drama, suffers because of script and acting errors, coupled with a loss of focus and a ludicrous finish. The Terminal is a recent comedy/drama directed by Steven Spielberg. The film stars Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorski, and Catherine Zeta-Jones as Amelia.To abridge the plot, Viktor Navorski arrives in New York from the fictitious republic of Krakozhia, only to be detained from entering the States because of a political coup inside of his country. Navorski cannot enter New York, and neither can he go back. He is forced to stay at the airport's international terminal. During his 9-month stay at the terminal, Viktor learns English,makes friends, falls in love, and makes trouble for Frank Dixon, the airport' s evil security and immigration officer (played by Stanley Lucci). The film is 2:09 in duration, has many sub-plots and frequently goes off on a tangent. In basis, the movie attempts to convey a foreigner's unfamiliarity and him accustoming with a new life.The Terminal in spirit is a heart-warming feel-good drama. Despite frequent clichés and tacky romance, the film establishes this spirit for three fourths of its duration. However, the plot suffers from many obvious holes and mistakes. At the time Viktor Navorski arrives at the airport (which is a vast multi-million dollar set erected exclusively for this cinema) and is denied clearance, he is allowed to reside within the terminal complex. As message boards point out, by law he would have to be detained in a prison (which would not make for a very good story).The movie theatre itself and my fellow viewers were a practical microcosm to help me build my opinions of The Terminal. The audience seemed to notice when something in the film was in disarray, and laughed at the humorous moments. Indeed, many parts in this film were comical, helping to provide a light aura to the plot. The acting of this picture is decent, though Hanks plays much too enthusiastically. He obtains the role of an Eastern European man and twists him into a juvenile buffoon. Hanks' voicing in particularly outlandish: he tries for a thick, Slavic accent, but ends up speaking in Bulgarian for the entirety of the film. One side-plot is particularly comical: a Russian traveler purchases medicine in America in order to cure his father back home, then is asked to withhold these medicines. The Russian threatens to commit suicide, and Navorski is brought in as a translator. The evil terminal czar Frank announces that '[The Russian] lives across from Krakozhia's border, and may converse in a different dialect.' As anticipated, the Russian man and Viktor comprehend each other beautifully. After an explanation that these pills are for a goat, the Russian man is set free to take a plane back home. As a show of Hollywood ignorance and simplicity, this could be deemed the worst episode in the film, and one may suppose it could have been a lot more elementary for Hanks to speak in Russian. If The Terminal tells an intriguing story leading up the climax, then the story's conclusion spells death for a potentially high-quality production. Many plot-loops are amiss in the film's conclusion. Viktor's love interest Amelia Warren regresses yet again to her boyfriend, murdering half the plot and tarnishing a happy ending. The Indian airport janitor Gupta (played by Kumar Pallana) makes an unexplained sacrifice for Navorski. Gupta delays Navorski's plane back to Krakozhia by running out onto the tarmac and stopping the arriving airplane with his mop. Gupta is then held at gunpoint by a SWAT team, and taken back to India, where he will wither away in jail for seven years, as a result of attacking a policeman years ago. The story, naturally, does not make any note of this. All too late in the movie, the audience learns Viktor's absurd motive for coming to America in the first place: to receive a signature from a jazz player (who has evidently played at the same hotel in New York for 9 months). The conclusion of The Terminal breaks apart desperately. Overall, I had much higher standards and expectations about this movie, due to its cast and the director's reputation. I am not necessarily in favor of films that portray reality unerringly, however the plot holes were both significant and palpable in The Terminal. Meanwhile I enjoyed the film, better execution and a more realistic script would have cured the movie of its blemishes.",The Terminal
594,tnZot,A wonderful film,10,10 August 2004,"My wife and I feel that this is a marvelous film with the potential to become a classic. Tom Hanks is, as always, superb with an outstanding supporting cast. He is certainly the premier cinema actor of these times. The script portrayed every type of character that we could possibly encounter in any situation dealing with bureaucracy. Besides the person Hanks played there are all of the prototypes which we seem to envision in our daily lives. My favorite was the chief of US Immigration at JFK. We have all encountered someone like him more than once. It a great story which was beautifully filmed, wonderfully produced and overall a winner. I would recommend 'The Terminal' to anyone. Good clean fun with plenty of laughs thrown in as a bonus.",The Terminal
595,morohoshi,"SPOILER some spoilage, Listen to Roshnir",10,4 August 2004,"It is great to be company with two other perceptive viewers of movies, roshnir and i-love- tom-hanks. I also agree that there is a political statement being made about the red tape in the U.S. and Homeland paranoia. One can see with the scene where a fellow Eastern European was caught bringing in prescriptions to the U.S. for his father. He was bringing it from Canada and the scene is about the exorbitant and ridiculous cost of prescription meds, here in the U.S. and the satire of the pharmaceutical companies and the role of the government and restrictions imposed upon the consumer in dire need of the meds. Here, he is let go if it is for his goat, then it is admissible. All these rules and regulations which dictates the U.S. law and government comes into play. Furthermore, in the beginning of the movie, Commissioner Dixon tries to figure out all these regulations and codes to bypass his problem and to get Viktor (Tom Hanks) out of his hair, bald though he is, not to criticize Tucci. Another tidbit is in the very beginning of the movie. It is ironic that the we are asked by passing through security we are always asked, ""Are you here for business or pleasure."" There are a couple of shots showing this ridiculous question. We are like in a processing line, like robots giving our standard cookie cutter response from a cookie cutter question. I always think about the California cheese TV commercial. The security person asks us, ""What is your reason for visiting California?"" Everyone is different but they all say ""the cheese."" When this unfortunate fellow says something else rather than cheese, he is whisked away. Funny but that says something about our government. To get to the point, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. And come on, do we always have to have the cookie cutter ending where the guy always gets the gal. What made Casablanca great? As roshnir says:""subtlety"" of this movie is very skillfully done and I'm glad Spielberg took on this film and know why. It is not a stretch for the imagination, such contrivances are based on a true incident Gazzo2! For the story to be believable, it would take 9 months to birth the relationships that Viktor (Tom Hanks) has with all the employees at JFK. And the little Indian guys does stop an airplane not just spinning plates. Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) falls for Viktor on meeting him in happenstance initially and other occasions that builds up to their relationship which does take TIME. It is conceivable that a country would take months to get its affairs in order. If you look a little deeper you would be engaging your mind rather than going on autopilot. The tagline is: ""Life is waiting."" If you took the time to look between the lines, you probably would have got a better perspective of the movie. The cuteness of the Tom Hanks is played to a tee and he fit this role perfectly. This is not meant to be an action packed movie. Maybe that is why the zzzzzzz's. Look for a pleasant surprise about life and its twists and turns. Take the TIME to see this movie.",The Terminal
596,bridieelsonuk,Awful film,1,28 February 2005,"This film, with no exception is the worse film I have ever seen (And I've seen a lot) from start to finish it was sugar coated, I felt no compassion at all for Tom Hank's character and couldn't wait for the end. To spend the whole film in the Terminal added to the boredom of the film, perhaps it could have had flash backs or something, Anything!!!!!Katherine Zita Jones, (In fairness) wasn't as bad as she usually is, but that could have been because the film itself was so bad made her look OK! Tom Hanks, whilst acting his socks off, as he usually does, really didn't come good this time, and I'd recommend giving this stupid film, a wide birth!",The Terminal
597,Inkadm,one-man drama,8,6 October 2004,"A light presentation of one-man struggle with bureaucracy and prejudice against foreigners. Sadly, Viktor Navorski, a man, who planned only a short term visit in New York city, is stuck at the airport, because of unfortunate events in his country and the American officials' inability to deal with this unexpected situation. The story shows how one man, against all odds, manages to provide for himself and his needs using only his own wits. Although not popular with the officials, he's friendly character earns him friends among other ordinary people. Although set in the US this drama could have take place anywhere in the world, where foreigners (especially eastern-Europeans) are still considered second-class citizens.",The Terminal
598,adriankok,Great Story,7,9 October 2004,"The Terminal is an unlikely story of a traveler who is stranded in New York's JFK airport because his country's (a fictitious Eastern European nation) government has just been overthrown, and the immigration officials refuse to admit or deport him. He is stuck in the transit lounge, and must survive as best he can.The story has a familiar ring to it: the protagonist is stranded by unfortunate circumstances, but by his ingenuity, he survives and even prospers in the face of opposition. What's new is the setting - how Spielberg turns the modern international transit lounge (a comfortable place nowadays - shops, restaurants, amenities) into a cold forbidding place populated with strangers.Tom Hanks plays the role of a foreign visitor who has to rely on his wits at first, but in the end he prospers because his honest nature has won the trust and friendship of the airport workers. He even catches the eye of an air stewardess (Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is simply luminous!) while struggling with the bureaucrats running the airport who conspire to deny him his chance to get out.The film does require that the viewer suspends his sense of reality for a while - in one scene, Hank's character gets a job as a building worker in the airport after a painting a wall in a single night with such skill that he impresses the foreman. And he learns a new language by comparing the foreign language version of Fodor's travel guide to the English version.Happily, I must say that these imperfections do not detract from the spirit of the movie, and can heartily commend it to those who are looking for a well-scripted story with an excellent cast. Seven stars.",The Terminal
599,jms_grhaccess,"Comical yet unclear at times, never the less great.",8,15 February 2013,"In The Terminal, Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) arrives at JFK International Airport only to find out that during the flight from his homeland, a coup over threw the current government spinning the country of Krakhosia into an indefinite war. Upon landing in the Big Apple, the limited English speaking Navorski is shuffled through the intimidating customs network only to be denied entry to the United States; which does not recognize Krakhosian passports in lieu of the political upheaval taking place. Unable to enter America and unable to go back home, Tom Hanks portrays a man stuck in the airport with no country to wait for something to happen in The Terminal. Considering the tight constraints on setting, director Steven Spielberg holds onlookers in their seats waiting for the next laugh in a comedy which at times has an unclear direction on where the plot is going.Tom Hanks pulls off a convincing accent while playing the innocent immigrant who only has one purpose of being in America which has to do with the peanut can he carries with him. This purpose is discovered by a love interest and flight attendant, Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who otherwise plays a seemingly unnecessary role which ends without closure. Other supporting roles include a group of airport employees, whom one of them finds enjoyment at watching travelers fall on the newly washed concourse floor. Tom Hanks is without a doubt the spearhead of the movie as he pulls off yet another great act while the less familiar supporting actors contribute to the overall success of the film.The actors were well directed in the roles which they were portraying. Spielberg does a great job of molding what would seem to be a limited script into a movie worth seeing. Who would have thought that a movie taking place solely within an airport could have been as creatively made? However, it cannot be ignored that at times there seemed to be some jumps made throughout the plot.The majority of the plot consists of the comical interactions of Navorski and the airport employees. At first the employees are skeptical of Navorski however they come to build a strong relationship with the man who lives at Gate 67 after he helps save a fellow immigrant from the grasps of the head of airport security. In addition, there appears to be another storyline between Navorski and Warren which makes it unclear as to which storyline is most important and how they fit together. These dueling story lines at times leaves the viewer confused as to the significance of what just played out in front of them.Despite the awkward cohesion of story lines, Spielberg saves the at times seemingly terminal film through his direction. The Terminal manages to bring the audience into the concourses of JFK International Airport and provide them with good humor and a heartfelt story through the comical acting of a great cast.",The Terminal
600,MovieGuruClub,How far would you go for a................Promise!!!,5,31 March 2005,"I was very disappointed with Steven Spielberg, the way he has managed to present it and even with very high star cast the all over movie was simply nothing.The concept of keeping a long kept promise for the father was good but seemed very unrealistic. The actions and the story line which followed in the movie wasn't that compelling. The series of incidents seemed very artificial.Tom Hanks came out as a shiner with his amazing performance like always but I never felt involved in the movie like it should happen. They could have done more with the great cast. In the Nutshell, it was a movie for the sake of making a movie.I would not recommend it if you are looking for any excitement.",The Terminal

It was a fairly simple plot, but at the same time...very ""in depth"" if you get my drift. Oh yea, and Tom Hanks rocks the Krackovian (or w/e it is) accent.I also love all of Viktors friends especially Eugine Cruz and GUPTA!!! And some of the lines...oh wow, even for a foreigner, Viktor really knows his humor. And I really like the marriage between Eugine and the African-American lady...that was really sweet. The reason I gave the movie a 9 and not a 10 was the constant appearance of Catherine Zeta-Jones. She was good in Ocean's 12, but in this film, I hated her, she really portrayed a slut in some ways. But I really liked the happy ending, the last signature, and everything! Excellent movie!!!",The Terminal
602,friveraz,What a waste,4,9 January 2005,"I was ready for a light, cheesy movie; but The Terminal ended up being a total head-scratcher. How can such a stupid plot be made into a high budget movie? The premise itself is ridiculous, and requires a fourth grader's grasp of international relations to accept. Since when does a coup attempt, or a civil war make a country ""non-existant"".Hanks as Navorski comes across more as a moron than someone who simply doesn't speak English. The love story between Hanks and Zeta-Jones is saved from being a complete cheese-fest at the end by the half-unexpected ""twist"". The love interest's demise was necessary to bring some semblance of seriousness to the movie after the silly marriage between two secondary characters.",The Terminal

And I happen to be a Kafka fan, so I've read a little bit about unchecked mindless bureaucracies, and when properly portrayed they're as funny as they are scary; The Terminal was neither.It seemed that the whole airport staff was totally ignorant. Several people kept talking to him in English, even acknowledging that they knew that he couldn't understand what they were saying. They also acknowledged that they needed an interpreter, and even though he was showing them his translation dictionary, and they acknowledged that he had a translation dictionary, no one tried to use it to help the situation.It might have been used as a joke if somebody had suggested that the Stanley Tucci character was an ignoramus, and had him demoted or if someone had filed a lawsuit, or otherwise pointed out the incompetence.But alas I couldn't wait that long. I don't know whether I'm proud or embarrassed that I was able to survive watching 30 min of this totally ridiculous / aggravating / silly waste of time of a movie.I can't believe that Tom Hanks did this movie; I can't believe that it ever got made at all.

They're all there, and quite obvious. Way too obvious. No, this is not a cynical review, it's a disappointed one. The movie's tempo is meandering, the characters are all two-dimensional and clichéd (including Hanks'). There is no satisfying denouement or crescendo -- it's almost a mood piece. While we like Hanks well enough, he comes across as almost a simpleton. His legal limbo and the tension and plot development it brings strains credulity and leaves so many questions unanswered, the work goes from fiction to cartoon.This film in the hands of these artists could have been genius, I'm sure.

Lets see, the first we ever see of our main character we notice that he speaks no English, and when told to go out into the international area, rejected without any access to an lawyer, let alone anyone who speaks his language(which any moron would recognize as at the very least eastern European). I mean come on, first 5 minutes of the movie he has become a non-person who lives in an airport. Now I know it is fiction but come on, even illegal aliens have a right to legal advice when entering the US. not wanting to give away much more of the ever worsening story, why the hell is there a love story? what does his crush have to do with anything in the story what so ever, nothing, it advances the plot none, and just acts as a pain extender to lengthen the movie to make it at least worth the film it was projected from. All in all, EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with this movie, and although I usually enjoy Tom Hanks, WHY WOULD HE DERADE HIMSELF TO THIS FILTH!!!!

He has done everything for others around him. If there is a great example of ""egoless"", he is one. Letting go ego, is the greatness that even Amelia found out when she gives up and scarifies something most important in her life to help Navorski.

I never would have guessed with his instincts he would produce such a frustratingly ham-fisted clichéd film. Being beat over the head with the pretext of the film is not my idea of entertainment. The immigration authorities finally figure out after way too long that the gentleman played by Tom Hanks doesn't understand English. Yet they continue to lecture him in English about immigration law. Huh? I don't get it. The film continues along the same vein. There isn't a sole in the airport that can see he needs some help and doesn't speak the language. Not realistic and plain dumb.

Here is a man willing to live in an airport terminal for an undetermined length or time just to fulfill a promise! Enduring almost-persecution and low-level harassment yet still able to find good things and productive ways to spend his time while he waits.The supporting actors were just as awesome.

So all he can do now is wait and hang around the airport.This could have resulted in an interesting movie but it's totally ruined by a number of things:-The cliché image of everybody coming from Eastern Europe being dumb and clumsy-Tom Hanks delivering one the worst fake accents in Hollywood history (do you know the video game ""Red Alert""? Well, worse then that)-This is Hollywood so it needs a Romance and a Villain, but neither of them works. I mean, would someone looking like Catherine Zeta Jones really fall for a guy who speaks like that dresses like your math teacher? There is absolutely no chemistry between those two. And this guy Dixon, does he have nothing better to do then bully this poor man?This movie has just too many stereotype characters and movie clichés along with a very VERY unlikely plot which is also full of holes.

I found it to be light-hearted fun along with another Spielberg film that had a similar tone (Catch Me if You Can). Of course, Hanks is masterful, Zeta-Jones is beautiful and Tucci is incredible in his role as a customs agent. I think most viewers will like or liked the cat and mouse banter between Hanks and Tucci's characters. It reminded me a little of how Forrest Gump kept beating the odds stacked against him.Unfortnately, half way through this film you begin to look at your watch. I kept thinking enough is enough. Please just get to the point. It is far too long for a film of this type and the payoff at the end did not justify the lengthiness of this film. I was hoping for an ending with more substance. It doesn't follow formula when it comes to the quasi-relationship between Zeta-Jones and Hanks which is refreshing, but at the end of the film I felt like saying, ""Okay, what was this whole exercise for?""

611,neerajmc,A movie with a message,10,4 February 2005,"This was one wonderful movie and deserves a lot of introspection. It brings out several subtle but powerful messages throughout its course..The ""Terminal"" that Navorski is stuck in symbolizes the world we live in and the time he spends there symbolizes Life itself.The movie's strongest message is that ""Life itself is one long wait amidst its various activities and experiences"" and hence ""Patience is the virtue of life"".Most of us have faced situations where life has reached a dead-end and we feel entangled in the web of problems and miseries of life. This is symbolized by Navorski's predicament at the Terminal. Frustration is not an answer, nor is running away or ""escaping"" it. The solution is to accept the Reality of the situation and adapt our life accordingly by handling all of life's problems with a sense of duty, by putting in our best efforts and leaving the rest to take its own course. Navorski does exactly this during his stint at the ""Terminal"".Another important message he brings out is that Humanity and Love are the basis of all life and all of our actions need to be based on these principles.Navorski shows this in ample measure by his compassion for fellow human beings and in the end is ready to sacrifice his goal and his wishes for the well-being of his friends.In short, Navorski exemplifies an ideal human being.",The Terminal

However, I did promise myself that I would watch the film when it came on DVD because of hanks and Spielberg's contribution. I loved the ""Terminal""; in fact it's probably the only film I've watched twice in the same evening. Based on the true story of the Iranian transient in 1988 ""who's still there and was offered 1/4 million dollars by Spielberg- at Charles DE Gaulle airport"" this film is set at JFK. What I like about the film was that it revolved around relationships with people working at airport rather than lots of small solo stories or stories with other transients like that in ""Castaway"". Hanks needs others to find that sweet innocence inside him that makes people love him although not necessarily want to make love too him.""will explain later"" Much of the narrative and directing is excellent / masterful but in places it borders on the ridiculous. It's as if two directors were making the same film. Egg the slapstick scene of hanks trying to sleep on the chairs did not work for me. Perhaps the most intriguing element was the casting of Catherine Zeta Jones. At first I thought that their was no sexual chemistry between the two but then I realised that she had been cast for that precise reason. The two connect on a spiritual level but not on a sexual level. And this is key to the ending of the film. So it was not hanks but CZJ grey haired lover who you envied.IE the man who gives her ""great sex"" and then leaves her. I feel it is the ending that spooled the film for me. I would have like to have seen some twist regardless of how unrealistic that would make the two transcend the spiritual relationship.""the clinch and night they spend together doesn't count"" An alternative ending could have been that Victor becomes a celebrity for staying at the airport has TV companies endorsements and is offered a vast amount of money from a movie company to make his biopic.

She understood how clever Victor (Hank character) had become, once he was approached by the acting Airport Commissioner, and how he was even more empowered when he began to grasp the Englsih language. Another reason it was great is that we got to see the commitment Victor had to his dead father. How many of us wouldn't have bolted for the door.

Much as Tom Hanks does an admirable job, it just irritates me to see Americans put on a generic ""foreign"" accent and walk funny, act funny, and just generally play an irritating twit and think that's what it means to be 'foreign'. It might go down well with the troops in Alabama, but in the rest of the world it's just offensive and to me it goes to the root of why America has a serious image problem in the world today. Where is it written that if you are from ""Krakosia"" that you immediately take on some kind of a strange, ""old man"" gait like Hanks does in the film. Does he have hemorrhoids? Is he knocked-kneed? And whether it's Spielberg or the writers who are responsible, the 'Commissioner' in this film is like a cartoon character. How or why could he possibly HATE Viktor so much? Not to mention all the secondary characters are like characters from Children's movies. There were moments (such as when Gupta, the Indian Janitor is telling Viktor's heroic tale) when I felt like I was watching the Goonies or ET again. I enjoyed this film, but I probably will go check out the French version now, just because it is -irritating- when big American studios cast big American actors to play a very small, foreign character. For a foreigner, in this film Hanks' character has a remarkably American sense of humor. Once again Spielberg falls just short of biting satire and descends into sentimental tripe.",The Terminal
621,markcp55,Hanks accent....,7,16 April 2006,"Overall I thought the movie was very enjoyable, but I couldn't quite decide which accent Hanks wanted to use. If you listen closely, you can notice that his accent is different from scene to scene and at times it made it difficult to follow what he was saying. I watched the movie on TV, maybe the sound was better at the theater. Did anyone else notice this who saw the movie or was it just my ears playing tricks on me, well I am getting up there in the ages, perhaps it is time for me to think about a hearing aid. I thought the plot was a little lacking, was it a love story or was it about immigration? I thought that the ending could have been better - like Hanks ends up the stewardess, but that is a typical Hanks movie ending. They never really end the way you want them too. I think I have blabbed on now for the 10 lines of text minimum rule. :)",The Terminal
622,marinova,A real Eastern European,10,26 April 2005,"It was a pleasant surprise for me  Tom Hanks speaking in my native Bulgarian language (and it is not Russian). His performance was outstanding, I could have sworn he was a relative to my father-in-law  gestures, posture, skills, desire to do the right thing and a heart of gold.This gentle comedy portrays Eastern Europeans in a much more sympathetic and realistic way than everything else I've seen in the West, and shows the West in ways that many migrants have experienced. It is entertaining and charmingly stupid at places, as real life. It also has this warm feel of optimism, simplicity and satisfaction that our consumerist society has almost made extinct.Thanks to Spillberg for this beautiful movie which made my day.",The Terminal
623,geesteele,Argh!,3,11 May 2005,This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Stupid story lines and dialogue and acting so cringe-worthy that I had to fast-forward a lot of the film. What a shame as it's a interesting idea but handled really badly. I look forward to the Hanks and Spielberg combination normally as at least you know you'll be entertained. But not this time. And Catherine Zeta-Jones...possibly the least sympathetic role she's ever played. I'm not sure that was all down to the character as well. The one highlight of this film and unfortunately he is not in every seen is the runaway Indian man who works in the terminal as a cleaner. I don't know who the actor was but his part in this saved me form ejecting the video altogether.,The Terminal

626,kaukabazhar,Splendid Hanks makes it a memorable film,9,25 March 2018,"Any one who has spent some time on airport can find a number of relatable characters and incidents in the movie. One of the finest performance by Tom Hanks. He is the real star of the film. My rating 9 is solely based on how Hanks has managed to single-handedly engaged the audience throughout. Some other side characters have put in a commendable performance. There are moments in the movie that makes it a memorable watch. The romantic element in the movie spoils the fun, for me. Unrealistic ending makes it look like a Bollywood masala movie (which has a lot of emotion without making much (or any) sense). Despite of that I consider it to be a must-watch. It can still do a lot of business in flights and airports as the emotional state of the audience would be much more active. Hanks, alone, deserve a 10 star rating.",The Terminal
627,rabia-s-sheikh,Hats off to Tom Hanks!,8,30 May 2005,"Just when you think you've seen Tom Hanks at his best, he gives another sensational performance and surprises you! This movie proves that he is a versatile and truly entertaining performer. The way he mastered the accent was fantastic! The other characters only added to the charm and humor of the movie. I absolutely loved the character of Gupta. Also, the romance between the food delivery guy and the immigration lady was real sweet. The movie unravels in a most interesting manner, which also proves to be highly engrossing. I was amazed by how the story didn't become monotonous after a while, and remained very, VERY enjoyable.Good stuff!",The Terminal
628,brian_hosey,absolutely horrendous,1,9 November 2005,"There was nothing really in the video store, so we thought we'd get the Terminal since it was about the only somewhat new release that was in.I really wish I had my money back and the 25 minutes that I invested into this film. Yes, I really only made it 25 minutes into the movie until I practically ran to the DVD player to eject it.There was not one thing funny or even remotely entertaining within the first 25 minutes. It was so ridiculous to watch supposed airport personnel continue to have lengthy and in depth conversations with someone that doesn't even understand English.

629,bjare-229-241478,"This movie is about a guy that loses his country and then get stuck in-between the U.S and ""nothing"". Therefore he has to stay a long period in a airport.",9,3 September 2015,"When Viktor (Tom Hanks) is traveling to the U.S to fulfill a dream his father had before he died. Viktors country got in a war and by that Viktor's passport isn't legit anymore. In this movie the airport doesn't have any way to help him. He cant go home to his country because it technically ""doesn't exist"" and he cant go to the U.S because his passport isn't legit. So then, the boss at the airport decides to let him stay there until further investigation. The movie is about a man who is really nice to everyone. And at the end his way to live gives us a good movie with a heartbreaking story. It is a drama-comedy though, so there is also many funny and weird moments. I first watched this movie as a child, at the time I didn't understand the story at all. The same year I was watching movies without any plot, so this movie was something else at the time. Now when I am older, this movie easily got to my top list of movies. It is maybe one of the ten best movies I have watched.This is a must watch movie. There was something about this movie, even though I didn't understand it at first. I did see something that brought me back years later to watch it as an adult. Also this movie has gotten a lot of good critics all over the world. Just a week ago this movie was aired on a TV-channel here in Norway. 11 years after its release.""The Terminal"" is really a movie to watch. If it isn't on your ""to watch list"" or ""have watched list"" then add it in! You wont regret it.",The Terminal
630,alyth,Good old fashioned film-making,9,13 July 2005,"I watched this film for the second time last night, as I recently saw Spielberg's latest, War of the Worlds, and was in a Spielberg mood! What I like about the Terminal is that it, for me, has a lot of similarities to the old Billy Wilder films such as The Apartment and Irma La Douce, in that love/romance springs up in the most unlikely of places or situations. It is great to see modern filmmakers returning to the roots of film-making in this way! There are plenty of humorous elements in this, and the characters are interesting and the storytelling rich. Tom Hanks plays Viktors character very convincingly, and the three friends he meets in the terminal are convincingly portrayed. Nice one!",The Terminal

Actors performance does not worth to mention, Hanks accent was the best part of it... but you don't need to make a movie for that...*****SPOILER***** Many junk scene - like when the workers at the terminal clap their hands for Hanks making a big applause. When the good old Indian guy stops the airplane, when the SWAT(or what) aims their gun at him. *****SPOILER*****Many many scenes made me to cry out (not) in (physical) pain.So all in all this is a JUNK MOVIEbut i still like Hanks and Spielberg...",The Terminal

634,markalbright53,Enjoyable film yet something was missing,6,27 July 2005,"I found the movie to be enjoyable, yet there were a number of misses that could have elevated the film to greatness.First, nothing came of the relationship between Hank's character and Jones'. Second, it seemed Tucchi's character kept vacillating between liking him and dismissing him. Third, the ending was not good. Everything for just an autograph? How about something else like someone who saved his father's life during a war or someone who wronged his father or someone who was his own father. I mean of all the emotional surprises, this had to be at the bottom.Nevertheless, the film was good.",The Terminal

636,srishti-59983,The movie is about a man who upon arriving in the United States becomes stateless because his nation has fallen in a coup.,9,14 August 2016,"The idea of filming an entire film at an airport, the simplicity of the protagonist superbly played by Tom Hanks and the brilliant direction by Steven Spielberg makes The Terminal one of the finest movies made so far. The Terminal is a lightweight movie. It doesn't get into any deep discussion on the human condition but it still manages to show how love can break the barriers of language and regionalism to bond people so strongly. The cast is great and all of them have delivered commendable performances. The writing offers enough laughter and some touching moments. One negative aspect of the film is the littering of product advertisements in nearly every scene. To sum up, Spielberg, his actors and writers have woven the movie into a crowd-pleasing and entertaining film about humanity and heart, that creates sympathy for all its characters through its entire flow and leaves the viewer unreasonably happy at the end. I will rate this movie 9/10 and will highly recommend it to those who haven't watched it yet.",The Terminal

The European accent and histrionic of Tom Hanks are simply fantastic. Steven Spielberg narrated it the way where you wouldn't get bored or anything. I still can't figure out why people wrote bad reviews about it. I agree that the movie gets a little unrealistic in climax and certain situations, but that wouldn't matter because there are Scifi movies like alien and other fantasy movies and they are all unrealistic.

Terminal had a simple message, Fight problems, love each other. Perhaps this movie has a simple story that you can predict the whole story but Tom Hanks shows us how his act and his accent makes Terminal a VALUABLE movie that you don't regret for your time and money spent. This movie shows you loving each other doesn't need any Language. You just need to show your feeling, the others will understand that. It doesn't matter what nationality or race you are, when one is in trouble, we had to help. Helping others is helping ourselves. Steven Spielberg shows us another masterpiece with simple story.",The Terminal

Like the majority of Steven Spielberg movies, this movie attracts who is watching it since the beginning, with an excellent performance of Tom Hanks as always.
A must see film for all Spielberg fans for sure!
Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) will pass almost a year in the airport, get a job, will fall in love for a woman that works in a Airline Company, build his own room, show his work skills and get a new family in the airport, basically, he gained a new family there.

Though the performance by Kevin Ryder was not up to class mark it is well made up by Holly Traister whose portrayal of her role balances the evil in the world. Due to some brilliant make up by Zoltan Elek and Thomas Real this movie becomes as good as a good make out. Greg Loskorn has lived up to his expectations once again and so has Toby Newell in all the perfect movie ever and the most scintillating movie made in the 2nd and 3rd millennium.

644,jsong13,heart touching on immigrants' point of view,8,12 January 2006,"This is a very nice piece of work by Steven Spielberg. I thought of this movie as being based on a true story of a man trapped at an airport for 2 years as i was watching the film. As an once non-English speaking immigrant who stepped into the foreign airport myself, I found the story very compelling and touching. Tom Hank's actions were terrific, although if there were some drawbacks it was hard to figure out a relative time frame, when and how long things have been happening for in the film.I actually found the catch phrase ""Do you have an appointment"" quite funny, it would've been strange for non-English speaking non-migrants as the whole movie may not make sense. But everyones been to airports, and facing language barrier is one of the biggest discomforts. Waiting at a airport even for an hour or two seems terrible, but if that goes on for months even years what would it be like? The movie has answered that, as well as giving me an insight into Mr Navoski's airport life very well. Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor.",The Terminal

I really loved the way ""our man"" saved the poor man's father, but I did not figure how the Russian understood the idea, may be he actually spoke a bit English and understood the story of ""our man"".Anyway, I really enjoyed the movie.

647,airscrew,The Terminal,10,19 February 2006,"First, I want to apologize for my bad English. So don't criticize me or disturb yourself by my English. I thank you very much. The reason that I write this comment, although my English isn't perfect, is the fact that ""The Terminal"" is really one of the best movies that there is.The movie begins in the Terminal, when Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) got picked up by the security. The reason is the fact that his country, Krakozhia, is in the progress of a revolution. This makes the passport of Viktor invalid. Not knowing what is happening, he says many times ""I go New York"". With some funny scenes he gets to know what is happening. After this there comes a long time of living in the airport.The director of the airport wants that he'll get out of this airport, but he can't do this without that Viktor makes a foul. Viktor does a lot of things in the airport, and makes himself home. After some times he makes friends, the progress in making these friend were always funny, but also dramatic, as one of the audience I felt very combined to him. He gets to know a woman, Amelia Jane Warren (Catherina Zeta-Jones) They become friends and maybe even.. With Amelia in the story, the story gets the factor love. Combined with the funny and dramatic part, it makes the story almost perfect. I must praise the scriptwriter; it really is a piece of masterwork.The actors, with Tom Hanks, Catherina Zeta-Jones and Stanley Tucci played really good in the movie. There wasn't any kind of hesitation or sign of unreality. I must praise even more about the actor skills of Tom Hanks, although he knows the English language better than me, he was able to make me believe that my skills in English were far more better than his. This is really astonishing.The music in the story also was very good and fitted very best in the movie. I can't have complaints about that.The ending of the story is..how should I say it..""perfect with some hesitations"". The first thing with the ending is that you'll see what kind of genius the scriptwriter is. It has a lot of symbolic thing, what makes watching the movie twice very attractive. The second thing is a personal thing..you'll collide it.In the end I want to tell you something about the making of the scenes, the audience will get the feeling that he is right now in the screen, in the airport. This is a really good achievement, for the director, Steven Spielberg.With the really perfect script (if there was an even stronger praise word I would use that) very skill full actors and good scenes. I give this movie a nine. I must warn you that, if you don't like comedy, love and drama, you must not watch this movie. But if you like one of these factors, I recommend you this movie. If you like two of these factors you must see it! And if you like all three of them..you'll have the time of your live, on my word.Cario Dally",The Terminal
