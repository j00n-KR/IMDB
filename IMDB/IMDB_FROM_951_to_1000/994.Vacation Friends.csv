2,paul_haakonsen,Genuinely funny...,6,28 August 2021,"Well, this movie actually turned out to be a surprise. Yeah, initially I hadn't really expected much from it, as it was a comedy with John Cena in one of the leading roles. But I opted to watch the movie, and give it a fair chance.Turns out that writers Tom Mullen, Tim Mullen and Clay Tarver actually managed to compile a story that was rather enjoyable. It was a solid mix of storytelling, character development and good old laughs. So yeah, ""Vacation Friends"" proved to be a rather wholesome and entertaining movie.""Vacation Friends"" is a feel-good comedy that is laced with some genuinely funny moments that supplement the storyline quite well.The movie does have a good ensemble of casted actors and actresses. And I have to admit that John Cena does actually carry the movie quite well with his performance here, proving that he is more than just the generic action movie buff. I am not familiar with Lil Rel Howery, Yvonne Orji or Meredith Hagner, but they definitely were nicely cast and put on good performances. And the on-screen chemistry between John Cena and Lil Rel Howery was just brilliant.I was genuinely entertained by director Clay Tarv's 2021 comedy, and it is a movie that I can warmly recommend you sit down to watch if you're in for an evening of good old fashioned comedy.My rating of ""Vacation Friends"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",Vacation Friends
3,deloudelouvain,I laughed much more than I was expecting.,8,16 October 2021,"For some reason when I saw John Cena's name appearing I wasn't too excited about watching this movie. Wrestling characters are to me, fake and very annoying to watch but I have to give it to him as I thought he was very funny as an actor. As was the rest of the cast in Vacation Friends. I laughed a lot with this comedy and I wasn't even baked so maybe the next time I'll rewatch this little gem I will get stoned first to have the ultimate experience. The story is simple, easy to follow, and has some really good moments of comedy. Maybe it's not for everyone but that's always the case with comedies as everybody has a different taste of humor. In my case, Vacation Friends is just the right kind of humor that I needed and enjoyed.",Vacation Friends
4,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Like a holiday you know you enjoyed but can't really remember.,6,11 September 2021,"'Vacation Friends (2021)' is a surprisingly good, if by-the-numbers, comedy starring Lil Rel Howery, John Cena, Yvonne Orji and Meredith Hagner. It focuses on a couple who go to Mexico for a high-calibre holiday and get engaged in the lobby because their expensive, decked-out suite has flooded due to the upstairs neighbours overfilling their hot tub. Those neighbours learn of the situation and offer to host the couple for the duration of their holiday, working their way into their lives and pretty much forcing their care-free attitude upon them. The first half of the flick is, essentially, just a series of skits showing the four new friends partying hard and getting to know one another. The second then takes things back stateside and reunites the foursome at the engaged couple's fancy, country club wedding, where the vacation friends' previously mentioned care-free attitude causes some tension with the rather conservative and judgemental family members in attendance. The flick is entertaining enough for what it is. It hits every beat you expect it to, but its cast are likeable enough that you don't really mind how predictable it is. It's usually enjoyable just to watch the focal foursome interact with one another; the affair is always rather affable. It isn't hilarious, but it has its fair share of humorous moments and does provoke laughter on a few occasions. It isn't great, but it's good enough. Though it's not something you'll likely remember for very long, it's a relatively fun and lighthearted way to pass an evening. 6/10.",Vacation Friends

7,jtindahouse,A couple of great characters make for a very fun film,8,6 September 2021,"I don't watch many comedies these days. I feel like they don't release as many as they used to. But I also feel like they aren't anywhere near as good as they used to be. It feels like they are terrified to offend anyone and so play everything extremely safe. 'Vacation Friends' is about as edgy as you get these days. There are raunchy and R rated jokes in this film for sure, however of that variety of joke they are very safe. I enjoyed the film nonetheless.The couple in the movie played by John Cena and Meredith Hagner are the type of people you want in your life (even if the couple played by Lil Rel Howery and Yvonne Orji feel exactly the opposite way for some unclear reason). They're great. They're the life of the film. I understand the movie needs conflict but one of my few dislikes of the film was the downer that was the main couple Marcus and Emily. There are movies where you understand why characters hate other characters. This was not one of them.Cena in particular really impressed me in this movie. His acting has come a long way and his comedic timing is masterful in this one. It helped the character he was playing was so great of course, but I think he played a big part in creating that. I had a really good time with 'Vacation Friends' and it is one I would recommend.",Vacation Friends
8,kevin_robbins,This is a nice addition to the comedy genre that's entertaining but a step below the Hangovers of the world,7,11 September 2021,"Vacation Friends (2021) is a movie my wife and I watched on Hulu. The storyline follows a conservative couple who run into an over the top party animals couple that are hardcore into drugs, alcohol and the eccentric. Due to a series of unfortunate circumstances they have to be together for vacation and have the most amazing time but the conservative couple wants to lose touch with them forever and forget they ever met. When the conservative couple start planning their wedding activities their party animal vacation friends arrive and threaten to ruin the entire event...or make it more fun than they could ever imagine. This movie is directed by Clay Tarver (Silicon Valley) and stars Lil Rel Howery (Get Out), Yvonne Orji (Insecure), John Cena (Trainwreck), Meredith Hagner (Hits) and Lynn Whitfield (Eves Bayou). The storyline for this is absolutely crazy, random and unpredictable. The comedic content goes back and forth from hilarious to awkward but definitely has a nice amount of laugh out loud moments. The cast is perfectly selected and really make the comedic content work. Overall this is a nice addition to the comedy genre that's entertaining but a step below the Hangovers of the world. I'd score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Vacation Friends

12,arungeorge13,Cena's good fun in what's an okayish R-rated comedy! [+50%],5,28 August 2021,"While Vacation Friends isn't the most original comedy you'll see, it does offer some good laughs. John Cena is the obvious standout here, and he proves yet again that his comedic timing is solid. His self-deprecating humor is spot on, I must say - a stark contrast from that largely wooden outing in F9. There isn't a whole lot to write about the plot or the performances - it's all by the numbers. The raunchiness is kept to a minimum in what's a pretty easy flick to sit through, with no particularly memorable scenes. This is the kind of cinema that you'll best enjoy with friends over a few beers at home. Nothing more, nothing less!",Vacation Friends

John Cena is by far the highlight of the film and does the best he can with a subpar script.",Vacation Friends
17,kjproulx,"Predictable, but Very Funny",7,12 September 2021,"By Hollywood standards, the comedy genre seems to be dwindling down year after year. With the focus being on real-world issues, true stories, and more dramatic stories overall, it's hard to find a new original comedy these days. Vacation Friends is one of the latest films that was going to be in theatres but was released via streaming instead. Available on Hulu in the United States and on Disney+/Star in Canada, even though people are talking about it, I feel like it won't receive as much credit as it deserves. This was a hidden gem that I wasn't expecting to be as fun as it was and here's why I recommend checking it out.Following Emily (Yvonne Orji) and Marcus (Lil Rel Howrey) as they take a vacation for themselves, Marcus' plan is to propose to her. After bumping into Kyla (Meredith Hagner) and Ron (John Cena), their trip instantly becomes much wilder than they had anticipated. This crazy couple may have been just what they needed for their trip (being the boring couple they were), but it's the aftermath that sets the film in motion. Many months after their trip, Kyla and Ron crash the wedding of Emily and Marcus and throw their lives back into a frenzy, with some shocking new revelations. All of this craziness made for a very fun experience.Back when John Cena began acting in films like The Marine or 12 Rounds, I just looked at him as someone who could probably only do action films of that nature, but he has really grown as a performer through the years. When he expanded his horizons and tried comedy, it seemed like an even better fit. When filmmakers decided to play to his strengths and include him in small roles in Trainwreck or Sisters, I could tell his career was on an upward trend. Then Blockers came out and it placed him front and centre and it really worked for me. Now with movies like The Suicide Squad and Vacation Friends, I truly feel that he has found his stride. I can honestly consider myself a fan of him and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of his screentime here.With that said, it didn't hurt that the other three main cast members were all just as likeable. Howrey, Hagner, and Orji all play off each other hilariously and dramatically and it never felt too forced. I'd be lying though if I didn't state that one of the big reasons I liked this film was due to the chemistry between John Cena and Lil Rel Howrey. Their banter made so many scenes that much funnier and I never once would've pictured them as the perfect duo. Sure, how the story plays out is incredibly predictable, but the journey to the conclusion was easily the strength of this comedy.Overall, a raunchy R-Rated comedy can just feel like a bunch of gross-out humour or people screaming things from start to finish, but Vaction Friends dives a little deeper than that. The nice touch of drama and realism to remind you that this story is still trying to be realistic was also a nice positive to me. As far as comedies like this go, in this day and age, you can do much worse. I was also pleasantly surprised to see that Clay Tarver directed this film and had a hand in penning the screenplay because his work on the series Silicon Valley was immeasurable. That was some stellar television work on his part. Look, this film is far from perfect and it's insanely predictable, but it's also a lot of fun. Now streaming, if you're a fan of raunchy/feel-good comedies, I recommend Vacation Friends.",Vacation Friends
18,Movi3DO,Young dumb and broke,7,28 August 2021,"Hmm the salt doesn't really taste saltyA brand new comedy on Hulu where a couple on vacation met another wild couple, and lives changed, for the better or worst.You know, there's movie where you're supposed to turn your brain off and have so dumb fun, and this one was exactly that.Let me throw away the problems of this movie first. The story is extremely cheesy with pretty much every plot points. You knew exactly what's going to happen, how the conflicts would start, and how the story would end. Also, some of the jokes didn't land.However, I had a lot of fun. Of course, without the wild couple played by John Cena and Meredith Hagner, there would be way less fun. Especially John Cena, you can definitely see him this time playing his usual self and having fun while being ridiculous and goofy. Meredith Hagner was just as nuts as Cena. The main couple tho, played by Lil Rel Howery and Yvonne Orji, they did fine, but I found them very replaceable.The jokes here were surface-level, dumb, and relied a lot of the chaotic nature of the movie and the actors, so I don't think the movie is right for everyone. However for me, I like some stupid jokes here and there, and I cracked up quite a bit. So I would say it's a dub for the movie and for me, because good lord it's not just another trash movie.Overall, strong performance from Dr. Of Thuganomics made for a fun 1 hour and 40 min vacation on Hulu. 7/10.",Vacation Friends
19,cardsrock,The Summer of Cena continues,5,28 August 2021,"After increasingly better roles in F9 and The Suicide Squad this summer, John Cena closes out his epic summer with his best performance yet.He is by far the highlight of the film and does the best he can with a subpar script. The rest of the cast is not really outstanding and the story is quite predictable. Also, the main actor is playing discount Kevin Hart and it was not enjoyable.The premise isn't the worst, but they just play it as safely as possible. Cena's shenanigans are fun though. This isn't the best or the worst comedy of the year. There are some decent laughs, but just don't go in with too high of expectations.",Vacation Friends

23,januszlvii,Not Funny,2,6 September 2021,Vacation Friends is simply not funny. Once again Hollywood fails to make a funny movie. The best part of the film is the idea behind it but the execution fails. John Cena is not the least bit funny nor is anyone else in this movie. The ending is too nice as well ( spoilers ahead: The wedding and naming the kid after Malcolm). 2 stars. Both for the idea behind the film.,Vacation Friends

25,ginocox-206-336968,"Some good moments, but not as good as I Love You, Man",5,3 September 2021,"Vacation Friends (2021) delivers a fair number of laughs and a few touching moments. It is similar to I Love You, Man (2009) starring Paul Rudd and Jason Segel bonding as mismatched Groom-to-be and best man, which is a much better and funnier film, and would be a better choice for those who haven't seen it. Despite some hilarious scenes and good performances, Vacation Friends isn't nearly as satisfying as I Love You, Man.Lil Rel Howery does as well as one might expect with the material he's given, but seems horribly miscast as Marcus, an anal-retentive, insecure, self-made businessman and owner of a successful construction firm. Why construction? Probably because the male lead in chick flicks typically has a socially responsible career, often involving physical labor outdoors - which is also the likely reason that John Cena's Ron is a park ranger. Working in construction, Marcus is viewed as blue-collar to fiancée Emily's (Yvonne Orji) blue-blooded family, and it means his employees are too rough around the edges to mix well with her family; however, it never becomes a part of the plot, as does Ron's knowledge of nature. Marcus dresses for work like a college professor, rather than somebody who spends much of his working day traipsing through the mud. He's portly and physically inept, as if he's never in his life swung a sledge hammer or even a claw hammer. He seems to know nothing about construction, other than the importance of using spreadsheets. He never seems authentic in his career, unlike Ron, who seems very credible as a park ranger with a loose screw or two.Marcus's romance with Emily doesn't seem authentic either. Emily is kind of just there. She's not stunningly beautiful, intoxicatingly sexy, wickedly clever, or engagingly amusing. There's no magic spark between them that transfers to the silver screen, and little reason for the audience to like her or to root for their romance.By contrast, John Cena is brilliant as Ron, a complex, passionate, mercurial, three-dimensional character with conflicts, a credible background, and an eccentric philosophy of life. There is a lot of energy between him and Kyla (Meredith Hagner), a sort of anachronistic 1970s flower child. Kudos also to Robert Wisdom as Harold, Emily's father, who delivers a brilliant multi-faceted performance.In contrast, Emily's extended family are familiar two-dimensional stereotypes. One's first impression might be that they are playing caricatures to make some sort of statement that upper-crusty blacks are as vacuous and self-absorbed as upper-crusty whites. However, Chris Pratt and Anna Faris were originally slated to play Marcus and Emily. Apparently, all these minor roles were originally envisioned as white characters and were never altered when the role of Marcus was re-cast as Ice Cube, and later Lil Rel Howery. The result is a large cast of supporting characters who don't quite seem authentic.This incongruity comes front and center in the second act, when it develops that Emily's entire family are enthusiasts in fox hunting and golf, two sports that are not considered popular in the black community. This is not to suggest that blacks cannot or should not hunt foxes, even if they appreciate the difference between a hunt and a chase, and know how many buttons to wear on their bespoke velvet coats. But it can be confusing to the audience. Is this supposed to be funny, like casting a black as the world's greatest hockey player in The Love Guru (2008)? Or is it intended as some sort of deadly serious woke political statement that any actor can play any role, as with casting a black Mrs Santa Clause in Fatman (2020)?",Vacation Friends
26,Brooklynsmagicmike,This movie isn't for everybody but I personally loved it.,9,2 September 2021,"I'm a huge John Cena throughout all his career as well as always found Lil Rel to be funny and entertaining. So my review could be slightly biased but I definitely enjoyed this movie.First the visuals are absolutely stunning you can tell they put a good amount of budget behind this film. The premise albeit similiar and something we've definitely seen before, still worked formulaic. As far as comedy goes the movie was very funny and even heartwarming by the end of the film. The only reason I diddn't give this movie a 10 out of 10 had to do with pacing at times. For the most part it was fine, but there were parts that felt little dragged.I would definitely recommend this movie to late teens to younger adults as I think they'll have alot of fun here. Older crowd I think could have lukewarm response due to good percentage of jokes being drug related.",Vacation Friends

40,chris_rowe-881-168820,Extra marks for being free,7,29 August 2021,"Ok I think a film should always get a bit extra praise when it's available for next to free, a cinema trip is expensive so adds to disappointment, I was familiar with the two male leads but not the two females.Acting wise it was a mixed bag, Marcus I'd seen in the parent film with Kevin hart, ironically he played the part exactly like you'd expect hart to, it wasn't good as he's not as likeable or charismatic. There's so much pointless dialogue that hart does in comedies that he somehow makes work but for example when Marcus takes the wheel of the boat and is saying ""who's driving the boat ""I'm driving the boat"" it just feels dumb, he's a grown man in control of his actions I just don't get why anyone would find that funny, in 34 years I've not done anything with anyone where they've narrated their actions out of surprise. Just a pet peeve but he sadly just felt like a cheap option and I'd put good money on him not being in this role without the hart film.The two wives, the blonde was funny and cooky but I enjoyed her performance, it wasn't particularly original or difficult but she played it well as it wasn't a very deep character, Marcus's wife had least dialogue and non existent character, didn't add anything to the movie , she wasn't bad but literally no ones coming away remembering her, the rest of the cast were generic stereotypical characters we've seen in movies from meet the parents through to just married.The star was cena, it's strange, I've known him since his debut wrestling and followed him through, he's a really great dude in real life and a hard worker, there's something about him that makes him feel unnatural as a person, not in a horrible way as it's the same when he's in real life, it always feels like he's playing a character and he's living it but he's done it so long he's lost the human aspects that make it relatable. In F9 with less dialogue it worked, same with suicide squad. But whilst he was hilarious in parts some of his delivery is a bit cartoonish, even the emotional moments that should be in this film he seemed to escape as it's not his strong suit. I think he's a good watch in this but only if you ignore the fact he's just a bit robotic.But although the characters weren't great and the story was mediocre it worked, it was fun, silly and didn't drag, strangely though the last 15 went too quick, it avoided the wedding scene and skipped to the cliff I felt that potentially could've really used 10 minutes to humanise them all with love and real emotion and not end stupidly, I thought possibly a joint wedding would've been a better idea.I'm not the writer it's just my opinion, I felt some of the joke set ups were peculiar and the curveball and overlooking of his wife's cheating was really strange, like how a child would think. Then the emotional moment was way too predictable in the set up and it took any emotion out the situation.I think overall for a free movie and a comedy it's worth watching, it has zero replay value and the script needs overlooking and just enjoy the moments as the writing is bad, as soon as the hotel guy was trying to be funny and failing I was worried it was going to be awful and too continuously talky. But it was good, comedies need moments to laugh, but too many rely on fake self narration and vocalising moments to explain why it's funny or what the joke is, that for me isn't comedy, this has moments of that well Marcus did but overall it was 6.5/10 bumped up for being free.",Vacation Friends

I don't know how I keep forgetting this but Cena is like a huge slab of meat so anytime he does something lighthearted it makes it even more funny.Related but not really related: Did anyone else think of Pops from Friday when Anna Marie Horseford (Marcus' mom in the movie) interacted with her husband (Marcus' dad in the movie)?

I genuinely laughed and it made me feel good by the end of the movie. Just one of the movies that you watch and you're happy you did because it was a breath of fresh air. It was an easy movie to just put on and relax to, with some ridiculousness that you can't help at least smirk at. I actually really enjoyed the movie and it had some wholesomeness to it too.

The wild couple ( John Cena and Meredith Hagar ) adds an awkward spark to the comical element .. so much so that you can't help but to chuckle a little. The movie stays in its lane offering some themes along the lines of friendship and a typical formula for a comedy : some drama surrounding the main character ( Lil Rel Howery), and outrageous explicit statements.I personally didn't find it to be laugh out loud funny, yet it still delivered what you expect. A weird but decent film!Verdict: you watch this movie for a fun time! If you have Hulu and want to watch an easy going film with a few chuckles, then why not.",Vacation Friends

What Marcus and Emily thought was just a vacation friendship, turns a real nightmare when Ron and Kyla turn up.The main cast is the bright spot in this film. Howery and Cena complimented each other well and built a great relationship. Cena stole every scene he was in as the lovable lunk. Orji and Hagner also complimented each, and when the four came together, they were enjoyable to watch.While the film is funny with some laugh out loud moments, it still felt formulaic. It follows a standard plot line with an insert joke here mentality. There are organic laughs that is a breath of fresh air, but you can see most coming from a mile away.This is a perfect kick off your shoes and relax comedy. You're not getting anything new or ground breaking, but you're going to escape and laugh along the way. John Cena is turning into a scene stealer with every project he takes on.

75,ryanwesthamfan,It Does Its Job,6,2 September 2021,The Good- I liked the concept of this film about meeting two crazy people of holiday and not wanting to bring them into your everyday lives. It's something everyone can relate to I'm sure. The comedic timing in here is great from the secondary couple. John Cena is perfect for this role.The Bad- Now this isn't a film I'd recommend all that much. If your in the mood for some dumb comedy then yes this is one I'd probably recommend but there are better comedies out there that are a lot funnier and send a better message. There wasn't a lot of issues I had with this film. There just isn't a lot of great things about it either.Overall Thoughts- 'Vacation Friends' features enough laughs to keep viewers engaged. However the comedy doesn't 100% land but there is enough chemistry between the cast. Overall I'm going to give 'Vacation Friends' a 6/10.,Vacation Friends

I love this genre, but, the writer had a recipe and went step by step.Couldn't we have slotted a ""non name"" actor in one of the leads? I feel both Lil Rel and Cena are both over used; let me re word that, good actors but over used. Guys, you can say ""no"" to a project, you do know that right?

So, in the end, I wasn't trying to think up scenarios that could have allowed me to better understand the character(s), a scene, or just the film in its entirety.

Well, they found it. Typically when I'm watching a movie and John Sena is in it, I'm thinking ""what is the Sena gonna do next"", in the movie, it just flowed and you forget he's even John Sena.Now onto the movie. It started off light, and went crazy after you get a minute to learn the characters. As the story progresses, you learn more and more about the soon to be married couple, along with some history on their new ""best friends"".Through a lot of crazy twists and mixes in the story, you start to really like Ron, and even Marcus grows on you. Kyla is naieve and follows her man blindly, I love her character, and of course the conflicted Emily has to choose between family and love.Some of the other characters added value as well, such as Andrew Bachelor playing the brother. He was a bit of an ass, and they take a while to explain why.Overall, I needed a movie like this, it's a great release and a lot of fun.",Vacation Friends

John Cena was surprisingly good and the rest of the cast did a decent job as well.One of the most challenging things in comedies is to keep an even amount of laughs throughout the whole movie and very few comedies in history managed to do that (The Naked Gun for example). 'Vacation Friends' loses its steam after the first crazy 30 min but manages to deliver some funny moments here and there after.",Vacation Friends

122,mcdopeshow,Better Than You'll Give it Credit For,7,29 August 2021,"Comedy is not an easy genre.If you're like me, you'll probably have a couple of long time favourites that you'll (secretly) believe can never be topped.I'm almost sure Vacation Friends won't top your list, but it's got qualities of its own that can and should be considered. And yes, it's a fun adventure, and one worthy of revisiting.Most importantly, it never takes itself too seriously and has a ""mind of its own"". Instead of going all the way down the usual road, it takes risks, sometimes it's extreme and obscene, but it is never presumptuous.Your most probable immediate dislike for the movie's main characters develops into a fondness that is hard to explain. In a way, they start off as those people you sometimes meet that you have absolutely NO connection with, to someone you can't forget.In many ways, the movie is very much about those improbable friendships. With everything that could go wrong, somehow, it finds its way.Definitely entertaining, and much more than you'll initially give it credit for.",Vacation Friends

127,jimsnider-89192,An Enjoyable Surprise,8,30 August 2021,"Vacation Friends is a very nice surprise in a year of comedies that simply aren't funny. I try not to let reviews dictate what I watch and avoid and, with this film, I'm glad that I stuck to that philosophy.The cast does a great job of drawing the audience into the story. John Cena (Ron) and Meredith Hagner (Kyla) are hilarious, adding a lot of laughs to an already very funny script. They are out there without being too over the top. Lil Rev Howery (Marcus) and Yvonne Orji (Emily) are perfect counterbalance to the wild antics of Ron and Kyla. Their straight-laced demeanors are fun to watch melt away throughout the progression of the movie. I had to watch more than a few scenes more than once they were so funny.Ron walking on the beach with a bloody rag on his head after Marcus shot a bottle off his head cracked me up. Not as much as the scene where Ron was foraging on the fox hunt and Marcus accidentally ate the mushrooms though. You could see something like that coming, but it was still a riot to watch unfold. Perhaps the funniest part was Kyla's little speech at the rehearsal dinner only to be topped by Marcus' interruption and misunderstanding. Again, great job acting and very funny stuff.The supporting cast does a very good job of adding depth and humor to the plot as well. Both sets of parents are very funny and bring a lot to the movie. From the minute Emily's dad coin checked Ron I knew the movie was only going to get better.At the end of the day, this is a good solid movie. The story moves along nicely and you don't get bogged down in a bunch of extra storylines. The cast, as I said, is very talented actors keeping things light and comical. No hidden meanings or sappy life lessons here, just good laughs that allow you to relax, forget your problems, and enjoy the ride.I saw someone say this film likely won't win any awards and they're probably right. Critics are usually idiots with absolutely no idea what humor is.",Vacation Friends

It's got a few laugh out loud moments and a few emotional ones too. It's not like a sandler level of stupid comedy if that makes sense which is kind of what I was expecting.

I don't like John cena unless he's in a comedy movie (so far). I'll give him some more opportunities, but haven't liked any of his action movies. But any comedy films I've seen him in were funny. LiL Rell is hilarious in this (IMO) and goes all in for plenty of great laughs. While Cena and his ""wife"" (Meredith Hagner ) steal most scenes lil Rell and his ""wife"" actor (Yvonne Orji) are a very funny pair . This movie has been done plenty of times. It's literally a classic scenario, that has been done over & over again. Many others have tried & failed. This one definitely passes the test, with jokes that land and the actors thrived in the hilariously awkward scenarios that they are thrown into. It's a comedy Win for me .",Vacation Friends

154,Rui-Wen,"Fun cast, forgettable movie",5,10 September 2021,"Earlier this summer John Cena introduced us to his Peacemaker in James Gunn's The Suicide Squad. He was crazy, hilarious and very inappropriate but was backed up by an entire cast of inappropriate characters. In Vacation Friends, Cena and Meredith Hagner are left to do all the heavy crazy lifting with Hagner showing the comedy chops that Anna Farris had back in her Scary Movie days. But once the focus shifts away from these two and the 'plot' really kicks in, the movie starts grinding its' gears as the writers appear to have run out of story beyond the first act.If you're looking for a comedy and have Netflix, Vacation Friends might fill that need.

More than I can say for most comedies that come out nowadays.There was a lot of action based comedy which was great, as well as easy to miss witty jokes thrown in the mix that were really funny too!If only we could all have friends like Ron & Kyla! They were of course the best part of this move! Both Jon Cena & Meredith Hagner were awesome in their Roles and stole every scene they were in! Lil Rel Howery & Yvonne Orji were great too!

202,rosecheveu,Fun movie,10,28 August 2021,"I enjoyed it I found it very entertaining. Who knew John Cena was so good at comedy! It's a good watch if you are younger, relaxing and looking for something good to laugh at. If you are older, conservative basically super straight edge person/square then this movie isn't for you (example: movie critics with bad taste). Hence all the people writing bad reviews below and above mine.Rose.",Vacation Friends

214,ww_1914,Random fun movie!,8,28 August 2021,"Had enjoyed some of these other actors before, but I never had strong feelings one way or another about John Cena. This is a perfect character for him to be a little self-deprecating while being completely over the top. The dynamic between these characters is so awkwardly hilarious, and they all do a great job! We were randomly suggested this by the algorithm robots, took a chance, and enjoyed it beginning to end!",Vacation Friends

Compared to the fact I've seen worse films in theaters, this free Hulu movie was great.There are people hating on it but half say they couldn't watch any more or are people taking it way too seriously. If you didn't watch the entire thing you should be rating it.Over, enjoyable film.",Vacation Friends

222,googs-94654,Better actors needed,5,28 August 2021,"Story was lame but the worst part was the actors. We know what we get with Cena but the other guy was just terrible. Lil Rel or whatever his ""name"" is is just terrible. This movie was not funny and it had a chance to be if the right ppl were casted. Would have loved to see Ron played by Ryan Reynolds or the Rock and Lil Rel played by Kevin Hart. I know will Smith and Nicolas Cage were suppose to do it back in 2005 that would have been better a lot better. But the rock as Ron would have been so much better.",Vacation Friends
223,blondon-86048,Yikes,2,27 August 2021,"I watched it til the end but it was a struggle. I fast forwarded through a chunk of it. Classic case of things go from bad to worse. Awkward, uncomfortable and unrealistic. I really like all of these actors but the story was really wack. I Just....wish I had better things to say about it but it left me with a stank ""wth did I just spend the last hour and a half watching"" face. If you've got something better to watch...I suggest you do.",Vacation Friends
