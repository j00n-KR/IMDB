0,TheLittleSongbird,A smart and fun send up of the action genre with a great performance from Arnold,8,13 December 2009,"When this first came out, I believe it received a lot of criticism. I think the criticisms have been unfair, for this is a very smart and funny send up of the action genre. I also think this is underrated, of course the plot is a little complicated, about a young boy getting sucked into the celluloid world of his hero, in places and it is slow to begin with. But there is a lot of fun to be had; including the spectacular set pieces and the expert direction of Hunt For Red October director John McTiernon. The scenery is lovely, the sets are colourful and the costumes are very nice. Plus the action is exhilarating. Arnold Schwarznegger I think is talented, and he gives a great performance here. Austin O'Brien is appealing as Danny, Charles Dance is terrific as Benedict and Ian McKellan is literally unrecognisable as Death. Other excitements to be had in this film are the many cameos from the likes of James Belushi, Sharon Stone, Joan Cartwright and Jean Claude Van Damme. All in all, a fun and smart take on the action genre, on par with Loaded Weapon 1 and High Anxiety and better than the disgusting trash of Disaster Movie, Epic Movie etc. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Last Action Hero
1,bkoganbing,The Magic Ticket,6,29 January 2017,"The future Guvernator of California stars in this film that literally shatters dimensions. It's all about a ticket more valuable than the one that got you into Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. This one allows young Austin O'Brien to get into one of the films starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as Jack Slater hero cop with one of those special weapons that never seem to need reloading.Young O'Brien's world is taken up with the movies, his is one humdrum and typically anxiety filled life of an adolescent and his preoccupation with the cinema is driving mother Mercedes Ruehl a little batty. But one day the cinema projectionist Robert Prosky gives him a special golden admission ticket that allows O'Brien to enter the Schwarzenegger film and become an additional character. Since he seems to know what's going on ahead of everybody that becomes a problem for O'Brien. But not half the problem the real world gets when one of the screen villains develops a consciiousness about who he is and invades the real world. In fact Tom Noonan realizes the perfect way to solve all his problems in the film.Such folks as F. Murray Abraham, Anthony Quinn, and Art Carney get to do some nice characterizations in the film. This was Carney's farewell performance. Schwarzenegger and O'Brien have a nice chemistry going themselves. And Arnie gets a chance to spoof a bit of himself. Last Action Hero holds up well as entertainment. It does date however since now the big screen uses those DVDs. Those cans of film you see in the projectionist unintentionally truly date the work.",Last Action Hero
2,Leofwine_draca,Fun self-referential spoof; didn't deserve the hate,6,16 August 2016,"John McTiernan's self-referential blockbuster spoof was a major flop on release, mainly because audiences just didn't get it. However time has been kind to this film, and looking back on it today, it proves to be a pleasing alternative to the more standard action fare filling the cinemas at the time.This time, the typical story is played for laughs as Schwarzenegger does battle with a one-eyed villain, Benedict, played to the hilt by Charles Dance. There are some amazing over the top set pieces to enjoy, with the action completely contrived and unbelievable, and these are the best moments. Take for example when Schwarzenegger is swinging from a crane with a corpse, or the numerous car chases, or many other moments. These scenes are hilarious and are meant to be, commenting on the absurdity of the modern action film.The film is brimming with a host of stars, mainly in blink and you'll miss 'em roles. Chevy Chase and Jean-Claude Van Damme both turn up briefly, as do Robert Patrick, Tina Turner, and many others. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays his typical cinematic persona, full of wisecracks and brawn, but this time it's a more tongue in cheek performance than is usual for him. He is supported by a standard villainous role from Charles Dance, who is memorable with his glass eye, yet also contrived and generic. Anthony Quinn amongst others lends support to the proceedings, and the only downside is the casting of a young, annoyingly bland child as the co-star. I could have done without the kid.With lots of gags, winks and clever moments (especially when Schwarzenegger has to gatecrash the premier of a film starring himself, and he meets up with the actor who plays him, and the bit where Dance discovers that nobody cares if he kills somebody), as well as some of the wildest action to ever hit the screens, LAST ACTION HERO is an interesting effort, unfairly maligned by the public but worth a look if you're in the mood for something different. Definitely hit and miss, but I found it to be worth it in the end.",Last Action Hero
3,SnoopyStyle,Not funny,5,24 November 2013,"Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) is a big action fan, and skips school to watch movies at an old decrepit theater. Nick (Robert Prosky) is the old theater operator who uses a magic ticket for Danny. During a big explosion, a bundle of dynamite gets thrown near Danny and blasts him into the movie. He lands in the back seat of action hero Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger)'s car.Arnold is trying to parody his action hero persona trying to deconstruct it. It's an interesting concept, but the execution is lacking. The movie world isn't particularly funny. The only way to make this work is to make us laugh. They do all the over the top action ridiculousness. Then they wink at us and expect us to laugh. It's not funny. And others have done it better, funnier, with more insight.Simply breaking down the 4th wall is not enough. Somebody actually has to write funny jokes. I look at who was involved with the film and I wonder if there was any comedian or joke writer in the bunch. The action part is certainly taken care of, and the movie has good action. But that's not what this film needs.",Last Action Hero
4,gavin6942,A Refreshing Twist on the Action Genre,8,8 March 2006,"""Last Action Hero"" is an action-comedy-fantasy. The action involves car chases, explosions and guns. The comedy involves one of the main characters pointing out movie in-jokes (the talking villain, the 555 phone numbers, etc.) and his partner's responses. The fantasy element involves a magical ticket -- from Harry Houdini -- that allows real people to enter films of their choice and even to allow the films to enter our world.This movie is funny, exciting and meant for those of us who have seen too many movies (action or otherwise). If you think references to ""Die Hard"", ""Amadeus"" and ""Basic Instinct"" are your cup of tea, this movie is that cup of tea you're looking for.Could this be Schwarzenegger's best film? With all due respect to ""T2"", ""Totall Recall"", ""Commando"" and other fine films (I could go on) I must conclude this is his best. So if you like Schwarzenegger and you haven't seen this film, get off your keyster and see this movie tonight.Very highly recommended!",Last Action Hero
5,lee_eisenberg,the purple rose of Arnold,5,13 September 2021,"""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" depicted movie characters interacting with the real world. Here we get a similar story, except that it's an Arnold Schwarzenegger character. ""Last Action Hero"" basically owns up to every cliche in action flicks: nonstop explosions, groan-inducing one-liners, irascible superiors, and an abundance of hot babes (and no plain Janes). Much like how ""Idiocracy"" dared you to laugh at obviously stupid humor, this movie dares you to luxuriate in stupid cliches.Enjoyable if you can tolerate what IS basically a trite plot.",Last Action Hero
6,jboothmillard,Last Action Hero,7,12 September 2005,"From director John McTierman (Predator, Die Hard), this is an interesting and appealing idea, what would you do if you were transported into you favourite film? Basically young Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) is a huge fan of the Jack Slater movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger (also producing this film), and he can't wait to see the fourth instalment. So his cinema projectionist friend Nick (Robert Prosky) offers him a preview opportunity, he also gives Danny a magic ticket given to him by Houdini, which he never tried himself, as it has a mind of its own. The first few minutes of Jack Slater IV see the bad guys, boss Tony Vivaldi (Anthony Quinn) and henchman Benedict (Charles Dance), then it move on to Jack who finds his favourite cousin they tortured. Soon enough, the ticket works its magic and transports Danny into the film, and he can't stop trying to convince Jack and a few other characters that they are in a film. After a long while of helping Jack defeat the bad guys, Jack does finally see that Danny did come from another world, i.e. the real one, and a poster of Jack's film proves he was right all along. But anyway, Jack still has to catch Benedict, who plans to put a stop to Jack Slater films for good, by killing Arnold Schwarzenegger Also starring F. Murray Abraham as John Practice, Art Carney as Frank, Frank McRae as Lieutenant Dekker, Tom Noonan as Ripper/Himself, The Fisher King's Mercedes Ruehl as Irene Madigan, Sir Ian McKellen as Death, Joan Plowright as Teacher, The Truman Show's Noah Emmerich as Rookie, Tina Turner as The Mayor, James Belushi, Chevy Chase, Robert Patrick, Maria Shriver (Schwarzenegger's wife), Sharon Stone, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Damon Wayans and Danny DeVito as Whiskers. The action is good, the in-jokes are also good, and the famous faces who show up add to the fun of the film. Very good!",Last Action Hero
7,ccthemovieman-1,The Good & Bad Of Last Action Hero,8,7 April 2006,"If you look at this movie as a cartoon-like adventure story, not to be taken seriously, it is great fun. The elitist critics took the movie seriously and panned it.. They couldn't see the film for what it was....just fun and nothing else. I enjoyed, but I have a few complaints of my own, too, so......THE GOOD - It's very entertaining, start-to-finish. You never fall asleep watching this 2-hour-and change movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger, obviously is the ""hero"" and Austin O'Brien does a nice job playing an 11-year-old kid who is wise (a bit too wise) beyond his years.The villains are particularly interesting in here. They are very ""colorful,"" sporting different glass eyes, doing Jack-The-Ripper imitations, etc. Some of the action scenes are spectacular with good special effects.There are good lines about fantasy and reality. (This was one of those ""film within a film"" stories like ""The Purple Rose Of Cairo.""). They make fun of many Hollywood clichés in films, including my favorite: the villains talking too much instead of just killing their opponent. There are many cameo appearances by other stars, some of whom don't even speak any lines. It's fun to pick them out.THE BAD - It's inappropriate for an 11-year-old co-star to be in a film with questionable language and a bunch of sexual innuendos. Here is another example of a PG-13 movie than should have been ""R."" As for the kid himself, his character is way too obnoxious. There is too much violence in here and a desperate need for a few more lulls. Give your ears and other senses a rest! A cheap shot, too, of showing a nun with a machine gun at a funeral was unnecessary.Overall: The pluses, as you can see, outweigh the minuses, but a note of caution to parents wondering about showing this to their young kids.",Last Action Hero
8,BA_Harrison,I was right the first time.,3,15 September 2013,"I first saw Last Action Hero back in 1993; I didn't like it. Twenty years later and I begin to wonder whether my opinion was a knee-jerk reaction to seeing Schwarzenegger in something a little different to his usual fare, and that perhaps I would appreciate the film more second time round. Well, I just watched it again and, if anything, I disliked it even more than the first time.The basic (high) concept—action movie fan Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) enters the fictional world of his movie hero Jack Slater (Arnie)—is actually pretty clever, allowing for lots of ingenious meta-moments, but the way in which it is all realised is diabolical: the screenplay is full of misjudged humour (what is it with that dumb animated cat?), child star Austin O'Brien puts in a thoroughly annoying performance, and the exaggerated action scenes within Slater's movie-verse are completely devoid of excitement. There are also quite a few jokes that have dated extremely badly, especially the 'star' cameos from people that are no longer as famous as they used to be.The saddest thing about the whole film is that, given the great talent involved (Arnie, screenwriter Shane Black, director John McTiernan) it really should have been much, much better. Studio intervention may have been the reason it turned out so bad, but knowing that doesn't make the film any more enjoyable to watch.",Last Action Hero
9,Quinoa1984,"the artificiality of it, and the film's own continued acknowledgment, ALMOST works",7,11 May 2006,"Last Action Hero starring Arnold Schwarzenegger is a very odd hybrid that never quite pulls off watching it today. As a kid it was dumb, silly tongue-in-cheek fun, with the soundtrack being one of the best I'd heard at the time. Now as I watch it I find as much to praise as I do to pan on. And it's not necessarily the fault of director John McTiernan or Arnold- the problems lie in two places, the script and in casting Austin O'Brien. By casting a kid alongside Schwarzenegger, even if it is a quasi-send-up of the action film genre (specifically the kinds of films Arnold made worldwide successes in the 80's), there's already the possibility for trouble. Casting a kid in a major role is always chancy, and even when you know the intentions behind it were pure (i.e. Phantom Menace), more than half the time its bound to disappoint. It's a shame then that O'Brien makes this self-conscious attitude of the picture that much more of an annoyance. His continued utterances, reminding us till no end 'it's just a movie' start to wear on a viewer. And by the end, when the story gets overly emotional- and with a very un-needed Ingmar Bergman reference no less- not to sound cynical but I understood why he hasn't had much of a career since.This being said, there are things that make Last Action Hero passable as long as you're prepared to turn off most of the synapses in your skull. The action sequences are achieved with as much of an adherence to conventional techniques while making a wink at it all the time. My favorite was seeing Schwarzenegger's 'new' bad puns (maybe not as good as Terminator or Predator but close) as he drove around without steering and going every which way possible in the first chase. And the star power in the film is impressive, with a nice laugh at seeing F. Murray Abraham in a choice cameo-type role, also Art Carney in his last film. But, as mentioned, all of the stylistic fervor and bits of real entertainment, it lacks a certain durability that other summer blockbusters have. It's not as funny as it means to be, its only half as clever as it is, and its Schwarzenegger-packed action is good only in spurts. In short, it's not too much of a wonder this was 2nd banana to Jurassic Park in 1993.",Last Action Hero
10,JohnHowardReid,Seventy Million Dollars! And most of that money is on the screen.,8,3 July 2015,"There are many things I enjoyed in Last Action Hero and also many things I did not like. The not-likes first: I found the plot difficult to follow and I'm not a fan of TV-style direction with the camera chasing close-up after close-up. On the other hand, there's no denying the sheer gusto of the production and its pell-mell pace from first to last. As the movie runs no less than 130 minutes, that's a large amount of space to fill up with virtually non-stop action, but that's exactly what director John McTiernan provides. The cast is solid, although apart from the lead himself, the kid and the projectionist, many of the name players are difficult to recognize. Also I don't like the modern habit of mumbling. Once again, aside from the three principals, many of the players tend to mumble their lines and are virtually inaudible. And alas – for most people – the otherwise superb Columbia DVD does not provide English sub-titles. Fortunately for me, it does provide Spanish sub-titles, so I had no problem, but how many other viewers would be sufficiently conversant with Spanish, I'd rank at less than one per cent. The movie reputedly cost $70,000,000 - and most of that money is on the screen!",Last Action Hero
11,BandSAboutMovies,A fun movie that wasn't ready for its time,7,1 March 2020,"After Terminator 2: Judgement Day, the monolith known as Arnold Schwarzenegger could do no wrong. But where do you go after you move from Austria to here with no money, take over the world of bodybuilder and then become the biggest movie star in the world?You make fun of yourself.That's where the original script for Last Action Hero - written by Zak Penn and Adam Leff - came in. Penn has since gone on to write PCU, X2, X-Men: Last Stand, The Avengers, Ready: Player One and Elektra while directing his own movie, Atari: Game Over. Leff hasn't been as lucky, as his only other writing credits are PCU and Bio-Dome. That said, their screenplay was set in the movie world and concerned a hero named Arno Slater who tries to deal with the never-ending world of violence that takes the lives of everyone around him. Pretty much, it's a meta-aware Shane Black parody.How weird is it that Black was brought it to do the rewrite, leading to Penn and Leff only getting a story - and not a screenplay - credit?In Nancy Griffith's How They Built the Bomb, the reasons for this film's failure go beyond it's biggest issue: was it a comedy or an action movie? Sure, it could be both, but the film seems wildly schizophrenic in what it wants to achieve. What are the rules in Jack Slater's world? What are the rules in the real - real as in the movie - world? Why can some people keep their powers and Jack can't? What the hell is going on here?The issues that Griffith pointed out include Universal moving Jurassic Park to a week before this film would open, negative publicity caused by initial screenings going so poorly, an out-of-control ad campaign that included a NASA rocket that never launched with the movie's logo and being the first film released in Sony Dynamic Digital Sound, which didn't even work in the tiny subset of theaters that even had this set up.A $26 million loss and the first real bomb on Arnold's record. It stung.Let me set that up even better: it made $137 million at the box office (over $220 million in today's money) and still was a loser, thanks to the budget, the overruns and the advertising.Arnold even placed the blame on a shifting geopolitic theme in the United States, telling Business Insider, ""It was one of those things where President Clinton was elected and the press somehow made the whole thing kind of political where they thought, ""Okay, the '80s action guys are gone here's a perfect example,"" and they wrote this narrative before anyone saw the movie [...] The action hero era is over, Bill Clinton is in, the highbrow movies are the ""in"" thing now, I couldn't recuperate.""Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien, Prehysteria!) is a kid living with his widowed mom (Mercedes Ruehl) in the dingiest, most crime-challenged part of New York City. He escapes by watching Jack Slater movies and gets to see the new one when Nick the projectionist (Robery Proskey, Gremlins 2) gives him a ticket that once belonged to Harry Houdini.This ticket allows Danny to enter the world of Slater, where he meets his talking cat Whiskers (Danny Devito!) and wonders about his friend John Practice (F. Murray Abraham), who Danny instantly doesn't trust because he was also Salieri, the man who killed Mozart in Amadeus.Of course, because this is a movie, Slater's supervisor Dekker (Frank McRae, playing a role named for Fred Dekker and basically playing the exact same part that he did in 48 Hrs.) assigns Danny as the supercop's new partner and sends them after mobster Tony Vivaldi (Anthony Quinn!?!).After plenty of 80's cop hijinks, Charles Dance - as henchman Benedict - gets the golden ticket and leaves for our world, stranding Danny, Slater and his daughter Whitney (Bridgette Wilson). And Benedict hatches a plan - kill Arnold so that no more Slater movies can be made. And that means that Tom Noonan can show up as Slater's big bad, the Ripper. Man, Tom Noonan can be in every movie ever as far as I'm concerned.The moviemakers wanted Alan Rickman, who was too expensive, so they got Dance instead, who showed up with a shirt proclaiming ""I'm cheaper than Alan Rickman!'Also: Death from The Seventh Seal shows up and instead of Bengt Ekerot, it's Ian McKellen. This movie plays fast and loose with cameos, with everyone from Tina Turner (the mayor of Los Angeles), Sharon Stone (playing Catherine Tramell from Basic Instinct), Robert Patrick (as the T-1000), Sylvester Stallone as a Terminator, Maria Shriver, Little Richard, MC Hammer, Leeza Gibbons, James Belushi, Damon Wayans, Chevy Chase, Timothy Dalton, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Wilson Phillips showing up.What can you say about a movie that was still filming a week before it was due in theaters? This was a film against incredible odds, odds that got even worse when negative press got in the way. Director John McTiernan would tell Movieline, ""Initially, it was a wonderful Cinderella story with a nine-year-old boy. We had a pretty good script by Bill Goldman, charming. And this ludicrous hype machine got hold of it, and it got buried under bs. It was so overwhelmed with baggage. And then it was whipped out unedited, practically assembled right out of the camera. It was in the theater five or six weeks after I finished shooting. It was kamikaze, stupid, no good reason for it. And then to open the week after Jurassic Park - God! To get to the depth of bad judgment involved in that you'd need a snorkel.""McTiernan would follow this up with Die Hard with a Vengeance, so that worked out a bit better for him. Then again, he'd also film the bombs Rollerball and The 13th Warrior.Sadly, Arnold would later say that this was the beginning of the end of his movie career. But you can't make a movie this big in nine months. Seriously - it just doesn't happen.But hey - you can see both Art Carney and Professor Toru Tanaka in their last roles. And it's not a completely horrible movie. It just doesn't know what movie it wants to be. And when that much money is on the line, this is what happens.",Last Action Hero
12,bevo-13678,Wow,10,3 April 2020,This has got to be one of my favourite movies of all time. I reckon I've seen it at least once,Last Action Hero
13,hitchcockthelegend,This hero stuff has its limits.,6,13 March 2013,"Last Action Hero is directed by John McTiernan and written by Shane Black and David Arnott. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, F. Murray Abraham, Charles Dance, Tom Noonan, Austin O'Brien, Art Carney, Robert Prosky, Anthony Quinn and Bridgette Wilson. Music is by Micahel Kamen and cinematography by Dean Semler.Film within a film action parody that sees young Danny Madigan (O'Brien) magically transported into the parallel universe of an action film featuring his fictional hero, Jack Slater (Schwarzenegger). A financial failure and beaten relentlessly by the critics upon release (even McTiernan would condemn it down the line), Last Action Hero is viewed some what in better terms these days. Whilst the arguments that it was ahead of its time, misunderstood and released at the wrong time due to competition with Jurassic Park (the last one was Arnie himself, bless him) are weak and really not worth considering, it's a decent and ""intelligent"" film that could have been very good if cut by at least half an hour.Running at over two hours in length, the film's central concept of parodying action movies, with Arnold broadly laughing at himself, runs out of steam, the joke just becomes a millstone around its neck. You can see the drop in quality of the action in the last third as well, purely because so much is thrown at the audience, it gets tiresome for the director, which is such a shame given that it's McTiernan at the helm, the man who in Predator and Die Hard gave the 80s its two best American action movies.As it is, and I was helped enormously in my viewing of this because I watched it back to back with Hard Target, much of the parody and cineaste jokes strike a humorous chord. While the roll call of actors lining up to be in on the joke is impressive and often laugh out loud funny. Yet amongst all the satire and tongue in cheek wink winks, there is also some depth to the dizzying narrative that is worth appraising, particularly when the picture pitches up the real life of an actor to that of the character he plays, with one sequence as Arnie faces up to Arnie particularly brilliant.Better than you may have heard it is, but still a film that's difficult to recommend with confidence. Some self-examining depth and smart in- movie jokes ensure it's no dud, but entering the last third it becomes tiresome and routine and that leaves a disappointment that's hard to shake. 6.5/10",Last Action Hero
14,Theo Robertson,Too Much Of A Good Thing,5,9 September 2003,"Once you`ve seen one Arnold Schwarzenegger movie you`ve seen them all with only the original TERMINATOR and TOTAL RECALL having much in the way of artistic merit . In short Arnie was a one trick pony who starred in either overblown actor proof action blockbusters or instantly forgettable comedies. LAST ACTION HERO is an amalagamation of the two made at the height of Armie`s popularity and what your opinion of it is goes on what you think of a typical Arnie film For the most part I did find it slightly amusing and watchable enough with a scene of Sly Stallone as the terminator bringing a broad smile to my face , but the film is also painfully overblown , self indulgent and overlong with the humour missing the target as often as it hits . Is it just coincidence that just about everyone involved in this movie has little in the way of a Hollywood career these days ?",Last Action Hero
15,Scarecrow-88,Last Action Hero,7,29 January 2010,"I remember as a teenager at the time how Last Action Hero was deemed a major commercial flop of the proportions of Heaven's Gate & Waterworld. LAH was considered a sign of Arnold Schwarzenegger's decline in the action market, perhaps signaling to the world that he had lost his appeal. Watching it for the first time in ages, I don't know why it wasn't more successful other than it was PG-13 and more ""teen-friendly""(..as in, aimed at a younger audience and without the kind of graphic on-screen violence often associated with Arnold's 80's movies). I like how LAH pokes gleeful fun(..as does the actor himself, always winking)at the persona, image, and movies Arnold has made that led to his financial and cult success.The knowing, tongue-in-cheek script and playful performances, makes such a ridiculous action movie as LAH easy to swallow, since most of the film occurs in the ""cinematic unreal world"" of the character of Jack Slater, from the point of view of a kid who adores his films(..a representation of us who grew up watching his R-rated blood-and-guts action movies behind our parents' backs). A kid, Danny Madigan(Austin O'Brien) receives a ""magic ticket"" from a movie house proprietor whose theater is being shut down. The kid uses it to enter the world of his favorite action hero and, in turn, gets caught in the middle of Jack Slater's feud with a sadistic, glass-eyed assassin, Benedict(Charles Dance, having fun with his fiendish killer) working for an evil mafioso. As expected, plenty of car chases, explosions, and machine guns firing off rounds of ammunition, not to mention damage to buildings, vehicles, and streets as a result. I think if one might have a beef with this film, it is probably when Slater, Danny, and Benedict exit their world into the very real streets of New York City as his newest movie is about to premiere. There are some jaw-dropping action stunt set-pieces from great heights, and, as mentioned before, plenty of structural destruction wonderfully lampooning how Slater is always able to survive such devastating feats which would undoubtedly kill mortal men outside of the celluloid universe. Many might find the movie premiere of Arnold's movie quite amusing in it's inclusion of memorable Hollywood faces and how Benedict attempts to use a villain from one of the Slater series to kill the actor himself! It's a diabolical plot to erase Slater by killing the man who portrays him!I think LAH will probably find the audience today it didn't have back in '93. It's directed with a stunning versatility from a man who knows how to make action movies. Part of the movie's charm is how Danny attempts to clue Slater in on how his world is fictional, make-believe and how Slater allows him to tag along, getting themselves in grand, and dangerous adventures only a movie could concoct. Tom Noonan(..as a hideous heavy in a raincoat) and Ian McKellen(..as Death from Bergman's The Seventh Seal!) have memorable roles as fictitious characters brought to life from movies because of the magic ticket. Dance's Benedict enjoys the fact that blatant open violence in the middle of a New York City street at night after shooting an innocent man doesn't necessarily draw the attention of the police it would in the cinematic world for which he derives. The one-liners and constant nods to action movies of the past are in full force so if you hate these aspects from the genre, beware.",Last Action Hero
16,poolandrews,"""I'll be back! Ha! You didn't know I was gonna say that, did you?"" A great action film parody that's pretty clever & funny.",7,22 August 2007,"Last Action Hero starts in New York City where a film obsessed young boy named Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) is looking forward to special midnight preview of the latest Jack Slater action flick arranged for him by his projectionist friend Nick (Robert Prosky) who also gives Danny a supposedly magic gold ticket given to him by Houdini. Danny takes his seat & the film starts, the magic ticket actually does turn out to be magic & Danny is transported into the film where he meets his film idol Jack Slater (executive producer Arnold Schwarzenegger) & he becomes part of the film helping Jack avenge the murder of his favourite second cousin. However the films main bad guy Benedict (Charles Dance) gets hold of Danny's magic ticket & uses it transport himself into the real world where the bad guy's can actually win unlike in the movies...Co-produced & directed by John McTiernan after Steven Spielberg turned the chance to direct down to make Schindler's List (1993) I really rather enjoyed Last Action Hero & I must confess I'm at a loss as to why it was so badly received when it was originally released. The script by Shane Black & David Arnott is actually a very knowing & clever parody of the mega budget Hollywood action flick for which star Schwarzenegger is most famous for & I thought it was very funny to see him parody & make fun of himself, in particular at the end when the real Arnold Schwarzenegger is being interviewed at his films premiere & he says his new film is more responsible because they only kill 48 people in it rather than 148 or when during the same scene he tries to plug his own Planet Hollywood restaurants! I really liked some of the ideas here like the fact the film world Danny finds himself in is populated by beautiful model like women which he comments on or that in the film a wound which would have killed Schwarzenegger in real life is seen as nothing more than a flesh wound! The filmmakers have great fun sending up the action film as a whole from the puns to the fact the character of Jack Slater is running out of family members so the bad guy's have to kill his second cousin! Then when Danny brings Schwarzenegger back into the real world & he tries to smash a car window with his hand he actually feels pain, the scenes on top of the roof where Schwarzenegger is holding onto the cable & rescues Danny slightly ruins the stance taken by the filmmakers as it imitates & essentially copies what it's been parodying & trying to send up but what the hell the film as a whole is great entertainment that pokes all sorts of light hearted fun at the action flick in general. I never thought I'd say this but Last Action Hero is a clever & very knowing Schwarzenegger film that might go on for a bit too long but when a films this much fun who cares?Director McTiernan does a good job & there are plenty of over-the-top action scenes, car chases, shoot outs, explosions & fights amongst all the countless film references & homages from E.T. (1982) to Lethal Weapon (1987). There are also lots of fun cameo appearances from the likes of Jean-Claude Van Damme, James Belushi, Chevy Chase, Sharon Stone leaving a police station & Robert Patrick dressed as an LAPD cop like his role in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) as the T-1000! There are so many gags & visual references for action film junkies to spot there's no way you'll spot them all the first time you watch it, I just think this is an action packed film which doesn't take itself too seriously & is great fun to watch.With a supposed budget of about $85,000,000 this flopped at the box-office with very negative critical & audience reactions which is a shame because I really liked it for what it is, making only $16,000,000 at the box-office bad word of mouth & opening the same weekend as Steven Spielberg's monster hit Jurassic Park (1993) probably were the main reasons why & Schwarzenegger's $15,000,000 he was paid didn't help the budget either. It's well made with plenty of big bangs & big names on screen for your money, the acting is alright & even the kid didn't annoy me.Last Action Hero is a really good slice of light hearted action that uses the genres clichés to amusing effect & there's even a message here about real life being very different to what happens in films & there are consequences if you try to smash a car window with your fist! I know a lot of people don't like Last Action Hero so I won't say you definitely will but I think it's a film that's worth a watch if nothing else, to be safe watch it on TV or rent it rather than buy it & you may just like it.",Last Action Hero

18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,People weren't expecting this,6,1 June 2009,"I realize that any movie on here that has an average-to-low rating has at least one person saying ""it wasn't that bad"" or something along those lines, however, I'd say that at least part of the blame for the reception of this was that it wasn't what viewers thought it would be. The names attached to it promised a run-of-the-mill effort, and this can't be taken entirely as that. This is parody, but the fans might not have cared for that... and those that would like it might have skipped it, thinking that it was what it made fun of(a disguise that it does wear rather convincingly). The in-jokes, references, clever material, puns and intentional clichés tend to work marvelously. The sound is utterly spot-on throughout. The acting is fitting with no real exceptions. The music is well-chosen and cool. McTiernan and Arnie, as the director and lead, respectively, are perfect, they know the genre, understand it(and have a sense of humor about it), and the self-irony and tone that they add is immensely valuable to this. You don't spoof action flicks with comedy people who thinks they ""get it"", you use experts in the field who don't take themselves too seriously. The biggest drawback of this is that it is just too long, and while the steam lasts the duration, the audience's patience and interest do not. The pacing is also a bit uneven. This comes off as confused about what exactly it wants to be, at points. The plot isn't bad. The violence is mild. Sex is limited to eye-candy. Language is relatively plentiful and moderate. I recommend this to all who wish to watch a send-up of of the type of feature that most expected this to be. 6/10",Last Action Hero
19,view_and_review,Actor Playing Actor Playing Hero,8,11 October 2019,"Last Action Hero was a creative zany movie that poked fun at movies in general and action movies in particular. This was no spoof film but it was close. The way the movie was done you got Arnold Schwarzenegger playing Arnold Schwarzenegger playing Jack Slater.This odd scenario began when a boy was given a magical movie ticket. The ticket allowed Danny (Austin O'Brien) to enter the Schwarzenegger film he was watching and be a part of the action. Being that he was now in movieland he got to be a part of the absurd things that happen in action movies.When one of the movie bad guys got a hold of Danny's magical ticket he was able to exit the movie world and enter the ""real"" world. This is where the irony was compounded. Slater and Danny pursued this bad guy into the ""real"" world as well, but very little changed as far as unrealistic action movie occurrences. Yes, Slater was slightly more vulnerable, but for the most part he was still able to do all of those things that you'd expect an action hero to do.The movie was still a fun and creative movie. It allowed us to watch a cliché action movie without rolling our eyes. The little boy, Danny, was a tad annoying, but that was the only real drawback. Besides his less than stellar acting performance the movie was good. We got to see Arnold playing an oblivious action hero as he continued to defy the laws of nature on screen... on screen.",Last Action Hero
20,neil-476,Clever underrated action comedy,8,11 April 2010,"There was this actor called Arnold Schwarzenegger, see. He was Austrian, and he wasn't actually that good an actor, but he was very impressive physically and had tremendous screen presence. As a result he ended up making a string of action movies which traded on that presence: they grew in popularity until he became the top box office draw in the world.And, when he was at the height of his popularity, he made Last Action Hero.In Last Action Hero, Schwarzenegger plays Jack Slater, who is exactly the sort of character Schwarzenegger plays. Oh, and himself.The main character is young Danny Madigan, who finds himself in possession of a magic cinema ticket which takes him into Jack Slater's movie world. It also enables both Slater and Slater film villain Benedict to come into the real world, where the rules are somewhat different - bullet wounds can be fatal, and villains sometimes win.This film is original, visually great fun, and is full - crammed, absolutely jam-packed - with movie-based gags and references.I saw it when it first came out, and I loved every second of it. I was absolutely mystified at the negativity towards it at the time, and I could only put it down to people simply not getting it.So the verdict is - if you get the joke, you'll love it (and familiarity with a lot of movies, particularly from the action genre).

21,HotToastyRag,Best action spoof ever,9,19 May 2018,"Anyone who loves classic, cheesy action movies from the 1980s and 1990s probably owns a copy of Last Action Hero, an absolutely darling spoof of the genre starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. Younger kids might not like it very much, since they've grown up on a different type of action movie, but older millennials and Generation X will totally love it. In the movie, Austin O'Brien is a preteen who has recently lost his father. His mother, Mercedes Ruehl, wants him to spend less time at the movies and more time concentrating on his studies, but boys will be boys, and Austin sneaks out in the middle of the night to watch an advanced screening of the latest installment of his favorite action film franchise, similar to Die Hard. The owner of the movie theater, Robert Prosky, gives Austin a magical ticket, and before he knows what's happening, Austin gets transported into the movie! He gets to pal around with the main character Arnold Schwarzenegger, laugh at the cheesy puns, unrealistic fight scenes, gorgeous bimbos, and plot holes in the script. It's a laugh a minute, and Shane Black's and David Arnott's script hilariously pokes fun of the real actors as well as the genre as a whole. For example, Austin O'Brien tries to convince character-Arnold that he's just a character in a movie, and he actually tells him that an actor named Arnold Schwarzenegger plays him! Character-Arnold has never heard of actor-Arnold, so they go to a video store to rent one of his famous movies. Inside they see a cardboard cutout advertisement of Terminator 2, starring Sylvester Stallone! In the movie universe, actor-Arnold doesn't exist. When Austin meets F. Murray Abraham in the movie universe, he immediately recognizes him and tries to warn Arnold that he's the bad guy because he killed Mozart. Anthony Quinn, who spent a career playing not very intelligent ethnic characters, plays the quintessential Italian mob boss, who always mixes his metaphors-a fourth wheel, in front of the eight-ball, etc.-much to the irritation of his evil cohort, Charles Dance. If by some miracle you lived through the 80s and 90s and haven't seen Last Action Hero, buy yourself a copy-I did it the old school way and bought a VHS-and get ready for a total laugh fest.",Last Action Hero

Slater and Danny must join forces and travel back and stop him at all costs before it'll be the end of Jack Slater!Last Action Hero or the one that almost ruined Arnie, is a strange beast, beating movies like Scream and Cursed by years. The media and marketing for this movie was all wrong, back in the day, an Arnie movie opening in the summer was a guaranteed hit, and not many other actors at the time could garner a big opening.But it flopped, because people didn't get it, and therefore didn't like it. It was advertised as some fantasy action movie, but it's more of a love in for all action movies ever made.There are so many references to movies, the makers of Spaced would be proud, and Schwarzenegger is fantastic as Slater, really sending himself up all the way through the movie. The on-liners are poor, and the editing is intentionally bad, but this is why the film is so much fun.Dance looks like he is having a whale of a time playing Benedict, and it's all sunny and summery all the what through.This was a typical blockbuster that ironically, didn;t bust any blocks.Give it a go, you will be surprised.",Last Action Hero

In fact, overall, I think it is an okay movie, which could have been a lot better.  I like Arnold and his movies, I think he is a good and fun actor to watch...is he Oscar caliber?  No, but I still enjoy his performances and this movie is no different.  His performance is an Arnold typical performance.  One of the main problems with this one is the kid.  I found him really annoying and he took the attention away from Arnold, but not in a very good way.  In fact, I enjoyed the whole Arnold as a cop routine, I think that would have been a very good movie...even making it sort of a spoof would have been good.  It is just the whole magic ticket thing and the kid kind of bog down the movie.  This story has the kid going into a movie where Arnold is the star, and the last part of this movie is set back in the ""real"" world.  By this time though I was thinking ""shouldn't this be over"".  The whole movie could have been a success and another blockbuster for Arnold if it was without the kid and the magic and the movie world and all that stuff.

This film is about 5 years too late, it would have been great back in the 80's, however the crash, chase, gunfight, blowup, action film has been so overdone, it hurts this film out of repetition.  Like an old joke where you know the punch line.  I love the satire part of the film, where it pokes fun at itself.

28,Smells_Like_Cheese,"""You wanna be a farmer? Here's a couple of acres!""",8,29 January 2010,"I remember watching on the biography channel and Arnold Schwarzenegger was on, so I decided to watch it. It's weird, I've seen so many of his movies, but I never saw Last Action Hero. They said that this movie was a huge flop and got nothing but bad reviews, so maybe that's why my parents never showed me this movie. But I decided to go ahead and watch it on my own and you know something? I loved it! Sure, it doesn't come without flaws, but I really enjoyed this movie and don't understand it's bad reputation. I think it's a spoof on action movies and how silly they are when you compare to what real life is. When you watch an action movie like Commando, Die Hard or First Blood, they take you out of our world and into an exciting one where the good guys always win and all is well with the world. Last Action Hero takes a clever idea where we have every action cliché and it's pointed out and makes for a very funny story and some comedic situations that are a good homage to our favorite action movies.Danny Madigan is magically transported into the surreal world of an action film featuring his fictional idol, Jack Slater; Slater is the hero of the Jack Slater film series, a fearless LAPD detective. Nick, a movie theater projector, invites Danny to a private screening of Jack Slater IV and gives him a magic ticket. Before the movie, Nick tears the ticket in half, gives one half to Danny, and puts the other in the ticket box. A few minutes into Slater IV, Danny's ticket stub begins to glow, and some dynamite from within the movie flies out of the screen, lands near Danny, and explodes. When Danny wakes up, he is in the back seat of Slater's car. He tries to convince Slater that they are in a movie, but Slater sees nothing unusual about his world. Jack doesn't believe him, but when one of the villains figures out with Danny knows so much about the world, he goes into Danny's world to destroy Slater in a different way where the bad guys always win.Now my only complaint being is that this movie is too long, we start off with Danny going into the action movie and him pointing out every cliché which was just great, he and Arnold had awesome chemistry, but then when they go into the villain going into Danny's world, we have another half of the story that could have been shorter. Jack Slater finding out his fictional, we didn't need so much sulking for an action movie. Also at the end where we're in our reality, it does turn into a bit of an action movie that goes back into clichés. But despite it's flaws, I still had a great time with this movie, it has some good laughs. I loved the part where the villain is in New York City and it's our reality, he shoots someone and screams in a public street that he killed a man and someone shouts out for him to shut up was just classic. Arnold also fighting Arnold(as Jack Slater) in reality was so funny as well. I loved this movie, I took it for what it was and really had a good time watching it. Give the movie a fair chance, if you're an action movie fan like I am, I'm sure you love Last Action Hero too.8/10",Last Action Hero
29,MovieAddict2016,Totally misunderstood and underrated,10,23 November 2005,"""Last Action Hero"" was one of the most commercially-publicized films of 1993. Millions upon millions were pushed into the extravagant advertising campaign, which included a blimp with Arnold's face being flown over the premiere. (According to the biography ""Fantastic: The Life of Arnold Schwarzenegger"" by Laurence Leamer.) However, it was being released in the throes of Arnie controversy - Sly Stallone, Arnie's enemy, had devoted millions of his own cash to exploiting Arnold as a Nazi in the hopes of ruining his prospering film career. Sly paid off a tabloid reporter (in secret - the truth only emerged years later) to dig up evidence on Arnie's father - and some contribute this smear campaign to the failure of ""Last Action Hero."" For some reason, it is regarded as one of cinema's biggest failures, when in fact it grossed $50 million past its budget of $85 mil in theaters alone, bringing its worldwide gross to $137,298,489. Not exactly a flop, considering it also brought in quite a bit of cash once it reached the home video market.In Hollywood, someone hears something and it becomes truth. It has become a fact that ""Last Action Hero"" was one of the biggest flops of all-time, even though it wasn't.And, much like its box office intake, the critical reception of the film was vastly misunderstood. ""Last Action Hero"" is brilliant satire - spoofing all the clichés and inner-workings of all action films, but most specifically Arnold Schwarzenegger's - beginning with Jack Slater (Arnold) going to his cousin's house: a bomb goes off, kills two nearby cops (one an aging black man days from retirement), but Arnie is left unscathed. Then he devotes his life to tracking down the killer.This film is being watched by a young child in a movie theater. His idol is Jack Slater, and soon he gets a magic movie ticket from an old theater owner and finds himself magically transported into the cinematic world. He becomes Slater's willing sidekick - the catch, however, is that Slater is unaware that he is a fictional character, and doesn't believe the child's ""lies"" about his origins.""Last Action Hero"" was directed by John McTiernan (""Predator"") and set back his career a few years; he found trouble headlining major productions again (indeed, he also went on to direct the 2002 flop ""Rollerball"").However, the satire of ""Last Action Hero"" is sharp and consistent. For anyone who has ever seen an action film, there's plenty to laugh at here - from the movie in-jokes (I love the F-word bit), to the Hollywood/celeb jokes (loads of cameos!), to the satire of violence and its influence on children, and so on and so forth.The only fault of the film is its ending - the last twenty minutes are a bit sloppy. The symbolism is too obvious (Jack is brought into the real world) and doesn't work out so well. It's not horrible, but it doesn't close off the film as well as it should.When ""Last Action Hero"" flopped in '93, Arnold made a statement claiming his intentions of satirizing violence had backfired and the result made him feel uneasy. He basically said the idea of having a child in the middle of the film's events disturbed him and ""didn't work out"" the way he had planned.I beg to differ. I think it works brilliantly, and if you're a film buff, you should appreciate this underrated movie all the more. It's one of Arnie's most daring and unique films - how ironic that it was one of his least successful motion pictures. In fact, it's all the more ironic that a movie satirizing the banality of Hollywood fails to make a fuss at the box office.",Last Action Hero
30,lost-in-limbo,"""I don't do fiction.""",7,22 July 2011,"Kind of a flop when released, but I always had a soft spot for this mega send-up action blockbuster by John McTeirnan which had Arnold Schwarzenegger (an ideal choice) going up against the devilish Charles Dance. Oh and let's not forget Anthony Quinn, Frank McRea, Robert Prosky, F. Murray Abraham, Bridgette Wilson, Art Carney, Tom Noonan and Ian McKellen. That's just to name a few, as there's plenty more showcase cameos and some stars are playing themselves. The cast is great, as everyone looks like they're enjoying its satirical film within a film structure. Real-life characters mixing it with fictional ones. ""No sequel for you"". This gave the biting material plenty of ammo to mock, but also glorifying its dissection of the conventions / clichés that drive action features. It's a parody with numerous in-jokes (probably why it didn't score with an audience), but a messy one making it an amusing bemusement of ideas, gags and encounters. You could say at times it's like having your cake and eating it too. At least the fun is there, as it shows in McTeirnan's execution. Colourful, zany and gung-ho all the way. The noisily pulsating action comes thick and fast, with punches, bullets and explosions coming off the screen. It's ballsy comic-book nonsense. The stunt-work is spectacularly staged. Schwarzenegger as Jack Slater, the ultimate action hero was a blast with his constant one-liners (""To be or not to be?"" ""Not to be"") and Austin O'Brien is likable as the movie buff lad who gets transported into the movie of his favourite action hero where he finds himself in the heart of the action. ""Last Action Hero"" is nothing more, nothing less than enjoyable Hollywood popcorn entertainment.""Holy cow, I'm in the movie!""",Last Action Hero
31,Robert_duder,Fun cheeky spoof movie that has gained a cult status,7,11 August 2013,"One of the best things about Last Action Hero is that the more you read about it, you realize the smarter it is. There are so many little nods and cheeky references to the action genre and to Hollywood that you can't possibly catch them all the first time around. It appears, on the surface, to be this huge action film but really the entire film is poking fun at the genre. And who better to bring on board to do that but the King of eighties action Arnold Schwarzenegger. There is so much right about this film. The scenes with Arnold playing himself and the interaction between him and ""Jack Slater"" are just awesome. The cameos and the world they create inside the movie is just so much fun to watch. The problem is that the film is almost too much of a joke. Fans of Schwarzenegger and action films might find their genre being made a total fool of a bit much to handle. And also one of the leading roles is really not good but more on that in a minute. It is definitely a PG-13 movie and while there is nothing wrong with that, it feels like it struggles to purposely try to stay PG and it has trouble doing that.I love Arnold Schwarzenegger, he has just always been one of my Hollywood icons. This is such an odd role for him because he is making fun of himself and what he does best. However, it works well and he is actually fun as Slater. He is especially fun in the brief scenes where is ""playing"" or ""over-playing"" himself. The banter between him and real life wife/ex-wife Maria Shriver is just awesome. Austin O'Brien is the young actor portraying Schwarzenegger's partner and his fan as well. O'Brien is unfortunately the character I mentioned previously that really holds back this film. He is simply unnatural and gives a strained and poor performance. It just is very underwhelming. The chemistry between him and Schwarzenegger is nearly awful and that would be the key point to this movie. Charles Dance is very good as the evil villain Benedict. He is over the top but looks menacing and certainly is the perfect personification of an action movie villain. Tom Noonan is also good as the twisted Ripper villain who is also an amped up spoof of a slasher villain. Everyone else in the film are basically cameos but there are some really good ones worth mentioning. F. Murray Abraham, Art Carney, Frank McRae, Robert Prosky, Anthony Quinn and even Ian McKellan are just a few of the faces you will recognize and they give good solid campy performances.If there was any director they should have gotten to direct this film it would be John McTiernan. Die Hard, Predator, The Hunt For Red October, Die Hard 3, Medicine Man...and more. Every action film he has done has at least been decent so he was the perfect choice to do this film and poke fun at the genre. The action scenes are well done and yet overdone at the same time (which granted is the point.) Last Action Hero is fun and exciting but is held back by making fun of itself almost too much. Still, it is a modern day cult classic and more and more people are calling it under-rated and when you look at some of the hidden Easter eggs in the film, it becomes even more fascinating and fun. 7/10",Last Action Hero
32,ElMaruecan82,Stupidity stops where its own awareness starts ...,8,6 September 2013,"I believe that principle applies for both people and movies. And this is why parody generally provides the cleverest films, mocking the archetypes over-exploited by lazy directors with a subtle, and so engaging, wink to the audience.And ""Last Action Hero"" parodies the action-flick, featuring its most iconic ambassador, Arnold Schwarzenegger as the lone-ranger bad-ass cigar-smoking titular hero of a never-ending franchise: Jack Slater. As if he was plenty aware that ""Die Hard"" put a deathblow on the credibility of such super-heroic figures popularized by ""Commando"" and ""Predator"", John McTiernan becomes the iconoclast of his own creations -a demonstration of smart sense of humor a few directors ever achieved.The opening ""Jack Slater"" film even concludes with a reference to the genre-defining ""Die Hard"", using the same score to contribute to the whole 'inside joke' effect, completed when Jack Slater becomes a movie-within-a-movie character, from the perspective of Danny, his number one fan, played by Austin O'Brien. Basically, Danny is to ""Last Action Hero"" what Cecilia (Mia Farrow) was to ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"": a movie lover whose only means to transcend routine's banality was a constant ecstatic stare toward the silver screen. And being a kid of the early 90's, I could only respond to his hypnotic fascination.Action films are indeed the best pop-culture fillers, crystallizing the most common denominators of fun and entertainment and generating codes and formula that are part of cinema's timeless and universal heritage, no matter how overused they are: the never-dying hero, the yelling superior, the revenge plot, the villainous monologue, the sexy daughter, the comic-relief sidekick, the sophisticated boss' right hand who becomes the real villain and a lame catchphrase. They're all there in ""Last Action Hero"" less because they're obligatory but for the necessity to turn them into derision, by confronting them to reality.Still, there has to be some fantasy in this reality: Danny is given by the projectionist Nick (Art Carney) a magic ticket that belonged to the Great Houdini. And while he watches the fourth opus of Jack Slater's adventures during a private screening, the ticket glows, sticks of dynamite are thrown from the screen and land near his feet. Danny starts to take the notion of 'danger' less cynically before the explosion immediately projects him into his hero's universe. The film's greatest moments come from Danny's desperate attempts to convince Slater that they live in a movie where phone numbers start with ""555"", video-store workers are sexy and profanity is prohibited. Hell, in this parallel universe, his own rival Stallone played the Terminator roles (which made me wonder who then played Rocky or Rambo).The film recycles every cliché in such an over-the-top way it's hilarious: the car rams into an ice cream truck and explodes, a henchman gets an ice cone on the neck, many gags feel like these 'McBain' segments from ""The Simpsons"", thus never fail. The film also features one hilarious modernization of ""Hamlet"" and two delightful movie references. One of Slater's friends is played by F. Murray Abraham, naturally, Danny warns him that it's the same guy who killed Mozart in ""Amadeus"": the film that got 8 Oscars. For a kid, he has the knowledge of an IMDb user, which says a lot about ""Last Action Hero"" exhilarating effect as pure geek escapism, reinforced by the obscure intrusion of Death from ""The Seventh Seal"", a joke I didn't even get when I saw the film as a teenager.Now, there are two facts regarding ""Last Action Hero"": the film flopped, and it didn't deserve to, not when box-office laws are governed by rules that allow ""Cliffhanger"" to be the 7th highest grossing film anyway. Therefore, I can only qualify its bombing as 'accidental', the same accident that made ""Sorcerer"" flop in 1977. The parallel is all the more eloquent because ""Last Action Hero"" suffered from an ill-fated opening coinciding with the big event of 1993: the release of Steven Spielberg's ""Jurassik park"" (""Sorcerer"" had it worse with ""Star Wars"") and perhaps misleading title, trailer and word-of-mouth that branded the film in the total opposite way it expected to: a dumb action film, 'another one'.I don't blame the viewers who thought a bunch of reptilian carnivores would be a fresher spectacle, I, was misled too, the first time I saw the TV announcement. But being a box-office flop is one thing, but when I started to examine the disastrous reception –from those who actually saw the film- I was stunned. Seriously, what's with all these Razzies' nominations? Worst actor? Arnold had to play his usual role. Worst screenplay? Check the review's title. Worst new star? That's the worst thing about vocation-discouraging Razzies: the kid was supposed to be annoying and he played that part quite well. Worst song? It's a cheesy action-flick, did they expect Barbra Streisand? ""Last Action Hero"" is not beyond criticism though especially in the last act, when they 'get' in the real world. It's true that the film could have pushed its self-reflexive concept to more thought-provoking levels, that the emotional involvement lacked when the action was conditioned by predictable plot devices and needed to be compensated in the 'real world'. It's also true that confronting Slater to Arnold (like in Woody Allen's film) or having Danny talking to him, could have induced more interesting situations, but the reception would make anyone believe the film is like ""Stop or my Mom Will Shoot!"".Talk about unfortunate misunderstanding, not that I believe it truly deserves this 8, but it makes up for the undeserved negativity it inspired. McTiernan would finally make the highest-grossing film of 1995: ""Die Hard 3 With a Vengeance"" which feels like his personal vengeance. The film is as corny and over-the-top as ""Last Action Hero"" but I guess the average audience wasn't ready for that level of subtlety, so he probably thought : ""Hell, give them the movie they deserve and give me a break"".",Last Action Hero
33,Pjtaylor-96-138044,To be or not to be...,7,25 March 2020,"'Last Action Hero (1993)' is a bit of a self-eating snake; it's half 80s action movie, half magical fantasy and one-hundred percent self-aware. The piece follows a film-obsessed teen who gets sucked into the fourth instalment of his favourite franchise after receiving a magical ticket from a theatre owner who claims to have been gifted it by Houdini himself. The film is silly, to say the least, but it knows this, relishing in its mad-cap action and no-time-to-explain plot. For the most part, the piece is an enjoyable and pacy adventure. It does slow down considerably towards its final movement, though, as the plot comes screeching to a halt right when it seems to be coming to a climax. Still, its actual climax is worth the wait; it's entertaining, funny and ultimately satisfying, even if it does come dangerously close to self-gratification on more than one occasion. The denouement is oddly protracted, too, as a certain movie character comes to life in a completely unnecessary cameo that just feels plain weird. Generally, though, the picture is fun throughout. Its solid performances, over-the-top action and mostly successful comedy should put a smile on your face. 7/10",Last Action Hero
34,bowmanblue,Officially one of the most underrated movies of all time,9,17 February 2015,"And, when I say 'officially,' I basically mean I think it is and that I've seen a fair few other people say that too on the internet. But, anyway, back in the late eighties and early nineties Arnold Schwarzenegger really couldn't do much wrong in terms of Box Office revenue. Then, from out of nowhere (and fresh off the back of arguably his biggest hit ever – Terminator 2) came 'The Last Action Hero.' How could it fail, people asked. It did. Well, it did... sort of.It wasn't a huge commercial disaster and probably made its money back and, when you factor into video sales (and probably DVD and Blu Ray by now) it pretty much did all right. It was just it was hyped and many felt that it didn't live up to its hype. And, when I say 'many' I kind of mean the film critics of 1993. Basically, they didn't like it. And they made their feelings clear.The plot of Last Action Hero is a little more complicated than Arnie's millions of fans were used to. Normally, he just kills one bad guy after another, pausing only to say a dry quip before carrying on the slaughter. Well, Last Action Hero certainly follows suit there – he probably kills more people that in Commando, Total Recall and Predator put together (not to mention more witty one-liners). However, the difference here was that the film was a parody of what Arnie was known for. And it just didn't seem to sit right with the critics. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays 'Jack Slater' – a fictional super-cop in an action movie inside this action movie. Confused yet? The 'real world' is inhabited by Arnold/Jack's biggest fan – a young boy named Danny who comes into the possession of a magic ticket which allows him to be transported into the 'Jack Slater film' itself and ride along with his on-screen hero, literally 'in-screen.' Then, just when we're secure in the 'movie world' Danny has found himself in, the 'baddie' of the Jack Slater film only goes and gets his hand on the magic ticket, allowing him to cross over into our 'real' world, forcing Danny and Jack to follow him through. And, once in the 'real world' things work differently and Jack finds punching through glass windows slightly more painful than he used to on screen.Therefore, we're treated to countless 'in-jokes' and movie references that you'll only really understand if you know, love and generally appreciate that action movies are pretty far-fetched at the best of times and very over the top. In fact, rather than being an all out no-brainer action movie, the Last Action Hero is actually quite a clever satire (wrapped up in explosions and car chases). There was a theory thrown around in 1993 that critics didn't like seeing film itself mocked on the big screen. I don't know whether that was true or whether Last Action Hero was just a little bit too different, or too ahead of its time.Plus I think people did tend to wonder who the film was aimed at. If you look at the cheery marketing poster that famously accompanied the film, it kind of looks like a happy-go-lucky action romp, similar to Indiana Jones, i.e. something for all the family. It's not. It's much darker. There's plenty of killing and references to films that no younger audience would appreciate. Therefore it's a film starring a kid that's for adults. And that's always a hard sell.But, as I sort of alluded to at the beginning, Last Action Hero has kind of matured over the years. Now many regard it as a classic. Granted it may not be 'pure' action like many of Arnie's fans were used to, but it is action better than that. It combines great actions sequences with clever humour and pokes gentle fun at its own genre. Quite a rarity really. If you like Arnie you should like this. Also, if you like action films in general, you're going to get double out of it. It seems that Last Action Hero does have more than just a few loyal fans out there who refuse to let it be forgotten. Hercules in New York it will never be. And I for one am glad of that.",Last Action Hero
35,lesleyharris30,"Simply not as Fun as it Could have Been,",5,18 March 2015,"Last Action Hero is a mediocre movie with an interesting and unique storyline and a cast that all sadly didn't work out as well as it should have. The concept of the movie seemed like a lot of fun, and while I will admit there were many parts that brought me genuine joy, there simply wasn't enough of it. The best parts was when the humour was very over the top and strange, such as Schwarzenegger playing himself in one scene and the animated cat, but there simply wasn't enough of this and it took itself too seriously at times for such a ridiculous film. Arnold Schwarzenegger is certainly the movies highlight, he has proved before with movies like Twins that he can do comedy, and his performance in this is no exception, his character made me laugh the most, as he was basically mocking the films he has done the most of, action, the child in the lead role, however, is very unlikeable. It has its moments, but the Last Action Hero had much more potential than what it delivers, because of this disappointment and its overlong run time, I simply can't recommend it. After being given a golden movie ticket, a young boy is sucked in to the universe of his favourite action film franchise.

36,CuriosityKilledShawn,"An intelligent, under-rated and over-looked satire",8,31 January 2011,"It's sad to think that 18 years after its release Last Action Hero is still trying to find its target audience. Audiences don't like smart movies. Or perhaps I should say audiences don't like to be OUTSMARTED by movies. In the summer of 1993 the world was going crazy for a certain dinosaur movie, almost everything else didn't stand a chance. LAH came out a week after Jurassic Park. The only people who really went to see it were those who were too late for sold-out screenings of Spielberg's movie. Bad word of mouth spread for many reasons.Those lucky enough to actually see it on the big screen walked away confused and disorientated. They thought they were in for a straight-up action movie, not an existential, meta-fictional parody of the genre they cherish. It was just too much and they weren't ready for it. Arnold had been riding the wave of Total Recall and Terminator 2 before the release of Last Action Hero, no one expected such a radical deviation from the norm.Danny Madigan is a lonely kid living in a tiny New York apartment with his single MILF. His only friend is Nick, an old-time projectionist at a run down theater (a REAL theater, no multiplex nonsense). Danny likes to escape into the world of action movies, his biggest hero, obviously, being Arnie himself. The latest Arnie blockbuster, the simply-titled Jack Slater IV, is a day away from its premiere, and old Nick has been tasked with checking the print. Before Danny sits down for his own personal pre-premiere midnight screening Nick gives him a magical ticket he's been saving since childhood. Five minutes after Jack Slater IV begins Danny is warped into the cinema screen and becomes part of the movie.In the movie world Danny quickly learns that the laws of physics and simple logic don't apply (how often has THAT proved to be true?). He's partnered with Slater, a renegade L.A. cop and the absolute zenith of action hero stereotypes, to find who killed his favorite second-cousin Frank (BIG MISTAKE!). Danny and Slater smash their way into a hokey, James Bond-ish plot, though it's not long before suave English henchman Mr. Benedict discovers Danny's secret and plans to escape to the real world. Danny and Slater follow, but Slater's movie-world abilities are rendered useless in reality. Doubt begins seep in for the first time as he ends up questioning his powers as a good cop.Last Action Hero scores huge points all round. It's technically wonderful, with gorgeous anamorphic Panavision photography full of wide angles and lens flares. The writing is sharp is funny. Arnie is great as an infallible hero in crisis as well as making fun of his screen persona. And the action, both fictional and meta-fictional, is wild, overblown, and exciting. I just love Slater's huge fall from the elevator.It's interesting to note that it has a lot in common with Loaded Weapon, which came out earlier that year. Both are send-ups of the 'L.A. cop movie' genre, both star F. Murray Abraham in supporting roles. Both feature Frank McRae as a screaming Lieutenant. Both have obvious Die Hard references (also directed by the infamous John McTiernan).The bad reputation is unjustified. The financial loss was a mistake entirely on Sony's part and their lack of foresight into the 1993 summer season. Last Action Hero and Jurassic Park went head-to-head with their advertising but the dinosaur movie's marketing campaign was just too groundbreaking. They also competed with each other on a technical level. JP was the first film to feature DTS sound, while Last Action Hero was the first to feature SDDS (Sony Dynamic Digital Sound), an eight-channel system that delivers every decibel of Slater's big gun and the multiple explosions of his daily life.It may be a satire, but Last Action Hero just may be one of the last true action films. Real stunts, real explosions, real destruction, reality gone twisted. It's Arnold's most subversive movie, and it's many things, but bad ain't one of them.",Last Action Hero

Plot In A Paragraph: With the help of a magic ticket, a young film fan is transported into the fictional world of his favorite action film character.Both Arnie and director John McTeirnan were riding high when they teamed up for what Arnie promised would be ""The biggest movie of the summer"" sadly it didn't deliver, and whilst people liked it, nobody really loved it, and all anybody remembers is it tanked/under performed and Jurassic Park killed it. Which for me is more than a bit unfair, as I do enjoy it. I don't rewatch it often, but when I do, I enjoy it for what it is.I think a lot of people miss the joke with this, in that, it is intended as a spoof!! I know I'll be in the minority, in liking it!! For me it's simply fun. I love all the little movie references. It may not be Arnie or McTiernan's finest work, but it is amusing if you get the humour. The jokes and cameos are OK, and Arnie'self-parody is just great. Truthfully not all of the jokes work, but over all it's enjoyable, Last Action Hero grossed $50 million at the domestic Box Office to end the year the 26th highest grossing movie of 1993.

40,sol-,Through the Fourth Wall,7,4 November 2017,"Transported into the cinematic world of his favourite action hero, a young film fanatic struggles to convince the character that his life is one big movie in this ambitious exercise in meta/self-referential filmmaking starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. Not well received upon initial release, the film arguably tackles a bit too much for its own good. It is not only an action movie spoof, but a fourth wall breaking exercise, a surrogate father/son tale and a personal identity drama as the action hero gradually comes to accept that his world is make-believe. If messy and uneven, 'Last Action Hero' is nevertheless a lot of fun. The opening sequence is a bit of a spoof of director John McTiernan's 'Die Hard' and the preteen protagonist even comments on a situation being like in 'Die Hard' towards the end! There are also amusing moments to be had from the boy recognising F. Murray Abraham as the man who ""killed Mozart"", him imagining Schwarzenegger in Laurence Olivier's 'Hamlet' and a zany sequence involving Bergman's 'The Seventh Seal' near the end. The best moments though come from Schwarzenegger poking fun at himself and constantly mispronouncing his own name.",Last Action Hero

42,tomgillespie2002,A curious oddity,5,19 February 2012,"When young Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) is given a magic movie ticket by friendly cinema owner Nick (Robert Prosky) at an advance screening of new action movie Jack Slater IV, he is magically transported into the movie and into the car of supercop Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Danny starts to inform Slater about who the bad guys are after seeing them on screen, and the two are paired up as a mismatched investigative duo by Slater's screaming boss. Glass-eyed bad guy Mr. Benedict (Charles Dance) manages to get his hands on the magic ticket, and escapes into the real world, where he finds things are much easier for the bad guys. Slater must leave his action movie cliché of a world where he is nigh on invincible behind, and enter one where things are slightly more difficult.Last Action Hero had one of the most expensive and turbulent page-to- screen stories in recent cinema history. Originally written as a self- mocking action movie that embraced the clichés of the genre, that was also a proper action movie in its own right. After an unexpected bidding war, the young scribes Zak Penn and Adam Leff were shocked to find that Arnold Schwarzenegger had taken a personal interest in it (the original hero name was Arno Slater). This was to be the turning point. Arnie saw the potential for a franchise as a kid's film and immediately wanted to tone down the violence, so Penn and Leff were fired, and genre legend Shane Black was hired to spruce up the script. Things changed yet again when director John McTiernan was brought in, and, due to the success of his previous films, was given full control.A few script re-writes, firings, and storm-outs later, the film was shot and ready to hit the market. A toy franchise and a ridiculously expensive and calamitous advertising campaign (they paid half a million dollars to have the film's name on a NASA rocket, only to have the launched delayed till long after the film's release) were put into motion, and the film's release date was announced for the week after Jurassic Park's. Last Action Hero had disastrous test screenings, but the release date was not changed, and naturally, Jurassic Park stormed the box-office and merchandising range, and Last Action Hero was revealed to be an over-ambitious, confused dud of a movie. However, the legend is rather cruel on Schwarzenegger's biggest flop, as although it is a gigantic mess, it has plenty of interesting ideas than are unfortunately spewed out onto the film in ungraceful belches.The biggest problem is that it doesn't know what kind of film it is. At its heart, its a kid's film, complete with annoying mop-haired child, a kindly old man, magic tickets and, um, a cartoon cat. Yet on its surface, its a rather uninspired action film that is actually rather violent and, once in the real world, is quite grim. The film never seems to know whether it wants to homage, spoof or simply in-joke. The movie world it creates is itself confused - while it has some funny touches such as the police line pairing together various mismatched partners - it also has women walking around in sexy, futuristic costumes, and the aforementioned cartoon cat called Whiskers (voiced by Danny DeVito). Seriously, whose idea was that? I've never seen a cartoon cat in a live- action action movie!However, the sheer mess that is the complete film does prove Last Action Hero to be a curious little oddity. There have been much finer examples of action-movie send-ups, namely in Shane Black's own excellent Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), so perhaps the producers weren't ready back in 1993 to take on such an ambitious project. Arnie is pleasantly game for sending himself up, and Charles Dance chews the screen with his gloriously hammy British bad guy. But Last Action Hero will ultimately always be a reminder of how the Hollywood system to suck up an interesting maverick project, f**k it over a few times, and bundle it over the finishing line with such unbelievable inefficiency. I did love it as a kid, however.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Last Action Hero
43,eddie_baggins,A what could've been film with some fun moments,6,13 October 2020,"An extremely meta offering that was quite possibly too ahead of its time upon release, the failures of box office bomb Last Action Hero have been well documented in Hollywood for many years now as the films notorious release against Jurassic Park saw its potential financial possibilities go south quickly, as well as sending the career's of its director and leading man into places they had yet to dwell in.Filled with ample potential and more ideas than multiple films put together, Hero feels exactly like the type of film it was in a behind the scenes sense, as it filmed right up into its release window, with the final product not allowing itself any time to breathe or feel at home within itself as it wastes some aspects of its story and unnecessarily extends other elements, giving off the feeling that we are witnessing an unfinished film be put forward as something that wasn't able to grasp exactly what it was or wanted to be.It's a real shame as when the film is riding along at a rapid pace and the embracing of its over the top goodness appears front and center, McTiernan's film is a rollicking good time that features one of Schwarzenegger's most enjoyable turns, one that is happy to poke fun at his career until that point and a general skewering of the Hollywood action genre in general.Starring as made up action hero come to life Jack Slater (who in an extremely funny way is played by a version of the real life Schwarzenegger), Arnie is having a great time ramping up the one liners and career references as the film introduces us to the Hollywoodized world that young film fan Danny finds himself in and in the films middle section you get a real sense for just what could've been had the film tied in all the elements with McTiernan's action direction, the films insane Looney Tunes like carnage and Shane Black and David Arnott's at times very witty script combining to great effect.There's so much of the film however that just doesn't gel.Jack and Danny's friendship never takes full flight, a very slow beginning and rather medicore finale hurt and the film loses a fair chunk of momentum when it re-enters the real world just after the half way mark and you get a sense that had it committed to establishing itself in the over-blown Hollywood version of itself it would've made for a far more consistently enjoyable romp rather than one that feels as though its ready to be something amazing, but remains constantly weighed down by a sense of what might have been.Final Say -Somewhere out there in the movie universe is great film known as Last Action Hero, while this version we get is fun and original in many ways, you can see why it failed to resonate into the genre classic it might have been had all the stars aligned.3 Ice-Cream cones out of 5",Last Action Hero
44,johnnyboyz,An escapist fantasy brought to life; Last Action Hero functions well enough as a deliberately mediocre action flick-come-self aware blockbuster piece.,6,3 September 2009,"Last Action Hero is essentially a fable about a young, father-less boy living in amongst the squaller of New York City with his single, middle-aged mother in a grotty apartment. His escape is films; specifically trips to the local cinema, which nobody bothers to frequent anymore, so that he can watch re-runs of his favourite action films in conditions that are large and completely empty. But the premise is mis-leading; this is not about a young boy mentally escaping from his life and 'into' the movies as a side-show amidst all the other griefs he might be facing in life like high school, adolescence and maintaining friendships. No, this isn't an observation nor mediation on life and the world around you as a youngster, alá Terrance Davies' 1992 piece The Long Day Closes – this is more about a physical escape; a thrusting away from one reality and into another.It's a good thing that the lead in the film is the young boy that he is, and one whom loves his action films, otherwise the film would be somewhat stuck attempting to make parodies, pastiches and statements out of things like The Seventh Seal and Olivier's Hamlet. Not many films can claim they have an instance in which The Seventh Seal's 'Death' character morphs out into our world, only to have a young boy point a heavy duty handgun at it in, where else? – a cinema aisle. Last Action Hero can. The boy is Danny Madigan (O'Brien), his 'ticket' into this alternate world is one of the golden and magical variety, given to him by Nick (Rosky), who runs the cinema.Danny's a kid who likes his films, he just doesn't know it yet. He seems to WANT to love cinema. He sits, somewhat slumped in his chair at school, as the aforementioned Hamlet is played whereas all the other kids laugh, mockingly. He somewhat pays attention, but cannot help but trail off into a fantasy that tells us what it might be like if is his fictitious movie-hero Jack Slater was cast in the lead role. It's a very early instance of the low-art clashing with the high-art within Last Action Hero; a sort of hybridity that is not limited purely to genre, and represents the sort of content the film will play with later on, particularly when the again aforementioned 'Death' leaves a poster for The Seventh Seal and will be seen sharing the screen with an action lead.Last Action Hero represents the sort of read that allows its viewer to sway either way. Its clear blurring of the boundaries between the 'real' world and that of a movie inspired one is handled pretty much to the point it can be. The film wants to get across a point of how grimy and nasty 'real' New York is by contrasting the 'scum' of a fake reality with that of an actual reality, best highlighted when the sadistic and uncompromising villain of the piece Benedict (Dance) walks down a night-set, damp and cold New York street encountering underage prostitutes and muggers out solely for an individual's shoes. Others will criticise the film by noting how a piece so pent up on pointing out the flaws and annoyances of the action genre is quick to conclude on the rooftop of some building, as forces of good and evil do battle 1-on-1 under the murky umbrella of doom, gloom and rain. The counter-argument might be that this is deliberate, we remember that this is exactly how one of the earlier Jack Slater films concluded, indeed it is exactly how Last Action Hero as a stand alone piece begins, meaning the whole thing is entirely self-aware.The progression of the characters in Last Action Hero sees Danny share his circular journey, fittingly beginning and concluding in a cinema, with action man of the hour Jack Slater (Schwarzenegger) as he undergoes a somewhat meek transitional period of self-discovery. When Danny sits in the cinema for his own private premiere of Jack Slater IV, he puts his feet up; munches his popcorn and smiles as the action, gunfire and general chaos is played out – he's enjoying it. Five minutes later, the ticket has worked its magic and he's actually in the film amongst all the madness. Suddenly, he's frightened; he's unsure and doesn't want to be able to witness the action, the gunfire and the explosions any more.One has to wonder if someone like Michael Bay has ever seen this film, and if they have, did they at all understand it? Here's a film, which many people have already pointed out, that sends up the action genre, indeed the 'blockbuster', with its vast cast of attractive female characters clogging up the screen, although some of the women at a roof top funeral look a little odd; its glowing, warm, dry weather which illuminates the screen when it needs to; its ludicrous product placement unashamedly being exploited in the background and its should-be pathetic macho introduction to its lead character: a cigar chomping, car-roof stomping man of muscles carelessly and nonchalantly dealing with a pretty sensitive hostage situation in his own manner.It isn't without faults, and I would've liked the fantastic idea of this golden ticket to have been explored a little more. What happens if you go into a silent film - does it mean you can't talk? What happens in a black and white film - can you no longer see in colour? What if you hopped on a plane and flew to where you lived in real life within the film - would you be able to then meet yourself? Technically, wouldn't the ticket work as a time machine if you were to 'journey' into a period-set piece? Flaws and annoyances aside, Last Action Hero stands up as a spoof; and ironically it's more thrilling, more entertaining as a self-aware piece than some other genuine action films from recent times are.",Last Action Hero

Austin O'Brien plays Danny Madigan, a young boy enthralled by the Jack Slater movie franchise, who through some cinema hand-waving gets transported into the Jack Slater movie universe. Hijinks ensue.The jokes work in this film. Everything is just slightly over the top, allowing you to laugh at all the old clichés, like the never-ending ammo, the ridiculously good-looking women, the superfluous need for aiming, and so on. We have the loud, yelling police chief, the cigar chomping main lead, the smarmy bad guy, the hot daughter of the main character, the compulsory cartoon character (it makes sense in context), and everything else under the sun.But, with just a slight twist, this could be a credible action film. It's a satire, not a parody, and all the best satires are still loving examples of their respective genres.Arnold is great in this film, but I also really love Charles Dance as the villain. What a suave, threatening bad guy. Dance is one of the best of his generation for a reason. On the other hand, Austin O'Brien as our supposed main character feels a bit tired. Too clichéd, even for this film.Still, I had fun. Arnold is great, Dance is great, the jokes are great, the clichés are great. Not the best movie you'll ever see by any stretch, but you'll have fun.

50,hellraiser7,In on the Action,10,11 October 2021,"Warning do not read unless seen film.Action is one of my favorite genres of movies, I loved them ever since I was a kid which is why they always have a special place in my heart. I feel what makes them special for me from the creativity contributed to the genre in creating escapist fun, the protagonists are always embarked on some sort of adventure someplace.But most of all that you always have protagonists that can fight back against evil. These things really gave me that sense of empowerment but also just gave me a good feeling that life isn't so bad at all, after seeing this film it shows it can be a worthwhile experience.This is another of my favorite movies of all time and it's my third favorite Arnold Scherzinger film. This is a film that is fun but very clever, it was no doubt ahead of it's time. It predates films like ""Scream"", ""Galaxy Quest"", ""Pleasantville"", etc. Like in those films it slightly parodies and satires on the genre it represents but also becomes meta and most importantly its own story all at once.I really like the story, it's that wish fulfillment fantasy of any of us that are fans of a particular movie or TV show wanting to get in it and be part of the action. As a kid I thought that was a cool concept, and this makes the film even more relatable because any of us that have watched films and TV have sometimes had that thought. This doesn't make us crazy it just shows how much we truly love as well as believe in it.Characters are good from the main character Danny who is relatable as he's a fan of action films and so was I when I was his age in fact even before I was an adolescent. The kid is highly imaginative like in one scene we see he's watching an old ""Hamlet"" film (thank God it wasn't the one from MST3000) but as he's watching it he suddenly is imagining it as an action film trailer starring Arnold.That part was just hilarious yeah, I'd see that movie, but that part told you two things that Danny not just possibly wants to be an action star when he grows up but maybe even make action films himself (those things I wanted to do also). But we see this kid isn't perfect from the fact he doesn't have a full grasp of alternate world physics or even knows all the clichés and tropes in action films, it shows he still has a lot to learn not just about the movies but life in general.Benedict Arnold played well by Charles Dance, yes, I have seen ""Game of Thrones"" however before that I remembered him as the main villain from ""The Golden Child"" another favorite film of mine and story for another time. But he's a really solid villain (with a name like Benedict you already know he's bad news) as usual he's got that simmering evil vibe to him, I remember as a kid being a little scared by him as he just has this dry icy tone and mannerism that could make summer feel like winter.There is one moment which is dryly funny and a little scary at the same time when he pucks out one little hair from Jack's daughter and then just pull it apart, I'll admit gave me a brief chill let alone made Danny instant retract his retort, it's such a small moment but it was just the performance that sold it how Benedict moves his hands, at that look he gives Danny while doing it, it all just tells you he's someone you don't want to mess with.Even like the look to him as he looks like he could have been Bond villain, ironic I say that as he played a subordinate villain Claus in the Bond film ""For Your Eyes Only"", shame he never got to play a main villain in another. He's got this crazy collection of glass eyes, like one which is a crosshair another a scary evil red eye, at times I still wonder if he can see through them. He's a worthy opponent as his wits are as sharp and deadly as his marksmanship.The Chief Dekker played by the late Frank McRae despite only in the film for a few scenes he's funny. He's pretty much the stereotypical yelling Chief which is why he's so funny because he's a parody on that. He has some of the best lines, but one favorite scene is when the Chief anger level is up to eleven, he's spewing out angry monologue at both Jack and Danny faster than Jack can discharge his gun.It's hilarious as Jack, Danny and we don't understand a word he just said nor to I think we want to; almost like he's speaking an undiscovered language. But also, how cartoony it is as we see there are two broken windows in the office and smoke coming out of the Chief's ears. Though I give the actor himself props as that monologue was not just the easiest to memorize but also deliver.But of course, the main protagonist himself Jack Slater whom is played by Arnold. Nothing unique about him as it's simply Arnold being well Arnold. However, what makes this role funny is this is more of not just a parody on Arnold himself but a parody on the whole action film protagonist architype in general. It's just funny how we see him not just as usual serve up the memorable lines like my favorite ""Big Mistake"", how casually he acts with all the extraordinary things going on around him is just the everyday norm for him.But I also like how he interacts and reacts from listening to Danny constantly addressing and proving to both him and himself the differences between his realm and ours. And even in the third and final act when he comes into our realm.There are so many clever moments of humor from not just visual, verbal, and physical but how the film plays with conventions and turns clichés on their heads. But also, like how the world of Jack Slater is made out sort of reminds me of the virtual worlds in the films ""Ready Player One"" and ""Free Guy"", where anything to everything is possible.One scene was when they go into a Blockbuster Video Store, I'll admit just seeing that really made me miss those places. There are two clever things from this scene from seeing Sly Stallone as the star of one of Arnold's movies which makes sense in alternate world logic as Jack Slater is an action hero not an actor so he couldn't of stared in that film; on a side note it's really funny what Jack says about him.And even the fact there is not one unattractive person in that store, which is true as most people in TV shows most notably certain superhero shows like ""The Flash"" (2015 version) or ""Arrow"" some of the cast could easily be super models. Another is going to Jack's police station which is pretty much a live action ""Where's Waldo"" or ""MAD Magazine"" art illustration as there are so many things going on and people you recognize.The action is solid, they are fun but play out in a way like live action 80 and 90's cartoons like ""G. I. Joe"" and others, of course the film doesn't hide that as there is a little ""Looney Tunes"" reference; but the funny thing about most of those kinds of cartoons are the protagonist hardly get hurt so they really have next to nothing to worry about.I really love how there are lots of conveniences in them, which is funny because it's true, but their always by their nature devices to keep both the hero and action going. From the home invasion battle which had a few creative kills, one that's a favorite is when Jack sticks a high voltage wire into a dead bad guy who conveniently has a machine gun in his hand and well you just have to see that sequence to believe it.A car chase scene which immediately happens in the first part of the film, what's funny is how the bad guys are always throwing explosives and blowing away every other car they pass by except Jack's; it really tells me two things either Jack Slater is really good, or the bad guys just really suck.Another is of course the Mob funeral, which is funny, where every person is strapped makes sense since their all mobsters after all. Jack is running and we see the blast trail behind him, I just thought those was a cool squb effects, but also display the terrible accuracy each of the mobsters have.One of my favorite moments is this monologue with Jack in the apartment, in this monologue Jack is in a rut where he admits his personal life is shot to crap. I really like how it humanizes the character and an interesting contrast, where Danny sees and thinks Jack's life is great; Jack himself doesn't really see it that way.But it also just shows the soul of every hero/superhero, despite the extraordinary things they do at the end of the day their really human beings' ordinary people just like you and me with wants and needs and trying to live out their life they best they can. It's very deep when you think about it because heroes/superheroes really were and still are ordinary people, in fact the people that create and write them are people like you and me.This even more contributes toward the final act when Jack finally comes to our realm. I'll admit I was honestly worried about Jack's life because we know at this point the stakes are raised way up because in our realm none of the physics from the film realm apply. But this also not just makes us want Jack to win but also shows why he's truly a hero.The only misfire of the film is the actor that play Danny, I felt he was really miscast, some of the guy's delivery and performance missed sometimes. I like the character don't get me wrong, it's just that character should have been played by a better actor maybe Macaulay Culkin, Elijah Wood, at least a good kid/adolescent actor that stands out better. Other than that, everything other shot is on target.The film I feel is a love letter to the action genre and everyone that's a fan of it. But also shows the importance of the genre how it has a place in both the movie world and ours and why we always need them. But also, two important messages on what it means to be a true hero and that life doesn't have to be crappy, as long as you always do your best it can get actually become livable and even better.Action films truly do make our world and lives a lot brighter and still do.Rating: 4 stars.",Last Action Hero
51,freemantle_uk,A missed opportunity,7,20 October 2013,"Last Action Hero is notorious action film that attempted to be a meta satire, being a box-office and critical flop despite it starring the biggest action hero of the time, Arnold Schwarzenegger and helmed by Die Hard and Predator director John McTiernan.Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) is a movie obsessed kid who skips school so he can watch the over-blown action series Jack Slater, starring Mr. Schwarzenegger. When Danny's friend, the elderly projectionist Nick (Robert Prosky) offer Danny the chance to see the fourth Jack Slater film before anyone else the kid jumps at the chance and Nick gives Danny a magic ticket. But Danny ends up transported to the movie world where he tries to convince Jack Slater he is really a fictional character as the villainous Benedict (Charles Dance) sees an opportunity to be more then a Mafia hit-man.Last Action Hero had a troubled production and post-production, from getting Shane Black to radically rewrite the script, having an awful test screening, being edited to the last minute and coming out a week after the hugely popular Jurassic Park. Added with the negative reviews Last Action Hero failed. But since its release Last Action Hero has developed a cult following and some see it as a misunderstood classic. I do not share that view point.As you would expect from McTiernan the action is of a very high standard and wonderfully over the top. There are explosions galore and Schwarzenegger continued to be an action presence. Schwarenegger also did have some funny jokes. But the meta approach of the satire falls flat. The idea of satirising action movies of the 80s and early 90s was fair game and still serves a way to deliver an excellent action film, but it was affected by the framing device of the movie-within-a-movie, allowing Danny to break the clichés down for us instead of letting us figuring it out ourselves. It is a bit like the Scream series but the Scream series was able to get away with it more due to the universe created.Some of the jokes in Last Action Hero really do fall flat like the cops getting mix-matched partners and it gets puts to extremes like someone getting partnered with a rabbi, another with a cartoon cat and a black-and-white Humphrey Bogart also gets in on the action. Another really ill-advised joke was when the police captain is yelling at Jack Slater so much that steam comes out of his ears.Dance did make for a good villain and are some decent character actors in supporting roles like Tom Noonan and F. Murray Abraham, but O'Brien was a grating presence as the know-it-all child.Last Action Hero is far from being Arnie's worst film, it wouldn't even be in the bottom five, but it is a wasted opportunity at satirising the action genre, being too meta for its own good. Hot Fuzz is a much better satire of the buddy cop and action genre.",Last Action Hero
52,ianlouisiana,In which Arnie steps through the screen and out of his fans comfort zone,8,7 December 2009,"Much like Steven Seagal in the later ""The Foreigner"",Arnie paid the price for overestimating the attention span of his fans who stayed away in flocks from ""Last Action Hero"" thus consigning it to the video bins at ""Blockbusters"" long before its time. Perhaps he was a little over - optimistic in hoping his admirers would accept a plot more redolent of Woody Allen than they might be comfortable with.Or any plot,really. What did they miss?A great deal,actually.""Last Action Hero"" is fast,furious and very funny and Arnie is terrific in it. Happily guying his own roles as Ur tough cop Jack Slater,he chews scenery and cigars with blithe disregard whilst babysitting a besotted young fan who has entered the world of Arnie's movies via a magic ticket which is then stolen by villain Charles Dance to escape to the real world where Arnie has to follow him and then become vulnerable,like Superman when confronted with Kryptonite. Lots of splendid in - jokes occur throughout the movie at regular intervals and many action movie regulars put in brief appearances to keep the interest going. Far better than its reputation might suggest,""Last Action Hero"" is amusing and exciting enough for anybody who is capable of handling comedy and thrills in the same movie,presumably a big ask for many Arnie fans in 1993.",Last Action Hero
53,jimbo-53-186511,Second or possibly even Third tier McTiernan (possible minor spoilers),5,23 August 2017,"Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) is a young boy who skips school and spends a lot of time at the cinema watching his favourite movie star Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Nick (Robert Prosky) is a kindly old man who works as a projectionist at the cinema whom innocently hands Danny a magic ticket - Nick is somewhat sceptical about this supposed magic ticket and innocently gives the ticket to Danny. However, Danny soon learns that the ticket is very real when he finds himself transported into his favourite action star's world...Clearly, Last Action Hero is intended as a bit of fun and one feels that McTiernan was poking fun out of the action genre - which incidentally is a genre that made him a very big name. This approach works in the first half (when Danny is transported into Slater's world and he's trying to convince Slater that his own existence and everything around him isn't real). Unfortunately, despite the numerous celebrity cameos and the odd in-jokes and nods and winks, this film falls short when it chooses to focus on plot and story (which seem to unfold in real time when Danny becomes part of the movie). It's from this point forward that the film seems to lose a lot of its irony and becomes another weak action film - perhaps that was the point, but it doesn't make for a particularly entertaining film.Worse follows in the second half when McTiernan abandons most of the fun when Slater arrives in the real world in New York. From this point on McTiernan plays it far too straight and carries on as though he's directing a serious action film - he seems to forget that the film is supposed to be fun. Mega star Slater arrives in Hollywood where he is a household name but no-one seems to recognise him. Wouldn't it have been funnier and more satirical if he was stopped everywhere he went for an autograph or a photograph whilst he was in his pursuit of justice??Having said all that, the film certainly has some fun moments and does have some nice nods and winks - Robert Patrick cameos as the T1000 and in the movie-world we have Sylvester Stallone on a Terminator 2: Judgment Day film poster (a character whom Arnie himself famously portrayed). There is also an ET spoof with the bike riding through the sky, but many of the stronger moments are in the first half and I couldn't help but feel that the concept was starting to run out of steam by the 1 hour mark.Last Action Hero isn't a bad film and is one that I would say is watchable (it does provide basic escapism and is fairly undemanding). However, I also felt that it was never as fun as it could have been and is also far too long, the story is weak and it loses some of its satirical edge in its second half. As the saying goes it's close but no cigar...",Last Action Hero

55,fertilecelluloid,Brilliant skewering of action movie clichés,7,1 February 2006,"John McTiernan skewered the action movie genre with such a sharp knife, nobody felt the initial incision -- which is why this sly pulp masterpiece flopped like a dead pigeon in a radiation cloud. Ironically, McTiernan had contributed boldly to the genre with ""Predator"" and ""Die Hard"", so when he knew the genre had hit its zenith, he opted to dish this one up. Few got the joke.As spectacle, the film hits its stride early on and doesn't let up. The centerpiece car chase is a blast, as is the Hamlet segment where Arnie takes the p*** out of his on-screen persona. Some of the parody doesn't work and walks an uncertain line at times, but what does work works brilliantly.These days, the film still feels fresh and perceptive, and its tongue-in-cheek, critical slaying of Hollywood action clichés retains its bite.",Last Action Hero
56,Agent10,A postmodern Epic,7,20 May 2002,"For some reason, this film doesn't nearly get the credit it deserves. Yes, it wasn't the best film Arnold Schwarzeneger has been in, but it proved to be one of the more entertaining. While I love the postmodern aesthetic, this film really brings out many principles which seek to give the movie an inner meaning to break away from placid conventions. Full of great one-liners, this film had some hilarious dialogue which was specifically written for Arnold. But the really interesting thing about this film was Arnold's deadpan caricaturing of himself in a typical action film.What I especially enjoyed about this movie was the first half where they were stuck in the movie world. The utter absurdity of the action genre world was put into full view. The only downside, they didn't have the right angle for the movie. Danny should have been living it up as the kid pulled into his favorite action film. To me, the film would have ultimately down better at the box office if they had gone in that direction as opposed to Danny always trying to discredit the false world.",Last Action Hero
57,adamjohns-42575,It completely takes the Mick out of itself and Hollywood.,5,16 August 2020,"I love it when a celebrity learns to take the pee out of themselves and Arnie does a great job of that in this film, as only he could. Yes, he's not the best actor and his pun delivery can sometimes be very badly timed or delivered, but he's just good fun and actually I quite fancied him in this one.
The sometimes hilarious cameos make up for the story, which is a great concept, but I think focuses too much in the movie world and not enough about the transition in to the real world and the havoc that the always fantastic Charles Dance as Benedict could have caused. It's quite funny just to see this acting legend up against Arnold, renowned for his wooden delivery and they bounce off of each other well in a typical action movie style.It ticks the boxes, is good fun and suitable for most with completely outlandish and over the top explosions and fights. The kids a bit annoying, but I think that's the point.",Last Action Hero
58,rbverhoef,Fun,6,27 May 2005,"You know what, I kind of like 'Last Action Hero'. It has so much fun with itself and its star Arnold Schwarzenegger you just have to smile occasionally. It borrows an idea like we have seen in Woody Allen's 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' where fictional movie-characters and real people are suddenly in a world together. Here we have a boy in the real world named Danny (Austin O'Brien) who is suddenly, with the help of a magic ticket, in a film that contains his favorite character, Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger). The boy realizes this pretty soon and he tries to convince Jack that it is only a movie.The movie within a movie, 'Jack Slater IV' deals with villains such as Benedict (Charles Dance) and a mafia-family and from a previous 'Jack Slater'-movie we have The Ripper (Tom Noonan). The story is never that clear, but the film is more about the idea than about the story that carries the idea. There is a lot of fun at times when Danny tries to explain why it is all a movie. All women are beautiful, coincidences happen a lot, when the villain pops his glass eye out we see he has two normal eyes, things like that. A lot of the little things are actually pretty clever, especially the little continuity mistakes. Maybe not all of them are on purpose, a lot definitely are.A lot of the fun also comes from Schwarzenegger himself and the way he mocks his own image. He has proved a couple of times he can handle comedy; here he is at the top of his game. Cameos from actors like Jim Belushi, Chevy Chase, Sharon Stone, Robert Patrick and Jean-Claude van Damme (which makes this the best film he is in) all help on this aspect and a scene with Schwarzenegger's wife Maria Shriver is simply hilarious.The movie is not perfect, certain things like the story could have been a lot better. But that movie already exists with 'The Purple Rose of Cairo'. This one only wants to have fun and it has a lot of it. It makes fun of itself, its star, other movies from the genre and it contains a lot of jokes that require a little movie-knowledge. There is even an encounter with Death from Ingmar Bergman's 'Det Sjunde Inseglet', here played by Ian McKellen. 'Last Action Hero' is underrated, probably because a lot of people do not get the joke or do not care for it. I do both and I like it.",Last Action Hero
59,truemythmedia,Criminally Under-rated. Ahead of Its Time.,10,1 November 2019,"This is a film that I love. It's a part of my childhood that has actually gotten better with age. How many times do you find yourself saying that about a movie you loved as a kid?Unfortunately, this film also has a TERRRRRIBLE reputation. This film was a box office disaster of sorts. I say sorts because it made a decent amount at the box office. However, the film was so over-marketed that the advertising costs outstripped any potential profits they might have gleaned. That over-marketing also had a negative impact on ticket sales as many people saw the film as a cash grab which didn't have any real substance.Bad reviews from critics led into worse word of mouth as the very fans who loved Arnold Schwartzenegger movies turned out to see the genre and actor they loved being made fun of in a movie that they paid their hard-earned dollars to see.For a kid like me, though, watching a VHS taped from a Saturday Night Movie of the Week, it was one of my favorites and remains so. Parts of the film appeal to the kid in me who saw it for the first time and others keep drawing the adult version of myself back to it over and over again. It's not without its flaws, but many of the things people complain about when referencing this film are, to me, simply signs that they don't really get what this film is doing, but more on that later.HEY, MIKEY, HE LIKES IT!
Growing up, I didn't see movies in the theater so most of what I knew of Action Movies were just what played on TV as PG-13 versions. In my head I have always preferred Schwartzenegger to Stallone despite the fact that as a kid, both were equally hard to understand. Probably, my liking of Arnold stems from seeing ""Total Recall"" on TV.""Last Action Hero"" is one of Arnold's best films, partially because he is playing himself but also because he is in on the joke. This isn't ""The Expendables"" where Stallone thinks he legit still has it (he doesn't). This is a guy who realizes how he has made his money and fame, how people think of him, and is poking fun at it, in a loving way. It's like many great satires; funnier when being made fun of by someone on the inside.As a kid, this movie captures the adventure and thrill of all the backyard and schoolyard games where you imagine that you are larger than life, whether that was as Luke Skywalker, Indiana Jones, The Power Rangers, Spider-Man, or Robo-Cop. What if you really got to meet those heroes and live in their world? Would it be fun or terrifying or both?Also, this is a film that doesn't treat its kid like an idiot. Danny knows a lot about movies and that knowledge is useful. For a TV addicted 90s kid like me, it was one of the few times that I saw a kid that actually resembled me on screen. I may have loved a lot of movies with kids in them over the years but Danny Madigan is the closest I ever got to seeing myself, a sarcastic movie quoting 13 year old, actually being useful.On top of that, this film's PG-13 rating made it way more friendly to a kid like me, with action that wasn't too intense but still a lot of fun, a cartoon cat detective, and a plot that even a youngster like me could follow.GROWN UP MICHAEL, HE STILL LIKES IT!
As much as this movie hit for me as a kid, it landed even harder for me when I re-watched it as an adult, after letting it sit on a shelf for a few years while the internet took over my film education. By this time I'd seen Arnold's other movies and not the TV edited pan-and-scan versions. I'd even seen more of Stallone's terrible films (sorry, I'm not going to let a chance to slam him slip past me).I was in for a surprise. I couldn't believe how ahead of its time this film was. I mean, I remembered that it had jokes about the genre in it but the level to which this film went into those tropes and gaffs common to action movies was simply mind-blowing (and this is before anyone was even using the word trope). There were, quite literally, jokes that had me looking up the exact year this film came out, to verify that it was, indeed, just that far ahead.Also, without my realizing it, this film had perfectly joined up with my MST3K sense of dry and sarcastic satire to form a perfect storm of Meta humor, way before I had even known meta humor was a thing. This is probably the first film I ever saw where ""breaking the fourth wall"" was intentionally used as device in such an abrasive, address the audience way.When people complain that this movie's humor isn't as sharp or that the rules of the world break down at certain points, they are forgetting that the internet wouldn't become a thing of common everyday use for most people for at least another 12 years after ""Last Action Hero"" came out. People weren't accustomed to the parsing of every single little thing a film did in order to find ""rules"" which were breaking a film's ""canon."" That's just not how people were watching it. It may seem crazy, but many people's complaint, at the time this film came out, was that the blending of real world and movie world was just too confusing to follow.Confusing to anyone who didn't grow up on TV and Movies or understand intuitively how they were made and written, maybe.Leaving aside the forward thinking nature of this film, Arnold's funniest and most heartfelt performance, and a master plan that involves a dead fat man named Leo the Fart, there are, unfortunately, plenty of other things left to complain about in this film, even from my perspective.The first is that Austin O'Brien (""The Lawnmower Man"") as Danny Madigan, the kid with a magic ticket, is just awful. He's a horrible actor and has mercifully, not had an acting career that put him in front of my eyes very often.He isn't helped much by some of the writing, to be fair. Sure this movie was doing things people weren't quite ready for and they made concessions, but that still makes some of the speaking out loud, to no one in particular, in order to explain a character's thoughts feel pretty dated and cringeworthy.It is also way longer than it needs to be. Again this may be due to the ravages of the internet on our attention spans but something tells me that even 13 year old me wouldn't have sat through the full film, not edited for commercial breaks, without some ants in his pants.The last thing that many people complain about is that the logic of the film seems inconsistent, at best. I agree, to a certain extent. Sure the film is a little hand-wavey for the sake of story, but not to the degree that people complain about. Death (Sir Ian McKellan, ""The Lord of The Rings"") for example doesn't actually retain his powers when he enters the real world as many online critics claim he does.When people complain about the logic issues of this film it simply reveals to me that they don't get what makes this movie so endearing.This is a film about the magic of cinema. It exults in the messy way that cinema breaks the rules of the real world in order to create an experience or feeling that is somehow unlike anything you can find in the real world yet hints at exactly what makes life so amazing and thus, ends up feeling true.Danny hates that he is a weakling and has no power but Jack Slater has all of that, or so Danny thinks. When he enters the movie world he sees that it is all tricks and that the real world is where real heroes and villains are made. We slay dragons in film not because dragons are real, but because they aren't. They become stand ins for what we are struggling with. They are rehearsals for life.To then complain that this movie acts like a movie misses the point. People say ""it satirizes action movies and then just ends up being the very thing it is making fun of, an action movie."" Yeah. The satire is NOT the point of the film. It is a device. The point is that real life is where you should be applying all of that intellect, logical thinking, heroism, friendship, and excitement. Movies are a great escape, but they are an escape: something we should hopefully come back from stronger, more engaged, more passionate; Better.For a lot of film geeks out there, ""Hugo"" is a quintessential love letter to the power of film. ""Last Action Hero"" is my ""Hugo"" because I didn't grow up watching ""Trip to the Moon"" or any other of George Milles other magical short silent films. I grew up watching superheroes beat each other up as a way of escaping the fact that I got beat up.This film embodies the magic that a film can impart. That escapism is works best when it has you feeling like a hero, through the movie you are watching, and realizing that the magic is on the inside and it is in your hands to be that hero, or scientist, or husband, or astronaut, or friend that you want to be.That is the magic of film and I, for one, feel it every time the projector light sparks to life and the house lights dim. I'm not there to see the real world. I'm there to see the magic I feel on the inside reflected up on that silver screen.",Last Action Hero
60,TheFearmakers,It Was Too Soon for Arnold to Parody Arnold,3,28 October 2021,"The problem with THE LAST ACTION HERO is not the film itself, but the film-within-a-film that the film itself is poking fun at, named after the main super-cop character JACK SLATER, which in itself is a lame title for a franchise that seems very made-up...So basically THE LAST ACTION HERO is bagging on an Action Movie starring Arnold himself being bagged on by... Arnold himself... Which would be like Jerry Lewis making fun of falling down during his peak as a physical comic or Rod Serling sneering at a twist ending...The main problem is, Arnold did this movie way too soon. After Terminator 2 he was at the peak of his powers and he winds up showing an audience how stupid those kind of movies are...The funny thing is, Arnold's most popular ""Action"" films are really Science-Fiction... Not just Terminator 1 and 2 but Total Recall, The Running Man and Predator... plus the Conan films which are sci-fi's sibling, Fantasy...Plus many of the cliches through the JACK SLATER universe do NOT exist in actual action movies... In those they're part of the plot as the action moves the story and characters along so not to be noticed or too obvious, but here they are glaring stereotypes that serve no purpose at all...Especially unrealistic of an Action flick is the CARTOON CAT that shows up as a working cop in the police station. No Arnold or Stallone or Bruce Willis movie has EVER had a cartoon mix in with humans.The bottom line is, Arnold fell into the self deprecation that people too aware of their shortcomings fall into before they can rise to the top, and on top is the last place to knock yourself down... and the bottom is the place this movie brought Arnold until, a year later, an ACTUAL action film, TRUE LIES, brought him back up again...Plus the movie is thirty minutes too long. It should be the length of an action movie... 95 minutes... Not 2 hrs and 5 minutes...Also, the kid, going from real life into his favorite franchise, has the same dull expression he did saying ""Cool"" in the Circuit City ad that got him noticed...The only two good things are the tall/lanky and scary-looking Tom Noonan as who should have been the ONLY MAIN villain here instead of Charles Dance making fun of Charles Dance the way Arnold made fun of Arnold... And F. Murray Abraham as the fictional cop partner turned backstabber could have had more merit than two quick scenes...The fact is, the film-within-the-film is treated with no respect, and it's simply not entertaining: For instance, when JACK SLATER IV opens, there is a five-minute scene with two very old men having a conversation (Tony Quinn and Art Carney)... This scene would bore the living heck out of any kid watching, especially to get the ball rolling...And so, after all the nonsense, by the time the fictional characters do a Time After Time meets The Purple Rose of Cairo and enter real life, the audience is exhausted. A shame since THAT movie was far better than the other.NOTE: Don't believe the hype that this is now a ""Cult Classic"" as said on Wikipedia. This was a FAILED mainstream blockbuster. It was a block that busted nothing. The reason people now protect it is because of that aspect, not because it's really, deep down despite bombing, a great movie, like BLADE RUNNER or NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET or many other films considered Cult that rise like a phoenix on video. This was a total mishmash, tonal-deaf failure that even the director knows wasn't made well. So the people who ""don't like it don't get it"" is because there's NOTHING to get.",Last Action Hero
61,a_chinn,1980s action film send-up worth reconsidering,7,20 May 2017,"This film was not the blockbuster that it was expected to be upon it's initial release and was pretty derided when it first came out, but I think it's one that deserves reconsideration. The story is essentially Woody Allen's ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" but with a 1980s action film hero stepping off the screen into the real world instead of a 1930s romantic leading man stepping off the screen. Both films feature a many funny moments of fictional characters having to deal the the real world and also funny moments of real world characters entering the movie world, enjoying the artifice of those fantasy worlds. The difference in how these two films go about this is that Allen's film was making keen observations about why people are drawn to fantasy worlds over reality, while ""Last Action Hero"" is comedic primarily a send up of 80s action film tropes. Although this film is nowhere as smart or insightful as Allen's classic film, it's a really funny film and does make some clever observations about action film formulas. What really makes this film work is the inclusion of so many action film heavy weights both in front of the camera (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and also behind the camera (director John McTiernan and co-writer Shane Black). The film is both a celebration of what audiences love about action films, but at the same time gleefully mocks them. I do think Sylvester Stallone's ""Demolition Man"" did a better job of satirizing 1980s action heroes by placing a stereotypical action hero into a peaceful futuristic utopia. This same year also saw the release of ""Romeo is Bleeding"" which was not exactly a send up of action films, but was more of an indie black comic send up of noir, which i suppose is pretty different from those other two, but I thought was worth mentioning. Overall, this film is not the throwaway over-marketed junk that I think it was perceived as upon it's initial release and is absolutely worth watching for audiences who want to laugh at 80s action film clichés. The film also features F. Murray Abraham, Art Carney, Charles Dance, Frank McRae, Tom Noonan, Robert Prosky, Anthony Quinn, Mercedes Ruehl, and cameos by Franco Columbu, Tina Turner, Sharon Stone, Robert Patrick, Angie Everhart, Maria Shriver, Little Richard, James Belushi, Damon Wayans, Chevy Chase, Timothy Dalton, Jean-Claude Van Damme, MC Hammer, and many other familiar faces.",Last Action Hero
62,Samiam3,"Mediocre Action/Comedy, starts fine but falls hard",5,21 December 2010,"""This'll work, It's a movie, and I'm the good guy."" so says young Danny Madigan, as he pedals furiously on a stolen bike towards an oncoming bad guys car. This is the kind of movie that Last Action Hero wants to be. Danny's hero is the character of Jack Slayer played by Arnold Swartzenegger. Hollywood is about to release the fourth entry in the Slayer series. Danny's projectionist friend has access to a copy of the film, and he offers to give Danny a private screening. A stroke of magic takes Danny into the movie itself, where he becomes Slayer's partner. Together they are going after a notorious drug lord in LA.So long as it sticks to self parody, Last Action Hero is watchable. dozens of cars (and one ice cream truck) explode in impossible ways, people go flying through mid air, off buildings, across rooms like there is no gravity in the movie, Slayer has more guns and ammo in his glove compartment than is physically possible, and for reasons he cannot figure out, he can't bring himself to say the 'f' word (because as Danny tries to point out, it's a PG-13 movie)And it's not just Action movies that get a comedic treatment, We have jokes from Amadeus, Witness, and The Seventh Seal. It's curious how an eleven year old boy can know so much about movies which he'd be too young to get into. Despite its ability to wink at itself, Last Action Hero still feels at a loss. It never quite rises about the stuff it mocks, because it still feels like a b-movie experience. And this isn't even the worst problem.Eventually, director John McTiernan takes the fight out of the movie world and back into the real world. It is here where Last Action Hero crumbles. It's astonishing how long it takes to end. The fluidity and humour just about vanish. The appearance of Slayer at the premier of his movie is amusing, but I found myself getting bored really fast. Another problem is that Swarzenegger and Austin O'Brien, don't make a good pair. Swarzenneger gets good one liners but like most action heroes he delivers them all the same way, and O'Brian acts like he is only half involved in the movie.The Last Action hero is good for a few laughs early on, but it gets carried away, and the finished project feels too clumsy and unbalanced to recommend.",Last Action Hero
63,davidmvining,Deconstruction requires love,8,25 May 2020,"In order for deconstruction to really work, the one doing the deconstruction has to love the thing to begin with. They have to love it and know it inside and out so that they can invert everything within it and make the work essentially regard itself in the mirror. That means the deconstruction needs to be honest but well intentioned. It's not a reaffirmation, but a reexamination. And you know what? Last Action Hero is just that about the action movie genre and Arnold Schwarzenegger's on screen persona. Schwarzenegger, John McTeirnan, David Arnott, and Shane Black came together to form a loving reexamination of everything that made Arnold's career.Using the fake franchise around the LA cop Jake Slater in its fourth installment, Last Action Hero uses literal magic to inject the audience stand-in of Danny Madigan into the action extravaganza and provide that knowing meta commentary about how things will play out in much the same way that Randy Meeks laid out the rules of the slasher film in Scream. He's thrown into the Jake Slater movie by a magic ticket from Houdini given to him by the kindly old owner of the run down single screen movie theater on the corner of Danny's little neighborhood in New York City. Once there, Danny interacts with all of the characters, pointing out the ludicrous nature of the film universe from its endlessly attractive women to the cartoon cat police officer, but Slater just thinks of the kid as crazy. His world is normal. It's all he knows.One of the things that I've grown to appreciate about John McTiernan's movies is that he populates them with intelligent characters, especially antagonists. From Hans and Simon Gruber of his two Die Hard movies to the alien in Predator, antagonists don't make stupid mistakes. They are smart, challenging foes, and the character of Benedict, played by Charles Dance, is no exception. He is the visually distinctive villain of the movie within the movie, the counterpoint to the cartoonish buffoon Tony Vivladi played by Anthony Quinn. He figures out quickly that Danny doesn't belong in the world and, after a quick investigation, claims the magic ticket for himself, not quite sure what it does. Once he does figure it out, though, he quickly takes advantage of it, realizing the limitations of the world he currently inhabits and the limitless possibilities of being able to move into another world at will.And its through that conflict that we get what the movie is actually about. It's nothing particularly novel, but it's certainly about the joy and magic of the escapism of movies, especially big, dumb action films with dubious logic holding them up. For, when Benedict escapes into the real world to discover that cops aren't on every street corner, crime can happen without consequence, and bad guys can win, he feels liberated and suddenly Danny and Jack are running to catch up. Danny isn't in control anymore because the rules he knows so well no longer apply. Benedict going into the real world levels the playing field.Danny is really the anchor of the whole story. He does function as the audience's stand-in, but he's still a character in his own right. His home life sucks, and he's obsessed with movies, particularly those starring Arnold. He lives with his widowed mother in a small apartment. He's even afraid to go out his front door for very good reason being terrorized by a criminal with a knife in Danny's own apartment when he opens the door at the wrong time. It's through Arnold movies that he feels powerful, and it is by bringing the lessons of the Arnold movies into the real world that Danny becomes stronger as the movie enters its final stages.Arnold's Jack is no less a character, though his central dilemma of discovering that he's nothing more than a fictional character gets a scene that Arnold can't quite carry because he doesn't have the range and then gets forgotten. He's best when he's playfully and charmingly interacting with the kid he doesn't believe, explaining away the absurdities of his universe, and humoring Danny. It's not that Arnold is bad, it's that the script wants to go places and explore aspects of a fictional character realizing the limitations of his existence and the cyclical nature of going from one ridiculous adventure to the next, it's just that Arnold isn't up to the task in those moments.I do wonder what this movie would have been if it had been able to use a real franchise as the movie within the movie. I'm not sure what would fit best (maybe Lethal Weapon), but the added nature of the audience seeing an actual franchise get taken apart this way might have been interesting. As it is, I know that initial reaction to the film wasn't entirely positive. It's a meta commentary that was at least ten years ahead of the rest of the movie world. Maybe if it had waited until Scream, it would have played better, but audiences apparently didn't like seeing Arnold send up his on screen persona and the genre they loved, feeling that it was disrespectful. But, if that was the case, then it was a misinterpretation on their part, because the movie reaffirms its love for Arnold and his films by the end. It's Jack who saves the day, not the real Arnold.On top of the strong storytelling and deconstruction, there's simply a lot of fun to be had on a moment by moment basis. Little nods here and there to the ridiculousness of the universe keep the affair lighter and breezier than one might expect. The little cameos, embrace of the absurd like the cartoon cat and the central movie plot involving two mafia gangs and a corpse filled with poison gas (which I feel goes on for too long, to be honest), and poking fun at F. Murray Abraham because he played Salieri in Amadeus are all amusing and help add a lot of color to the deconstructionist affair.I kind of love Last Action Hero.",Last Action Hero

Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) is crazy about the screen character Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and when he uses a magic ticket he is pulled into his latest film, where guns don't need to be reloaded, cars can jump the grand canyon, and the hero can't be hurt, etc. When Jack Slater comes over to the real world in pursuit of the bad guy (Charles Dance) the fun really begins, and for once Jack Slater seems out of his depth.The whole movie is a funny parody of itself, and it's crammed with ludicrous stunts and action throughout.

69,Howlin Wolf,This is what happens when you try something different...,7,26 April 2001,"It pains me to say this, since more creativity in the movies should never be a bad thing, but I think ""Last Action Hero"" was perhaps a little TOO inventive for its own good. Who would have thought that Arnold could turn in an effective parody of himself and some of the macho flicks he's starred in? OK, the guy can't act, but that doesn't mean he's not intelligent, and that he doesn't have the good sense to recognise that this project is far cleverer than some of the stuff he gets sent. I'm betting that he knows the difference between films like this (for arguments sake) and mindless action fodder such as ""Raw Deal"" which this film often successfully lampoons. It's why he was desperate to work with James Cameron again on ""Terminator 3"", because he's smart enough to know that then it would have had a much better chance of being a great movie.So kudos to Arnold for being able to separate the wheat from the chaff and realise that this is actually quite a good movie. It's too bad that the critics and the majority of the '93 audience couldn't do the same. Is it Schwarzenegger's fault that few people were willing to accept him in this kind of vehicle? No. It's still a good movie. By no means a GREAT one, but far better than its initial reception would suggest. Unfortunately, it was just ahead of its time, and maybe it still is.

71,pyrocitor,"Schwarzenegger versus ""Braunschweigger""",8,2 March 2009,"Few sub-genres have become associated with so many iconic elements as the 1980s-1990s action film, obsessed with their own overblown stereotypes to the point of becoming almost self-parodic. As such, it is particularly poetic that three of the most celebrated contributors to the aforementioned period of explosions and shootouts, director John McTiernan (of Die Hard fame), screenwriter Shane Black (creator of the infamous Lethal Weapon, among countless others) and star Arnold Schwarzenegger convened for a particularly surreal anomaly of a film. Part parody of the past (and future) action films of all three, part philosophical breakdown of the usage and cultural importance of the genre and part pulse- pounding action romp in its own right, Last Action Hero on occasion gives the impression of having bitten off more than it can chew, but its bludgeoning enthusiasm coupled with rare introspective wit makes it a delightfully entertaining and frequently fascinating experiment, continually denied the acclaim it deserves. While it would be simple to dismiss the film as mere post-modern silliness (as many have), the vast array of thought and reflection hiding behind the barricades of bullets is too complex and compelling to immediately warrant writing off. Black's script (co-written with David Arnott) makes a valiant attempt to delve into the cultural relevance and usage of the action genre as cathartic for real life trauma, juxtaposing the violence, crime and poverty in child protagonist Danny's neighbourhood with his adoration for a simpler world where the good always triumph and any adversary can be vanquished by a hail of gunfire. As Danny enthusiastically gushes regarding his favourite cinematic action hero, ""Jack Slater can't lose - never can, never will"". This belief leads to the central hook of the film, as Danny is transported (via a ""magic ticket stub"") into the realm of Slater's latest action blockbuster, where his knowledge of action film conventions helps him both predict the plot and save the day. Danny's presence serves as ripe comedic potential for sending up the genre stereotypes Slater experiences as real life (""where are the ordinary, unattractive women?"") but also carries the continual uncertain tinge of the film being geared towards audiences younger than its legal demographic, with many of the script's largest faults centering around many of the cringe-worthy jokes and irritatingly broad humour revolving around him and offsetting the film's more crafty wit. However, Last Action Hero never descends into mere Kindergarten Cop silliness, but remains even at its worst something far more intelligent, insightful and supremely entertaining, even if the general thematic tone is generally as hard, loud and overstated as the movies it sends up. McTiernan continually toys with viewer expectations throughout, not only identifying and parodying action film conventions and Schwarzenegger's associated persona, but also knowingly addressing and winking at viewer desire for an outrageous satire and spectacle with sequences as Schwarzenegger playing a gun toting Hamlet, one of the film's most outrageously entertaining points. Of course the innate magic realism centering on the ""magic ticket"" gimmick and the film in general may strain credibility to occasionally unreasonable levels and require above average amounts of suspension of disbelief, but those willing to commit to the film and take it in stride may likely find rewards far exceeding the usual thematic content of an explosion-fraught blockbuster. Conversely, those with less complex designs can still enjoy the film as a straight out action romp, as McTeirnan clearly has a ball topping the larger than life explosive confrontations which made Die Hard such a riotous success, though such an approach may likely make the film's more surreal touches (an animated cat saving Slater's life within the realm of the film) all the more jarring and an undeniably overly saccharine ending all the more out of place. Similarly, regardless of the viewer's approach, certain criticisms are inescapable, as the film, despite a supremely hilarious and energetic start, sags throughout the second half and drags on at least 15 minutes too long, and the occasional comic misfires hardly help.Of course no star could truly play 'Jack Slater' other than the king of pulpy action blockbusters Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Schwarzenegger is a consistent delight to watch, both enthusiastically delivering an extreme parody of his own persona (both in character and as 'himself', which, despite the lack of bullets, proves just as hilarious) and even delivering a surprising level of emotional depth in scenes where 'Slater' existentially ponders his nature as a fictional construction - though, as expected, Arnold's real strength lies in his blowing things up and shooting cheesy one liners, which he gleefully delivers in spades, raising countless unquenchable laughs. Similarly, Austin O'Brian mercifully manages to mostly avoid the irritation frequently associated with child co-stars, carrying enough charm to make up for the moments where he overstays his welcome. The eternally classy Charles Dance proves deliciously suave and maniacal as a master assassin, delivering a parody of supervillainhood superbly rendered enough to stand up to Schwarzenegger, as does Tom Noonan as an unhinged, axe-wielding psychopath. Robert Prosky gives a charmingly warm and likable performance as the elderly projectionist who gives Danny his ""magic ticket"", and F. Murray Abraham, despite being saddled with a thankless supporting character, is a worthy inclusion if only for Danny's ""he killed Mozart!"" crack. The treatment of Frank McRae's stereotypical, incomprehensibly jiving police chief is likely to evoke as many groans as roars of laughter, but the hilariously unorthodox inclusion of Sir Ian McKellen as the character Death from Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal is in itself nearly worth seeing the film single-handedly, as McKellen's effortless class, dignity and stage presence carry through even through a tragically brief role. Despite occasionally tripping over its own excesses, the cunning wit throughout and moments of sporadic brilliance make Last Action Hero an undeniable success with enough energy and fun to spare even if it may not be the cinematic triumph it appears geared to be at its triumphant beginning. -8/10",Last Action Hero
72,fmarkland32,If only it were the last bad action movie...,3,4 September 2006,"Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as Jack Slater the hero of Austin O'Brien who knows Slater's world inside and out. However when the kid gets a hold of a magic ticket, he becomes part of the movie and helps his hero fight off the bad guys although when the bad guys cross over into the real world, it is up to Slater and the kid to send them back and prevent them from ruling the real world. Last Action Hero comes packed with great potential. The idea in question is an idea that was later conveyed in Scream and it's subsequent sequels. Still Last Action Hero is a failure because the problem is that the production is bloated and there is just too much too juggle as McTiernan tries hard to make a coherent story. That isn't to say there aren't a couple interesting touches here and there, the fish out of water jokes with Slater in the real world as well as the whole ugliness of the real world compared to the movie world is an interesting concept. In fact had the movie taken more with this, the movie may have been a winner but because it stumbles around the action movie clichés and tries extremely hard to poke fun at them, the movie becomes a groaner.*1/2 out of 4-(Poor)",Last Action Hero

People really don't understand and don't appreciate action films this day. I grew up watching action heroes and Last Action Hero is my childhood film with Arnold I grew up watching. After 14 years I re watch this movie today and I still love it. I love this movie to death I miss Arnold Schwarzenegger I miss him, I wish he would make such a good action films today I really do wish. Why is Arnold now fat and he can't get in to shape anymore why?Back there were all these action heroes who were my idols! Where are they now: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Chuck Norris, Steven Seagal, Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton where are all those action heroes now? I miss those guys a grew up with it. I miss the Rambo trilogy, Tang & Cash, Demolition Man, Commando, The Running Man, Predator, Total Recall, Red Heat and of course Last Action Hero. Everyone today is talking about Terminator films what about this movie? It doesn't get even mentioned and get's a bad rap why? I don't understand the hate it is a f****** satire man! It is a fiction not to be taken serious and that a good one. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Austin O'Brien does a solid job at acting performance.

It may be a satire, but Last Action Hero just may be one of the last true action films. Real stunts, real explosions, real destruction, reality gone twisted. It's Arnold's most subversive movie, and it's many things, but bad ain't one of them. I miss those movie I grew up and I want them so much back. It is a real shame making an action film today without real practical effects or without CGI every god damn action film today has to be CGI, no explosions nothing. I want the 90's back and I want my childhood back. Why can't we have a good action movies anymore what is wrong with Hollywood this days? I miss Arnold I miss his stunts I miss all that. I miss John McTiernan I miss his movies work direction. please come back why did you leave us? You movies are my favorite, Predator, Die Hard, Die Hard with a Vengeance, The Hunt for Red October and The 13th Warrior those were really good movies. He directed perfectly I love his art direction I didn't see anything bad about this movie. I love the actors it was well done acted it is an entertaining flick.

The movie also shows off the bad side to getting inside your favorite movies (so there! to you Jason and Freddie fans) as the kid gets into trouble for revealing too much of the plot, but Arnold does come up with numerous reasonable excuses to support his reality's idiosyncrasies. This movie reminds me of the film ""Delirious"" as I wonder if Hollywood is really dictating their lives or are our films the psychic impressions of actual worlds. Arnold shows a remarkable comic range in this action-fantasy-comedy. F. Murray Abraham is Practice, the man with a million catch-phrases and Anthony Quinn is the misunderstood Italian crime-boss. Charles Dance has a lot of fun with the role of the hit-man who discovers Austin O'Brien's reality-hopping ticket as the young actor discovers nearly too late that he's just a comic sidekick. The movie takes off as Dance comes here and discovers our grim, disappointing reality. there's also a bit of a dark note as the character meets the actor and discovers the reality of his fictitious life. He realizes that the bad events of his life may have come from the pen of a sadistic Hollywood hack. And then there's the beautiful Bridgette Wilson who turns in a spunky performance as Arnold's would-be spinster daughter. I'd walk a thousand miles to meet her !

77,Min111,I first seen this on television,9,11 August 2017,"A great nineties action movie. I remember watching this on television as a child during the night, and I enjoyed every second of it. I just didn't know what the name of the movie was back then. Now I know. Last Action Hero. It's one of my favourite action movies from the nineties. It's something I could watch several times as a kid. I have the video now.The story was interesting. It's about a kid named Danny Madigan who likes watching action movies. He is given a golden or magic ticket that has special powers. You need to see the movie what that ticket does. Danny Madigan is from New York City. He's a loner, and has no friends. He lives with his mother who is single. The movie, Last Action Hero, is entertaining with plenty of action. The movie is funny. It will get you to laugh. It's also fantasy. It's a great kids movie, yet a great movie for all.The villains or bad guys were probably the best thing about this movie. I liked that guy named Benedict. He was cool, calm and collected. He was serious. He meant business. He's a psychopath. I liked one of his eyes. He was the main bad guy. Another bad guy was the Ripper. He's a sociopath. He looks like a monster. His face says it all. I also liked how they included a cartoon character, but it would've been great had it had more screen time. It's a cat who happens to be a detective. His name is Whiskers. I found that funny. The same goes with several other characters such as John Practice. I find his last name funny: Practice. I also like the girl named Whitney. She is so hot!This movie had potential to be even greater.
I'm a huge fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and he was the perfect choice to play the main character. He played Jack Slater (I like his name by the way.) He was so cool! He was so calm! He's so assured. I like how he's dressed. Looks great in that jacket of his. I like how strong and tough he is. I don't think anyone else could've played that role any better. I would say it's one of Arnold Schwarzenegger more underrated movies.There's nothing more to say other than the fact it's just a good and entertaining action movie. It's also an adventure, comedy and fantasy movie. There are many genres, and that's why ""Last Action Hero"" was so good.",Last Action Hero
78,Antagonisten,Not enough,4,27 December 2005,"Sometimes when it comes to movies i like the idea and ambition but not the result. This is one of those times. The idea of making an action movie that is both action-filled as well as a parody of the genre is not bad really. But the result here is far from what it could have been, despite the potential.There are several reasons why this movie fails. First of all the comedy is not as spot-on as it has to be for something like this to work. There are so many things to make fun of in the tragic genre of 1980's steroid-action. Sometimes they succeed, but many things are also left unnoticed. The transition between the fantasy-world of movies and the ""real"" world is really the high-point of the movie. Cars not exploding instantly when hit, hands hurting after punches... This is where the comedy could have been elevated to great levels with a better script.Arnold Schwarzenegger is not much of an actor. But he does have a sense of humor that works very much in his favor, i always find it easier to accept a poor actor if he can poke fun at himself. He works nicely here and i wouldn't put this movies failure on him, nor would i put it on director John McTiernan who (as usual) produces decent action-sequences. Rather it's mostly the script that is lacking. While i consider this to be a failure, it's still worth pointing out that it's a lot better than what you'd expect considering most of the reviews it was given on it's release. I rate it 4/10.",Last Action Hero
79,statuskuo,"Okay, It's Not Perfect",7,16 April 2020,"I recall having massive expectations for this movie back in 1993 and after watching it with friends, we came out...well, shell-shocked.Fast forward, 2020 and I popped in the blu-ray again. Though not perfect, this is one of those movies that loves movies...specifically action movies and has the insight to parody itself. Most notably because writer Shane Black who was responsible for late 80's early 90's action flicks like ""Lethal Weapon"" or ""The Last Boy Scout."" Two movie I wore out my VHS tapes on.Helmed by action maestro John McTiernan, I kept wondering what could possibly go wrong?Probably because the kid, Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) is pretty obnoxious. (as some other reviewers had mentioned).
He's supposedly a film fan and spends a great deal of time nagging Jack about the tropes of action movies. This is like someone poking you in the chest throughout the movie. He's shrill and unpleasant and now we're left to spend hours with him. It's worse than babysitting (same reason why I hated ""Scream""). This meta comedy works well, if you're a fan, and if you can ignore this kid, the rest is really entertaining. You get funny one-liners and silly humor. A lot of inside jokes about buddy cop movies but also you get a lot of great cameos (Robert Patrick and Sharon Stone as the most notable).To me the blend of action comedy probably could've worked better if not everything was thrown at the screen. Maybe an example of too much of a good thing. Though, McTiernan is a genius as juggling all the storylines and pace, it still sags heavy due to the inability to drop great jokes (the video store is a GREAT moment, but it probably could've been trimmed in writing). Which is what I think this movie sort of lacked. A fine tuned focus. It's fun in so many parts, and goofy and I'm aboard, but then they throw in these odd moments (pulling a hair from her head) which drags things out too long. It does feel, and has been confirmed, things were being written as it went along. No final script means a LOT of problems (also a very short post production schedule).
Also, when they do get to Danny's ""real world"" you feel the heaviest part of the movie because the fun seemed to be over.I would never call this the disaster that the 90's labeled it. If anything, it is a time capsule to the action genre of its day. A perfect collection of pop culture history, if you take the time to watch.",Last Action Hero
80,bheadher,Waay underrated delightful entertainment...,9,4 September 2016,"I'm giving it a 9, since the movie tickles you all the way through...I'm not sure who came up with the idea to spoof action movies, but I'm sure glad they did. Last Action Hero is so irreverent it is hilarious.Danny Madigan is a big fan of Jack Slater, a larger-than-life action hero played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Danny goes to his favorite movie theater to see the latest Jack Slater fare, and listens to a story told by the theater projectionist, Nick, about a magic ticket he's had for years. Nick gives Danny the ticket, and somehow Danny is transported into the movie right behind Slater in the middle of a car chase scene...The laughs begin right away as Jack and Danny get wrapped up in the movies plot, and just keep going on and on.Last Action hero has a stellar cast literally, having a huge selection of big name stars, which simply adds to the delight...This movie has had lower reviews than I would have ever imagined. It's quite sad really, since the movie is not only hilariously funny throughout, it also has some very poignant moments as well...it deserves so much more...And as something of a p.s. Arnold will always be remembered for his stellar role in The Terminator; but he really showed an acting talent in this movie as well...in fact, his performance frankly was perfectly done...",Last Action Hero

The film is a ton of fun and it really explores every aspect of the theme's idea and brings it to life. It takes the grand scale of action from T2 and mixes it with heaps of comedy references and clichés, and brings a killer soundtrack with it.

Arnie gives maybe his best performance ever and there are so many situations that bring laughs!,Last Action Hero
83,DavidSim240183,A quite witty and sophisticated sendup of the action film genre...(no really!),9,10 January 2008,"Last Action Hero is a grossly misunderstood film. Everybody hated it because they just couldn't understand it. Either they were expecting another Schwarzenegger action blockbuster, or another film that deflated his tough guy persona like Twins and Kindergarten Cop.The finished result is actually a combination of the two, but that clearly didn't satisfy audiences. It had the bad luck to open in the same week as 1993's biggest moneymaker Jurassic Park, and it bombed big time. Which is a shame because LAH is that rarest of things. An action film that deconstructs itself one cliché at a time.I'm not sure what people were expecting with LAH. But I can't say I hated the film. In fact I found it refreshing and witty. I loved the way it punctures the unreality it surrounds itself with. I think its a film that deserves reappraisal as one of the most knowing and sophisticated action movies you could ever hope to see.Everything about LAH is designed to spoof and comment upon action movies. It is for the action film genre what Scream was for slasher movies. Or Galaxy Quest for Star Trek fandom. If its a film that seems overblown and over the top, that's only because its making fun of its contemporaries, which are exactly the same, only without the self-reflexive philosophising.The film opens with a dead-on parody of many an action film. A hostage situation. A crazy criminal. Dozens of police cars and even more guns. A blustering, hot-head of a police chief. And then the camera focuses on a glaringly aggressive closeup of a pair of heavy-set boots. It pans reverently up past jeans, a belt buckle, shirt and jacket, until it reveals the face of Arnold Schwarzenegger.Holding what must be the biggest handgun ever constructed, he barges onto the scene and manages to do what the entire LAPD couldn't. He saves the hostages (bar his son), boots people out of his way like they were footballs, gets the crazy and saves the day.Its a scene so ludicrous it could only be a fantasy. And it is. Because it's a film. Jack Slater III, starring the biggest action star of the moment, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) is the only one in the audience, and he can't wait to see the next instalment, Jack Slater IV. When he acquires a magic ticket from a cinema projectionist (Robert Prosky), it ends up transporting him into the film.The film of Jack Slater IV has become a blinding and bewildering world. And Danny is caught right in the middle. Partnered up with Jack, they must track down Benedict (Charles Dance), the film's villain. Which becomes more complicated when Benedict gets his hands on the ticket, and breaks through to our world.Anyone who says Last Action Hero is ridiculous and absurd only demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the film. The film's excesses are the exact type of thing its mocking its contemporaries for. And the film never misses a trick. Any cliché or plot hole, and you can be sure LAH will assault it somewhere.In fact its nice to see an action film that's fully aware of how inane action movies usually are. Director John McTiernan, one of my favourite action filmmakers, explores every possible angle there is to be found. A typical day in Jack Slater's life is so full of unbelievable absurdities you wonder how he could have survived in the job for so long.McTiernan is quite merciless and scathing when it comes to spoofing action movies. He leaves no stone unturned. The typical gigantic explosions. Connect the dots plot lines. Villains who talk to they're enemies when they should be killing them. Slater has tons of guns on his person. He's almost never seen without a jumbo-sized cigar. And in the car chase to end all car chases, Jack drives off an overpass and lands on the road with no discernible damage. And then does the same thing in reverse. It even looks suspiciously like the storm drain from that chase scene in T2.There are too many in-jokes and observations to mention in one review. In fact the film is quite exhausting at times with its extensive knowledge of the genre. But just about every pun hits the mark. And it gives Arnie plenty of opportunities to do what he enjoys most, sending up his own image.LAH is basically one long commentary on action movie clichés. All helpfully provided by Danny. And when the film reenters our world, it achieves new and wondrous heights. Jack can actually feel pain. Things don't come as naturally anymore.And in the film's most inspired moment, Jack meets the man who made him, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnie clearly enjoys riffing on his own image, enthusiastically endorsing Planet Hollywood, while his wife Maria Shriver looks off to the side in frustration.LAH does sometimes feel like it has a few ideas too many (such as an animated cat in Jack's world) and it does perhaps go on longer than it needs to, but this is an exceptionally witty and very involving action movie parody. Packed with in-jokes, surprise cameos (Sharon Stone and Robert Patrick's are particularly inspired) and every gag in the book, Last Action Hero is a real unopened treasure.It deserves high commendation indeed for having the guts to satirise one of Hollywood's biggest breadwinners. And if any genre deserves a bit of spoofing, its the self-important action genre. Shame people didn't understand that.",Last Action Hero
84,malkane316,quick reviews!,8,23 May 2004,"Another underrated movie, and one which few people understand, or try to. This is a spoof of action movies, primarily those starring Arnie and Stallone, ones which director McTiernen has made a living from. That said, the action, stunts, effects are good, the cast, especially Arnie, ham it up as much as possible, and the plot is pretty clever. Tons of in-jokes make this an entertaining film, and I'll admit that's all it is. But that's all it is trying to be. Don't whine to me about artistic merit, character development, internal meditations on life and all that crap-I have those movies on my list too. It's an action movie, where the bad guys are supposed to die, cars are meant to explode when scratched, the good guy is untouchable, and it knows it. 8 out of 10",Last Action Hero
85,kgprophet,The world is a better place because of John McTiernon.,5,28 November 2011,"John McTiernan is a master action movie craftsman. He helped change the equation with the blockbuster ""Diehard"". He made sitting around in a submarine exciting in ""Hunt For Red October"". He also made ""Predator"", a great action vehicle for rising star Arnold Schwartzenwhatever. ""Last Action Hero"" was in reality a different genre than another Hollywood action flick, and is both successful at the attempt and at fault at the execution. McTiernan helped reinvigorate the action genre by turning the action hero into a normal guy in ""Diehard"". Similarly, the man who saves the day in ""Hunt for Red October"" is just a CIA analyst who reluctantly gets involved. For Arnold, he had done over-the-top ""Total Recall"" and been nearly invincible in ""Terminator 2"". For this director/star pair, it seemed like the next step in 'taking it to the next level'. Both probably realised that any action film that tried to top the last big action film would become a self-parody. So they deliberately poked fun at the ridiculousness of the genre. However, that made the film no longer a big Hollywood action movie, it made it an experimental film, almost like a Godard film.Playing with the characters, the story conventions, the glitzy production sets, the always great looking actors, etc., the scriptwriters managed to pigeon-hole every cliché into this screenplay, and for the most part it looks like the filmmakers had a ball doing it. The folly came with the primary character being a 13 year old (or so) kid. He was played a little too cliché as well, not realistic enough for supposedly being from the ""real world"". Then there was the whole gimmick of transporting to the movie world via a ""magic ticket"". That really had little inspiration and should have been more indistinct (a worm hole, the kid is really dreaming, etc).What works, ironically, is that however over-the-top the crimes the bad guy commits in the movie world, he seemingly can get away with much more in the real world (at least in the tougher neighbourhoods in New York). The other statement (which reshoots probably backtracked on) is that people actually get hurt in the real world when they go through a plate glass window, or get shot by a bullet. It is easy to see why the movie was not well received. The main objective of a summer movie-going audience is to forget about the troubles of the real world, and basically take a roller coaster ride for 2 hours. The moment the blood or pain we see on the screen is supposed be real, it is no longer fun.For the first 2/3 of LAH, we are given that roller coaster ride that would later be the norm for director Michael Bay. Flying cars, explosions every few minutes, and bad bad bad dialogue. I found myself smiling along during the wink and nods at the movie clichés, but only to get annoyed when the kid started griping about it constantly. The old theatre guy also felt a bit uninspired. I think McTiernan should feel lucky he was able to get away with making this film, because the world is a better place for it.",Last Action Hero
86,frankfob,Say what you want about it . . .,5,16 June 2003,"but I actually liked it, and I'm not particularly an Arnie fan (he's not a very good actor and he's a terrible governor). Some of his movies are pretty good, some are pretty lousy, but this one isn't, IMO, anywhere near as bad as its reputation. I happen to think it's a lot of fun. Sure it's cartoonish, but ARNIE is cartoonish! That's what makes this movie so much fun; all of his movies--in fact, all action movies in general--are not much more than live-action cartoons, and this movie gleefully makes fun of them in general, and Arnie in particular, and the best part of it is that he's in on the joke. I don't know why it was savaged so much when it was first released; it really didn't deserve it. Several of his later movies (""Eraser"" and ""End of Days"", for example) were far more deserving of that kind of treatment than this one is.Anyway, I just like this movie. The action scenes were exciting, there were some very funny lines and a ton of clever in-jokes, some great cameos, and it was just an all-around fun flick. Try it, you'll like it.",Last Action Hero

88,ayoreinf,much more than a simple spoof,9,10 December 2007,"I've been reading different comments on this film here on and off for a while. I'm sorry to say: even those who love the film, and some do love it, don't fully get it. If it was nothing more than a complex spoof on action movies, many of the gags would have been cut off the pace would have been relentless and many action fans that came to see another Schwarzenegger movie wouldn't mind some extra jokes. They didn't mind ""Twins"" all that much.If you look carefully you start realizing all those gags have a certain sense. The whole movie is in fact about the shifty relations between the art of cinema, the commercial life of cinema, and the real world. Its been done many times -Woody Allen did a few films on the subject ""Zelig"" and ""Purple Rose of Cairo"" are just two examples. Jhon Landis comments on it in most of his good films, Even Steven Spielberg does it in his fantasy films like ""Hook"" another under-appreciated film and in his Indiana Jones trilogy (didn't see no.4 yet). But I can't think on anyone who did it so straight forwardly in an action film. It was a tricky combination to begin with and it proved to be too much for most of the action lovers. As I don't want to add any spoilers I'll direct you all to the trivia section of this site. But I want too add one more thing. While commenting about the relations of cinema with reality this movie doesn't forget that it is a movie which means that all the things it says about the art and the industry from the so called real world inside the film apply to this film as well, and it does.

90,Pookyiscute,"Best action movie, ever",7,4 January 2006,"I hate action movies. There, I've said it. I know that I'll probably get so much hate mail from every guy that reads this, but the truth is, I find action movies, dull and boring. There is nothing to them generally and it's just a bunch of fighting. I find it boring, more than anything. But, to each his own I suppose. Give me Steel Magnolias, any day. At any rate, this movie is set apart, far from any other action movie. In a way, it makes fun of all other aciton movies. Sort of like 'Scream' is to the horror genre.Danny (O'Brien), a thirteen year old boy from New York, lives alone with his mother in the 'not-so-nice' area of town. He skips school to go to the movies, and to hang out with his fifty-something friend, who runs the projectors. One night, after his apartment is robbed, he runs to the theater at midnight, to see a sneak preview of the new Jack Slater movie, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Now, when I say that, I mean in the movie, there is a separate Schwarzenegger.With a magic ticket that his friend gives him, Danny enters the world of Jack Slater, and is now inside the movie. With (of course)action, girls, more action, and more than a few punches at the expense of Arnold (in real life and in the movies), the film is made up of good humor, and plenty of guy action, and is very entertaining. Quite enjoyable, and very laughable, and fun to watch.And, guys, don't think that just 'cause I'm a girl, and I don't normally like action movies, that this one sucks, or anything like that, 'cause it doesn't. It's probably more of a guy movie than a girl movie, but I still love it!",Last Action Hero
91,ReelCheese,An Unappreciated Gem,10,20 August 2006,"We all have that one movie we absolutely love but of which no one else seems to think very highly. My 10/10 rating for LAST ACTION HERO signals that this is mine. But before you laugh me out of IMDb, allow me to explain why I think this notorious bomb is in actuality an unappreciated gem.The central highlight of LAST ACTION HERO is the plot. I've seen this film three times, and in each instance I've been completely drawn into the notion that there exists a magical Movieland where we too could travel if only we had a magic ticket. It's sort of every film buff's fantasy, one that we get to enjoy through young Danny Madigan(Austin O'Brien) as he meets up with clichéd action hero Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger, of course). It's priceless to see the real-world youth interact with the silver screen community and its cartoon cats, 555 phone numbers, and impossibly perfect women. It's equally entertaining when Slater comes into our world, discovering that he can't effortlessly smash his fist through a vehicle window or blow up his enemies with ease. Love it or hate it, you have to admit the story gets high marks for originality.The writing is another highpoint, convincingly mixing so many great elements. Those behind the script nicely exploited the vast potential within the storyline. LAST ACTION HERO is on the one hand a satire of so many action films in which the likes of Schwarzenegger have straightfacedly starred. The oft-sequelized Slater chomps a cigar and wields bullets like confetti at a wedding, effortlessly taking out the bad guys and spewing witty quips. At another angle, the movie is a lighthearted romp, with one-liners and plenty of pokes at Hollywood. From another viewpoint, it's a dramatic piece, with Danny struggling to make it through an awkward age and Slater coming to grips with his unreeled existence -- and that in the real world, the bad guys can and do win. Nowhere along the line is it Oscar-caliber stuff, but it is entertaining.There are other things to like about LAST ACTION HERO. The action is well-paced and well-placed. The acting is more than up to par, with O'Brien and Schwarzenegger great individually and as a tandem. The humor is sharp and effective, with Arnie often hilarious in his self-deprecating ways.Perhaps much of the negative criticism directed LAST ACTION HERO came from those who didn't understand what it was trying to do. This was never meant to be another one of Arnie's shoot-'em-ups, lame attempts at comedy or even a family film. It was just meant to be fun to watch. And that's what matters most in any film. There are things about the film that don't work, but there are things about THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE that don't work, either. All that really matters is, Are we entertained? On that note, LAST ACTION HERO delivers.",Last Action Hero

Maybe it was too ahead of its time and maybe it still is, but I enjoyed it a lot. Arnold Schwarzenegger was extremely brave and humble to joke about himself and the movies he tends to be in, just a testament to someone who appreciates all they have. All the cameos and film references are some great touches and I love the cheesy over the top sequences and dialogue. I think the overall message is good; while Hollywood isn't an accurate representation of the world, it's still an important part of our culture and a way for us to see life as we wish it was.",Last Action Hero
93,Jerique,Fantasy Comes To Life!,9,23 January 2010,"Shane Black is a co-writer and you can tell certainly because a lot of witty comedy that comes from his hit Kiss Kiss Bang Bang are also in this film.Personally, this is my favourite Arnold movie. Not only is it a great action/adventure movie but it twists the laws of realism while still keeping loyal with the story.Arnold plays Jack Slater, a big time hero cop, in the on-screen series Jack Slater. In the movie Danny (Austin O'Brien) is going to see Jack Slater IV and with the use of a magical ticket from his friend, Nick (Robert Prosky), who also operates the theater's films, he lands himself alongside Jack every step of the way.As the movie goes on, Danny tries to convince Jack that this whole life of his isn't so real, in fact it's just a movie. Jack can't find his theory right until he sees his enemy Benedict (Charles Dance) go through the wall without it smashing or anything. When Jack goes to the real world he's no longer happy Jack Slater, the hero. He's now saddened by knowing that his life is fake. Still he goes after Benedict.It all comes together and Arnold has to play himself and Jack in a scene. It's filled with some great humour, action, kick ass soundtrack and an imaginative story to boot.Not to mention a grand list of cameos and tremendous casting.Arnold himself has some amazing lines and his timing is perfect as well as his emotion. Amazing role for him and I'd say is best, even better than the Terminator.Austin O'Brien plays Danny and though he's a young one at this time frame he's grown to be something much more. He definitely adds a lot of comedic relief to the story and combines a lot with Arnold to make some great comedy. As well as Danny's character would be me no doubt - trying to lecture Arnold (Jack) on movies and how its obviously a movie. He plays the role of the audience superbly.Charles Dance plays Benedict and he does a great job. While he was villain he still has a few comedic lines. Especially when he gives his end-of-the-movie speech and his few correcting lines (ie. ""It's behind the 8-ball, you old fool."") F. Murray Abraham plays the small role of Jack Slater's friend John Practise. While his role is small here and will be remembered forever as Antonio Salieri in Amadeus, he still had a good role here and did a fine job.The rest are no more than minor characters who just support the main ones, or the had such a small cameo that there is no reason to give an analysis on all of them.The Director is not well-known, but he's done 4 amazing films, including this one: Die Hard 1 & 3, Basic and Last Action Hero.While his role in the film wasn't much, for what he did do he sure can show why he was chosen. Great film for him and I thank him for making it come to life. Thanks John McTiernan.If you don't love this movie, you either don't like Arnold or you don't like action. If you like both, you'll absolutely love this movie as much as I do. I keep hoping and praying Jack Slater becomes an actual flick on the big screen. Could be quite an interesting story.",Last Action Hero
94,ivanmessimilos,"If you dont like it, you dont understand it",8,24 May 2020,"John McTiernan is one of the best action film directors, films like Die Hard (my personal favorite), Die Hard 3 or Predator are among the very top directed action ever, no doubt about it. Maybe that's why this film went under some radar or maybe it didn't get the attention it deserves.The film can be viewed from two perspectives as I experienced it. The first is that this is a solid (to say the least) standard frivolous entertaining action movie. The second is that this is also a parody / satire. Both are correct, but if we add this second perspective then it gains extra in value.Little Danny loves to watch movies. His favorite actor is Arnold Schwarzenegger who acts in numerous action films and always plays the same character, an invincible badass who in a fight with a multitude of villains eventually, after a million bullets and dozens of explosions, emerges as the winner. Does this sound familiar to you? Danny's best friend is an elderly Nick who works in the cinema so he often lets him watch movies on his own. One night she gives him a magic gold card that makes Danny create himself in a movie he was just watching at the cinema.Danny here in the film represents me, or all those who grew up on action movies from the eighties and nineties, the golden age of that genre. My favorite actor was Arnold, I watched each of his films several times. Clearly this also includes Willis, Van Damme and Stallone (Rambo 3 is probably in my top 5 if we look at how many times I've looked at it). The most important thing for me was for the main character to charge, beat and shoot about fifty people and in the end overcome all obstacles and save people. When I first watched this movie (the first few times) I saw only action and nothing more.However, the film is so much a target and a parody of these same action films that only one great article can be written about it. I could see and understand this only a little later when I was growing up. So much base, humor and cameo roles are rarely seen in one film especially if the championship is action. Unfortunately, today (as a rule) such good action films are no longer made.I don't like to use this sentence, but I think it's true for this movie.

95,Indy-52,one of Arnold's best,9,18 March 2000,"This is definitely one of the best movies Arnold Schwarzy has ever done. It is a great spoof of the typical action hero he often plays. It's great how he kinda admits some of his flicks are ridiculous. I especially loved the scenes where Danny tries to prove him that he is in a movie, saying there are no bad-looking women in California, which is impossible. Watch out for the scenes in the video store, where you see a poster of Sylvester Stallone playing the Terminator,(because Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't exist in the movie) and Jack says ""that's his best performance ever"": he's actually saying that his part in Terminator 2 was his best ever AND that that movie is better than anything Sylvester has ever done. So that was a very funny part. But, although this is an action spoof, there are a lot of  good action scenes, i like the one with the elevator and the roof of the building. The scene at the end with the premiere of the movie is great.

96,Mr_Censored,Misunderstood but ultimately brilliant lampoon of old-school action flicks.,7,5 May 2009,"""Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers. Ha! You didn't know I was gonna say that, did you?!"" - Jack SlaterIntended to be a huge summer blockbuster, but ultimately becoming a big-time flop, ""Last Action Hero"" stars the then-infallible Arnold Schwarzenegger as the fictional action hero, Jack Slater. Jack Slater stars in his own franchise, ""Slater"" and is idolized by Danny (Austin O'Brien), a young boy who escapes his real-world troubles with an unhealthy movie-going habit. When an opportunity arrives for Danny to see the upcoming ""Slater IV"" prior to its release, he can't pass it up, and a magical ticket given to him by the theater owner propels him into Jack Slater's world, where clichés rule the realm and anything can happen.Unfortunately, ""Last Action Hero"" has been maligned through the years for being both misunderstood and eclipsed by the success of another 1993 blockbuster, ""Jurassic Park."" What many may not realize, until they give it a fair chance, is that it's a brilliant action satire that serves a double function in that it is as action packed as it is humorous. As Jack Slater, Arnold pokes more fun at himself than any critic ever could. Teamed up with director John McTiernan (""Die Hard,"" ""Predator""), it's got loads of explosions, stunts and special effects, so much so that it represents the best of 80's/early 90's action film, while simultaneously mocking it. Austin O'Brien plays the young protagonist well, and thankfully, isn't just another annoying kid in a summer blockbuster. The subplot of Danny's escapism will appeal to and hit close to home for many a film fan, which is one of the film's greatest strengths.If there is one flaw, though, it's that the film is about twenty minutes too long, which means the joke wears thin after a while. It seems that ""Last Action Hero"" is stuffed with almost too many ideas and in-jokes, which is where it loses points. Despite this, though, it's immensely entertaining and unrelenting in its roasting of typical Schwarzenegger fare. Forget the fact that critics hated it and audiences rejected it; ""Last Action Hero"" is like a valentine to action fans everywhere, a bold and unique blockbuster that perhaps never found its way to its true audience",Last Action Hero
97,monkeysgalore,"A Wonderful Parody of Action Films and Genre Tropes, and a Great Arnold Vehicle",8,23 April 2020,"I would give this the full five stars if I could, but there are a few small things that keep me from doing so, and the film just ever quite reached its potential. I do understand the criticism and hate, but I think the good really overshadows the bad here. This is a great, if unsubtle, parody and it really works.Arnold Schwarzenegger knows his audience. He knows exactly what people want and expect from his movies and he always delivers. He's in fine form here, playing his persona to a T, and doing it wonderfully. Even when he's making more fun of himself than usual, he's a great action star. O'Brien was fine as the kid, and not as annoying as he could've been. Dance was great and suitably OTT as the archetypal action movie villain, and perfect for the role.This is a pretty good script, obviously written by people who know and appreciate action movies. The fact that Shane Black helped with it makes me love this even more. John McTiernan does an excellent directorial job, with some great action scenes and excellent and atmospheric world building.The action is crazy and totally unbelievable, which is the point. It's a parody, but still with a mildly serious edge, and it never enters National Lampoon territory. The opening rooftop scene, the car chase, the house shootout/fight, the theatre shootout, the house scene, the street scene, the theatre scene, and the climax on the rooftop are all very well done as only McTiernan could present. There's an excellent head-on car crash, and lots of other cool scenes. There's also a nice Terminator reference. It's all great.If you want a fun, entertaining parody and lighthearted action movie, then this is for you. It's another shining example of the glorious 90s action period.",Last Action Hero

99,BadWebDiver,Totally THE best action spoof movie of all time (and prob one of the best spoof movies ever).,9,1 September 2004,"I am totally amazed that most of the so-called ""expert"" film critics at the time didn't seem to have a clue what this movie was doing. It is positively one of the tightest, most brilliant, sly, wickedly satirical action movie spoofs of all time. I am also rather amazed that Arnie actually agreed to this one; it's almost like he's biting the hand that fed him.The biggest clue of this movie is in the opening shot, when the whole picture wipes into frame in the shape of a ""movie"" screen (hint, hint!) From then on, anyone with any experience at watching blockbuster action movies at all should have picked up how the scene was taking the standard setup-action pieces of the time, and then pushing them a little bit further than normal; so that they become an obvious (to most people) parody of the situation. The close-up of the feet as Jack exits from the car is just a little closer and off-angle than normal. The ranting chief yelling at the hero that he's gonna get fired if he disobeys orders is just a little bit more heated that the standard action movie would do it. Come ON people, couldn't you get the tongue-in-cheek nature of this?Then we fuzz out and see the ""real"" story - introducing Danny, our viewer's representative (played by a very adorable and very chatty Austin O'Brien). The one scene I dislike in this movie is the actual ""real-life"" robbery scene at Danny's home, which comes across as a little too bleak and depressing; even though it does set up the thematic contrasts in the story very well. On the other hand, one of my all-time favorite scenes is when Danny is in school watching the Olivier version of ""Hamlet""; and he starts to drift and re-imagines the story in a modern action style. (Gee, if I had a penny for every time I've done that with a pretentious old film - well, anyway...)Of course the two outstanding highlights of this movie are the police station/video store scenes in the Jack Slater movie; and the climactic show-down at the big premiere, especially when the action hero confronts the movie star: ""You have caused me a lot of pain. I don't like you very much."" (Y'know, I've often felt that is movie characters could come alive, some actors would have great reason to worry. Just a thought.)All I can say is, if you can't get this, you don't really deserve to be watching movies, or even let out to the cinema. It's too complicated for you! Just go back to your padded cell, and vegetate.Best lines: ""Mom, you're turning him into a wimp!""; ""This has got to work. I'm going to win. Wait a minute; I'm the comic relief.

102,lagriff05,Laaaaaaaaaaaaaame.,4,26 August 2009,"Last Action Hero is...I don't know, a satire of Arnold Schwarzenegger? A satire of action movies in general? That's the first problem, it doesn't know what the hell it is. At first you think it's going to be one of those fish-out-of-water movies where someone from our world is transported to one he doesn't belong in, but it also has the satire elements there, even though it isn't sure what it's a satire of. Then later on it seems like a sort of existentialist thing? Come on, you idiots, pick a theme and stick with it. Whatever it is, there are some funny parts here that are really genuinely witty, tongue in cheek and clever, and some parts that just make you roll your eyes out of boredom, and that's the main problem with this - it's dull. It doesn't seem to have much direction at all as it plods on and on for what seems like forever, and while there are good ideas here and the intention seems to have been good, it's just too contrived and stale, and it doesn't really excite that much, as hard as it tries. Austin O'Brien plays the kid in this movie in what is probably its most annoying point, too, dragging it down in mostly every scene he's in. Lame. We don't really need to have all of this self-reflective, obnoxious ""it's a movie! it's a movie!"" bullshit shilled at us, anyway. And why is he even doing it? What's there to gain by ruining what is supposed to be his favorite movie franchise? It makes no sense. This movie could have been a very funny and clever parody without the kid or any of the bullshit about the real world, or any of that, and you know what? It would have still been manageable as a full length theatrical movie if you took out all of that. Well the ending FINALLY comes after what seems like aeons, as well as suffering through some painfully stupid scenes and a plothole or two - why would the kid need to get Jack Slater back into the movie? Wouldn't the real Schwarzenegger play him again anyway in another sequel? This makes the climax very hard to really get into, especially when it seems like they wanted you to.

Is it a comedy? a fantasy? an action film? or all three? Whatever it is I never enjoyed watching it, it is actually a very annoying film. Arnold made a far better film with the same director called Predator and I had high hopes for this film in the summer of 1993 but Jurassic Park and Cliffhanger were far better summer blockbusters. Arnold followed this up with pretty good True Lies and the awful Junior and Arnolds time at the top was over, it was time for the likes of Keanu Reeves and Nicholas Cage to take over in films like Speed and Con Air. Action Heroes had changed and the likes of Stallone, Arnie and Seagal seemed old hat. One positive thing I can say about Last Action Hero is at least Arnold was brave enough to try something different, it didn't work.",Last Action Hero
104,counterrevolutionary,Should have been better,5,9 February 2003,"In spite of a promising premise (Arnold Schwarzenegger as Arnold Schwarzenegger as Jack Slater in JACK SLATER IV) and some very funny jokes (the HAMLET trailer, the whole movie premiere scene, ""He killed Mozart!""), LAST ACTION HERO ultimately fails.The reason is simple: For LAST ACTION HERO to work, JACK SLATER IV needed to play like a real action movie. The jokes should have been *on* JACK SLATER IV, not *in* it. The comedy should have come from the *inherent* silliness of action movies, which we would be seeing from one step removed and could therefore laugh at it (or with it, if you prefer), since we would have no emotional investment in JACK SLATER IV.Instead, they play JS4 as a Mel Brooks parody of an action movie. Cars explode *before* they crash. Our Hero causes cars to spin out behind him as he drives casually down the freeway. Nuns pack submachine guns to funerals. Arnie wipes his entire body clean of tar with a handkerchief. Ha ha ha. Unfortunately, the exaggeration destroys the premise of the movie (LAST ACTION HERO, I mean). Instead of being a parody of Arnold Schwarzenegger action movies, it's a parody of Leslie Nielsen action-movie parodies. And since the script never indicates that JACK SLATER IV is intended as a parody, what we're left with is a mere nonsensical muddle.But what totally kills the film are things like the rabbi, the cartoon cat, the attack dogs that make a pyramid, the women's JETSONS-style clothing, and stuff like that which has nothing to do with any action movie ever made.If Mr. McTiernan had thought back to his experiences helming DIE HARD, PREDATOR, and THE HUNT FOR RED October, he might have noticed the complete lack of animated animals or heavily-armed nuns. And he might have made a better movie.Addendum:On reflection, I think the problem is that the filmmakers didn't really believe that action movies are silly. That's why they felt that they had to pump up the silliness by making JS4 into a parody. But this means that instead of laughing at the silliness of action movies, we're supposed to laugh at the silliness of a parody, which makes no sense, since parodies are *supposed* to be silly.",Last Action Hero

Skip this. It's almost like the first spy kids movie. Arnold played a pretty good role but other than that. This movie is almost unwatchable. It kind of reminds me of space jam, who framed roger rabbit or something similar.

So when I rewatched it today, googling afterwards for pure interest I came across this Collider article that had the headline:"" Why this movie is a required watch for fanboys who take movies too seriously""Now. Only only is this article probably written as a weaponization attempt since fan-wars have escalated lately with marvel films and Star Wars, Star Trek etc because of mishandling of properties, so seeing Collider trying to attack us fans this way at first made me angry because thats not at all what this film is about.The beauty of Last Action Hero, is not just the cool action, kicking bad guys, creative scenes, epic dialog, fun with humor and one-liners, lots of tropes, lots of classic behavior. Making jokes at Hollywood itself, being both 4 dimensional in its scope and having a blast with it, without being remotely generic. Its so creative and fun.A timeless flick.But its at the end of the film where Jack is hurt, Danny needs to go back but doesn't want to leave him alone although he's gonna be okay. And Jack says how Danny needs to go back. He needs him to be out there, believing in him. Taking all the good emotions, the thoughts, lessons, all the good stuff we get from these movies and live a long, happy life.Always knowing our favorite super heroes are nearby. They wont leave our side. We know where to find them. They love us and we love them.Last Action Hero... isn't a movie preaching at the kids telling them to not take things seriously. Its a LOVE LETTER!... to the fans, letting them know that our favorite action heroes love us, care about our support and want us to believe in them, as well as enjoying our own lives, using all the cool stuff we draw from the movies to enhance our own.
Becomes idols ourselves whilst always knowing that our childhood champions will near nearby.That... is what Last Action Hero is all about. And I wanted to made that clear because of opportunists at these shill websites who love to make stuff up that simply isn't true.This is one of my favorite films. Childhood favorite, next to Turboman.
And it deserves to be highlighted and loved for what it so perfectly accomplished to do.Giving us a damn good ride, bringing the audience with it, through Danny, representing us as kids, watching all sorts of action, heroism, surprises, humorous one-liner and story developments, so very creatively at that.
Hot girls, mega awesome music, fantasy galore and at the end... a love-letter to us viewers.Who believe, love and adore these films. Our childhood heroes.
They just dont make them like this anymore.A flat 10 out of 10.
And Collider... there is nothing wrong with taking movies, comics, music or any other form of entertainment & Art seriously.It is because of our passion, our love and FAITH in these characters, franchises that they become so successful.
We're passionate human beings. And it feels good to be a fan.The fact that you guys over there complain about that, says nothing about us, but everything about you.
Long live fandom. And masterpieces like this film that is made for us. Respecting us and having a blast whilst taking us to all sorts of mega creative and new heights.

I know that this movie was meant to spoof those absurd action movies. Its these bonehead cookie-cutter critics that don't get that point. Bunch of pinheads keep saying the same thing because they allow smarmy d***head dictate to them what qualifies as quality movies. Check out the negative reviews on this site. They all go along the lines of ""worst movie I've ever seen"". Simple-minded predictable sheep. And now....... the review.Premise: Daniel(Austin O'Brien) gets a magic ticket from a movie store owner given to him by Houdini. While watching the latest Jack Slater movie, Daniel gets transported into the movie itself and ends up joining Jack Slater(played by Arnold) in his crazy adventures. This particular adventure involves Jack finding out the killer of his brother.Opinion: There are plenty of good things to say about this movie and very little bad things to say about this movie. The action is plentiful and the sets look great. That kid is annoying little wimp though(I must have watched this movie 10 times and still find that kid insufferable). The humor hits(the outlandish stunts, shooting TNT away with bullets, the hackneyed catchphrases, a funeral filled with strapped mob families etc). My biggest gripe with the film is that it has to constantly explain itself through that craven kid. Its obvious that Daniel is the voice of reason in this movie and what an annoying voice that is! Plus he is a major wimp. You mean to tell me that somebody breaks into your house armed with a knife, dares you to stab them in the back with the knife and you do nothing? What a wuss! Besides these flaws, this movie is still underrated gem that is worth picking up. A noteworthy satire on ludicrous action flicks and compared to the rubbish that passes for parody now(Date Movie, Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, Meet The Spartans etc)it holds up well after all these years.I'll leave you on this note: Not every movie that bombs at the box office is bad and not every movie that succeeds in the box office is good.

Most action is just spoof action, deliberately over-the-top.The first time I laughed was when the movie in the movie starts. The opening is so marvelously over-done. And then Danny makes smug comments, knowing exactly what is going to happen, just the way we all do when watching a too predictable standard action movie. And the movie kept being funny pretty much throughout. There are few cheap under-the-belt gags, basically just one fart gag but otherwise there is enough real humor to avoid that. That is a big, big plus!The movie includes at least one visual goof which makes you wonder if it is deliberate or not (the mechanism hauling an exploding car into the air is visible) but I am not sure it is a goof at all. It can just as well be an intentional, subtle gag; we are in an action movie to it is perfectly normal that anything that explodes do so with mechanisms that enhance the explosion.Acting is just fine. Anthony Quinn does the Italian gangster with good style. Arnold acts as he should. And I actually liked Austin O'Brien as Danny. His reaction to the movie world is so right!In the later part of the movie, the movie wanders off into action-thriller, which makes it go slightly off-course, but not too bad. Even then, the script is smart enough to make fun gags.Overall, I was extremely pleased with the movie. Watch it as a comedy, as a spoof of Arnold's simplest movies, movies with too much empty action, like Raw Deal (his worst IMHO) and Commando (ending in particular).

120,actionmoviestar,Underrated Action Film,8,23 April 2006,"""Last Action Hero"" the film that was Arnold's first real flop makes up for what money it lost at the box-office with a fresh, inventive plot and great performances. Looking back at this movie, I'm surprised that this was one of the box-office bombs for Summer 1993 and the year of 1993 in general.Everything was believable about this film. The acting was very convincing and the whole movie within a movie theme really works well for this film. The plot alone is what makes the film stand all by itself in an elite field of movies that contain a lot of shoot 'em ups and blow 'em ups. I still wonder why this film flopped. Maybe it wasn't the right summer to release it or people just didn't get it. Though it is far from being another ""Terminator 2""(which is probably what people expected and wanted it to be) it is a good social commentary about the action movies that are made and the people that watch them.I will say one thing about the movie. However, the only bad thing about this movie is that it kind of lags behind during the second half of the movie and doesn't seem nearly as interesting as the first half. Other than that it's a well-thought out entertaining film. One day, if it hasn't already have, it will become a cult classic.",Last Action Hero
121,Jetset971,Failure to launch.,4,21 May 2010,"Whenever I think about this movie I believe it should be shown as an example in all movie classes of how you can all the right ingredients for a movie and it still falls flat. First lets examine the ingredients,1. Plot- very promising. Kid who loves an action hero of the silver screen gets magically transported into the movie.2. Actors-Who better than the ""governator"" to be the hero. A strong eclectic supporting staff also adds promise. 3. Action-First rate concepts and executed with real flare.So what when wrong? Well, my best analogy is very simple. Think of all these elements I have mentioned put into a blender. You turn it on and it keeps starting and stopping barely spinning at all. After a few minutes, instead of a well blended, frothy shake, you have a congealed, slapped together mess that is very hard to swallow and just leaves a bad taste. I really was excited about seeing this film and I did something I rarely do when I see a movie that is starting to bomb. Instead of getting mad at the film, this time I was rooting for it to regain its footing. I keep thinking to myself, ""Come on, this can work, don't blow it!"", but by the middle point of the movie it was unsalvagable. I'll give the director and actors credit, you could almost feel them trying to get control over this mess but alas, no cigar. Even the action scenes started to get more and more uninteresting as this movie sputtered along. Like the scene where Slater goes to the funeral and tries to steal the corpse and run of with it and everybody pulls out a gun and shoots at him. It felt so lackluster and forced and that is what became of the movie as it when on, more lackluster more forced upon. What might have salvaged this movie is a simple thing, focus! I mean there is just too much mediocrity being focused on in this film and not enough wonder I don't know but, I think I would have had the entire movie take place in one world. Either The movie world or the real world. Here they go to both and that to me is the biggest flaw. Its all lighthearted farce in the movie world but in the real world they play it seriously. One or the other, but put together its a square peg trying to fit into a round hole. On the other hand, maybe they did the best they could with what they had.

In short, I was COMPLETELY unprepared for what this movie served up.This is not a serious action film. It is definitely an action picture, but not one that is meant to be taken seriously. This is an action film that spends about 3/4 of its time laughing at everything it has: the explosions, the car chases, the silly lines, the unbelievably clichéd characters, ANYTHING that makes an Arnold movie an Arnold movie. While it does take a little while to get off the ground, the first bit spent establishing just how boring and scary the real world is, the movie sucks us in (literally) and takes us on a joyride through the explosion-happy world of Jack Slater, the most stereotypical of loose cannon cops right down to consistently being yelled at by his boss for saving the day.This movie is 100% self-aware of how over-the-top it is. It flat out refuses to take itself seriously, even providing us with a slightly annoying but ultimately laughable comedy sidekick to point out the inside jokes when we're too busy recovering from shell-shock to notice them. Why did it tank at the box office? Well, I guess because it set itself up as a metaphysical action movie rather than a satire/parody of action movies in general (even Hamlet, which is labeled ""The First Action Hero"" by this movie). Yes, it's Arnold. Yes, it's an incredibly surreal picture. But that's all part of the fun. And if you choose to take it seriously, you're gonna have a bad time.",Last Action Hero

Possibly it's not the best Arnold's movie but definitely the most underrated one. It's a two hours of great entertainment with bright satire and many incredible funny lines and dialogs. Last Action Hero is a bright and charming Arnie's parody to himself. It provides a very unusual and funny look to his typical characters as well as to numerous silly action movies that filled theaters around the world. Also it is very nice to see moral messages and such warm story in Arnie's movie (that's a very rare thing for his works). The direction is very good and the strong chemistry between young Austin O'Brien (best his role in my opinion) and Arnie is one of the best parts of the story. I recommend Last Action Hero to all viewers. This movie is much better than a usual modern silly action movie. My grade 7.7,Last Action Hero

When I first saw this one I was BRAIN DEAD!Last Action Hero (Spoilers******) Directed by extreme action director of DIE HARD movies John McTiernan, this was his second venture with Arnold after the acclaimed film Predator.It is a story of a young boy (like me) who is a Die Hard fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) often misses his class by thinking of his greatest action Hero ""Jack Slater"", a famous character played by film star Arnold. He never misses a single chapter of Jack Slater franchise from theaters which makes him a great friend to its film operator. One day he gave a special ticket to him for the screening of Jack Slater IV. The ticket has some black magical spirits that makes Danny to enter to the fictional world of silver screen. There he meets his hero Jack Slater, the rough and tough cop who find Danny a disturbance.Danny tells about his world but Jack didn't believe him. But things went wrong when the villain of the 'Jack Slater' movie finds the truth about Danny. He enters the real world and set up a plan so that in the movie world he can live in peace. The plan was to kill the actor who plays Jack Slater and that was Arnold Schwarzenegger.What will Jack Slater do to save himself. Can he save Arnold, the story of the movie in a movie starts to get twisting from that point.Scripted by Shane Black and David Arnott for the story of Zak Penn and Adam Leff tells the mind-blending story of a fictional character entering the real world, where he finds he has no power that he acquired in the film world. A nice plot which could have been done better, but the screenplay and directions failed.The problem seemed like the writers wanted it be a movie like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", so they added various characters, plots, events to make it like a complicated world. If director Robert Zemeckis did this movie it would have been set in a strong storyline. But vision less John McTiernan treated it as a stupid action venture even tough it is an action film.As always in all Schwarzenegger films Arnold is the strength. WOW, he rocked in that outfits. I don't know any other movies he portrays so deeply, doing all his actions, all the running, all the free-falls. WOW, also the camera works were so excellent, especially in the flash back scenes, slow motions, climax, and that stylish Hamlet's version. As always composer Michael Kamen did a nice work in creating the soul of the Last Action Hero.All in all it's a great movie, I was blown away when I first saw it. Huh, a great, great movie for the Great Arnold Fans like ME! I give this movie 8 out of 10.Last Action Hero = Lasting Arnold FANS.",Last Action Hero

I loved it then and do now. its one of those rare action movies thats well written, funny, and still blows ya mind with colossal action. Arnie plays the character he normally just portrays in the movies, in this movie. He cavorts in a fantasy land where -top shelf Hollywood quick to die in amazing fashion- bad guys are rolled out minute by minute. There's something under the surface here though, some feeling, some emotion in the big man. He has a few reflective moments in the movie which are great, i didn't cry or anything but the part where Aaanold and Danny are looking for Benidict is solid. Arnold's reaction to punching out windows in the real world and falling off cab's is equally entertaining. The pacing, camerwork, shot sequencing are all top notch, and the soundtrack is flippin amazing! I would recommend watching this, as i would everything, in widescreen to really savor the shots.

As such I will now tell you my impression of LAH.It was mediocre crap. McTiernnan, who has done my favorite action movie of all time Die Hard, did not take any risks with this movie. It was formulaic. The script was original. I will give Prather and Penn credit for that. Their script originated a genre that Scream made famous, self Parodying. But there is a reason that Scream made it famous and LAH didn't, and that is Scream was good.I mostly place the blame for this movie's overwhelming mediocracy on O'Brien and Schwarzenagger. O'brien you can forgive for being 11-12 at the time. and Arnold just cannot do comedy. I mean look at his track record: Junior. Twins. Jingle all the way for god's sake.This movie had a new idea that died in the execution.

If you were expecting a serious action movie, well DUHHHH!! No wonder you hated it!  I happen to think that it is real clever that Arnold was willing to spoof the genre that he had been trapped in for most of his life.  So few actors are willing to do that, even in a bit of fun.  Acting is a job, but it's supposed to be fun as well.  Not every movie we see is meant to win an oscar. They are just entertainment.  Take it for what it's intended.This movie is on my top five of my favorite Arnold films, because of it's boldness, and the fact that Arnold can be really funny when he wants to be.

I am not one of those reviews. I say ""Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain."" This was a ""cash-for-clunkers"" film.The conceptual story of kid fantasy and action film parody with a magic ticket that transports the kid to fantasy worlds with Two-D fantasy characters is original and probably reads nice. When you see it on screen it is awful.There are 2 primary reasons that the film comes off as awful: The first is the main child protagonist. He is a whiny 13 year old loser boy who is from a poor family and he is soooooooooo hurt and he needs his nose wiped. You will watch this whiny boy for 2 hours and 10 minutes. Does that sound like entertainment to you? I didn't think so.The second reason is the fantasy world. Anyone can do anything and it is a world that makes no sense. After an hour of anything goes with little realism and an embarrassing attempt at Buster Keaton like humor with a funeral with a dead body with a bomb in it on the top of a skyscraper the viewer is left going ""Yawn.""

Not many stars of Arnold's magnitude will produce a self-parody at the height of their careers.  (Unlike some - Stallone? - who inadvertently self-parody at the peak of their careers.)  Viewers will most likely NOT rent this again and again, but it was DEFINITELY better than ""The Avengers"" and ""Batman and Robin.""In sum, you've got to like an Arnold action flick that introduces the mass film audience to Bergman.

137,DaRick89,One of the most underrated movies I've ever seen - an ingenious satire of action movie clichés,8,11 January 2006,"Last Action Hero has to be the most underrated movies I've ever seen. I've seen it at least four times, but I still like it. Stuff the critics and enjoy it for what it is: a spoof of action movies and their clichés. It's something that probably hasn't been done before and hasn't been done since (because this was undeservedly bashed, I'd say). I would say that it was poorly received because audiences expected a mindless Rambo or Terminator-style film, rather than a satire.The plot concerns this kid Daniel Madigan. He leads a pretty poor life and the only good thing that happens in it is that he gets to go to the movies to watch his favourite movie(s), Jack Slater with Arnold Schwarzenegger. He finds a golden ticket and travels into one such movie: Jack Slater IV. Madigan marvels at his good fortune and observes the many action movie clichés: a police officer getting blown up two days from retirement, Jack Slater evading every blast and machine-gun burst that comes his way, the bad guys never winning, the attractive daughter and not one unattractive woman to be seen. He also witness a whole array of unrealistic characters, including an animated cat and Robert Patrick (AKA Liquid Terminator from Terminator 2), as well as the stereotypical screaming boss. Let's not forget the big explosions and loud noises that always take center-stage in action movies. The sidekick also always get into trouble (i.e when Madigan plays chicken with a car). This is truly brilliant stuff.If Last Action Hero has a flaw, it's that Daniel Madigan himself is excessively annoying and this doesn't bode well, as he is a major character.However, that only has a slight effect on the rest of the film. I've said it before, I'll say it again: This is an ingenious satire, a spoof of action movies and their clichés. Not only that, but it is entertaining in a mindless way as well. It is not perfect, but it is about ten times better than the critics say it is.Ignore them and see this film.4/5 starsEDIT (1/4/2013): This movie is slightly more flawed than I remembered.

Also the scene where Schwarzenegger is talking to the press about his new Jack Slater movie is funny, he comes with the usual comments that you hear before each premiere over and over again.The acting is like you can expect in an action/comedy-movie.

I guess I couldn't deal with the curtain of an action film was lifted. ""Last Action Hero"" definitly pushes the envelope of our understanding of how a film works and walks the boundaries between actors and audience.Being produced by Arnold Schwarzenegger himself and directed by John McTiernan the whole spectacle is both a satire and a self-indulging contradiction. What were they thinking making an action movie with a huge action star (at that time) and then totally dragging the action genre through sarcasm? Well it was pretty ballsy and it is even a more daring move from today's perspective.In the 90's there were only a handful of real action stars and they were every cliche you wanted to see. So it is an act of self destruction to lift the veil of immortality. The minds behind this film could have made their statement without much depth, but in fact, they worked with great care. The plot is pretty smart and even the action star in the film in the movie (Jack Slater) realises his flaws. The insider gags with Sylvester Stallone and the nods to other films (be it of Arnie or other) are placed sublte and perfectly. The rock music carries the accompanying soundtrack and the action scenes do what they must. Big explosions, big guns. Even the ironic interviews from ""real"" Arnold Schwarzenegger in the movie make you giggle. The best thing about the whole show is that kids back then loved these kind of action movies so it is no surprise that Danny adores cinema flicks and Austin O'Brien delivers that feeling with authentic behavior.""Last Action Hero"" was a huge box office success grossing $137,298,489 worldwide with an estimated budget of $85,000,000.",Last Action Hero

I guess I can give you a jest of the plot to entice you. A kid named Danny, gets sucked into a movie thanks to a magic ticket, and he meets his favorite movie hero named Jack Slater played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. To divulge anymore would spoil the fun and that would be wrong. But I will say this, it has a great villain played by my favorite character actor Charles Dance.

While a tad heavy-handed, the constant riffing on typical macho action flicks is spot-on, always amusing, and yet at the same time the film delivers saw awe-inspiring, sometimes deliberately implausible action set-pieces. Arnie sends himself up fine, while Austin O'Brien often says out loud what most often think watching these kinds of films. Charles Dance makes a menacing villain, and provides some dark amusement of his own - I JUST SHOT SOMEBODY, I DID IT ON PURPOSE.Where the film begins to falter is when the fictional characters, plus Danny, enter the real world. Until this point, it had been going along at a roaring clip, constantly amusing. Perhaps it was necessary to show a dose of reality to those brought up on mindless action flicks, but it starts becoming a little more serious and darker in tone, more sentimental, and consequently less fun. That doesn't make it bad though, and it does provide some food for thought, with Arnie-in-character ranting about how he's fed up of shooting people in films, and blowing things up.Not a masterpiece perhaps, but deserves to be ranked high on Arnie's filmography.",Last Action Hero

Well, it might be all of them, and more.This movie could be interpreted in several ways. In it, Arnold is spoofing himself (or his on-screen persona, anyway) and the genre of action movies in general. What's more, it's a story within a story, making an audience member part of the story, giving the whole thing a post-modern twist. The movie is full of genre in-jokes and self-references, making fun of many of the clichés - while at the same time referring to other films, actors, and even other genres, making this sort of a celebration of the entire film business.
On the other hand - in case you don't care about all of this - as an action movie in itself, it's still very entertaining.

Indeed the number of plot holes in this movie could put Iceland on the bottom of the Atlantic, but if you take it for what it is, a silly, over- the-top action movie, then you're guaranteed entertainment!So what's the Calamari? Danny Madigan is a lonely boy with a big imagination but a busy mother, and spends a majority of his time watching the new series of action movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger called Jack Slater. However, his friend, the owner of the cinema, gives him a magic ticket which transports him into the movie, and thus he has to try and convince Jack that all this is a movie whilst also trying to dodge death from violent gangsters.The bad bits? There are a million tons of plot holes and story problems in this movie, be they through continuity errors, incidents in the movie that either don't go anywhere or are never addressed, which can be quite confusing, and at points it can drag as there are quite a few talking scenes.But other than that, if you're someone who enjoys action movies with a bit of emotion thrown in, then this is really the movie for you. I wont give away what the emotional scenes are, but let's just say that they are handled quite well. The acting in this movie is largely done to satirise the action movie genre, including the sarcastic main hero, the cool, calm (and quintessentially British) main villain, a selection of comedic sidekicks and quite a few rather obscure cameos. In fact if you want yourself a drinking game, count how many celebrities or characters from other movies show up in this film, you'll be under the table in no time!Apart from the various problems, this movie is still great fun!

The film plays ironically with typical action-film-clichés when during the climax the fictional character Jack Slater is forced to tress-pass from screen to real world and gets upset finding out that some reliable action-movie-rules don't work there ... here anymore. The confrontation with his alter-ego Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of the key-sequences of the film and even offers some interesting philosophical questions about the relations between actors and their roles. Finally Jack and Danny face the biggest Boogeyman"" in the history of cinema ever, who also managed to escape from his flick into the real world. That encounter is another respectful salute to the great old European cinema and grants this hopelessly underrated movie another friendly shoulder-clap from the classics. Aside, passionate movie-goers find a lot of cameos and references to other films, for example when Danny tries to warn Slater not to trust his buddy, performed by F. Murray Abraham ""because he killed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart!"" In fact Abraham played the rivaling composer Salieri in Amadeus"", but since the sequence here plays in a fictional action-world beyond the screen, Slater neither knows classic music nor Amadeus"" and of course this ain't one Salieri or Abraham but his partner John Practice. Later confronted by Slater with the insult of killing Mozart, John Practice just answers: Moe... who? Jack, I've killed that many people..."" THIS is smart entertainment! Even the great Anthony Quinn obviously recognized the qualities of the script and joined up to portray a Mafia-boss who you'd rather like to give a hug than a bullet.Last Action Hero"" is definitely and by far the best Arnold-comedy he ever made! He deconstruct his own image and the most action-movie-standard-situations in it. Nevertheless it is solid entertainment, action and fun. Other comedy-attempts like True Lies"", Kindergarten Cop"" or Junior"" were just stupid. This one is not.",Last Action Hero

It offers a clever commentary on the tropes in action films and the humor, while being juvenile and over-the-top wacky at times, is actually quite clever and meta. It also takes a while to warm up and I'd argue that the best part of the movie doesn't come until later, when the action hero finds himself in the real world. This movie is like Who Framed Roger Rabbit in that it's not sure if its target audience is kids or adults, but I think it's silliness mixed with the blood and the adult jokes is what makes it charming. And its ending was surprisingly heart-warming.Last Action Hero is not Arnold's best movie, but it's worth a watch.",Last Action Hero
151,iamsam103,An incredibly underrated film,8,8 December 2005,"Last Action Hero has a young boy get magically transported into an action film starring non other than big-old Arnie. Although it sounds like a kids film, IT'S NOT.This film is incredibly underrated, and for the life of me I can't see why! It's all here, action, Arnie, beautiful women, comedy, tons of inn-jokes that poke fun at the clichéd action films (especially those of Arnie and Stallone's caller). This is done with the really cheesy punchlines, over exaggerated action (which is spot on superb...eg, a villain throwing a stick of dynamite at Arnie, who shoots it, knocking it back at the guy) Plenty of in-jokes include cameos by Sharone Stone and Robert Patrick, reprising their roles from T2 and Basic Instinct. Ian Mckellen plays an interesting role as Death, and Charles Dance is excellent as what is possibly the best villain ever created.The story is spot on superb, mixing effortlessly classy action, with comic dialogue, inn-jokes and emotional binding factors.However as interesting as a boy taddling along with his action hero may be, it gets better once the villain escapes to the real world, in which Arnie and the boy follow. Things turn around now, as the boy is now in his element as opposed to Arnie (eg, Arnie punches in a window of a car, then complains of it hurting...he also did the same in the movie world as if it was paper) All in all, this is a fantastic film, and possible Arnie's best. Perfect blend of action, comedy, witt and depth...whom I'm sure movie-buffs to appreciate more than the casual viewer.",Last Action Hero
152,centropolis,Why did I like this movie?,10,17 December 2000,"I am 15 years old, and a cynical movie-goer. I hate most big-budget  crisis films. This one, there is just something about it. It is funny because it makes fun of all the movies, and has a terrific cast(F. Murray Abraham, Robert Prosky). Columbia Pictures was litterally asking for a stinker when they had Shane Black(Lethal Weapon, Last Boy Scout, Long Kiss Goodnight) write the script and not bother with shelling out a couple more thou, which wouldn't have hurt(the film cost $75, which for the time was quite a bit) by having Richard Price(Shaft, Clockers) rewrite the script. But Columbia thought all that matters to audiences is big noisy explosions. Well, I liked this movie, because I want to be a producer-director, and I love all the jokes about the celluloid industry, ""Say this word"" ""No"" ""Because you can't! This movie's only PG-13"" or (talking about F. Murray Abraham) ""Jack, he was the bad guy in Amadeus, it won 8 Oscars!"" or how about ""Where are all the normal girls? They all look like Guess adds!"" This movie also has some awesome action sequences. Too bad everyone hated it, I enjoyed it. Look for the part when Jack and Danny go in the video store, and all of John McTiernan's movies are in the background(Hunt for The Red October, Medicine Man, Preditor) or when the kid says ""Like in Die Hard(A McTiernan film) when the bad guys hanging off the roof, he's not dead yet!!!"" This movie is funny, and has a really cool design by Eugenio Zanetti. See it if you love movies, action, or loud-amusing popcorn fun. If you are looking for romance, drama, or a beautiful filmwork, search elsewere. Although, cinematographer Dean Semler(The Bone Collector) does know his way around a camera.",Last Action Hero
153,jrgirones,Nice effort!,6,31 December 2002,"The concept here is brilliant, as it was in Buster Keaton's ""Sherlock Jr."" or Woody Allen's ""The purple Rose..."". Collision between fiction and reality is given an ironical and witty treatment, and that makes ""Last action hero"" one of the most interesting commercial action films of the late years. 
Then, why everybody says it is flawed? Aside from the ambivalence of having born with a smash hit vocation and wanting to be something more, which makes the original premise to lose weight along the way, I would say the principal flaws have its roots in a bad structured screenplay: the plot of the movie within the movie (a vane, not original at all mob story) is given too much importance, and when we come to the real point (the confrontation between fiction and reality) we are almost at the end and then a lot of a good story beats happen quickly and disordered,  creating a little bit of a mess.Anyway, let me insist this is, at least, very curious and fun, and movie lovers will appreciate it above all its flaws.",Last Action Hero
154,fineanimal,Much Better The Second Time Around,8,19 February 2005,"The only thing I could recall about seeing Last Action Hero in the theater was that it had a fantastic hard-rock soundtrack, and the movie itself was a disappointment. But after giving it another chance on DVD years later, I was surprised by how good of a film it really is. I think that is because I was young when it was originally released, so I didn't ""get"" the satire, and was only looking for action.As it turns out, there is great action *and* satire in this film. In fact, after the second viewing I'd say the film's weakness is that it didn't include even more obscure references to Arnold's previous films, and make even more fun of the way Hollywood insults viewers' intelligence. But then again, Last Action Hero was released before Mystery Science Theater 3000 had trained me to expect riffs and puns flying faster than speeding bullets.Still, I wasn't quite prepared to laugh as hard as I did during this film, especially when blindsided by our hero's ""two questions"" for the villain. I won't ruin it by quoting here, because that just might be the funniest line Arnold has ever read on screen.The soundtrack still has the best and most appropriate songs of any film I've seen, although this is not as evident in the film as in the soundtrack CD. And it was great to finally see a teenage boy character in an action film who didn't annoy the hell out of me with constant screaming and whining. Austin O'Brien did a fabulous job as the hero's unlikely sidekick.The only thing that really bothered me occurred late in the film, which was supposed to take place in the ""real"" world. After spending so much time emphasizing that there is no deus ex machina in the real world, the hero-villain conflict is resolved in just such a manner. I would rather have seen a battle of wits, or at least brute strength, to carry our hero to victory.One last thing: I watched the full-screen version DVD, and a lot more than usual seemed to be trimmed from the periphery. If a widescreen version exists, I'd highly recommend that instead.",Last Action Hero
155,choatelodge,Too intellegent for it's target audience,9,26 December 2002,"After a string of predictable cookie cutter script action flicks that made money from Arnie's muscles and persona, one studio decided to take a chance and try a Hollywood self-mocking film starring the big guy. It had a story line that actually made one think and pay attention in order to appreciate the paradoxes arising from its premise.( A fun side effect is that its movie within a movie allowed for some more over-the-top stunts and tough guy scenes than even the simplest knuckle dragging mouth breathing 'action' film fans would normally sit for) Scenes with recognized characters drawn from recent popular films were played tongue in cheek and while the story proceeded on a couple of levels there were enough innuendos and amusing elements in the background to keep the viewer's appreciative attention. The result of this comparatively well polished gamble was the sort of reception reflected by the vote results in this IMDB poll.  A surprizing number of viewers don't like it.Maybe the studios waited too long to try a movie like this with Arnold. It is possible that the market segment that would appreciate a film like this had already dismissed Arnie as the Commando/Raw Deal lout and dismissed the film unseen, while the usual shoot'em punch'em fans found their brains hurting too much from trying to follow a real story.One thing is sure, the studios are watching and you can bet they won't make that mistake again.  Get ready for more movies that play to the lowest common denominator and are written so the dullest gonk in the movie house can still comprehend the plot.

The plot was very interesting and creative and Arnold Scharzenegger, despite other opinions, does a good job of acting.  The whole plot of Jack Slater (Arnold) taking on the villains, having to come out of the movie to catch them, and being assisted by a fan of the Jack Slater films is well thought out and entertaining.  This enough, should have been in line for a great film and it would have been if one key factor would have been left out.  The main character, Danny, is so incredibly annoying that one gets worn out of his constant blabbering to convince Jack Slater that he's not real, everything around him is a movie, and that in real life, he's Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Seriously though, if ANYONE, especially a kid that's a fan of the film, was able to go into their favorite movie of all time, they would be living it up and enjoying it!! But in this film, they had him irritated the whole time because no one would believe him that none of it was real and that it was just some movie.  The line ""because this is a movie!"" just got a little old after the umf hundredth time. If Danny's dialogue had been altered to express the idea that he was just having fun and helped Jack Slater nail the bad guys, and help him out when they enter the real world, it would have been a fun and enjoyable film.  But the annoyance level of the main character was a little too much to take. I wish the kid's dialogue would have been done right so that I could have been allowed to enjoy what could have been a good movie.  It's a real shame.",Last Action Hero

164,thedoctor98,Intelligent Action,8,20 June 2000,"A possible reason why this movie hasn't been received well by some people is probably the exact reason why The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996) had trouble. It's two genres merging.  Action movies are tending to be more and more no-brainer affairs ... people sit and vegetate while watching characters blown apart onscreen.  And then there are the ""dramas"".  Movies intended to make people think, and sit on the edge of their seat wondering what plot-twist will occur next, while the writers work to surprise the viewers with every turn.  Nobody expected an intelligent action movie ... but that's what happened with both TLKG and The Last Action Hero.Firstly, the writing is first-class.  Shane Black (creator of the Lethal Weapon Characters, and writer of TLKG) et al create a  rare situation of a movie-within-a-movie, managing to create what would have been a good action movie AND poke intelligent fun at it at the same time.  It's even very witty!The casting is great, too.  Arnold Schwarzenegger actually comes across as witty, which has to be a reason to watch for.  And if you don't like that, there are the classy performances of F. Murray Abraham, Charles Dance, and a very good performance by young Austin O'Brien.  There are assorted star cameos and movie references!  There's even Danny Devito as the voice of a cartoon cat!

It's a fun parody that the now-Governator had of himself.Everyone wants Mr. S. to be Conan, a Commando, a Terminator, a spy ... etc. They want(ed) the one-liners. They want predictability, and to tell the truth. I never was a big fan of Arnold's movies. They were okay, but you knew anyone that big is virtually indestructible in real life too. Maybe Arnold got tired of playing a recycled character, so he said screw it. Not to his fans, but to himself. And for the first time, I was laughing with him.This movie throws the kitchen sink at everything it touches: crazy cop combinations, the actor vs. the character, the car chases, the hair never out place in a fight, the flesh wounds the size of Arnold's hands, plus it has Ian McKellen as Bergman's version of Death, the late Anthony Quinn as a crazy gangster, and a heck of a lot of movie tie-ins that relate to Arnold and other films.In short, it's Arnold's 8 1/2 ... millimeter (couldn't resist) When you view the movie for yourself, just do it for crazy, wild fun.

167,serghei_romanu,A surprisingly good sf/action/comedy flick,7,15 January 2010,"Not your usual action/sf/comedy experience, Last action hero, is one of those films which at the end leaves you satisfied. Last action hero presents the story of a young boy named Danny Madigan, a huge fan of Jack Slater, series. One day he receives a magic ticket, from Frank - who supposedly got the ticket from Houdini himself - , the local theater manager, also an admirer the series. While watching Jack Slater 5 (not for the first time) , he is literally sucked into the film. From now, on we have an interesting adventure going, because Danny knows what's gonna happened next, after all he saw Jack Slater 5 numerous times, and he has decided to share his valuable information which Jack (Arnold Shwarzenegger), now his much experienced partner, in order to uncover the plans of the bad side. However things get out of control as Benedinct the antagonist character get a hold on the magic ticket, and manages to bring fictionally devious characters (death, the reaper, Dracula etc), in the real life creating chaos.Tough may present some unnecessary misplaced developments, the story is not at all a bad one. It was intelligent, creative and funny and it can be righteously described as entertaining. There were several great moments sustained with some excellent dialog lines, as well as some very particular and unusual characters, such as Benedict, the hit-man with the glass eye. Those are important pluses, those kind of pluses which keep the viewer's attention throughout the film, as it kept mine. The acting wasn't very good, but not very bad either. The actors succeeded in combining action/suspense moments with hilarious moments, so I can say they got the job done. Arnold fit great in his roll, how couldn't he, since he always, with minor exceptions, plays the hero. Last action hero was as far as I'm concerned a medium-good movie.

Because it's the one that completely mocks himself, the situations he always finds himself in AND the way he talks!! It couldn't have been made better. As he always does, McTiernan takes us on a roller-coaster ride through the life of Jack Slater and Danny Madigan, trapped inside his favourite action movie.There are twists and turns, the action is over the top and Arnie even acts convincingly. I always find that McTiernan films have a special element - you think it's getting close to the end, but then the story takes a completely different turn and you're in for another 40 minutes of entertainment, which I love.Talking about this movie is pointless, you just have to see it. It's a parody like no other, it's amazing! There are some great quotes in this film too.I remember a couple of years ago someone said to me, ""There's something rotten in the state of Denmark..."" and I replied - uhh, have you seen Last Action Hero? He said no, and I explained he'd just accurately quoted a line in the movie.McTiernan also takes the mick out of his own film, Die Hard. You should listen to the music too, which plays the ""Die Hard"" melody. This kind of intertextuality sends shivers down my spine, and it's doing it now and I'm only thinking about it!! Also, the part where he pulls the driver out of a taxi and yells ""Billy bunting baby bubba bobba...HA! You did NOT know I was going to say that!!"" or something, is insanely funny.

There are some brilliant cameos made by celebrity names, including Jean-Claude Van Damn, and even Arnold's wife, Maria Shriver.

Where this movie really shines is in its self awareness, satirizing the action movie genre (and Arnie himself) that was so popular during the 80's and 90's, using all of its cliches to its advantage. One of the film's chief writers is Shane Black, the man responsible for almost single-handedly inventing the Lethal Weapon universe (and there are several nods to the franchise throughout the film). Anyone who is familiar with his portfolio (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Nice Guys, Last Boy Scout) knows that the man has a way with words that is authentically funny and smart.

183,Halfwaytoheaven,Ahead of its time or behind it?,8,11 April 2004,"One criticism of this movie that I have heard is that it came out too long after the heyday of the action movie in the '80's.  Yet, I believe that audiences simply weren't ready for an action movie to be this intelligent. Action movies aren't supposed to point out their own tropes and then ridicule them.  Things are just supposed to blow up.  When Arnie shoots the cab in the real world, and says that the taxis must be bulletproof - genius. Jack Slater makes a wonderful development from Arnold's most cliched and shallow character to being one of his most convincing once he leaves the ""movie world.""  And the actor who played Danny did an admirable job, for a child actor.  This film secured John McTiernan's place as the greatest action director ever - or at least until he made Rollerball and blew it all to hell.Last Action Hero is perhaps Arnie's second best movie, after Predator. I was going to give it an 8, but then I remembered the scene where Arnold plays Hamlet.  ""Something is rotten in the state of Denmark - and Prince Hamlet is takin' out the trash!""

After seeing the IMDB rating, I didn't expect much but what I got was a lot more!If you accept the ""magic"" premise and realize that this is a fantasy film, there is something for everyone.  Of course, there's the explosions, gun shooting, and fist throwing, but there's also comedy (not unexpected in an Arnold flick), sensitivity, horror, and suspense!  I actually believe this film offered Arnold his biggest acting opportunity (I haven't seen ""End of Days"" or ""The Sixth Day"" yet, though).  Charles Dance was perfect as the sinister bad guy.  The plot was interesting and not necessarily predictable. My wife even asked if there was a sequel, and she didn't even want to watch this film initially!  I really am disappointed that this film didn't do better at the box office.  I think it was tastefully done - there was little to no gore or foul language or bare skin - thus the PG-13 rating.  While it may have been aimed at a younger audience, as an Arnold fan I thoroughly enjoyed the film.This is not to say it was without flaw.  I don't think Charles Dance should have talked to the camera in the one scene - it didn't fit with the rest of the film.  And I don't think kids need any more encouragement to watch movies or skip school!  And these days, old Nick could turn out to be a pervert!!These things aside, I liked the movie.",Last Action Hero
188,emran222,Criminally underrated action movie parody that deserves more respect,9,6 January 2010,"When i was about 8 years old, I remember renting ""Last Action Hero"" and enjoying it a lot, and i recently saw it again and enjoyed it even more as i began to notice a lot of great stuff in the movie that i hadn't noticed when i was a kid, as a film buff i decided to look up the history of the film and i found out That ""Last Action Hero"" was a box office flop when it was released in 1993, this shocked me and what shocked me more was when i looked up all the reviews i could find for it, most of them were very negative, I think at that time the public missed the point of the film, the film is a parody of action movies not a serious action thriller and i guess during that time of arnold schwarzenegger's career it was probably the wrong time for Last Action Hero to come out,as before Last Action Hero schwarzenegger had made ""Total Recall"" and ""Terminator 2"" both of which are great movies but were also very serious and i think people were expecting that from Last Action Hero, but instead they got a parody and they just didn't understand it.But i think it's time Last Action Hero get's the respect it deserves because it's actually a very good movie. Plot: The plot to last action hero is probably the most clever I have ever heard, It's about a young boy named Danny who is going to see a private screening of ""Jack Slater 4"" (A fictional Action series starring Arnold Schwarzenegger),But before entering the movie theatre, Danny's friend projectionist Nick, gives Danny a magic movie ticket which was given to him by the great magician houdini, nick then tears the ticket and gives danny his stub , Danny then walks into the theatre to watch the movie and while he's sitting there enjoying the show the ticket mysteriously activates itself and transports danny into the movie where danny meets Jack Slater(Schwarzenegger) And from then on it's action and laughs all the way, as well as some science fiction because there's Inter-dimensional travel involving the Villain of ""Jack Slater 4"" Played brilliantly by (Charles Dance),getting a hold of danny's magic ticket and planning on creating havoc on the real world and also the movie world, by getting every single movie villain imaginable to take over those two worlds.Overall: ""Last Action Hero"" Is not as bad as people say it is, It was just misunderstood, the film is without a doubt a Spoof on action films, but it works, there are many Jokes and Cheesy one-liners cracked by Arnold Schwarzenegger which are often hilarious, and even the villain has great lines and jokes, but let's not forget about the action, after all the film is called ""Last ACTION Hero"" there are many great action scenes the best being the beginning of ""Jack Slater 4"" where an awesome car chase takes place with AC/DC's Big Gun playing in the background, but there's also an incredible and funny scene where Arnold is up against a gang of mobsters on a building rooftop and his escape from them leads him to being on the hook of a crane where he falls into a tar pit, Now keep in mind the action in ""Last Action Hero"" is more Traditional rather than slam-bang, it does have gun's and explosions and the Occasional Crazy stunts, but do not go in thinking that your'e going to see Stuff like ""Transformers"" or ""Avatar"" The only problem I have with Last Action Hero is that it's a tad too long running at 130 mins and people who don't like their movies long may not like this, i have no problems with long movies but other's may, so i guess that's my only gripe.But for those of you who are fans of movie parody's, you will probably enjoy Last Action Hero a lot, there's good acting (Surprisingly from Schwarzenegger who shows that he has no fear of mocking himself) there's Action,Comedy,Sci-Fi and plenty of trivial moment's as well as many actor cameos.

189,hadar-20,A great movie about movies,8,31 August 2002,"This 1993 action fantasy was, in my opinion, unjustly lambasted by critics. Arnold Schwarzenneger Plays Jack Slater, a cop which epitomizes every cliched action hero you can think off, and parodies himself as an actor, and later on, as a celebrity. This movie pokes fun at the action movies Hollywood makes (Or used to make especially in the eighties), it is filled with great in-jokes which should be appreciated by film lovers, especially those who love American, Hollywood movies. Schwarzenneger parodies himself brilliantly, he has great support from top notch actors like Charles Dance and F. Murray Abraham. The whole thing is directed with great style by action extraordinare John Mctirnan. The co-writer of the script is no other than Mr. Shane Black, creator of the original Lethal Weapon, which is also spoofed here heavilly. It's a great romp, filled with imagination, inventivness and yes, great action. An intelligent, humorous work by everyone involved. Sure, it has plot holes and a sappy ending, but it never takes itself too seriously. And the most important thing of all, it makes us remember why we love movies.",Last Action Hero
190,BlinkFlame,More Comedy than Action,5,22 January 2002,"If you view this film as an action film, you'll be very disappointed. The overall intent of the picture is to more or less spoof action films-therefore you get very cheesy dialogue, cliche scenes, and a lot of dramatic irony.Even if you view the film as a comedy, you're still likely to be disappointed. It is by far not hilarious, and I've seen Arnold in funnier roles. But, as a stand alone spoof, it is definitely worth a look, especially late at night with some friends who aren't looking to get anything serious out of the film.That said, The Last Action Hero is not a bad film. There are several scenes that are pretty funny, including an early parody of Hamlet with Arnold portraying the title character. Also, the running gag of Arnold not knowing that in Danny's world he is a huge action star remains funny throughout the film. References to this, such as the famous video store scene filled with cameos, do evoke a few chuckles.In conclusion, The Last Action Hero is not to be taken very seriously. It's not an action film, and it more or less tries to be a spoof. Although it's not the greatest movie ever made, it is the kind of movie that you can just gather around with a group of friends and get some meaningless enjoyment - which, in my experience, is one of the best ways to watch movies.",Last Action Hero

Maybe in the 90s that was acceptable but I'm reviewing the movie from a current perspective.",Last Action Hero
192,Hedgehog_Carnival,Harmless fun,5,19 August 2005,"Until I saw this (as part of a captive audience on a bus travelling to Quito), I was probably one of the few people alive who had never seen a Schwarzenegger movie.I'm still not sure that I've seen one, and not only because the thing was dubbed into Spanish. But going by reputation alone, this film makes you feel you've just seen everything Arnold has ever done, conveniently compressed and amusingly exaggerated and self-parodied to boot. Which can't be bad.I don't watch low-grade action movies as a rule. Yet even I could at least smile at some of the obvious send-ups and references here, which extend beyond the specific genre of shoot-'em-up action to embrace such things as the cartoon laws of physics or the convention of the villain's ""before I kill you, here's what I plan to do"" speech which we all know from the Bond films. Not much of the parody is particularly intelligent or subtle (Leslie Nielsen does this kind of thing better), but it is disarmingly good-natured and unserious, and the timing is generally adequate - tired old gag follows mildly amusing in-joke fast enough to make the thing look lively, or even, for some viewers, ""stylish"" (sic), if not exactly fresh or daring. Plus there are enough two-wheeling, bridge-hopping, exploding cars for your money to make the thing justify its parodic remit.As far as I can tell, the film scores low with critics who wanted it to take itself a bit more seriously than it obviously does. It's true that the last third of the film seems to come unstuck at a worrying pace, and I agree with whoever it was who found it annoying that the ""real world"" that Slater strays into begins by frustrating his expectations, as it should, but then, unaccountably, adjusts to them to the point where it allows him to perform an unconscionably silly Heroic Rescue Of Child, complete with undercurrent of schmaltzy sentimentality - one aspect of Hollywood scriptcraft that this movie does not even attempt to take issue with. And yes, the intrusion of Bergman's Grim Reaper at the end is pure toe-curling embarrassment: it reads as ""look at me! I've watched a serious movie"" self-advertisement on the scriptwriters' part, with no other apparent raison-d'etre. That last chunk of plot is disappointing, and does definitely need a rethink.So - daring, iconoclastic this movie is certainly not, and no, it doesn't have what you would call a coherent plot, although it might have had, if the scriptwriters hadn't apparently hit the bottle head-on towards the end of what was presumably a six-crate overnight slog. But it's good, harmless fun, and has the odd inspired touch - like the Schwarzenegger version of Hamlet, which I defy any high school English Lit teacher to not find funny.What surprised me most is that the Governator comes across in this movie as quite a likable, humorous, self-deprecating guy.

They did a hilarious job of blatantly setting up just about every action film cliché they could come up with. I loved how Arnold was able to basically make fun of himself in this movie. Some of the Cameo appearances were incredible. My personal favorite is the scene when they enter the LAPD HQ. The biggest problem the movie had was that too many people were expecting a real action movie, not a parody of the genre. You could say Danny did one thing a lot of us dream of when he actually became part of the movie for real. BTW the AC/DC video for Big Guns is a gem too loaded with clips from the movie and ultimately seeing Arnold transformed into a super sized copy of Angus Young and even mimics him during the guitar solo.",Last Action Hero
198,vickievallencourt,"A little confused, but very fun and totally under-rated.",10,2 June 2004,"LAST ACTION HERO went down in the books as a notorious, hopeless bomb, putting it in the same company as films like HUDSON HAWK, BATTLEFIELD EARTH, and GIGLI.  And although it was a huge financial dissapointment back in 1993, this film stands head and shoulders above those other stinkers, and has certainly found an appreciative audience over time. Perhaps it wouldn't have earned such awful word-of-mouth had it not been advertised and released as a straightforward action film. No doubt 1993 audiences were expecting a TERMINATOR- or TRUE LIES-style adventure. Instead, LAST ACTION HERO is fairly misleading, and it shifts tones pretty dramatically, from a free-wheeling action adventure, to something much more dramatic, set in the ""real world"", and back and forth again. This can be quite jarring upon a first viewing, and certainly unappealing for anybody who doesn't enjoy Hollywood satire.  Eleven years later, the American public is a little more film-industry-savvy (its seems like every Mom and Pop follows the salary rumors and box office races these days), and may appreciate the insider jokes a little more. If you prepare yourself for a cheeky spoof- and DONT expect TOTAL RECALL!- you'll definitely find LAST ACTION HERO better than you remember.",Last Action Hero

One of Arnold's comedy movies on the other hand tends to be 'meh' for me. So when you mix the two poorly you get something like the ""Last Action Hero"". I understand that this movie is supposed to act as a spoof of the action genre as well as Arnold himself, but I just found the jokes to be so blatantly obvious and uncreative that the comedy fell flat for me. So how does the action fare?As a result of Arnold making the executive decision to make this movie PG-13 (which the movie not so subtly references) as to appeal to a broader audience, the action in turn takes a direct hit. Instantly you notice the violence has been toned down and since this movie is basically a children's comedy you have action that is overly-cartoonish.I think if this movie had some better writing and had maybe went for the R-rating even with a child co-star we may have gotten something good here. We've seen it work with T2 no reason to believe it couldn't have worked with the ""Last Action Hero"" because the premise is fun I'll give it that. Unfortunately, this movie is also bogged down by a bad child actor. So the only positive thing I can say is it keeps the tradition with Arnie movies of providing some classic one-liners.All in all it's a movie that has a fun premise inside it, but is plagued with bad writing and overall bad execution.",Last Action Hero

And this from one of the most outspoken action heroes in the 1980s and 1990s! Excellent!! Much like the warning William Shatner gave about not confusing Star Trek with reality. It is so positive that actors take this responsibility upon themselves, however unfortunate that it appears to be necessary!Likewise Arnold's comments to himself - the real life man, Arnold Schwarzenegger, actually appears to have a solid grasp on the hype about Holy Wood, err sorry ...

201,toastedslipers,The Parody To End All Parodies,8,27 March 2014,"During the better half of 1980's and 1990's, action movies were huge, and even that can be considered a vast understatement. Full of explosions, cheesy one liners, and over the top characterizations, this genre was just BEGGING for a parody. While ""Hot Shots! Part Deux"" did an admirable job, Last Action Hero is the absolute ""last word"" on the subject of ""action movie parodies"" as it takes an already takes an established ""beefcake"" action star like good ol' Arnie and thrusts him into the spotlight as the mega-hit cop hero, Jack Slater.The film centers around a delinquent kid named Danny who skips school constantly so he can watch movies (namely Jack Slater Films) in a rundown theater run by a kindly old man. The old timer offers to show Danny an advance screening of the latest Jack Slater film provided he attends school. And he does so after being mugged in his own home and having day dreams of Arnold (who also plays himself along with Jack Slater) starring in a much more action oriented version of the film adaptation of Hamlet during class. When Danny arrives at the cineplex, he's given a magical ticket by the old man who says that it was given to him by Harry Houdini. Later on, while Danny is enjoying the movie, the ticket sparkles and he's instantly thrust into the celluloid world of Jack Slater who's hot on the case of Tony Vivaldi. And Jesus, this film plays ""homage"" to so many action film tropes that it is quite honestly INSANE. Cops dying three days before retirement, the henchmen double crossing his incompetent boss. the hero getting his badge revoked during an important case, etc, etc, etc The tropes are openly mocked as well as celebrated and I feel is the biggest underlying theme of this movie: the celebration, not mockery, of action movies. And what's strange is how many people see Arnold's other film ""Commando"" (1985) as a parody movie (namely Doug Walker, alias ""The Nostalgia Critic"") and view ""Last Action Hero"" as some shlocky mess of a film that can only be laughed at ""ironically"".Bottom line: If you like Action Movies and a good bit of satire, get Last Action Hero",Last Action Hero
202,soldier9428,Very entertaining,7,28 December 2013,"This is essentially a movie that parodies action films. Last Action Hero does a much better job at it though than some parodies do at spoofing their genre. It was very entertaining and interesting to see all the action movie clichés, and their contrast to the real world. Although the supposed real world has some of those same clichés.(spoilers start here) For example the main villain (Benedict) is searching through movie theaters to find all the movie villains and basically take over the world. The second protagonist (Jack Slater) is trying to find him by wandering around the city looking for movie theaters for hours. The kid of course tells him that things just don't work that way in the real world because the real world stinks. Almost as soon as he says that though he conveniently spots Benedict exiting a movie theater (spoilers end here).Back to the main part of the movie though. Last Action Hero has a unique approach to the comedy of this film. Most of the comedy is not done through jokes but through showing all the movie clichés. An animated cat in the police station for example and nobody seeming to mind at all. Or when the police chief is yelling at Slater and showing literal steam coming out of his ears. This is a fun film that isn't meant to be taken seriously but is still very entertaining for action and comedy fans alike.",Last Action Hero
203,JT-Kirk,Not the lost treasure some claim it to be,4,13 July 2015,"Last Action Hero is deeply flawed and incompetent both as a dumb film and a smart one. The script wants you to think it is being clever, yet never once takes time to actually delve into what it's trying to say; the closest we get is Jack Slater, freed from celluloid, experiencing his first genuine conversation outside his action-filled life, yet that moment misfires by being woefully brief and shallow. It's also incapable of creating a real-world tone that feels grittier or more dangerous than that of the celluloid one; there's a scene that should have a shocking impact from the real world where Danny is assaulted in his apartment, so lost that it's hard to know if it's the celluloid world, the real world, or a dream.The movie tells us time and time again it's being a clever, tongue- in-cheek, meta look at the world of big Schwarzenegger-style action films of that era -- it screams this into the audience's face. But never does it actually succeed at commentary in a meaningful way, instead relying on cutesy moments and the same shallow style it's mocking to cover up for not being remotely smart enough to justify itself.I can't blame the cast, they seem to be doing an adequate job of what they're being told to. But too much of this film falls on young Austin O'Brien's shoulders, his character of Danny Madigan feels only slightly more authentic than Jake Lloyd's Anakin Skywalker in The Phantom Menace. His character is given too much to do and too much to carry without any real character integrity, and as a kid he struggles to make it all compelling. He's not bad at all, but his character is an oddball and a bad fit, and O'Brien is wearing a lot of ""early '90s kid"" traits that just didn't translate to likability *or* believability.A lot of blame can be put on the shoulders of the writers, especially when Shane Black is mocking his own Lethal Weapon films by doing what he always does of making this script into yet another Lethal Weapon film - look at Die Hard 3, The Last Boy Scout, Iron Man 3, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, etc., and you'll find many of the same exact buddy cop film tropes pouring out of them as you will here. The writers don't get the difference between a cinematic universe that feels like movie Los Angeles and a real world that only feels like movie New York; it's not enough to just change locations and put in one scene pretending to show real consequences. ""Jack Slater"" is an intentional sendup of Schwarzenegger films, a direct pastiche, yet the Jack Slater movies contain a cartoon cop detective paired with a human while a clown detective waits in line with a rabbi cop -- is this supposed to be an Arnie film with that stuff, an R-rated violent kiddie movie? Arnold hadn't done anything remotely kid-friendly, and nothing stupid approaching a ripoff of The Naked Gun or Roger Rabbit, yet the Jack Slater film universe that stuff is constant and we're asked to relate to that at face value. Jack Slater the film series seems to be something akin to Space Jam, and we all loved that, right?But the truth of the matter is that this movie's failure is its choice of director. Having come off a pair of action/adventure successes with Predator, Die Hard and Hunt for Red October, John McTiernan is the absolute worst choice for directing this film and it shows in every scene. McTiernan shows no experience in comedy or satire of any kind and directs every scene as if it were a standard, heavyweight action scene. There isn't one instance of comedy that works on a smart or funny level, much less the more nuanced need for satire and parody that Last Action Hero's complex premise demands. His version of storytelling is semi-gritty and action-based; while his version of comedy is the dumbest, simplest, shallowest type, right down to a giant fart bomb, and it's all tonally incompetent, directed as straight action. There's over 2 hours of this, couldn't something have been cut out?The movie also looks shockingly cheap considering how big its budget. The cinematography looks lazy and slapdash despite a competent D.P.; the special effects are mostly middling but there are some downright terrible. The gang members' casual car explosion at the end of a chase scene looks like an afterthought created on the video toaster, undermining what could have been a funny gag of our hero totally ignoring a giant fireball behind him, if not for the fact that it looks like that premise was added late in post despite coming from the shooting script, otherwise they wouldn't have shot it that way. Production doesn't even feel bloated and lazy, it just seems entirely out of its element and scrambling to put together something, anything because there's a release date and a mountain of cash riding on this, not to mention toys and soundtracks. Last Action Hero wasn't misunderstood when it came out, it was seen as the sloppy, wrong-headed mess it still is. The film is filled with action yet every scene drags, the plot is bloated and lost, the characters are shallow and paint-by-numbers despite pretending to be ""realistic"". The producers, writers, and director all got it entirely wrong, this is a dumb movie pretending to be a smart one, substituting subtlety and cleverness. Last Action Hero yells its gag into your face endlessly while telling the joke wrong the whole time, and then it's also bad at being a regular dumb movie! It's movies like Last Action Hero that paved the way for even more studio schlock like Batman & Robin and Speed 2, movies that were driven by corporate spreadsheets instead of vision.",Last Action Hero

The tongue-in-cheek self irony is very rare in Hollywood, and the film has a brilliant sense of humour.Arnie actually acts, and acts well (again, a very rare occurrence). And the film premise is very unusual and interesting. It also pokes fun at standard Hollywood formulas and pre-packaged characters very effectively.This film is terribly under-rated. It's not meant to be an action flick, and if you try to look for an action flick in it you'll be disappointed.

Arnold Schwarzenegger must have a good sense of humour to be able to be in a spoof of his OWN GENRE!Arnold Schwarzenegger (as he invariably does) gives a good performance as Jack Slater. Not amazing, but he gets the job done to a high standard. Also Austin O'Brien gives a good performance for a child of that age.The story follows young boy Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien), who takes comfort in watching action movies featuring the indestructible Los Angeles cop Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger) after the death of his father. After being given a magic ticket by theatre manager Nick (Robert Prosky), Danny is sucked into the screen and bonds with hero Jack Slater. When evil fictional villain Benedict (Charles Dance) steals the ticket and enters the real world, Danny and Jack must follow and stop him.This film brings the laughs, the action and everything else required for a fun action spoof.

It perhaps came a bit early for public consciousness to be ready for it, and so wound up showcasing (in hindsight) more of Black's prescience than his market savvy.In an out and out clever spoof of not only the action film industry but of the slavering fans of action, Schwarzenegger is brilliant casting.  The fact that he never quite seems to get the tongue-in-cheek aspect of the whole endeavor makes it all the funnier.  (The daydream sequence of Hamlet as an action flick is hysterical!)  Director John McTiernan (Die Hard, Hunt For Red October) strikes a nice balance between the tension of the plot and the relaxed atmosphere of the spoof.  If you saw it before and just didn't get the thrill ride you were expecting, that's probably because you were the butt of the big inside joke that was this film.  Try it again.",Last Action Hero

The one-liners, which people panned, were meant to be corny.  ""Big Mistake"" is part of the fun.  Many action movies had famous one-liners at that time, and this was the hommage to that.The jokes about never running out of bullets, flesh wounds, cleaning tar off quickly, people showing up coincidentially, police coming as a person is shot, are all easily verifiable as action movie staples from the time and earlier.Watch it with this in mind, and you'll see that it's a great movie for what it is intended to be, and that's a comedic look at the action genre.

To me the theme of the movie, which is basically movie characters coming into the real world, seemed like an adventure.  It's also a movie that seems like it would draw kids to watch it.  It wasn't really that entertaining to me except when Jack and Danny came out of the movie screen to capture Benedict, the evil villain who discovers a magic ticket that transports the movie characters to the real world, or real people into the movies.When I first found out about this movie, I thought it would be a really cool movie because I liked the main idea of it, but I think the writers could of made a different, more adventurous purpose for Jack Slater.  You see, the theme is unrealistic, but Jack Slater fights off basically criminals and he is apart of the police business.  There's alot of action, but it just doesnt have adventure, which I was expecting.  It's twisted, reality and non-reality is involved.  It's alright, I dont think kids would like it that much though either, since Jack Slater fights off guys that are criminals and even though he is a hero, he is a realistic hero, and that's what I mean by the twisted unrealistic and realistic.

Stallone as The Terminator - and Arnie says ""This was his very best movie"", sounding like a praise, but meaning, of course, that Terminator is better than all Stallone movies.This was one of the intelligent scenes in the movie, but not the only one.

Yeah, it's a little on the cheesy side at times, and the foray into PG-13 territory takes away some of the usual Schwarzenegger punch, but these are minor complaints.  The action sequences are well done, the direction by McTiernan is better than average, and Arnold puts forth a fun performance. I consider this film to be the SCREAM of action, using the formulas of the genre to it's advantage while recognizing and mocking them at the same time. It is a little more obvious about it than SCREAM is, but it's interesting, nonetheless.  Decent supporting roles and some excellent (sometimes strange and/or dated) cameos (Ian McKellen, Art Carney, Toru Tanaka, Van Damme, MC Hammer) help the film, but make no mistake, this is Arnold's movie.

At a time when Arnold was an action star with a capital ""S"", it's amazing that he would even make a film like this. I especially like the part where the characters come into the real world and discover things like that it hurts to break a window with your bare hands or to get shot.

229,trapper7111-1,My favorite Arnold Schwarznegger film. If you're not that fond of Action hero movies BY ALL MEANS WATCH THIS ONE,8,7 October 2005,"I'm not a movie critic.. What I don't know about film production, acting,directing etc. would fill several large books. For the most part I cherish my ignorance. The only reason I got into this comment thing was because again and again after watching a favorite movie for the nth time, I've looked it up to find it rated as 5.1 out of 10. Reading many of the comments has often supported my impression of the film and makes me wonder who weighted the thing so much that it pulled it down so low. So...You won't see me panning films I don't like. However, I do often feel compelled to counter what I feel was an uncalled for low rating. Now having got that out of my system....My favorite Arnold Schwarznegger film. If you're not that fond of Action hero movies BY ALL MEANS WATCH THIS ONE.As a normal American male, I've frittered away quite a few hours watching Arnold, Sly, Claude, Steven et.all do their macho thing and my personal (admittedly biased) ratings would be 4 to 7. Probably one thing I'm up to here with is the incredible number of dead bodies, the lousy shooting of hundreds of bad guys and the over use of pyrotechnics. I must admit however, I'm fascinated with the career of Schwarznegger. As it says in this movie: ""only in America - (rather), only in Hollywood"".By now I assume it's understood that this is a spoof of action hero movies and especially Schwarznegger's own. Apparently the hard core A-H watchers didn't realize this and were disappointed. That's understandable. Its parody on the genre is a masterpiece, if somewhat complicated. Where can you find an action hero who dislocates his shoulder doing a simple stunt, likes classical music, comes up with the new tag line of ""rubber baby buggy bumpers, works with a cartoon character and takes the last bullet in the movie with fatal consequences? ( I won't spoil the movie by telling the end of the ending). I liked the supporting cast, and find the whole project hilarious. In this one Arnold is obviously a little tired of the genre himself. So if you can stand to see a few more bodies and explosions done in fun, I recommend you see this one. I believe you'll like it. I'll raise the average with an 8.",Last Action Hero

From the outset it was clear that this film was a parody of all those classic over-the-top Arnie movies rolled into one. One-liners, mad action, improbable stunts, a decent child actor, a good supporting cast (including a host of cameos), and plenty of humour. As Jack Slater (Arnie) walks into his apartment he immediately pulls out his gun and shoots his closet, opens the door and a man falls dead to the floor.

Fortunately he bounced back to make some more excellent films after this one such as Terminator 3, the End of Days, Batman & Robin, Eraser, Terminator 2 3-D and of course True Lies.

237,lonshapiro,"The ""Blazing Saddles"" of Action Movies - Arnold's Best",10,29 November 2005,"Whether you laugh at him because of his bad acting, or laugh with him because he is able to make fun of his own persona, Arnold Scwarzenegger has always been one of my favorite actor/comedians. His scene in ""Terminator 2"" as a robot learning how to mix and match teenage slang into the appropriate insult from a young John Connor showed how funny he could be while not trying to be funny. Having said that, Arnold made a quantum leap forward in his comedic abilities with the hugely underrated ""Last Action Hero"".Unfortunately, audiences in 1993 were not ready to accept Arnold Schwarzenegger spoofing himself in this wickedly funny satire on action blockbusters. The rich use of background gags, cameo appearances and in-jokes playing behind the main action in this film make it is as good a genre spoof as ""Blazing Saddles,"" ""The Naked Gun,"" or ""Austin Powers."" In addition, ""Last Action Hero"" contains a number of original elements that elevate it above the normal spoof (which only confused the unsuspecting and unsophisticated audience further): 1) The use of classical references twisted to fit the action film genre are hilarious - Schwarzenegger as Hamlet was one of the funniest things he has ever done.2) The ""movie within a movie"" device present in ""Last Action Hero"" is just as powerful a juxtaposition of reality and fantasy as we see in ""The Matrix,"" but it came out six years earlier.3) Jack Slater's growth as a character throughout the film reveals a depth in him that far surpasses most of the ""real"" people introduced to us in other films. There are so many instances where we see this growth: his understanding of current vehicle specs in the third ""chicken"" scene (which takes place in the dangerous real world); his consistent ability to surprise the audience with out of character choices like the scene with classical music and the choice of a new action hero one liner; and his ability to learn the nature of physical pain. Especially entertaining is the background monologue at the end of the movie when he tells the chief that he is perfectly capable of hearing and that he would like to develop a more respectful relationship.There are a number of reasons the film was panned at the time that have been referred to by other reviewers - a misleading marketing campaign that had people actually expecting an action blockbuster, the misfortune of premiering right around the time of Jurassic Park, and an anti-Arnold backlash. But the biggest problem the film faced was the inability of the audience to accept Schwarzenegger as more than an ignorant muscle man. As Arnold has proved in his rise as Governator, he is far more intelligent than most people give him credit. (Don't get me wrong, he has been a terrible governor, but when you consider that his competition is made up of lawyers, businessmen, and self-made millionaires, he has certainly held his own in game of politics.) If someone else had played the role spoofing Schwarzenegger and Mel Brooks was credited as the producer, this would have become an instant classic. However, twelve years have gone by, and people are beginning to discover how good the film really is. Which is good news for Arnold, because he will most likely need a job after the 2006 gubernatorial election, so at least there will be a built in audience for ""Last Action Hero: The Sequel.""",Last Action Hero

248,claven666,Give this one another shot,9,20 March 2014,"This move is not an action movie and it never was supposed to be. It is a satirical comedy.When this movie came out in 1993, it was almost universally panned by critics. After watching it again last night on netflix, I have to say that those critics were idiots, they didn't understand what the hell they were doing, and they probably didn't pay very good attention to what was going on around the main plot.This film is actually an extremely intelligent piece of work but it requires you to pay attention to the little details going on in the backgrounds. Everything in this film is a satirical jab at Hollywood and the myriad clichés that surround the industry. The film doesn't hit you over the head with the jokes, it expects you to be intelligent enough to understand why they are jokes.Why does Jack Slater have an empty apartment with a bed on the floor and closet full of the same clothes? Because he is an action movie character whose only function is to make things explode. No one cares about what kind of TV he has or what he eats for dinner. No one cares what he wears when his time on screen is over. In fact, no one even thinks about the character as person existing outside the confines of the story. Why do the cars in the background scenes constantly swerve out of the way and crash? Because they're in an action movie from the 90s; not a single character has ever looked at the road or driven in their own lane in an action movie since action movies were invented.I would say this move is far, far better than the original reviews first intimated. Arnold is hilarious, the jokes are good, and the sub-textual commentary about Hollywood fantasy cliché world vs. the real world is actually quite engaging and well-thought. Unfortunately, Benedict was correct when he stated that in our world the bad guys can win, and they won in a major when this film didn't get the respect it deserves.",Last Action Hero

Beautifully done parody of the action-movie genre and contrasted with real-life creates some truly memorable scenes. Villain role was played to near perfection by Charles Dance. Watching Arnold's Jack Slater character being suddenly thrust from a movie and into real-life was captivating and tugged at the heart.",Last Action Hero
251,chermanyever,Very good!!!,10,5 February 2007,"I don't care what the critics say. This is one of my favorite fiction movies. Danny Madigan falls into the screen of the cinema right in the middle of his favorite movie! Reality and fantasy all the time, all in one. It can be easily compared with Back To The Future. Imagine a mirror, reality at one side, fantasy at the other, and at the same time they inter-cross! Very smart movie. Great actors. Too much characters. A mixture of comedy and action. Awesome soundtrack! I think it has everything that any movie of this kind must have, and more. This movie makes you ask yourself how could someone imagine such story. Too much fun. Great for a lazy afternoon.",Last Action Hero
252,sonoran_entertainment,Excellent Concept Poor Film,1,4 January 2008,"The concept of being transported into a movie using a magic pass is original and exciting. What let this film down was the poor casting, story and direction. If you had someone like Spielberg on the case it would have been a magical adventure where one boy's dream comes true. Instead you have a very cheesy film with poor gags and one liners with a washed up action hero thrown in for good measure.There was so much potential for this film, to be so much more but what you end up with is Arnold trying to inject some life into his waning career after the post 80's mussel bound action hero genre which he seemingly ended up (trapped) in. There is still potential for this concept to be revisited but with a better story outline and cast.There's got to be someone out there who could take this concept on and do it justice!",Last Action Hero

A lot of people looked at this as a cheap Arnold action movie, and while it's not a great film it's certainly a good one with a very good concept.  The intentional continuity errors are funny and clever, the movie cliche's are great.  So what if it's a little cheesy and Arnold is the only decent actor?  Enjoy the conflict of reality and fiction, and see this movie because it's a fun and somewhat thoughtful flick.",Last Action Hero

There are so many puns, double entendres, refs to other Arnie flicks, and just poking fun at Hollywood in general. Really fun stuff. The exchange between Arnie and his wife (Maria) in the premiere sequence is a riot. Great fun when the actors take us in to the movie with them and demonstrate they get the joke every bit as much as we do. Watch it for entertainment and not to see a hardcore action flick. Good for several laughs...watch for the killer dogs and how well trained they are!",Last Action Hero
255,MisterTimeguru,A Fine Film,9,3 April 2004,"I feel this is one of those films you have to see twice or more to appreciate the sheer complexity of its finer points. It wasnt until recently that I realized it had such a decent soundtrack to go along with its colorful dialogue and snappy one-liners from you-know-who. A good enough ending to this picture was a welcome thing in today's movie trend of sequel after sequel. Casting seemed alright. Good amount of cameos. Pretty well done visual effects. All in all, this is probably my favorite of all of Arnie's movies yet as far as entertaining me. Can't wait to see if he decides to make some more after he gets out of the California Governor's Seat. Come back, Arnold, come back!",Last Action Hero
256,supercheese,under-rated Arnie to the max,9,20 November 2004,"Some of the best Arnie one-liners and bad throw-away puns are included intentionally in this HAM CAMP meta-film roller coaster. I mean come on! Arnold Schwarzenegger's Hamlet!?! Brilliant! A film that makes fun of the bottom of barrel Hollywood action scene, using the cheesiest mainstream action star of the earlier 90s (even better lines than Kurt Russell, Sly, Bruce Willis, Segal, and VanDork)There are many sections which are just too much for serious movie fans, and rightly so. This film celebrates Hollywood predictability for those of us who love to say what happens before it does.It's no mystery why this film was a box office flop. The acting blew, and it was full of cheap sight gags. But in the name of fun, this is one of the coolest stories of its day. Too bad it's been basically lost in a swarm of negative criticism from various malcontents. Absolutely worth seeing, unless ""you don't get it"".

257,chilton-3,A good movie misunderstood.,9,30 January 2005,"If you are looking for a typical Arnold action flik don't bother with the ""Last Action Hero"". However if you are looking for to see Arnold act in what was probably one of his most difficult roles this movie is not to be missed. Most people don't get that this movie was a parody. It must have been incredibly tough for an actor used to working in a world where cars explode if you scratch them and characters are thinner than a piece of newspaper to move into a world of real cars and real characters. What worked for me in this film is that Jack Slater became a surrogate father to Danny Madigan. People looking for bigger and better explosions should move on and see True Lies. To view Last Action Hero start by thinking in terms of Kindergarten Cop, Twins, or Junior.-- Chris",Last Action Hero

259,staughn,"The early nineties were filled with, shallow, shallow people...",8,11 January 2006,"It is quite sad when movies are watched by people who make hasty decisions. I'm not surprised in the least... Over the years sinse its release I'd crossed people who had told me how much ""Last Action Hero"" sucked. For shame... Yet I'm pleased to know I'm not the only person who watches movies to ""enjoy"" (Oh noes, a sin) what they have to offer.Remember when ""The Shawshank Redemption"" first came out and it wasn't well spoken of? It had to take more than 5 years for people to come out of the woodwork (Or come to their senses in the privacy of their own home) to decide that it was not only underrated, but also very intelligent.::THE FOX POINTS OUT A SPOILER:: This movie (As a generous amount of people had stated here) is a spoof, a parody... Everything is stereotyped exactly, yet no one in the movie ever notices.Throughout the first half of the movie Danny and Jack wander about in the fictional world of ""L.A."" to seek out and stop the main villain. This world is bright and cheery, but when danger shows its head you know it's there. The villains wave guns like the uber-villains they are meant to be, and they seem to show no remorse or sign of a conscience (Like a typical action movie). ""X"" amount of bullets from the hero's gun mow'ss down bad-guys and causes vehicles to explode *Suddenly remembers the scene in UHF when Al dreams of being Rambo* while the villains accuracy rating suffers greatly. At a certain point in the movie the villain makes his escape into ""another world"" where things seem the same, except the setting is dreary, dismal at times, and may ultimately cost you your life without warning. Bullets kill and injure, and they do so indiscriminantly. Cars don't explode when shot at either, and they don't fly dozens of feet into the air when the collide with another car for that matter.Find it on DVD. There are many ""Easter Eggs"" throughout the film (T-1000 cameo, Jack's apartment number and various movie posters and billboards). After sitting through the entire movie you might even want to take the time to go through again just to pause and zoom in for a closer look.Trust your own imagination and not some movie critic, unless they can protect what they claim. Movies are meant to entertain, and the more you get out of it the better you'll feel. =)",Last Action Hero
260,mikekrencicki,"Not just nostalgia, ""new""stalgia",6,16 July 2014,"Not a masterpiece, but definitely a considerable work from an acclaimed director and a talented supporting cast (and then there's Arnie!). Arnold's humor and style are really on display here. His acting ability has been questioned by many, but here he makes all the right moves in a script that balances satire with homage. I gave it a six because I typically review more ""Artfull"" films, but hey, this is pure nostalgia...and it has become ""new""stalgia for the countless friends I have recently told to try this movie out!

261,domxdom,Last Action Hero,8,23 September 2018,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is back, like he promised, in this action parody. Schwarzenegger, in true Schwarzenegger fashion, plays movie star character Jack Slater, a heroic cop with an almost idyllic lifestyle, but with any good action hero's comes a villain; no need to worry though, bad guys never win, right?
This light-hearted film, directed by John Mctiernan, a director who has worked along side Schwarzenegger in other classics such as predator, has created this spoof to emphasis no matter how many times you are shot, beat up, tied up,or how many explosions you are in- the good guy always wins. Schwarzenegger's characters of course are all shinning examples of this so who better to play Slater than the real life action man himself.
The film focuses on a young kid, Danny Madigan (Austin O'brian), who'd rather be at the theater with his old timer friend and projectionist, Nick (Robert Prosky). Excited about his favourtie on screen hero's new movie, Nick allows Danny to have first look and adding to the experience hands Danny a magical ticket he's sceptical about; unaware of the adventure to come Danny takes his seat. Fully indulged in the film the power of the ticket unleashes, catapulting Danny into the parallel universe of Jack Slater. Right in the heart of the action, Danny tries to convince Jack his life is in fact just a movie. However, Danny's appearance doesn't come with out consequence when his ticket ends up in the wrongful hands of Benedict (Charles Dance); Benedict soon realises bad guys have a better chance of victory in the real world. Jumping between the two universes Jack and new side kick (by default) Danny have to try and stop Benedict before the inevitable happens, bumping into some familiar faces along the way. 
As Previously mentioned, this film is a spoof, a satire, a film where Arnold Schwarzenegger takes the mick out of, well... Arnold Schwarzenegger. Every explosion is over dramatic, every bad guy needs to learn how to shoot a gun and every one liner to come from Schwarzenegger is cheesier than ever. Some viewers are put off the eccentric style of the film, but that's why its humorous. This film is real breath of fresh air, it does what its meant to do, make you realise life isn't always how it's portrayed in the movies.
Maybe swaying from Schwarzenegger normal line of characters, this film is still an Arnie classic and any fan of his should definitely watch this. But remember folks, don't always believe what you see in the movies! enjoy...",Last Action Hero

I think back to all the great comedic moments throughout my film viewing lifetime, including Dr. Strangelove, the Python films, American Beauty and countless others but cannot come up with a moment in any of those films that is more laugh out loud funny than that scene. Even moments from MST3K, The Flying Circus, Seinfeld, Mr. Show, Hogan's Heros, Curb Your Enthusiasm just don't compare to the genius of this scene.
