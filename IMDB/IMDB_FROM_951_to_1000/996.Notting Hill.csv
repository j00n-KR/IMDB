0,TheLittleSongbird,"Warm, charming and pleasant",8,10 January 2010,"This film was surprisingly good, not my favourite romantic comedy in the world, and personally I think Love Actually and Four Weddings and a Funeral are better. But it is a good film, thanks to the strong performances, fresh script and the film's look. While not laugh out loud funny, Notting Hill is nonetheless warm and charming. The script is fresh, sometimes funny, sometimes insightful. The part where Anna says ""I am just a girl, standing in front of a boy, waiting for him to love her"", may be cringe worthy to some people, but for me no matter how clichéd it is it shows a vulnerable side to Anna's character. The film is based on love revolved around unequal social standing, William being diffident and unsuccessful, Anna being the complete opposite. The photography is fabulous and the direction is excellent. Hugh Grant is charming as William and Julia Roberts is positively luminous as Anna, and the two have strong chemistry. Out of the supporting performers, Rhys Ifans stands out in a very zany turn as Spike. The music is lovely too. All in all, this is very warm, charming and pleasant, yeah the ending is predictable, but this is a well written and quite irresistible film. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",Notting Hill
1,bkoganbing,Media goldfish bowl,7,14 June 2019,"Notting Hill is a neighborhood in London and it's the title of a romantic comedy
starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. Two of the most unlikely lovers you could
ever imagine get together here.Grant is the respectable, but somewhat dull proprietor of a bookstore in Notting
Hill which specializes in travel books. It looks like he's getting by, but truth be
told Grant's perfectly happy with just making enough to pay the bills and a little
extra.Back in the day after she retired from the screen for almost 50 years it was one
of those urban legends in New York City to spot Greta Garbo out and about and you'd never know but when she might get a notion to stop into a bookstore like Grant's. In this case Julia Roberts plays a movie star not unlike
the real Julia Roberts. Garbo mysterious she's not.For if she was I doubt Hugh Grant would have considered approaching her. As
for Roberts she's looking at Grant as a bit of respite from her life in the media
goldfish bowl. When she's discovered it's disaster for both of them.Notting Hill is a nice romantic comedy with very believable leads in a fairy tale
fantasy. I mean who doesn't have a fantasy of wooing and winning some
celebrity you might admire or be crushing out on. In that sense Notting Hill
has a universal appeal.In an unbilled part Alec Baldwin plays her boyfriend whom we learn little about factually. But he comes across as an egotistical fathead. One thing
you're certain of, no matter what happens with Grant, Roberts and Baldwin
won't be an item much longer.Notting Hill, a nice romantic comedy/fantasy. May you win the celebrity of
your desires.",Notting Hill
2,Leofwine_draca,Yuck,4,18 September 2021,"Not one for me, thanks. Julia Roberts is as obnoxious as ever and Hugh Grant overplays his stuttering goon character to the max. Even Rhys Ifans is an irritant and the whole thing plays out with a thick layer of cloying sentiment.",Notting Hill
3,SnoopyStyle,Rom-Com Royalty,8,13 September 2013,"William Thacker (Hugh Grant) owns an unsuccessful Notting Hill bookstore in London. Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) is a movie star considered as the world's most beautiful woman.Of course, the movie Gods declare that these two must bump into each other and fall for each other. There must be trials and tribulations. There will hilarious moments at the expense of the awkward gaff prone Hugh Grant. Yes, we have rom-com royalty here. So this film is in safe hands. The story is safely traditional fare. It's been done before. But the rom-com gods commands it. If you like rom-coms, this is the safest bet you can place.Julia Roberts is the perfect movie star chased by the paparazzi. Rhys Ifans has some funny moments as the weird Spike. Hugh Grant is still at the top of his game playing that charming stuttering guy. The story has some heart from the sister character played by Gina McKee. It is a perfectly crafted rom-com.",Notting Hill
4,kosmasp,Pretty famous woman,8,16 April 2021,"What does fame do to a person? To their perception ... now don't get this wrong: this is not a character study. This is a comedy - but quite a good one. I can see why Hugh Grant was considered the thing (excuse the objectification) for some time back then ... well until he had a public ... I'm not even sure what to call it. Funnily enough this movie has something similar. Although I reckon no one would call Hughs character a hooker ... ah well so many jokes and connections to other things. Also life being stranger than fiction.But back to this and a story that may be a bit too sweet at places but still has some weird jokes to keep a balance of it all. If you like the two main actors and characters, there is nothing that can go wrong ... and then there is the mad Spike character ... he has his moments. For better or worse ... also the movie in general seems to be winking at the audience and be self reflective ... maybe more than some even remember. I know I would have really laughed, if after they talked about body (part) doubles, if we'd seen Julia Roberts behind ... well not her behind in that case obviously ... anyway strange and funny and engaging. It deserves being hailed as one of the better romantic comedies, predictabilities and that ending aside ...",Notting Hill
5,gavin6942,Tolerable By Romantic Comedy Standards,6,25 February 2016,"The life of a simple bookshop owner (Hugh Grant) changes when he meets the most famous film star in the world (Julia Roberts).What I really enjoyed about this film is the guest stars. Alec Baldwin shows up unannounced for a brief but crucial scene. Heck, even Mischa Barton appears as the child actor whom Will pretends to interview for Horse & Hound. Of course, when the film came out no one knew who Barton was, but that is what makes looking back at movies fun.Beyond that, it is your typical romantic comedy. I suppose it is slightly different in that the main character is male rather than female, and Grant is more charming than the average male lead. In fact, Grant is the saving grace of this film, because Julia Roberts is just as awful as ever. Her character is uptight and only opens up in the second half, completely without any reason.",Notting Hill
6,jboothmillard,Notting Hill,9,14 September 2005,"Following the success of Four Weddings and a Funeral, five years later the same team of leading actor and writer Richard Curtis (Blackadder, The Vicar of Dibley) teamed up again for what would become another big success, directed by Roger Michell (The Mother, Enduring Love, Venus, My Cousin Rachel). Basically, William Thacker (Golden Globe nominated Hugh Grant) owns a travel book shop in Notting Hill, London. His wife left him for another man, and he shares his house with an eccentric Welsh lodger, Spike (BAFTA nominated Rhys Ifans). One day, Hollywood actress Anna Scott (Golden Globe nominated Julia Roberts) happens to enter his shop, which amazes him. Later, in the street, Will accidentally bumps into her, spilling orange juice on her, and he invites her to his nearby house to change. When leaving, she impulsively kisses him. A short time later, Will is surprised to receive a call from Anna inviting him to visit her at the Ritz Hotel. He is mistaken for a reporter, from Horse & Hound magazine, and becomes part of a press junket for Anna's new film, Helix. Will tries to express his feelings regarding the kiss but is continually interrupted by Anna's press agent (John Shrapnel), and then he is forced to pretend to be a journalist whilst meeting the other cast members. But before leaving Will does manage to invite Anna on a date to his sister's birthday party that evening. They attend dinner at the home of Wil's useless cook friend Max (Tim McInnerny) and his wheelchair-bound wife Bella (Gina McKee). There, Will's sister Honey (The Vicar of Dibley's Emma Chambers), Max, Bella, and friend Bernie (Hugh Bonneville) are amazed by Anna's attendance, but she gets on well with them all. Later they climb a fence and enter a private neighbourhood park, where Anna again kisses Will. While on another date the following night, they overhear three men at first praising and then disparaging Anna, equating actresses to prostitutes. Will walks over and criticises them, he and Anna are about to leave when she turns around, comes back, introduces herself and calmly insults the stunned trio. Anna invites Will to her hotel room, but she is surprised be her movie star boyfriend, Jeff King (Alec Baldwin), of whom Will was unaware, unexpectedly arriving from America to be with her. Will's friends try to help him get over his disappointment, he spends the next six months being set up on a series of dates with various women, many eccentrics, but he cannot forget Anna. One day, a distraught Anna shows up at Will's house, needing to hide from a tabloid scandal. She apologises for the hotel incident, telling him her relationship with King is over. They enjoy spending time together and discover shared interests, and sleep together that night. The following morning however, reporters have been inadvertently tipped off by Spike and have surrounded Will's house, and take pictures of him, Anna, and half-dressed Spike at the front door. Anna is furious and blames Will, telling him she regrets coming to him for help, and she leaves. Will remains miserable for the passing seasons. At a dinner with his friends, he discovers that Anna is back in London making a film, a period drama based on Henry James, something he suggested she should do. He visits her shoot, where Anna sees him and invites him past security to watch and to talk privately afterwards. But, using headphones provided by a crew member, he overhears her on microphone dismissing him to a co-star, and he leaves without speaking to her. The next day, Anna comes to the bookshop; Will tells her what he overheard, and she explains that she did not want to discuss her private life. She then confesses that she loves him, and pleads to rekindle their relationship, saying ""I'm also just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her."" But he is afraid of being hurt again and rejects her. Will meets his friends and sister in a restaurant, they act supportive, and half-heartedly back up his decision, but Spike calls him a ""daft prick"". Will fully realises his mistake and they all race across London to a press conference Anna is holding at the Savoy Hotel. Will arrives in time to hear Anna's publicist say that Anna will be taking a year off and will be leaving the UK that night. A reporter asks about ""Thacker"" and the controversial photographs of them, and Anna says they are just friends. Will, again pretending to be a reporter, asks Anna if she would consider being more than friends if he admitted to having been a ""daft prick"" and begged her forgiveness. She smiles and asks to be asked how long she will stay in England, to which she replies ""indefinitely"". Anna and Will get married, attending red carpet events, and Anna becomes pregnant; they are last seen having quiet time on the bench in the park. Also starring James Dreyfus as Martin, Richard McCabe as Tony, Dylan Moran as Rufus, the thief, Henry Goodman as the Ritz concierge, Julian Rhind-Tutt as Time Out journalist, Lorelei King as Anna's publicist, Clarke Peters as Helix lead actor, Mischa Barton as 12-year-old actress in Helix, Emily Mortimer as Perfect Girl, Samuel West (son of Timothy West and Prunella Scales) as Anna's co-star, Dorian Lough as Loud Man in Restaurant, Sanjeev Bhaskar as Loud Man in Restaurant, Paul Chahidi as Loud Man in Restaurant, Simon Callow as Self in Film-within-Film, Matthew Modine as Actor in Film-within-Film, Omid Djalili as Cashier at Coffee Shop, and EastEnders' Michael Higgs as Man at Market. Grant is the same likeable bumbling charmer he was in Four Weddings, Roberts is beautiful and equally loveable as the most famous in the world, the supporting cast of well-known British stars all get their moments as well. With a great soundtrack, including the songs ""She"" by Elvis Costello, ""In Our Lifetime"" by Texas, ""When She Says Nothing at All"" by Ronan Keating, ""Ain't No Sunshine"" by Bill Withers, and ""From the Heart"" by Another Level. The writing is impeccable, it is a good insight into modern celebrity culture, with a sweet love story combined by marvellously funny embarrassing and awkward moments, a fantastic romantic comedy. It won the BAFTA for the Audience Award, and it was nominated for Best British Film, it won the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Hugh Grant was number 73, and Julia Roberts number 29 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Grant was also number 8 on The 50 Greatest British Films, and the film was number 95 on The Ultimate Film. Very good!",Notting Hill
7,ccthemovieman-1,"Started Off Great, Then Became Like The Rest Of Today's Lame Comedies",3,2 February 2008,"This started off promising with a very good first 40 minutes, then slid downhill fast with all the typical modern-day film clichés you hear in a romance-comedy. You get the customary excused promiscuous behavior and overdone sex jokes, excessive profanity and wrong intentions with the male always at fault. (It's never the female in the ""politically correct"" world of entertainment.)Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts obviously make an attractive couple. Grant is a likable guy in most of his movies, not just some ""pretty boy"" because guys like him, too. The only complaint I have with his characters - as he does in this film, too - is his overly self-effacing attitude where he's always apologizing for living, practically, to his female counterpart. Hugh - speak up and be a man! Stop sounding like a stuttering wimp!I'm a romantic guy, but romantic comedies are so lame most of the time. How two people get together usually is so ludicrous, so unrealistic it gets downright insulting. Modern-day films like ""Sleepless in Seattle"" make me puke, as do classic films labeled ""screwball comedies."" I actually thought - for the first 40 minutes - this film might be different. It wasn't. You get the normal ""formula"" and ""contrived"" story, even though it reeks of charm. However, enough is enough. Grant (""William Thacker"") and Roberts (""Anna Scott"") got all the acting publicity for this film but the colorful supporting characters were more fun to watch than the two stars. Do you think it is possible for some filmmaker to make an intelligent romantic comedy, and one that isn't rated PG-13? I hope so.",Notting Hill
8,rmax304823,"Er, This Is So, Um, So Awkward Really That, Well -- It's Surreal.",6,13 November 2017,"You have never seen such realistic portrayals of awkwardness, nor so many of them. Hugh Grant runs a humble bookshop in the little urban village of Notting Hill and one day a glamorous movie star, Julia Roberts, enters the store and pokes around. He doesn't recognize her but he kind of, well, likes her. On his way home to his humble flat and his skinny and nearly insane flat mate he bumps into her again, spilling something all over her shirt. With abundant apologies he invites her in so that she can clean up. She does so. And as she leaves his flat she unexpectedly leans forward and gives him a great big smooch, leaving poor Hugh Grant dumbfounded.He later makes a date with her but shows up while her interviews with reporters is still going on. He must pose as a writer from Horse and Hounds magazine and ask her silly questions like did she use horses in her last movie. (""It took place in outer space."") But mistaken identities are a staple of successful romantic comedies and of comedies in general. They were probably staples when Aristophanes used them. And that's what this is, a traditional romantic comedy, with three ups and two downs.What makes this different is the understatement and unease in the budding relationship. Nobody is better at discomfiture than Hugh Grant. Hugh is as good as Cary, better maybe. Some of the other staples I could have done without -- Hugh's eccentric but warm family, a near-slapstick ending, the soggy music. (A melancholy rendition of ""Love Makes the World Go Round"" when Hugh seems to have lost Roberts and is moping around.) It's a colorful comedy though and I enjoyed it. There are just enough touches of realistic diffidence to tickle the heart of anyone who was once swamped with the neuropeptides of true love and then lost it.",Notting Hill
9,moonspinner55,Has some very sweet qualities and laid-back performances,6,28 August 2005,"""Notting Hill"" is quite pleasant and has many wonderful moments, but I resented the cookie-cutter formula which serves as the framework for the story. The two main characters played by Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts meet in his bookshop and trade some lines. The stage is set for them to meet again, which they do by bumping into each other on the street (he splashes juice on her clothes). This kind of stuff is worse than old-fashioned, it is downright creaky. Things do pick up from there as the bookseller and his movie-star girlfriend get closer to each other (the sequence where she meets his friends is enchanting, funny on different levels, and based in a surprising sort of reality wherein Roberts sends up her persona as an overpaid underachiever). But then the formula has to rear its ugly head in the climax: guy meets girl, guy loses girl...you can finish the rest. It's a 'nice' movie, lightly broad, but is it asking too much to want smarter people at the controls? **1/2 from ****",Notting Hill
10,sunwarrior13,Romance Between An Actress And A Bookseller,9,15 October 2012,"Can a beautiful and internationally famous American actress find happiness with a frumpy British bookstore clerk? She can it seems at Notting Hill. Notting Hill is a romantic comedy set in London.The film stars Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts, Rhys Ifans, Emma Chambers, Tim McInnerny, Gina McKee and Hugh Bonneville.The screenplay was by Richard Curtis;it was produced by Duncan Kenworthy; and directed by Roger Michell. William Thacker is a bookseller at a shop in the Notting Hill district in West London, who shares a house with an eccentric Welsh friend,Spike. One day, William is minding the store when in strolls Anna Scott, a lovely and well-known actress from the United States who is in London working on a film. She buys a book from William, and she is polite and charming in the way a famous actress would be with a star-struck sales clerk. Their relationship would logically end there, if William didn't run out a few minutes later to buy some juice. While dashing back to the shop, he bumps into Anna on the street, spilling juice all over her blouse. Since he lives nearby, William politely offers to let her stop by his house to clean up; since William seems harmless enough, Anna agrees. When Anna has to stop back to pick up a bag she left at William's house, they kiss just in time for Spike to show up. A romance slowly blooms as his friends and family wonder out loud what he's doing dating a movie star.This movie is funny, sympathetic, mostly smart, and it boasts a likable cast of characters led by two performers - Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant - who have star power and know how to use it.While we never doubt the outcome of how the film will end,it offers an enjoyable narrative journey that endears and entertains, with genuine warmth and grace.In short,Notting Hill can be described to be a thoroughly pleasurable emotional thrill ride.",Notting Hill

12,hitchcockthelegend,"Oh, sod a dog. I've made the wrong decision, haven't I?",7,20 May 2009,"Bookshop owner William Thacker's (Hugh Grant) life is turned upside down when Hollywood star Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) ventures into his shop.By definition, Notting Hill is crowd pleasing fluff for the romantically inclined. Nothing wrong with that of course, chances are that if you have tuned in on TV or loaded this film on your player, you are fully expecting a fluffarama with lots of toothy smiles. Sure enough Notting Hill, written by Richard Curtis and directed by Roger Mitchell, delivers everything that the wish fulfilment plot synopsis suggests it will. And nicely providing a few laughs into the bargain as well.That it stops short of being a top line rom-com falls at the feet of Curtis and his over egged script. The comedy is razor sharp and the romance is excellently fleshed from start to finish, but in his need to add drama via media intrusion and a ""woe is me"" life of the actress, Curtis comes dangerously close to fluffing his, well, fluff piece.Still, it's a flaw that doesn't sink the film, because hey! We want feel-good and that's what we shall bloody well get! Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts take the lead roles of our mismatched (matched) coupling, and as it turns out it's a fine bit of casting. Roberts is not asked to do much other than smile and work well opposite Grant's wonderful foppish charm, while both actors benefit from an excellent supporting cast who rise above what in essence is a roll call of rallying around your mate mates!Especially praise worthy is the efforts of Gina McKee and Tim McInnerny, whose sub-plot story could have been twee, but thanks to both of them it actually adds an emotional pull rather than being a shoehorned hindrance. Cringe comedy comes courtesy of Rhys Ifans (owning every scene he is in) and James Dreyfus adds extra light relief as William's assistant at the shop, Martin.There's no Wet Wet Wet theme tune to outstay its welcome, and Roberts says her cringer line with far more oomph than that of Andie MacDowell. To which all told it makes Notting Hill no masterpiece in a much loved genre, but crucially it is however a delightful frothy film that hopefully makes you smile as much as it does yours truly. 7/10",Notting Hill

Maybe not in real life, but for the many that hope to ever do so this movie is a ray of hope.Hugh Grant was absolutely marvelous as a bookseller who bumps into Julia Roberts. She was equally fantastic in what I perceive to be her best performance since Pretty Woman.Rhys Ifans was absolutely over-the-top as his flatmate.As Lloyd Dobler said in ""Say Anything..."" My goal in life is just to be with her. What a goal. Lloyd achieved it and so did William Thacker. There is hope! I would be remiss if I did not mention the fantastic music in this movie. It was just incredible. Shania Twain, Al Green, Bob Marley, and on and on. It was a perfect soundtrack.

Observant sketch of a celebrity desperately seeking solitude and love. Julia Roberts plays an actress who is involved in a film in London, and she encounters Hugh Grant when she enters his bookstore. After an accident involving orange juice, Grant offers his home for her to clean up thus begins predictable circumstances chalk full of clichés. Director Roger Mitchell delivers insight on the price of fame and the strive for normality. Part of his success is his fairy tale delivery on the place of Notting Hill combining it with the realities of celebrity lifestyles and that of those observing from the outside as Grant does here. Roberts is strong as an actress struggling with a high price lifestyle, while Grant feels guilty due to her fame yet he really does love her. They counter formula with wit and charm making their roles likable. Supporting roles are the usual band of distracting props with actors like Hugh Bonneville and Rhys Ifans making appearances that amount to nothing. Emma Chambers plays Grant's sister and that is about the extent of her role. Strong emphasis on solitude and fame make up for its predictable structure. Guanine love celebrated as oppose to the fluff usually seen in movies. Score: 8 / 10",Notting Hill
16,gradyharp,A Wry British Comedy with Staying Power,10,14 May 2006,"NOTTING HILL was a breath of fresh air when it entered the theaters in 1999. Written by Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Love Actually, The Girl in the Cafe - as well as the Bridget Jones scripts) and directed by Roger Michell (Persuasion, Changing Lanes, Enduring Love) the story is a bit cockamamie but blossoms in the hands of the fine cast. Now with this Collector's Edition release it is available for us all to appreciate again.William (Hugh Grant) is an ordinary bloke who runs a Travel Book Store in Notting Hill, a man whose life is abruptly changed when an American actress Anna (Julia Roberts) enters his shop and his life. Bumbling William spills orange juice on celebrity-shy Anna and the two cross the street to William's flat, shared with the wildly mad but lovable Spike (Rhys Ifans), and despite poor starts there begins a romance to test all romances. The manner in which William and Anna gradually find each other's vulnerabilities, including exposure to each other's lives - Anna with her celebrity entourage, William with his loony but oh so tender extended family (Tim McInnerny, Gina McKee, Emma Chambers, and Hugh Bonneville) - is the story of love overcoming hurdles. The secondary themes are lovely and beautifully played by this committed cast.For a springy, funny, tender, sweet British humor story, this one is hard to beat. Recommended. Grady Harp",Notting Hill
17,SimonJack,Fairy tale romance is just so-so,5,28 January 2017,"""Notting Hill"" is sort of a fairy tale romance. Of course, the initial appeal would be the two stars, Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. Grant plays William Thacker who owns a travel bookshop and lives nearby in the Notting Hill district of London. Roberts plays Anna Scott, the world's most famous actress for this story. They happen to meet when Anna just happens into his bookshop one day. The screen idol is trying to get away, to duck out of her life for a while. This eventually blossoms into a romance, and that leads to a fairy tale ending. Grant is the main star of this movie, and the main reason to see it. He wrestles with the unlikelihood of his encounter. He's attracted to Scott, and the thought of anything serious is too unbelievable. But, it's happening and he's there, and he needs to pursue it. That sums up the good and interesting parts of this movie. Roberts doesn't have many lines in this film. At times, Anna just seems to be a pretty face or fixture. Some of the film surrounds the actress and her entourage – a secretary, manager, publicist and reporters and photographers. Her life seems tightly regulated and scheduled. I think the audience is meant to sympathize with the heroine who can't have any time of her own, away from the spotlight, news cameras, and public. It's hard to empathize, though, when Anna makes $15 million just for one movie. She tells Bernie (played by Hugh Bonneville) that's what she is paid. So, make three or four films in a year, and that's $45 to $60 million a year. It's hard to sympathize with that. Of course, money isn't everything – and really not that much, when it comes down to happiness in life. But, what this film shows, probably not intentionally, is that those who make a fortune in the limelight (obviously, not all super wealthy folks), aren't very happy. Or, they have a hard time finding happiness. That's because the money, the limelight, the notoriety get in the way. Imparting that message, however subliminally, may be a quality of this film that most won't see or realize. It may get lost in the dream romance.The best parts of the film are when William takes Anna to a family dinner with his two sisters, brother-in-law and family friend. The family add the most zest and some good comedy to the film. Gina McKee is Bella, William's older sister. Richard McCabe is Tony, her devoted husband, gourmet cook and witty humorist. Emma Chambers is the youngest sister, Honey. Family friend, Bernie, rounds out the group. Toward the end, this group comes together to help William get to the depot on time.This group had been trying to find a match for William. So, they repeatedly had dinners at Bella and Tony's with a date they would line up for William. Naturally, none worked out, and most were far out. One of the strangest was a funny but somber match. Tony had just fixed a gourmet meal that they are about to eat and she announces that she is a fruitarian. She says, ""We believe fruits and vegetable have feelings, so we think cooking is cruel. We only eat things that have already fallen from the tree or bush that are, in fact, dead already."" William, ""Oh, all right. So, these carrots?"" Date, ""Have been murdered, yes.""Rhys Ifans who plays Spike, an out-of-work roommate of William, adds very little to this film. His character seems to be intended for the humor, but there's not much. Mostly he's a coarse slob who sponges off William. He lounges around the flat most of the day in his skivvies. The film was shot in the Notting Hill district. I'm not familiar with London, but this seems like a nice residential area not far from the heart of London, to the Northwest. Of course, residential areas in such places are mixed with, or adjacent to, stretches of commerce and government. It's not far from Kensington Palace (museum) and Hyde Park. The little that the film has on the streets is a nice peek at life in London neighborhoods. It's hard to imagine though, that a bloke could make a go of it in a neighborhood bookshop that just handled travel books. This film will probably be enjoyed most by the lovelorn and those who like to fantasize about romance or the perfect match. But for the most part, it's just so-so. Hugh Grant's part is good, and his family members and scenes are the most fun. Julia Roberts is mostly a pretty face. The trivia section of the IMDb Web site says that she wanted terribly to play this part, it was such a wonderful love story. Well, she forgot to bring her pep pills to put some life into her character. Another interesting bit of trivia is that Roberts made $15 million for this film. So, she accounted for 36% of the $42 million budget. Incidentally, a number of Hollywood stars have been paid $20 to $35 million or more for single films. Sandra Bullock, Keanu Reeves, Johnny Depp, Bruce Williams, Tom Cruise, Angelina Jolie, Sara Jessica Parker, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks and a host of others get many millions for a single film. Some also take smaller salaries but get percentages of the profits. In some instances, that has made them more than $100 million – for a single film.",Notting Hill

19,JamesHitchcock,Warm and Human British Comedy,7,17 December 2004,"Notting Hill is a district of west London that was built as a fashionable Victorian suburb, became very run down during the mid twentieth century and is now once again fashionable, but which retains a distinctly cosmopolitan atmosphere, with London's biggest street market and many small specialist shops. (My wife and I sometimes go there to shop for bargains). The hero of the film, William Thacker, is the owner of one of these shops, a travel bookshop. The film concerns the romance which develops between William and a young woman named Anna Scott whom he meets when she comes into his shop.As another reviewer has pointed out, 'Notting Hill' is based around a theme, love between people of unequal social standing, which has provided literature with some of its greatest works, both comic and serious, dating back at least to the tale of King Cophetua and the beggar-maid. Although many of these stories tell of a poor but honest lad who aspires to the hand of a princess or titled lady, Anna is not part of the Royal Family or the British aristocracy. She rather belongs to an even more exclusive elite, the Hollywood starocracy. She is a hugely popular film star who earns at least $15,000,000 per film, and pops into William's shop during a brief stay in London to publicise her latest movie. Although Anna is played by a real-life Hollywood superstar, Julia Roberts, the film is very typically British. William is similar to an number of other Hugh Grant characters, being a shy, diffident middle-class Englishman, probably public-school and university educated. (Despite this background, he is not particularly wealthy following a divorce from his first wife and is forced to share his lodgings with an eccentric Welsh flatmate, Spike). The humour of the film, particularly the dinner-party banter between William and his friends, is mostly of the typically ironic, self-deprecating variety popular in Britain, especially in middle-class circles. Rhys Ifans's Spike, by contrast, typifies another strand of British humour, the eccentric zaniness found in the likes of 'Monty Python'. Spike's strong provincial accent suggests a more working-class background; this possibly accounts for the teasing that he has to put up with from the other characters, although he takes it all in good part. William may be diffident, self-deprecating and unsuccessful, but he is probably the stronger of the two main characters. Anna is beautiful and successful, but underneath it all she is insecure, worried about losing her fame and fortune and about her inability to form lasting relationships with men. Early on in the film she has another boyfriend, Jeff, but it is clear that he is only the latest in a long string of unsatisfactory romances which have left her emotionally (and in some cases physically) bruised. The scene where Anna says to William 'I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her' is the one where we see her at her most vulnerable. Although both characters are in their late twenties or thirties, it is noteworthy that Anna refers to 'girl and boy' rather than 'woman and man'. Anna's vulnerability also comes through in her reaction in the scene where hordes of paparazzi appear on William's doorstep; William tries to play down the incident, and Spike finds it hugely amusing, but Anna is horrified. (The film was made shortly after the death of Princess Diana; this scene possibly reflects British disgust with the antics of the paparazzi, who were regarded as being partly to blame for the Princess's death). Like others, I found myself wondering how much Anna's personality reflects Julia Roberts's own; she too has had a number of unhappy relationships. Important roles are also played by Tim McInnerny and Gina McKee as William's best friend Max and his disabled wife Bella; the love of this ordinary couple for each other provides a more realistic, down-to-earth counterpart to the fairy-tale romance of William and Anna, helping to anchor the film more firmly in reality. The main charm, however, lies in the relationship of the two main characters, as Anna comes to realise that the seemingly ordinary William has a kindness and decency which count for more than the monstrous egos of Jeff and his like. Like 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', which was also written by Richard Curtis and starred Hugh Grant, 'Notting Hill' is one of the warmest and most human British films of the nineties. 7/10",Notting Hill
20,MovieAddict2016,What a nice surprise!,7,1 September 2002,"Like 'As Good As It Gets' and 'Sleepless in Seattle' if a romantic comedy is done right, it can be very entertaining to both sexes.
 Too many so-called 'romantic comedies' come out nowadays that are just ridiculous-all they are are stupid, dumb, unrealistic teen movies. But alas, when a romantic film is done right, you get a nice surprise, which Notting Hill was.  The screenplay is very humorous and pleasant, and so is the acting. While Hugh Grant is nothing great, I must say he chooses good romantic comedies to be in.  I lived in England over 5 years, and picked up the British 'humor' that is so many times overlooked, or called 'raunchy' and while their sitcoms may be this sometimes, the main humor is not raunchy! Notting Hill captures this humor and puts it in a blender, along with a great screenplay, cinematography, and chemistry. All in all I found Notting Hill to be a very pleasant, nice surprise, that female and male alike can enjoy. 3.5/5 stars--JOHN ULMER",Notting Hill

22,Buddy-51,trite romantic fable,5,26 July 1999,"""Notting Hill"", the latest venture from the makers of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", lacks the charm and depth of the original film, which, in retrospect, stands as one of the top romantic films of the 1990's. ""Weddings"" soared on the basis of three essential elements:  the sharp, offbeat wit of its screenplay, the likability of its subsidiary characters, and, most important, the emotional and psychological depth of the Hugh Grant character, who, in many ways, functions as the archetype of all those modern men caught between love for a good woman and the paralyzing fear of committment.  ""Notting Hill"" unfortunately approaches romance from a far more conventional direction, settling for wish-fulfillment fantasy rather than a more acerbic reality.  The trouble with ""Notting Hill"" begins, in fact, with its initial premise of the world's most beautiful movie star falling in love with a handsome but essentially average Joe bookseller in the Notting Hill section of London.  By creating such an unlikely setup, the film loses the emotional connection with the audience so essential to the success of a romantic comedy.  The contrivance at the movie's core makes it impossible for us to really identify with the principals and, thus, the movie devolves into little more than an exercise in play acting for the two leading characters.  This is a shame because Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant are certainly two of the world's most attractive and likeable stars and this role obviously seems tailor made for Ms. Roberts who carries with her the built-in aura of all that goes into being a world famous media celebrity. Perhaps, the stars are let down by the film's screenplay, which seems strangely devoid of real imagination and wit and the pace of the direction, which often allows comic lines to fall flat.  A scene, for instance, in which Grant, through a convoluted set of misunderstandings must interview other actors in Roberts' new movie, is deadly in its lack of comic freshness and timing.  The same can be said of a poorly written dissertation on the comparisons between some food Roberts is eating and Mel Gibson's much-exposed derriere.  Moreover, unlike in ""Weddings"", the secondary characters, who surround Grant and provide him with a running commentary of advice, come across as bland and witless and subtract rather than add spice to the central romantic proceedings.  ""Notting Hill"" does provide a few scattered moments of genuine humor and charm (Grant's being forced to attend a movie wearing his prescription deep sea goggles is hilarious), but the film often relies, stereotypically,  on sappy  montage sequences accompanied by a song-filled soundtrack rather than incisive dialogue to achieve a romantic mood.  ""Notting Hill"" simply does not ground its characters enough in reality to make us care.",Notting Hill
23,theowinthrop,Can a diffident and shy travel bookstore owner find happiness with the reigning female movie star?,10,13 December 2007,"With few exceptions that the public recall, both Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant have been singularly blessed in their film choices. My own recollection for Roberts was some unfair carping about her nice follow-up (with Richard Gere) to PRETTY WOMEN, RUNAWAY BRIDE. Basically a different storyline, the fans of the former film were confused by the nuttiness of the latter one. For Grant there has never been a negative comment about his films that I recall, but rather that embarrassing prostitute incident a few years back that really just showed that the actor was human. Both have a nice film charisma that makes their myriads of fans very happy. In NOTTING HILL the charisma of both mixed well on screen. It is a very sweet comedy.Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) is basically a clone of Roberts - she is a multi-talented and beautiful film star who is known around the globe. One day she is doing a ""Haroun - Al - Raschid"" act (like the Caliph in the stories of THE ARABIAN NIGHTS who goes in disguise among his subjects). She is doing some simple sightseeing and shopping in London's Notting Hill Section. She enters a bookstore specializing in travel books. It is owned by William Thacker (Hugh Grant), who lives in the neighborhood. Thacker's business is struggling along, with too many people coming in expecting it sells best-sellers (John Grisham) or classics (Dickens). He keeps correcting them about this.*(And the script writer makes a mistake - a minor one. Dickens, unlike what Thacker tells a stupid customer, did write several travel books: THE UNCOMMERCIAL TRAVELLER and PICTURES FROM ITALY are two of them.)Due to an accidental collision between the two in the street, Thacker invites Scott into his home to clean herself. He behaves with typical charm and care not to offend her. She leaves, but a moment later rings the bell again, and when inside kisses him. Later she leaves a message (that is nearly lost due to Thacker's idiot roommate (Spike - Rhys Infans)) to visit her at the Ritz Hotel in London. Thacker does see Scott, but has to pretend he is a movie reviewer for the magazine HORSE AND HOUND. He ends up asking questions to her and her co-stars about their latest film (which he knows nothing about), and how it relates to horses and hounds (it is a space epic, so it doesn't). But Scott and he go out together that night to a dinner party at Thacker's family's home.The film progresses like this, as we see the attraction between the two develop. Both are basically simple types, and the glitz of Scott's film reputation belies her feet on the ground approach to life - except for her fear about scandal. Like all celebrities she tries to avoid that shade of limelight that Holly Golightly says really ruins many girls complexions. This makes things difficult for Thacker's dating of Scott, as she frequently is aware of cynical comments made about her (watch the scene in the restaurant for this), and she has to also put up with hyped publicity stories such as her long standing relationship with a prominent film actor (Alec Baldwin in a nice single scene). Finally, she flees to Thacker after a couple of months, when she is facing an embarrassment over some nude photos and an old (secret) nude film that was shot of her. Thacker gives her what seems to be quiet and protection in his home, only to find that the press is tipped off. Scott is aware that while Thacker will be able to shrug this off in a short time, she will have the scandal of their relationship follow her for her life. She leaves him in anger.Will that be the end of the line for the lovers? I'll let the viewer see the film. Savor the performances of the leads who do fit well together, but also of Infans, who is the guileless dimwit who never realizes the long range results of his blunders. Yet in the end he proves to have more sense than Grant does in what to do about the relationship with Roberts.NOTTING HILL is a real charmer for the movie fan, and a rarity in the present age of angst and bloodshed in our films. I recommend it heartily.",Notting Hill
24,Lejink,Good for Notting,1,29 December 2014,"I'm sorry but I absolutely hated this sickly-sweet romantic comedy from the too-prolific pen of screenwriter Richard Curtis. It boasts, if that's the right word a wholly unbelievable plot about a mega-famous Hollywood actress (Anna Scott, played by Julia Roberts) escaping the trappings of stardom to naturally stumble into a London bookshop and promptly falling in love with its down-at-heel but of course down-to-earth and available mop-haired owner (played by who-else? Hugh Grant) and the ups and downs of their subsequent affair. Along for the ride are a motley crew of Grant's supposedly ""normal"" friends including Gina McKee and Hugh Bonneville and kooky characters like Grant's fated-to-be-mated hippy-chick sister, played by Emma Chambers and his painfully unfunny gauche flatmate played by Rhys Ifans.By-passing the ridiculous plot, the film's dialogue is excruciatingly awkward and strives so hard to be everyday and natural but instead comes off as stilted and cringe-worthy. The humour is as thin as ribbon-pasta and the acting painful to watch, almost as if the cast was embarrassed speaking this forced, supposedly feel-good nonsense. The worst example is when Grant profanes the phrase ""Shittety Wicketty"" at an exasperating moment, but there's plenty more dross where that came from.As for the playing, you can see everyone acting and a painful experience it is to witness. Mind you, you'd have to be Mary Berry to make writing as flat as this rise up. For good measure throw in a sappy soundtrack with Elvis Costello vacuously crooning the old Charles Aznavour hit ""She"" and a song by the even worse Ronan Keating, to make my movie-hell complete, while the only happy thing for me about the so-predictable happy-ending is that it was the actual ending of the film.For a so-called romantic-comedy, I found it uninvolving, unamusing and ultimately unwatchable. I'd resort to sarcastic clichés to complete my hatchet job but fear the movie used them all up by itself.",Notting Hill
25,ElMaruecan82,1999: the 'Year that Changed Movies' ... except maybe for romantic comedies ...,8,28 July 2013,"From Richard Curtis, the screenwriter of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""Notting Hill"" wandered through a labyrinth of cinematic conventions with such confidence I felt myself immediately absorbed by the story. Romantic comedies might not be my cup of tea, but not in Britain where tea is elevated to an institutional rank. And romantic comedy is not the easiest genre to handle; it has an obligation to reinvent new comedic and entertaining situations out of hackneyed material. For instance, as soon as the eyes of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts meet in the titular area, we know they're meant for each other and that they'll end up together. But we also know it won't happen before the last five minutes, so the reason-to-be of ""Notting Hill"" relies on the way it will delay each time the predictable resolution. And when it comes to rom-coms, it's on the 'how' factor that relies the effectiveness of all the 'aww' and 'wow'-feelings, they're meant to provoke.Like most romantic comedies, ""Notting Hill"" starts with two lonely hearts filled with good excuses for having lost faith in true love: an indispensable attitude to postpone the romantic epiphany. Julia Roberts is Anna Scott, a movie star, an object of admiration for women, of fantasies for men, and harassment from the Press and Tabloids.(and Britain is certainly not the safest place to visit when you're a celebrity of her caliber). And in the love department, Anna Scott had the kind of romances that would have made lousy Curtis' screenplays, when we meet her, she has 'naturally' a boyfriend, but 'naturally', it's not official. Nothing is.And Anna Scott is such an obvious alter-ego of Julia Roberts that her name doesn't fool us, there's no doubt about her autobiographical inspiration, if it wasn't intended in the beginning, at the end, no one can ever dissociate the fictional from the real actress, but this is definitely not a flaw. At one point, Anna even mentions the disillusion of her stardom and the artifices she had to undergo to earn her 15 millions for a role, and then there's this little sparkle that disappear in Julia Roberts' eyes, as if Anna became the vehicle of Julia's truth. And in the process, Julia Roberts brings so much sincerity to her role that our empathy is granted for her, as it's impossible not to forgive the attitude she displays with the poor, well- meaning William, played by Hugh Grant.Grant is a divorced man, running a modest travel bookstore, sharing a house with an eccentric and nonchalant roommate (Rhys Ifans) who keeps exposing his dirty soles on the table, something that would immediately cure from the most hardcore foot fetishism. By the way, I suspect the director Roger Mitchell for having quite an obsession with feet and after Rhys Ifans and Hugh Grant, I was glad we could have some glimpse on Julia Roberts'. Anyway, there is Grant as William, who despite all his misadventures, is still in love with Anna Scott. Nothing happens at their first encounter but a few minutes later, through one of the gutsiest plot devices ever written, he collides with her, spilling orange juice on her shirt, and a perfect excuse to invite her to his house, and when she kisses him, it's  well, didn't I use the word 'obviousness'?Yet, there's one obvious element that is handled perfectly: the supporting cast. If you believe that nothing could beat the joyful bunch from ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", wait till you see ""Notting Hill"". Now, that is a group that could have inspired a less insipid sitcom than ""How I Met With Your Mother'. We meet them during the first date between Anna and William coinciding with his sister's birthday: a lovable couple with a woman on a wheelchair, William's goofy airhead sister, a buffoonish stockbroker, they all make lovable losers (in the positive meaning of the term) genuinely supporting William and blessing his actions and decisions with the most cheerful approvals, with such friends, who'd even need a girlfriend? Except one like Julia  I mean, Anna Scott.William's friends contribute to one of the best written dinner scenes featuring a game in which the last piece of cake would be earned by the saddest story teller (not a piece of cake exercise).. And the scene provides some serious and tender moments proving that ""Notting Hill"" is more than your average romantic comedy. Indeed, while the two stars in the posters might be invitation for the most cynical expectations, ""Notting Hill"" tactfully and elegantly walks on the tightrope of its screenplay and never falls into the stereotypical schmaltz that could have destroyed it, even the so-called cringe-worthy line supposed to be the ""is it still raining"" of the film, suited the story. However, I noticed that the choice of songs seemed kind of out-of-place sometimes and. I was glad, after reading Roger Ebert's review that he also was annoyed by the 'Ain't no Sunshine' montage after the break-up. Who needs a song with 'when she's gone"" when we know what's going on? (By the way, I hope you won't take this as a spoiler, wouldn't you expect one break-up in a romantic comedy?)Perhaps regret on the redundancy of some situations, and the fact that Grant remains all stoical, never abandoning his British phlegm  seriously, when you know you love one person, would you take that much time before taking the big dive? Sometimes, one delay is one too much, or it betters leads up to a better conclusion. And I wouldn't have been that enthusiastic if the film didn't fulfill this premise, when it ends, it's a cheerful celebration, not overdone like ""Love Actually"", but with the right amount of positivity and tenderness, and the last shot is probably some of the best that ever concluded a romantic film.And thank God, they didn't think of putting ""Here Comes the Sun"".",Notting Hill
26,paul2001sw-1,Quality trowelmanship,7,23 November 2005,"I didn't want to like 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', but in the end, I just couldn't help it. Writer Richard Curtis is a master of situation comedy, and although manipulative and sentimental, the film was constructed with sufficient skill to force one to care for the characters, even when one's head might have been telling one to vomit. 'Notting Hill' is virtually a retread of the same film: there's another Curtis script, Hugh Grant plays an Englishman falling for an unavailable American, lashings of soppy music and moments of poignancy. Unfortunately, it's obviously not as fresh as its predecessor, and moreover the essence of the earlier film has been not so much replicated, as distilled into something almost unbearably trite and false. Grant's character Thacker, for example, is almost a parody of the one he played previously; he lives in a Notting Hill that can be considered (depending on your perspective) either stylised or racially cleansed; and although (unlike in 'Four Weddings') we do actually see how he earns his living (as a cute, inefficient bookseller) this in no way accounts for the quality of his life (for example, he owns a main door flat in central Notting Hill, which is not the average abode of an impecunious shop owner). Indeed, whereas in the funeral scene of the earlier movie, we at least saw that not all of the characters necessarily lived in the manner their fancy wedding attire might have suggested, in 'Notting Hill' all the heroes are sympathetically unmaterialistic and yet none seem to in any way be strapped for cash; even when one loses their job, and another's business fails, there seem to be no negative consequences, and no-one envies anybody else's success, either. It's as if each character has to be given problems to make them seem human, vulnerable and sympathetic, but these problems are not in turn allowed to puncture the essentially idyllic set-up. The scene where one of Thacker's friends, who is beautiful but paralysed, half-laughs off her disability (able to do this because of the depth of her husband's love for her), really does make one reach for the sick bucket in its mawkish conceit.Yet Curtis is just so good as writing this rubbish that I find I can't hate this film either, even though I should. There are some very funny jokes (although some lines seem virtual copies of those in 'Four Weddings'), and the romance is played by all with infinitely more skill than in, say, 'Bridget Jones Diary' (which also had a Curtis script, but which was infinitely cruder in its execution). It may all be laid on with a trowel, but the trowelmanship is the best in its class. So I find I have to give this film seven out of ten. Oh, well. Maybe I'll manage to hate 'Love, actually'.",Notting Hill

Julia Roberts effortlessly plays movie star Anna Scott (who may or may not be just a representation of who she truly is in real life) and Hugh Grant plays Will Thacker, just a bookshop owner who happens to meet Anna on a fateful day in Notting Hill.

Later, when the narrative voice-over returns, it works just fine. He's the consistent charming low-key Hugh Grant that we've seen in many films before, and if you don't like him, you should steer clear. If you do, here you go!Of course, there's Julia Roberts, too, and I find her completely fine, the dependable Roberts who really can't quite ""act"" but who is always likable and so acting isn't the issue. And to make it even easier, her role here is to be a huge mega-star actress. Which she already is. Voila, a perfect fit.The magic and romance that is meant to spark between the two leads isn't always convincing, but there is a sparkling kind of dialog between them, and among extended family, that keeps it going. There is some really sharp writing here.And there is some really stupid acting. The goofy roommate is just too goofy and caricatured for the rest of the cast, and he is given some of the weakest script to read, as well. The first appearance of Grant's family might strike you as forced, as well, but they gradually work their way into the film and are actually warm and very funny. I wish they had been larger and the roommate smaller in the plans.Director Roger Michell has a short resume, including a well-regarded ""Persuasion"" which didn't persuade me (I like Jane Austen too much, I think).

(Hugh Grant is pretty good too.)The movie is undoubtedly formulaic. From the moment Julia Roberts--Anna Scott, the most famous woman in Hollywood--steps into Hugh Grant's bookstore, we can pretty much predict how the rest of the movie will turn out. My comment about this is, ""So what?"" No one wants a romantic comedy with a sad ending, and no one wants to think about whether ""the most famous actress in the world"" could really enjoy life with a kind and gentle man who lives and works in Notting Hill.The movie has some real strengths: William Thacker (Grant) has a loving, lovable sister (Emma Chambers), and some great friends. The Portobello Road market and the Notting Hill section of London look colorful and authentic. London gleams in the sunshine, and the posh hotels look, well, posh. Most important, Julia Roberts is perfect for the part. The cliché is that the camera loves Julia Roberts. I would say instead that WE love Julia Roberts. The camera just transmits her beauty and charm so that we can appreciate it. Note: Watch for the lovely Emily Mortimer who plays ""Perfect Girl."" That is, she and William are brought together after Anna breaks his heart, and she would, indeed be perfect for him.

The central element of the film does not, therefore, nothing new. The cast, headed by Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, does a decent job. Most of them has very secondary roles, with the exception of Rhys Ifans, whose character is one of the greatest comic elements of the film.The two main actors are Roberts and Grant, whose characters have features that turn them into allegories of themselves. In fact, Grant's character, a quiet bookseller, discreet to the point of erasing himself, realistic skimming defeatism, is a perfect allegorical representation of the middle-class man, who hardens with each blow that life gives. Roberts character, a famous and successful American actress, represents very well the rich and famous of the magazines and television, with her hidden weaknesses, a total inability to lead an ""normal"" life and a overwhelming desire to have a good family and love life, with several disastrous attempts. To some extent, we can even question whether the two actors were not, almost, to be themselves, since they can recognize in their characters several characteristics of themselves. The history between them is, at least, unlikely: a chance meeting followed by an (even more) unlikely romance shows us that love can overcome all barriers, at least in theory.This romantic comedy, very pleasant and entertaining, is delicious in its details, deeply British and imbued with a strong spirit of self-criticism and irony.

Hugh Grant plays a normal guy who owns a travel bookstore in a tiny town called Notting Hill in London. He gives a surprisingly convincing performance in this role, and Julia Roberts is also excellent as the hugely popular Hollywood movie star because, whether you like it or not, she is a hugely popular Hollywood movie star. She plays the part of Anna Scott, the film star who happens to wander into William's (Grant) bookstore while in London shooting a film. One of the things that distinguishes this movie from other romantic comedies is the hesitant way that William and Anna grow to know each other. It's true that the whole oops-I'm-sorry-for-spilling-my-drink-on-you bit is not entirely original, but the good acting and directing made over-used material interesting again. By far the funniest character in the film, of course, is Spike, William's nut-case of a roommate (or `flatmate,' as William calls him). Some of the things that he did in the film are funnier than anything I've seen in years. For example, the way that he blows smoke through his nose into the snorkeling goggles, the way he mistakes mayonnaise for yogurt, or the scene where he finds out that William turned down Anna Scott (`You daft prick').
While the movie may be a little bit long for some people, and as a whole, it doesn't really present anything really new in the genre of the romantic comedy, it moves along so smoothly and is so entertaining and funny that it is more than worth the extra time. I think that the fact that I am personally not a fan of either of the main stars, and yet I thoroughly enjoyed the film, says something about the quality of the movie. An excellent date movie, for everyone from first dates to happily married couples, so don't miss it. Just be prepared to be sore from laughing so much.",Notting Hill
37,lisafordeay,A better than your average romantic comedy starring Hugh Grant,7,13 July 2015,"Notting Hill tells the tale of a man named William Thatcher(Grant)who's life is well let's say not that great. His gone through a divorce from his first wife and he owns a book shop that sells travel books(I swear the bookstore reminds me of the book store Meg Ryan was working in You've Got Mail opposite Tom Hanks)anyway one day however and a mysterious woman shows up looking at books. He asks her what would she like and she is very discreet to him and says she's fine. But when she leaves the bookstore he discovers that she is the famous American actress Anna Foster(Julia Roberts). And later bumps into her again as he accidentally spilled orange juice on her t-shirt,and from here on in an inevitably romance blossoms between the two of them. Trouble comes however when Anna's American boyfriend shows up(Alec Baldwin from 30 Rock)and it causes a stir on her relationship with William as well as the paparazzi spying on her as they found out she was sleeping with William. So will they,won't they get together in the end. Bottom line I haven't seen this movie in over 10 years since last night as it happened to be on TV and I decided to watch it again as I had it all forgotten. Julia Roberts is one of my favourite actresses of all time so any film she is in I have to watch it for her. Hugh Grant is well Hugh Grant in any film he is in. Boring,dry and just down right dull. But here he wasn't that bad in it. However him and Julia Roberts chemistry was kinda average to be honest. I felt that they were uncomfortable in this film,but it wasn't all that bad. But the show stopper here of course in Rhys Ifans(from The Amazing Spiderman as Dr Curt Connors)as Spike. He was hilarious in this movie and every time he appeared on screen he cracked me up. Also starring is the guy who I think was on a programme called Black Books and the man who played Glen Close's henchmen Tim McInnvery as Grant's brother in law.Overall I found it enjoyable and I recommend it to those who are a fan of Grant or Roberts.7/10",Notting Hill

He was in the vanguard of the resuscitated middle classes who gleefully began filling our screens in such self - regarding fluff as ""Four Weddings and a funeral"" . In ""Notting Hill"" he plays a Trustafarian who falls in love with a huge Hollywood Star who is so well - known that he doesn't recognise her. He owns a book shop so he can appear to be clever(probably an Oxbridge man)and wear glasses without seeming girlie.His flatmate is played by Mr Rhys Ifans who is apparently Welsh and clearly believes he is giving one of the great comedy performances.The huge Hollywood star is played by Julia Roberts in not the most taxing role in her career. His friends,trendy and liberal to a person,are just the sort of tossers you'd run out of ""The Ivy"" to avoid. The Notting Hill they inhabit is unrecognisable to any real Londoner, being - as the former D.G. of the BBC coined the phrase - ""Horribly white"" and totally unlike the vibrant culture - mix of the real area. Come Carnival time,Hugh and his chums would hotfoot it to the South of France for the duration,but still consider themselves ""street"". Who watches stuff like this?Quite a few people apparently,presumably those fans of Miss Roberts who found ""Pretty Woman"" believable,or admirers of Mr Grant who find anything he does believable.

One of those feel good movies you catch yourself watching every time you find it on TV. Good chemistry between Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant help carry this romance between an American movie star and a shy British bookstore owner. The sub actors are equally important here though especially 'Spike' the flatmate, hilarious, William's sister and his inner circle of friends.Robert's character is shy, stilted but what I also noticed this time is that she hurts William again and again, is just terrible to him and he remains charming...just nice, understanding. She does not deserve him.My favourite scene remains the market montage with the ""aint no sunshine when she's gone"" song and the changing seasons.

They made great chemistry as a couple! In my opinion, Anna (Julia Roberts) was a very charming and beautiful lady, and, William (Hugh Grant) was the same way. The only difference was the fact that he wasn't famous. When the loud men (Dorian Lough, Sanjeev Bhaskar, Paul Chahidi, Matthew Whittle) made fun of Anna in the restaurant, I wanted to kick their a****! This was because they were saying offensive and untrue things about her. I thought that Honey (Emma Chambers) looked very beautiful in the dress she wore when she first appeared. If you ask me, the funniest quote of this movie is, ""There's something wrong with this yogurt."" To me, Spike (Rhys Ifans) was really offbeat, especially when he told William that he didn't know where his glasses were, that is, until he realized he was sitting on them. That was pretty hilarious! In conclusion, I think NOTTING HILL is a great romance with beautiful music. You should see it if you are a fan or Julia Roberts or Hugh Grant.

43,davispittman,Just alright,6,26 April 2017,"Everyone I've talked to seems to absolutely adore this Julia Roberts-Hugh Grant romantic comedy. I don't really know why, I mean yes it has a few funny parts and no it's not terrible, but I don't really see anything that makes it stand out from the plethora of other romantic comedies. With romantic comedies, I don't usually require originality because I know you can't be too original with those films, but this one just wasn't interesting or entertaining enough to me. The acting isn't bad, in fact Roberts and Grant are pretty good in the movie, it's just other factors in the film that I wasn't so crazy about. The script is alright, to me there was nothing in the script that jumped out at me and really grabbed me, it was just okay, but the writing didn't inspire me to come back and watch this movie over again. Yes some of the humor was done well and there were several times where I laughed, unfortunately that alone was not enough to save the movie and make me recommend seeing it. I'll finish up by saying this. It's not a bad movie, you won't reach the end and say wow that was bad, but if you're like me then you'll come to the end and feel like you could've watched a better movie of that genre and been more satisfied. Notting Hill is just okay when it's all said and done. 6/10.",Notting Hill

47,triple8,Lovely airy romantic story where the scenery is as good a reason to watch as the plot.,7,31 March 2004,"Notting Hill is such an obvious warm, lovely airy romantic movie you almost don't want to say anything bad about it because of just how sweet it is. And actually, I don't have anything bad to say because I quite enjoyed Notting Hill. It was sweet, mildly funny, touching. However, the one of the best things about it was the scenery. This movie is so beautiful visually it's almost worth it, even if one doesn't get into the plot, to see it for the Gorgeus rolling hills and scenery in general. It was lovely. Lovely is definitely the word that comes to mind when viewing Notting Hill. It was pretty much almost exactly what I thought it would be going into it.As enjoyable a movie as this is, I wouldn't say it bowled me over. I liked, not loved it and have enjoyed other romantic comedies more although as mentioned, as far as cinematography goes it gets 10 of 10.The SECOND observation I wanted to make and something that I've noticed is lacking in other romantic comedies is -ENDING SPOILER 2)The end was UNUSALLY touching. Rather then, when the guy and girl eventually get together and the audience gets to see that 1 scene where MAYBE they kiss-this ending went on a minute or two and showed the couple's wedding, kids, walking the red carpet. I liked that. It was a nice change. To many other romantic comedies including Truly great ones don't do that-they end to abruptly-I liked, tremendously the scene where they get together at the end,at the press conference, it was very touching and the fact that they stretched the end a bit was particularly nice.Notting Hill, in my opinion has more pure romance in it then comedy but it's an excellent choice and a must see for any fan of romances in general.",Notting Hill
48,Sandcooler,Somewhat touching Hugh Grant flick,7,13 January 2011,"This movie basically just connects the dots between all the romantic comedy clichés, but at least it does so competently. The standard boy-meets-girl thing is as formulaic as ever, but this time around the actors make it work really well. I also like how the obligatory comic relief character is actually funny here, that's a luxury the average Hugh Grant film rarely has. Hail Spike and all his disgusting ways. Obviously the script is very predictable, and there are some scenes in here that are downright painfully corny (""I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy"" definitely comes to mind), but if you have to watch one thing that features Hugh Grant, there are plenty of worse picks that this.",Notting Hill
49,philip_vanderveken,"A really nice, charming and humorous movie.",8,12 October 2004,"Notting Hill is a very charming and humorous movie. It follows the classic pattern of boy-meets-girl, they loose each other but meet up again later. This could be so boring, but thanks to the humor used in this movie, it didn't annoy me once. The humor is typically British and perhaps not to everybody's taste, but I thought it was very funny.William Thacker (Hugh Grant) is the divorced owner of a travel-bookshop who lives and works in London's suburb Notting Hill. Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) is a very famous American actress who comes to William's shop to buy a book. While Roberts and Grant are wonderful in their roles, it is definitely the supporting characters that set this movie apart from others in the genre.Perhaps there are people who think this is a real girls-movie, but I'm a guy and I loved it as well. I gave it an 8/10. A really nice movie.",Notting Hill
50,bkrauser-81-311064,Carried Largely by Two Very Charming Leads,7,11 February 2016,"Watching Notting Hill I came to the realization that it's been a while since I have seen a movie that is so unabashedly romantic. Today's romantic comedies tend to add layers of cynicism in lieu of two people, on screen who actually have chemistry. It's like half of the rom-com industry has decided to pander to the eye-rolling, smartphone scrolling, shrugging indignation crowd. The other half cater to those who like their romance overcooked, contrived, and unbearably overwrought as to render them offensively outdated upon arrival.Thankfully Notting Hill falls into the latter category without wholly reaching Nicholas Sparks territory. Our protagonist William Thacker (Grant) is a normal, good-humored Brit who has a chance encounter with American darling of the screen Anna Scott (Roberts). Despite being consistently befuddled around the constantly on-guard ingenue, William manages to endear himself to her and they begin a charming little courtship away from the flashes of paparazzi cameras.Grant's character manages a struggling bookstore because in the late nineties and early two thousands screenwriters wanted to let us know how unfashionable books were. His shaggy-dog normalcy, quick yet harmless wit and his social circle of close-knit friends, endears him to the audience within the first few minutes of the movie. This is important because with the arrival of Robert's character it's as if a draft of arctic wind had assailed his life. Take away the moments where bit characters do a double take when she enters the room and you're left with a very cagey actress who Grant at first seems to admire because of her celebrity. She doesn't come across as endearing at first but slowly gains your trust throughout. As she slowly un-spools to a level the audience can commit to her struggles, Grant also begins to grow and change in unexpected ways. In the hands of other actors this movie might have been relegated to rom-com purgatory. Yet so much audience goodwill can be made with Roberts's winning smile and Grant's signature stutter.The secret to Notting Hill's success is its ability to play out the scene in a meaningful way and earn the audience's respect with well- formed characters. The central gaggle of friends played by Tim McInnerny, Gina McKee, Hugh Bonneville and Emma Chambers all have interesting backstories and aren't the one-dimensional boors we always see. The movie goes into a bit of a third act stumble culminating in that frantic ""mad dash to your lover"" sequence we've seen in every romantic comedy since Manhattan (1979). It's a shame too because everything leading up to that moment was organic and fun while not being too sweet.I didn't love Notting Hill but then again the film is not for me. Much like William's bookstore, the movie is for a special class of people who don't know or care that the world has left them behind. It's a piece of well glossed fantasy that has the ability to harken back to older movies such as Roman Holiday (1953) and The Shop Around the Corner (1940) only with updated stars and risqué humor. It's obviously a winning formula as proved by the film's enduring popularity. Give it a try if you're not completely callused by the prospect of love; otherwise there are other fish in the sea.",Notting Hill
51,krocheav,Notting Hill Review - Big On Little,3,15 March 2019,"If you're a hopeless romantic (as I tend to be) you may last the distance of this way overlong, crudish, fairytale. By the first 20mins I was getting somewhat restless and my viewing accomplice simply said, enough is enough, then got up and left. I waited to see if it got better - it didn't. Hugh Grant is typecast (or should that be miscast?) as the by the numbers coy, clumsy, bookstore owner - while Julia Roberts does her best to convince, as the poor-little-rich-movie star. Both have to deal with a forced, unrealistic, script by the same writing team of '4 weddings and a Funeral' (& it shows) with a dreary slow pace. Example; if you can swallow the idea that an International Mega-Star beauty, can walk unnoticed through the streets and shops of London - without attracting any Paparazzi! Or on the other hand, that a nobody, spreading a rumour one night in a local pub, can bring a street blocking avalanche of international press to an unknown 'private' address - then you might enjoy this outlandish 'would-be' situation comedy. Ms Roberts knows only too well, how impossible it would be for her character to get away with this super-stretched situation.It's amazing what star power can do to convince some audiences to part with their money. If you happen to be in the right starry-eyed mood (like; newly in love or just won the lottery) you could possibly be the right audience for this fluff - otherwise, don't expect too much, look for something worthwhile or just steer clear. If this is being touted as one the best romantic movies of its year - then, seems to suggest there may have been lean pickings on offer. As with too many movies of this era, the soundtrack is overloaded with unnecessary pop songs to fill in for gaps in dialog (and sell S/T CDs). To each their own.Best point; It offers a role for a disabled character to be shown in a positive light.",Notting Hill
52,m-47826,One of the best romantic comedies.,8,12 October 2021,"It is up there with Bridget Jones, The Holiday and Love Actually, to me. I think this Hollywood version of British cinema, works perfectly. And the two leads have a great chemistry. Late 90s London had this undeniable charm, and everything about this time period, is filled with nostalgia and carefreeness onscreen. Even the humor is to the point, and not too pushy. The corniness is a given to the genre, but in movies like these, it is done in an endearing way. The characters are flawed, but never annoying. Except maybe Jasper... Effective, and free of hidden agendas, aside from this harmless criticism on Hollywood and the « star system ». Notting Hill was one of those movies that made you escape for a moment.

Will Thatcher is a book store owner who one day meets Hollywood movie star Anna Scott and so her world of showbiz and excitement meets his lonely boring existence. The movie is well written and directed.Hugh Grant plays himself to an extent but I still love his nice guy persona. Julia Roberts simply lights up the screen with her smile and the rest of the cast provide much needed awkwardness and laughs.This film is very nice and will cheer you up even when you're at your lowest.

55,baumer,"Nads, this one's for you!",9,5 July 1999,"There is something almost surreal about a good movie.  If you like it, it can make your day, put you in a good mood or perhaps brighten your spirits for a time being.  But if it's really good, not only does it become a part of your life, but it almost becomes folk lore between you and your friends. Raiders of the Lost Ark was like that and although I'm not saying that Notting Hill will have legs the same way that Raiders does, it certainly is a movie that I and one of my very good friends named Nadia, won't soon forget.  Because I think in a way, although we were good friends before this film came out, Notting Hill added another level to it.  It gave us something that we could both quote, and then subsequently laugh at the same memories from the film.  And that is what makes film the great medium that it is. It can bring people together with a simple laugh or a tear that one shared together.  Notting Hill is definitely in the laughter category.  And for that we can completely thank the little known Welsh actor named Ryhes Ifans, who plays Spike.  Back to him in a few minutes.Notting Hill is the story of a simple man that leads an unspectacular life. Suddenly one day Anna Scott, the biggest film star in the world walks into his bookstore and changes his life forever.  They develop a relationship and from there we explore how they work together as a couple and the complexities that a major star must face if they choose to lead a normal life.The romance in this film is really one of its great strengths.  Hugh Grant comes off wonderfully as the man who can't get Anna Scott out of his head. He is the perfect mumbling man and that adds to his authenticity as a human. Think of Paul Reiser and even Woody Allen.  They often play similar characters and their believability is also one of their strengths.  And in here it is Grant's normalacy that gets some of the bigger laughs ( not the biggest though, that is reserved for Spike ).  Take for instance his scene in Anna's hotel when he is interviewing the cast and crew for her lastest film.  He does not realize at first that he is supposed to be a journalist and his questions reflect his ignorance towards the whole Hollywood scene.  It plays beautifully and it does a great job of playing with our funny bone. The assorted cast of friends that he interacts with also make for some great laughs.  But having said all that, let me just say that if Notting Hill was a story about a guy who falls for the most famous actress in the world and it stuck to that story line with no real attempt at humour in it, it would be a fine film.  But Notting Hill has one ace up it's sleeve and that is the character named Spike, which incidentally has kept Nadia and me laughing our butts off for months ( right Nads, not bad not bad! )Spike, as played by  Ryhes Ifans is electric.  Every scene he is in is a scene steeler.  He upstages everyone including Roberts.  By now I'm sure we have all seen the commercial when Spike goes out to greet the media and he flexes for the cameras.  That is funny in itself.  But what we don't see is his reaction to his stupidity when he comes inside.  He doesn't realize that he just made a fool of himself and frankly he doesn't care.  He looks in the mirror and admires his ""tight firm buttocks, nice choice of briefs because chicks dig the grey,""and he thinks his stomach is nice and toned.  If you really haven't seen this film you have to do so just to appreciate this scene and the rest of Spike's antics.  He really is hilarious.As I've said, this film is one of those films that you can stand around and quote with your friends from work, but it is also a great love story and the final scenes are happy ones.  And for all those reasons I say this film is great entertainment and it is worth seeing at least twice.And don't forget about Spike.  If he can start a friendship, think of what he can do to people that just want to laugh."" It's a vicious circle. """,Notting Hill
56,film-critic,Whoopsidaisies!,10,13 January 2005,"I first saw this film when it was released in May of 1999. I saw it as an instant love comedy classic combining the taste of Noel Coward as well as the subtle wit of Four Weddings and a Funeral. There was something original about this tale, something that just made the entire movie-going experience monumental. I was very impressed with both the talents of Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts, and newcomer (that would eventually make a name of his own) Rhys Ifans. I loved the modern fairy-tale story that Richard Curtis created (and would soon repeat again and again with success) and felt that the chemistry between Grant and Roberts could not have been done by anyone else. America's sweetheart coupled with Britain's poster-child was immaculate. This was a near perfect film that could be rediscovered again and again.Sadly, I still haven't bought this film, but when my wife and I chose to rent it the other day, I was curious to see if the emotions and excitement that I felt when I initially watched it would survive in the year 2005. Sometimes films have this uncanny habit of becoming dated and musty with age. The jokes seem to be less funny, the characters seem old (because Hollywood may have recycled them in other films), and overall the film just feels like 1999. As I watched this film again, the first time in several years, it became obvious early on that it did not age in any way. The jokes still had me rolling around in my chair with laughter, the quirkiness of the characters still redefined Britain, and Julia Roberts still shined in one of her best roles to date. It was impressive to see how well preserved Curtis was able to keep this body of work.The characters are what preserve this film so well. I do not think that Hollywood has ever recreated Rhys Ifan's Spike, and if it has it was not as memorable. Hugh Grant is an awesome screen presence with his quick tongue and insecure personality. I have always been a fan of Hugh Grant's work, and am constantly impressed with the resume he has built. Julia is, well, Julia. While some will argue that she plays the same character over and over again, I would have to agree. She is a typecast character, but in Notting Hill it works. She is supposed to play herself, and she pulls it off with the greatest of ease. I did not see this film as a stretch for Julia, but an opportunity to show the world what Grant has to offer. He successfully built this multi-dimensional character that believed in love so deeply that once it was given to someone, it could never be taken back. You don't see that sort of theme in the cinema today. Even the cheesy ""boy and girl"" line was not as bad as other films. I thought that it fit perfectly and gave Grant a reason to continue. Nothing could be as bad as ""You had me at Hello"". To see a cheesy romantic comedy last through time is due to the work of Richard Curtis' screenplay and some amazing (yet simple which is why this film works so well) direction of Roger Michell.Overall, I felt the story was bold and imaginative. The characters were played with so much respect and dedication that it felt almost real. It was a love story that has lasted the test of time due to the huge talent and simplistic themes. I laughed through this film again in 2005 just as hard as I did in 1999. That says something about a film if it can still evoke the same emotion nearly six years later. I am impressed with this movie, and with everyone involved. Go see it if you haven't yet, I know you will not be disappointed.Whoopsidaisies! Grade: ***** out of *****",Notting Hill
57,blott2319-1,Some bad choices hold this back from greatness,7,11 August 2021,"I'm a sucker for most romantic comedies, and I must admit that Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts are like a dream-team to star in a rom-com. I also adore the premise of this movie, because it naturally creates situations that will be humorous. Any time the mega-famous interact with ordinary people it is potentially funny, and I particularly love how Hugh Grant is constantly trying to downplay the whole situation. They also fill the cast with a number of hilarious characters that add to the laughs. The first dinner date that they have is easily one of the funniest scenes in a rom-com, and I love every minute of it, particularly when it gets dark for a moment and they know just when to surprise you with a joke. They do stretch the limits of believability a few times in order to manufacture more comedy, but I still think it works, particularly watching Hugh Grant stumble through media interviews in a movie's press junket. There's so much to like in Notting Hill that I almost feel like it should be one of my all-time favorites, but it isn't. So let's talk about why.First and foremost, I struggle a lot with the mean-spirited outbursts that Julia Roberts is given in the script. I feel like the massive difference in social status between the two characters is enough to create the kind of tension that is necessary to add that touch of drama required by any rom-com. But instead of relying on that, they crank her up to ten, and have her be downright vile to our protagonist. In the end, I struggle along with Hugh Grant's character to decide if forgiveness is the best course, because that kind of personality trait isn't going to just disappear. The other thing about Notting Hill that has always bugged me are the needle drops. I know this is going to sound like nitpicking because this isn't the kind of thing I ever notice, but it stands out like a sore thumb here. Every single song they plop into this movie is easily the most cliched or on-the-nose choice, and that rendition of ""She"" by Elvis Costello is nauseating. Aside from these bad choices, Notting Hill is a solid film, I just wish they tweaked it a little more to make it great.",Notting Hill
58,ODDBear,Charming romantic comedy,9,4 December 2005,"A fantastic movie, really. I found out you don't even have to be a fan of Hugh Grant (although I am personally) to really get the charm of this movie. Grant goes through all his usual stutters and silly manners but that's a thing he does very well. But Notting Hill doesn't have to rely on Hugh Grant alone, it's simply got a very witty and intelligent script by Richard Curtis (who later went on to write and direct Love Actually), fantastic British director Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral), Julia Roberts at her most charming and best and a bundle of supporting actors who are quite simply excellent.Despite a 2 hour running time the film's never overlong.

They've become familiar enough to us to enter the cultural psyche; I'm thinking of time-tested tales like Cinderella and The Prince and the Pauper, with ideals so simple and inspiring that even Disney cartoons can appropriate them. This also means that any movie that wants to tackle the issue is facing an uphill battle. In Notting Hill, we chuckle because of the sheer coincidence of the spilling of the drink, and because we know that little innocuous incident will spark so much more. But we also don't expect it to be that easy for Will and Anna - it wouldn't be a movie if it didn't wait up until the very last minute for the pair to truly realise what they mean to each other. The true strength of Notting Hill is how it lifts its characters out of these tried and tested archetypes. Roberts has all the makings of a glamorous Hollywood goddess, so we expect her to be a little high-minded, a little dismissive of the residents of Notting Hill, which has charm, but not the glitz of the Boulevard. Yet the movie resists the temptation to establish her as some snotty brat to be humbled by the family, to go through a re-evaluation of her entire life just because of a culture shock. One of the best scenes has her going toe-to-toe with Will's family, in dinner talk that is highly characteristic of British humour and self-depreciation, laced with the right amount of darkness. Anna is tender enough to join in on their game and open up a little about herself, but more importantly she also shares their ability of self-awareness and being able to laugh at herself. She's not merely a high and mighty aspiration for Will to strive for, but put through her own challenges, and though she may have millions, we come to understand that this does not mean her emotions can be easily discarded. This lovable bunch, reminiscent of another in Curtis' Four Weddings and a Funeral, are immediately likable because they feel like real characters, not merely bits of Will's modest, working class tapestry. They have real lives and struggles outside the window from which we view them through the film's plot, and we can see that they care deeply about each other. They might go wacko when they first meet Anna, a little starstruck as most might be, but also show their fierce loyalty to Will when they realise that he has been hurt and needs emotional support. One of the marvels of the Thacker family is in how their depiction normalises disability - Bella's condition slips into their stories, loves and jokes with ease, and we witness how the others adapt to it. It is accepted as a fact of life rather than something that defines her. So if anything it might be Will that is the weak link. Try as I might it's difficult to see him being so bogged down by heartbreak and situation. This is, after all, Hugh Grant at his peak, roguishly and lazily handsome, carrying himself with an aloofness and effortlessness about him like the wavy parting in his hair. He even has too goofy sidekicks at both home and work to accentuate his relative sanity. It's a pity that most of the men in Notting Hill are obnoxious, sex- crazed pigs, the most egregious intrusion being Alec Baldwin, who's unshaven and crass, and who all but sneers dismissively at the help before shoving his tongue down Anna's throat. The relationship is defined not by Will's own character, but rather how special and different he may be to all the other male suitors out there. He's modest in dress and tone, shacked up in a bookstore away from all the glamour and gossip of the world, and it is not him but her that initiates the sex instead.Anna, after all, is looking for that diamond in the rough that won't give her the concessions of a film star but treat her like an ordinary human being with flaws and weaknesses, and it's not an unfair request. Her characters are are exaggerated, over- the-top heroines, and all she wants is someone that realises there is a person behind those portrayals. And along the way we shake and bury our heads in our hands as they navigate the more typical conventions of the genre, and how the story inevitably twists their words and inserts convenient inconveniences to trip them up and try as hard as it can to tear them apart. It isn't immune from the dramatic confrontations and spillings of the heart of the rom-com; in fact it happens twice, and we can understand both perspectives. And the music cues are obvious and cheesy, these days borderlining on self-parody. But aren't they just part of the package? We go into Notting Hill expecting to be comforted and satisfied, and it delivers exactly what we want.",Notting Hill

62,The_Movie_Cat,Not the next great British movie,5,31 May 1999,"Notting Hill is much-touted by insecure Brits as the new ""British Movie"", yet - correct me if I'm wrong here - is made with American money. My theory is that Americans pay for shallow junk like this to make their own films look better. Notting Hill is a self-conscious comedy, with all jokes clearly sign posted, and all periphial characters ""wacky"" and ""zany"". There's Grant's crazy sister, overbearing mother and his effeminate employee. Aren't all us crazy English exactly like that? Well, no, not compared to the Welsh character, whose every line and pace is so predictable so as to bore off the screen.Writer Richard Curtis even gets in a bitchy dig at the film industry when Grant reads through Robert's (American) film part. Commenting on the writer, he double takes and changes it to ""writers"". Fine if your film is Citizen Kane, but when you've just written Notting Hill, it seems a little ill-advised to criticize others. Grant and Roberts do quite well in the midst of all this sub-realism, but at the end of the day Robert's character isn't that nice to begin with.",Notting Hill
63,harry-76,Nice Romantic Comedy,7,8 August 2000,"Leave it to those Brits for mastering wry humor.  Reminiscent of some of the early Alec Guinness comedies in timing and tone, ""Notting Hill"" strikes just the right amorous notes in this modern day farce.  Julia Roberts, looking lovely, and Hugh Grant, oozing charm, breeze through this lightweight, contrived but cozy romp with ease.  The two create a pleasant rapport, and the entire time spent in this engaging English community is delightfully diverting.  Makes one want to quench one's thirst with a spot of tea.",Notting Hill
64,fernandoschiavi,"With a lean script, perfect casting, solid direction and an abundance of charm and charisma, Notting Hill offers delicious moments of escapism",8,6 December 2020,"Notting Hill shows us an actress who is always surrounded by journalists and photographers interested in her personal life, someone part of the celebrity system who needs to feed the tabloids and the thirst of her fans. Owner of high fees, Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) travels to London, with a view to promoting her latest film, a work of science fiction. One day, she enters a bookstore in London's Notting Hill neighborhood. Received by the withdrawn William (Hugh Grant), a man who lives the hardships of the recent divorce. Soon, an attraction will be established between the two, in an interesting game of exchanges: she will need to enter the simplicity of William's world, a character that also needs adaptation to circulate in the meandering media of Anna Scott's celebrities.Fame does not seem to bring happiness to Scott, because even in the face of exorbitant wages, the actress does not show to be satisfied with her personal life. What attracts her to William, by the way, is the fact that he recognized her at the bookstore during the first meeting, but treated her normally, without the flattery common to the world of the famous. Thus, following the dynamic celebrity x anonymity, the film bet on chemistry between Roberts and Grant, one of the elements that made the box office success. Grant and Roberts embrace the film's proposal and show that they are a conquering couple. It is clear from the beginning how the film will end, but this is not a testament to its quality, because what matters is seeing how they both conquer, how they go through situations where they try to spend time together and also through samples of their respective lives. The sequence in which Thacker is mistaken for a journalist in a junket of an actress film yields the best comic moments of the feature, delivered at the right time by Grant, who hits, like few, the expressions of despair and discomfort that the situation calls for. In contrast, the sequence in which the actress is introduced to the protagonist's family provides first-rate comedy, with the varied reactions of its members when meeting a celebrity, while making a small comment about the difficulties and injustices by which women in this medium unfortunately have to pass.Incidentally, this is another good fit of the plot. A celebrity's life is not filled with roses and rainbows. It is full of elements that attack your psychological constantly, with consequences unconnected to the general public. Rita Hayworth once said: ""They go to bed with Gilda, but they wake up with me"", referring to her famous role in the eponymous film to say that she was no longer seen as a person, only as her character. This famous quote is used in the script in a simple and efficient way to humanize its protagonist.
It is not clear where the myth ends and the person of Anna Scott, actress character of the film, played by the real actress Julia Roberts, begins in a game of identities that we notice for the admired way that the camera captures that woman right in the opening sequence which will be the keynote of this romantic comedy, in which the impasse of the relationship of the main couple will then be to find an agreement between social / professional / artistic life and private life, between what is represented and what is. Of course, speaking in this way can misunderstand that Notting Hill is more complicated than its initial concept suggests, but it is not, and its grace is, moreover, in the fact of assuming itself as a genre film without any modesty, although its metalinguistic bias works, above all, so that the romantic journey of those characters, especially Roberts', is more interesting to follow. Yes, because the proposal to unveil the actress behind the spotlight, without script and without ready-made costume, makes the love story of the protagonist couple not only marked by romanticism, but mainly by discovery. Naturally, this demystification of Anna Scott throughout the film will yield those moments of greater humor, as she, in order to live the relationship with her partner (Hugh Grant), understands that she needs to adapt to ordinary and average life, and for that you need to dodge the flashes and the microphones, and our interest in this change would not be the same if Julia Roberts did not incarnate this role, lending Anna the actress a little incomprehensible star charm and Anna woman with a charisma and delicacy baffling.The supporting cast plays a key role in the plot. From Will's friends and family to Anna's business people and agents, and even Alec Baldwin's brief participation as the rude boyfriend, everyone acts in perfect harmony to strengthen the couple's romance between their comings and goings. It would be a sin to criticize Notting Hill without mentioning the famous passage of time during a sequential plan in which Will is walking through the streets of his neighborhood. As we follow the protagonist's depressed gait, time passes slowly and we discover this through the changing seasons and interactions of the extras.The screenplay is by Richard Curtis, responsible for ""Love Actually"" and who also collaborated with Grant on ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". It is clear that the actor fits perfectly in the tone of the writer's works, full of charm and charm. It is a film with a standard structure, with all conflicts and climax in the right places, interspersing the story of the protagonists with other groups. The difference is that all the characters are treated with respect and there is an interesting contrast between them: a nucleus is ""too realistic"", with a complicated drama; the other accompanies ""exotic"" people, bordering on slapstick comedy.Romantic comedy films are changing. They needed to change, adapt to our time, how and where relationships start, how they happen and, well, how they end as well. But Notting Hill is timeless for betting on an absurd, almost impossible premise. With intelligent dialogue and development and the best possible cast at the right time. It is impossible not to delight in the tone of the work, which leaves that feeling of well-being in the spirit during the entire exhibition time. Roger Michell's direction may not be innovative, but it is efficient and maintains full control of the pace. Curtis chose Notting Hill as he lived there and knew the area, saying, ""Notting Hill is a melting pot and the perfect place to set a movie."" This left producers to film in a densely populated area. The difficulties in filming in the neighborhood itself were immense, due to the large number of people who pass there daily. However, the decision to face the challenge proved to be right, resulting in a vivid, real, palpable and full of personality Notting Hill, fitting well with the proposal to illustrate the London of the film as an attractive place with a certain magic in the air.
The original song was composed by Trevor Jones. A main score was written and excerpts were used throughout the film. The score was divided into two songs for the soundtrack (Will and Anna / Notting Hill). Several additional songs written by other artists include Elvis Costello's cover version of Charles Aznavour's ""She"", the remixed version of Shania Twain's ""You've Got A Way"", as well as Ronan Keating's specially recorded cover, "" When You Say Nothing at All ""; the song reached number one on the British charts. Pulp recorded a new song ""Born to Cry"", which was released on the European version of the soundtrack album. The song played when Will goes down Portobello Road is Bill Withers' ""Ain't No Sunshine"". Tony and Bernie play ""Blue Moon"" on the piano at Tony's restaurant the night it closes. Originally, Charles Aznavour's version of ""She"" was used in the film, but American audiences of test screenings did not respond to it. Costello was brought in by Richard Curtis to record a cover version of the song. Both versions of the song appear in non-American versions.Notting Hill won the most popular film audience award at the BAFTA in 2000 and received three Golden Globe nominations in the categories for best comedy or musical film, best comedy or musical actor for Hugh Grant and best comedy actress or musical for Julia Roberts. Balanced and passionate, Notting Hill is yet another romantic comedy in the dramatic trajectories of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts and screenwriter Richard Curtis. Under the medium direction of Roger Mitchell, the film does not bring anything new, but as already mentioned in other reflections of the genre, it capitalizes well on ideas already worked on. Compared to the also attractive Four Weddings and One Funeral, the viewer will notice that there are quite similar scenes, something that borders on self-plagiarism, as Curtis also scripted the successful romantic comedy in 1994. With a lean script, perfect casting, solid direction and an abundance of charm and charisma. It is one of the most delicious romantic comedies that exist, offering delicious moments of escapism.",Notting Hill

NOTTING HILL adds a little spice to the usual and has a little more flavor than the typical romance movie.Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts, Rhys Ifans, Tim McInnery, Gina McKee, and Emily Mortimer are all pretty decent here. The film is certainly nothing special, but it is quite entertaining and has some genuine laughs in it for once, as some of them are pretty crude and will most likely strike the fancy of any crude humor fan.

67,Atreyu_II,The peculiar British humor,7,9 March 2008,"It really doesn't matter if ""Notting Hill"" is taken too seriously or not. It is an okay romantic comedy. I mean, without being a great movie, at least this is entertaining enough and something that can be watched without much bad surprises. Although it contains some vocabulary of discussable taste, it isn't profane at all and doesn't contain dirty humor, unlike ""Frankie and Johnny"" and ""There's Something About Mary"", which makes this a much more intelligent movie.""Notting Hill"" is one of those movies for people who appreciate the particular British sense of humor. British humor is a full plate, let's face it. This movie, when it comes to humor, romance and simplicity, is at the same level of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Bridget Jones Diary"", which makes it a good alternative to these movies.The characters here are interesting and humorous, without being great. Hugh Grant does a great job as William Thacker, as well as the guy who plays Max. However, the actor who portrays Spike is who makes this movie so hilarious. Spike is so goofy, so silly and so humorous - congratulations for the actor who played him, 'cause he did a perfect job for this kind of role.Julia Roberts, on the other, is okay as Anna Scott but not exactly great. I don't sympathize very much with the character she plays here. I mean, she only goes to William when is convenient for her, she uses him, leaves him and does other things that break his heart. They shouldn't have stayed together at the end, because she doesn't deserve him. I know, it's just a movie, but I feel bad for William, he deserves someone much better than Anna Scott.Overall, a movie which is nothing spectacular or to be taken very seriously, but made just for fun. And it has a nice soundtrack too.",Notting Hill

69,rebeljenn,"a bittersweet romance, powerful and emotional",6,20 February 2006,"Those who look for a story about bittersweet romance need look no further than 'Notting Hill', starring the ever-handsome English Hugh Grant and American star, Julia Roberts. Hugh Grant's character is an ordinary man who lives and owns a travel bookstore in Notting Hill. He falls in love with celebrity actress (played by Julia Roberts) who happens to come into his store. She then leads him on a wild chase and ultimately breaks his heart while he is trying to win her over. But, like other films in this formula, there is a happy ending.'Notting Hill' is very British in style, and it has that sense of Hugh Grant-esquire humour. Then, there is his Welsh flatmate, the odd sister and odd dates, and the embarrassingly-funny and confessional press conference. It is easy to feel sorry for Hugh Grant's character, and this film does play on the tenderness. It also does not take itself too seriously by offering the humour, mainly at shy Grant's expense. There's also some fast-paced action at the end, and it is feel-good because it brings all of the characters together. Talk about team-work. I'm not a fan of this genre of film, but I did enjoy 'Notting Hill'.",Notting Hill

71,tonypeacock-1,"Surreal, but nice!",8,15 February 2019,"Notting Hill is a romantic comedy or rom-com from 1999 made by a successful production company (Working Title) and written by an equally successful screenwriter of the time, Richard Curtis.The team had been behind another successful rom-com of the 1990s, Four Weddings And A Funeral.It is as the title unoriginally suggests set in the Notting Hill area of London. An affluent area some would say yet at the same time home of immigrants and the annual carnival. It is also the home of a bustling market. I digress!Back to the film. Anyway, Hugh Grant plays a travel book shop owner William Thacker who lives within walking distance of his shop conveniently. A shop that isn't particularly financially successful.Grant has a couple of failed marriages to his name and lives in a terraced house with a rather scruffy, yet likeable Welsh lodger Spike (Rhys Ifans).The film has all the traits of the rom-com film at hand. You could say it is split into three distinct acts:
1. Boy Meets Girl
2. Boy loses girl
3. Boy wins her back and everybody lives happily ever after!The boy in question is really a man, Thacker! Although Grant plays Thacker with his usual rather tedious surreal but nice attitude. He's done it in several of his films before and after.The girl, or lady is successful Hollywood actress Anna Scott played by Julia Roberts.
Now the meet-cute scene is classic rom-com staple. Scott is in London and happens to browse the bookshelves of Thacker's book shop. Although his initial attempts at link-selling leave a lot to be desired!All I can explain about the scene is surreal but nice!Grant struggles against the media frenzy that follows Scott and her movie enterouge, at one point pretending to be from Horse and Hound magazine!Thacker introduces Scott to his wacky relatives/friends at dinner. The supporting cast here includes the likes of Hugh Bonneville.Now there are obstacles to the relationship developing. Not least the fame and 'adulation' that follows Scott at every turn. The media frenzy and tabloid revelations about old videos.The obstacles also come in the form of a supposed relationship with a fellow actor, cue a cameo by Alec Baldwin.Scott seemingly has little independance but shows Thacker a good time. In one scene breaking into a Notting Hill square garden over locked railings whilst Thacker struggles ala Alan Partridge!The casting is a high point of the film. Grant is a regular at these roles throughout his career and Roberts probably had her most successful role to date in Pretty Woman.Rather than a gay best friend, Thacker confides his concerns to his relatives/friends including Ifans who is funny as Spike.
Now Thacker loses Scott whilst she faces her media demons and cross Atlantic way of life.Cue a musical montage scene where Grant walks through the Notting Hill market to his shop through several changing seasons to depict the passage of time. For the musical geeks out there the track in question is Ain't No Sunshine by Bill Withers.
The soundtrack also features some brothers Gibb input and Ronan Keating.Thacker faces his moment of despair around the 3/4 point of the movie toward the end of the second act.The final act sees Grant racing through London traffic aided by his friends to reach Scdott's latest press conference at the Savoy Hotel. Horse and Hound is back!
The inevitable outpouring of love occurs and Thacker and Scott appear to live happily ever after!",Notting Hill

There were several funny scenes at the beginning, and Hugh Grant did a great job of making the humor work.  Then, things bogged down.

Without funny moments to keep me interested, the film crawled along, and I was very relieved when the obvious conclusion finally took place.  Don't expect too much from this movie.",Notting Hill

He brings some very much needed brevity to the proceedings and loves his jocks to show off to the media Julia Roberts acting is e Screenwriters dream Richard Curtis's (""Four Weddings And A Funeral"") goal this time around seems to be a sharp satire of the Hollywood starlets and their psychotic relationships with the public and themselves, and the old wacky English humour we've come to expect from any film with Mr. Grant. It's a very odd mixture of the audience-pleasing easy comedy and something more sinister - possibly due to both lead's past public lives. so as they meet Williams friends and family they cant believe who he brought to a family party so she is ordinary like everybody the romantic music soundtrack is very good to deal with offset of their story as it goes has a lot to say about fame and the effects of it on a life. It never bothers to take a stand or really explain if Roberts's character embraces her super stardom or is oppressed by it. Screenwriter Curtis makes compelling arguments for both sides of the debate but strays away from truly looking deep within their souls When you think about it, William was a fan of Anna but was worried that the fame thing would have an effect on him ""Notting Hill"" is an extremely charming film with so much love to offer. 7/10 and its perfect date night film .",Notting Hill

It's as close to perfect as you can really get, I just wish they could have explored the background characters a little more. I enjoyed Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts performances so much however that I can forget about those background characters very easily. My favorite sequence in the entire film is when Hugh Grant is walking through Portebello Road and the seasons are changing.

76,braddugg,I liked it but not to the extent that I love it.,4,7 September 2014,"I liked it but not to the extent that I love it.It's a good film, a fun watch but it's clichéd in dialog and screenplay. It relies heavily on the two leads, Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts. Though Julia Roberts as Anna Scott does her part with ease, Hugh Grant as Will Thacker seems to be shaky, and uncomfortable. Also, its way too long with a running time of more than two hours for something that a very light romantic comedy. Editing lacks hold in an otherwise well written film. But the dialog ruins the well written scenes by putting some mediocre lines that were extremely predictable by me. I felt, this film did not have the charm of romances like ""When Harry Met Sally"" or ""Love Actually"". The chemistry between Julia and Hugh though made up for most flaws, it did not cover them well enough. Just an exampleWilliam Thacker: I've opened Pandora's Box! Spike: I knew a girl named Pandora in High School once...Never did see her box though!If such jokes make you laugh and smile, then this movie is certainly for you. For me, this was a very poor joke and I could not buy such jokes. The sad part is the film is filled with such lines and that is why I did not like it much. For sure, there are good aspects in terms of production. But with such actors at the helm and budget taking a toll, those things are expected too. Writer Richard Curtis seems to be a good one at slapstick comedy and slick dialogs but what he is not is mastering the same and adding a touch and flavor of his own. The same ""I love you"" can be said in innumerable ways but it has to be one that will be attractive and has it's own place in the hearts of the viewer. I am going with 2/5 for this. Though its a very well made romantic comedy. It lacks that specialty of becoming greater than a normal film. I am also skeptical if this will stand the test of time either.",Notting Hill

78,Rickting,Not Richard Curtis' best movie but quite sweet,6,27 April 2015,"Hugh Grant, a man who has a fairly rubbish love life and owns one of the worst bookstores ever has a romance with a hugely famous film actress. Richard Curtis, ever the feel good rom com maestro, launches another sugar covered love story at us with this irresistible premise. Sure, it's ludicrous, but for many this will be just escapist as many of today's blockbusters. A perfectly cast Hugh Grant plays the bookstore owner, and an even more perfectly cast Julia Roberts plays the actress superstar. Together, they're a dynamite romantic couple, although the film around them lacks a bit. In stark contrast to the giddy laughs of Love Actually, the loopiness of About Time and smart, razor sharp wit of Curtis' crowning achievement Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill is a bit dead. It's not particularly funny with Curtis' jokes falling flatter than usual and the film drags itself out over 2 hours, which really wasn't necessary. It's more dull than other Working Title films and populated with many offensive British caricatures. Normally Curtis' eccentric, bumbling British middle class citizens are entertaining but here it's just a bit offensive and also not very funny.NH has its many dips, but is made more enjoyable by its leads. Hugh Grant is very likable as the main character and while he's pretty much playing the same character he did in Four Weddings, he does it very well. In fact, possibly even better. Julia Roberts is the complete star of the show and she's aggressively likable as the Hollywood superstar actress, but more importantly she brings a vulnerable, insecure side of her character out too. Despite the lack of effective humour, the film is undeniably charming and the film is very uplifting and is also an original rom com. Emotionally, it more or less delivers for all of its characters and thankfully this time Curtis actually includes a bit of conflict in the story, something which is mostly absent from his other movies. It's not a great film and can be fairly dull at times, although to be fair it's possible Richard Curtis was aiming for a different tone. A decent rom com; not as fun as other Working Title films, lowered by a lack of laughs, irritating secondary characters and overlength, raised by a decent amount of emotion, good acting and decent direction.6/10",Notting Hill
79,grendelkhan,"Charming, If Slightly Improbable Romance",8,30 November 2014,"Writer Richard Curtis set out to answer a question: What if I showed up to a regular get-together with friends, accompanied by the World's Most Famous Woman? This is his answer. Hugh Grant plays a bookshop owner, in Notting Hill, who lives his life within a very small area. Of course, as these things go, he has a chance encounter with Julia Roberts, who is stretching her acting muscles by playing a famous, superstar actress. After an awkward first encounter, a series of events lead to a slightly more charming, if improbable second encounter. From there, an incredulous, and rocky romance develops.As with four Weddings and a Funeral, the film is largely a series of sketches, driven by dialogue between the characters. Curtis excels at this kind of stuff and his scripts have memorable exchanges. Perhaps his plots are a bit far fetched, though stranger things have been known to happen. They do tend to tread a bit on a romantic fantasy of life; but it is a romantic comedy, after all.The cast are first rate, with Hugh Grant returning to the Curtis world as yet another charming, awkward man. He can pretty much play this part in his sleep. Julia Roberts plays a version of herself, though with a bit of tweaking here and there. The rest of the cast are filled with terrific character actors, including Curtis alumni Tim McInnerny (Black Adder series) and Emma Chambers (Vicar of Dibley), as well as newcomers Gina McKee, Hugh Bonneville, James Dreyfuss and Rhys Ifans. Curtis knows how to write character pieces and these actors make music of his writing.It's easy to pick apart the reality of the film, that a famous actress would find true love with an ordinary guy that she, literally, bumped into; but, the scenario is so wonderfully done that you don't really care. The chemistry between the leads makes you forget the plot holes and the rest of the cast create an atmosphere that would be attractive to anyone, famous or not. It doesn't have a huge laugh quotient, but peppers the film with some really great comedic moments to keep you amused, while it charms you and brings a tear or two to your eye (like the scenes at the park bench, or when Roberts is in Grant's shop, begging him to forgive her). You can dismiss it as forgettable fluff; but, chances are, you'll be swept up in it, even if it's for just a little while. That's what movies do.",Notting Hill
80,MattBrady099,A enjoyable Romance movie,6,23 January 2015,"Anna Scott: ""Here sit down. Have some tea, these lots to see"".Notting Hill is about an unassuming, unimportant bookstore owner in Notting Hill becomes friends with Anna Scott, the world's most-loved actress. But as friendship turns to romance, the fame and attention, not to mention an American actor, threaten to destroy their relationship.Okay I have to be honest here but Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts never stood out to me in they movies. I don't think they terrible actors or anything like that, it's just that they performance in they movies I never thought it was groundbreaking or pure greatness, just okay and nothing else. And now both of them are in Notting Hill and I can positively say that I thought both did pretty good in this movie.The chemistry between Grant and Roberts was sweet and well written. Yeah it was cliché and I could predict what was going to happen next and normally I hate it when I could predict the relationship and all the drama in a romance movie, but in this it didn't really bother me that much. Because of the great acting and good character development that stopped me from hating the movie completely.I actually was surprised how much I laughed during this movie. The side characters or the supporting characters to those people would like to say, but anywhere the side characters were pretty damn funny and give a lot of funny lines. Rhys Ifans in this movie was the true comic relief of this movie. He stole every scene he was in. For problems there only are some: Has I said before about the romance cliché thing and how Grant and Roberts chemistry stopped me hating this, well towards the end of the movie it went so cliché I won't lie I rolled me eyes. The scene that stuck out to be the stick in the mood cliché is towards the end were Grant and Roberts have this big fall out and you see them feel sad and they missing each other but they don't want to admit it, but one of them finds out that he or she was wrong and goes chasing after the girl or men of he or shes dream. That right there is the biggest cliché that still been used today and I don't know why that cliché has to be the worst. Notting Hill overall may turn people off by the has I said before those annoying cliché but let's put that a side and look at the movie fully. The movie has some good chemistry and good acting. This isn't like any other romance movie out there, and what I mean is that this movie didn't make me mad and that's so rare for me.",Notting Hill
81,SKG-2,Not as good the second time around,7,9 June 1999,"Perhaps it is unfair to compare this film to FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, even though the writer and star of that film(Richard Curtis and Hugh Grant) have re-teamed for a similarly-themed romantic comedy(English man falls for American beauty who may be out of his league).  And I don't think Grant has played the same the same character over and over again(there's not much in common between his roles in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, SIRENS, and EXTREME MEASURES, for example, not to mention AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE).  But he certainly does a carbon copy of his performance in FOUR WEDDINGS here. Worse, while he was able to display a range of emotions in that film, and even get in on some of the film's funny bits(the best man speech), here, the only emotion he's allowed to display is wistfulness, and a little of that goes a long way.  You just wish that he'd get angry once.Julia Roberts fares a little better, though she's underplaying as if she expected she'd have something much more raucous to play against.  She of course is playing someone who has to have a facade on at all times, but she does get to show other facets, like petulance(when the others around her are saying how miserable their lives are, and she feels left out), humor(when she shows up a group of diners talking about her as if she was a whore), and anger(when the press shows up outside Grant's door).  Still, I wish the satire on movie stars' lives had been more pronounced; what's there is good(the press junkets, the discussion of stunt bottoms), but I was left hungry for more.Oddly enough, the most blatant copy of FOUR WEDDINGS - the friends Grant has - is the part which worked best for me, because at least the people their had personalities to express, and they never let the sentimentality get too heavy(when one of them is in a wheelchair, you prepare for the worst, but Emma Chambers(I think she's the actress) deflects that by never playing for pathos).  Also, Rhys Ifans steals the movie, and it sorely needs him. Overall, not bad, but could have been better.",Notting Hill
82,AKS-6,Fine romantic comedy,7,31 October 1999,"First of all, I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies. Sure, I adore ""The Wedding Singer"" and a few other films, but I'm not exactly interested in the next ""big"" romantic comedy. However, there are a few movies belonging to this genre that are so charming that I can't resist them. ""The Wedding Singer"" is one of those, as is this film -- ""Notting Hill"". It's very funny and it's very romantic. I saw it for the second time tonight and I liked it even better than I did the first time. Hugh Grant is absolutely adorable, Julia Robert's character is charming. Some of the scenes (e.g. ""The Horse & Hound""-scene) are absolutely hilarious. This is a much better film than Richard Curtis's ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", and it's a masterpiece compared with the other Roberts-film ""Runaway Bride"".In short, ""Notting Hill"" is a fine romantic comedy with appealing performances by the two leads. (7/10)",Notting Hill
83,Angeneer,Take it for what it is,7,21 October 1999,"Looking for a ""date movie""? This is the one. A pleasant, sweet and charming love comedy, for two relieving hours. I guess it doesn't take itself too seriously anyway so I won't be too harsh against it. Two beautiful actors involved in an intimate affair and all the rest of the supporting cast adding to the comic relief. I loved Hugh Grant's lines, every single word was perfectly chosen to add to the wit and attractiveness of his character. I didn't like the plethora of close-ups of the two leads, they made the film look like a photo shoot of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts. Okay we know they're good looking but please! In conclusion, it is light entertainment but it is actual entertainment and not all films are nowadays, so it's worth seeing.",Notting Hill
84,bbewnylorac,Not bad but too long,7,29 January 2014,"I love screenwriter Richard Curtis's affectionate way of creating characters, and his witty scripts. Julia Roberts gets good directing support here, and puts in her best role since My Best Friend's Wedding. Unlike that movie, when her character was quite dark, here she is very much playing herself -- a rich movie star on vacation, albeit a bit down in the dumps at first. She must have found it interesting virtually playing someone in her own real life world -- doing press interviews, dodging the paparazzi, trying to have a personal life and making wry comments about plastic surgery and obnoxious co-stars. Curtis puts in interesting lines for her (and presumably Roberts didn't object) for her character, such as wryly stating she's earning $15 million for one film, which is very bold, but quite accurate for someone like Roberts. Hugh Grant plays Hugh Grant, but hey, it is quite an attractive character, and he is believable as a book shop owner. As usual for Curtis, the supporting cast are not just bland faces -- they're real characters with their own good and bad points. However Curtis does tend to make them all a bit too lovable and winsome and kooky. But it is a comedy. I loved Grant's flatmate, the skinny Welsh eccentric. All in all, a very likable film. The big complaint I had was, it was too long. It was 'boy gets girl, then loses, then wins, then loses...' when it should have wound up in half the time.",Notting Hill
85,PyrolyticCarbon,"Just a bad remake of Four weddings and a funeral, with worse acting.",4,16 October 2002,"It could have been a nice film, if not for the following faults. The cheesy, laboured dialogue of the Hugh Grant character, where he says the stupidest things possible, and acts in the most inane way that leads to loosing the girl on multiple occasions. I mean, at times it's so out of character, and so idiotic, that you are almost grimacing and shouting at the screen! Also, something I couldn't understand, is if the housemate had behaved as badly as he had throughout the film, through his entire stay there, Grants' character would have kicked him out long ago. Julia Roberts is great in this film, and looks the best she ever has, and I'm not that much of a fan, but she looks gorgeous here. However, that does not make it worth going to see, or even hiring out to watch. Miss it, and loose nothing. It is, after all, a bad remake of Four Weddings. Just slight circumstance changes.",Notting Hill
86,TaylorYee94,Hugh Grant's eyes just speak every romantic line itself.,8,6 October 2021,"Roberts was a well-loved sweetheart by everyone, and Grant was a sweet English Gentleman just much as the sky is blue and grass is green. Two actors delivered what the director and the writer asked for 100%. Richard Curtis was Richard Curtis again in 'Notting Hill'. Lines are very realistic like the ones you can hear from the conversation of a couple sitting next to coffee shop or something with a humor added on the side. Even though the setting of a world-famous actress falling in love with a stranger from a bookstore in a foreign country is surreal, exchange of lines brings the story down to Earth. Moreover, you have to admit lines are adorable and romantic as heck. 'I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her' is the best romantic film quote and so applicable in real life not just in drama. William telling Anna ""You are lovelier this morning than you have ever been"" after first night just makes many girls' heart melt.",Notting Hill
87,roghache,"Sparkling fairy tale romance, film star meets ordinary bookseller",8,16 March 2006,"Whether or not realistic, this is a wonderfully touching fairy tale like story of the romance between two people of unequal social and financial standing. The beautiful, rich, and famous American movie star is superbly captured by the incomparable and always endearing Julia Roberts, who brings such a wonderful vulnerability to her roles. Hugh Grant is perfect as the shy, stammering, bumbling, unassuming, obscure, and not very affluent London bookseller, who shares a flat with his zany, weird roommate, Spike.The tale revolves around the world's most famous actress, Anna Scott, who visits a Notting Hill travel bookshop and thereby meets the very ordinary British bookseller, William Thacker. Improbable as it might seem, the two fall in love despite the fact that Anna already has a 'significant other' in the form of the obnoxious star, Jeff, who treats her poorly. Alas, Anna and William's romance is of course subject to hounding by the ubiquitous media, making the course of true love definitely not run smooth.Just an aside, but did the screenwriters get Hugh Grant's character's name from the Victorian novelist, William Makepeace Thackeray? It seems quite a coincidence. Ha, ha. Anyway, nice name...The film does a marvelous job conveying what must resemble Julia Roberts' own fishbowl life, subject to constant media scrutiny and innuendo. She must have identified strongly with the character she was playing, not only the media nuisance but also the failed relationships so common among film stars. Her hounding by the paparazzi is also of course reminiscent of that plaguing the late Princess Diana, and of course, sadly, resulting in her death.The portrayal of William's friends is very touching here, as their reaction transforms from understandable awe at socializing with such a famous star, to accepting and treating Anna as basically an ordinary person and good friend. The viewer gets a sense of how much this response, this genuine friendship means to Anna. One of William's friends is a disabled wife in a wheelchair. Her normal, ordinary life and attitude are well captured and would be well received, I believe, by viewers with physical disabilities.The love story is beautifully depicted. The sadness of Anna's failed past romantic involvements is conveyed, and despite the fame, her vulnerability as being really just 'an ordinary girl in love with an ordinary boy'. The portrayal of William is touching, as he copes with all the media attention, sees the actual person behind all that fame, wealth, and glamour, and tries to give Anna the genuine security and the 'ordinary life' she so desperately craves. A fabulous, moving, and ultra romantic film with a relevant message regarding modern society's perception and treatment of its movie stars. We can all learn a lesson here.",Notting Hill
88,Rammstein-2,Nothing like a British comedy,9,27 January 2000,"No one can match the British comedy. Take ""Notting Hill"", and compare it with any American counterpart, like ""You've Got Mail"". That is a great movie, and I loved it. But ""Notting Hill"" is just over-the-top.British comedy has a special ingredient that Hollywood has yet to appreciate: tragedy. There is often a tragic background to the funny events and characters - just have a look at ""The Full Monty"", one of the best films of the 90's. It's basically tragic. The seriousness of the situation and the grief involved makes it sting - and that's what makes it so good. I really can't see any tragedy in ""You've Got Mail""...Anyway, ""Notting Hill"" is not very tragic. The situation between Thacker and Scott, however, seems to be doomed. Also, the woman in the wheelchair adds a sad note to the music. But the characters lift themselves up from the mess of their lives and make something funny and worthwhile from it. It's uplifting not only to see the harmless behavior of Thacker or the incredibly dumb-ass Spike - but the entire set of people that Thacker trust and love provides additions to the story that are just as valuable.This film was probably the best one, bar ""The Matrix"" to appear in 1999. And I just want to say that I'd like a T-shirt like the one Spike wears to his date.",Notting Hill

Their paths cross several times and after the media discovers the blossoming relationship, Williams life, and Anna's also, will never be the same. Can these two seemingly complete opposites make it work, or are they too different? A brilliantly done movie, backed by an excellent supporting cast, most notably Rhys Ifans as William's roommate Spike. Plenty of memorable scenes, especially when William poses as a reporter and one of the great music moments in a movie when William walks the streets to ""Ain't no sunshine"".Guys, if you have to endure one romantic comedy, you could go a lot worse than this eg ""Monster in Law"" or anything with Meg Ryan.",Notting Hill

This film was just nuts. YEs sometimes there was some decent comedy, like from the wonderful scallywag played by Rhys Ifans, but for some reason the buildings that the film revolved around t like the bookstore and the flat grants character lived in where the only blue colored ones. Was that to help people focus? This was too much like a cross between Youve Got Mail and whatever other julia roberts tripe shes made in the past. Though to be fair, erin brokovich was not half bad. Notting Hill was just one of those stereotypical crummy chick flicks. YEs it was a thing, it still is, get over it its a sub genre and highly apt description. 4.5/10",Notting Hill
91,SMK-4,Played strict by genre rules,6,26 July 1999,"A straightforward romantic comedy.  In many ways this characterisation sums up both the strengths and weaknesses of this film. It is disappointingly non-experimental and plays the genre strict by the rules, but these rules work fairly well and here we have the good cast that is needed to pull it off.There are quite a few details in the script that are rather questionable. For example, if Anna is this big Hollywood star, then - how does she manage to walk unnoticed through the streets of London, with not one paparazzo in sight?  And why do we have (in contrast) an army of photographers at William's house when the source of their information was merely a rumour spread by his flatmate Spike down the local pub?One of the big pluses of this movie is its largely British supporting cast, especially Rhys Ifans is a treat.  As so often in this genre the supporting cast is not given enough to do.  The film hardly touches the stories of these characters, we only get the odd bit of inconsequential information. That is a shame, because one could have used these characters to add interest in the story .",Notting Hill
92,Quicksand,Is this supposed to be funny?,5,6 August 2002,"In the brain-dead world of the U.S. sitcom, there's a common plot device called ""embarrassing the protagonist,"" in which some idiot writer apparently finds mountains of hilarity in rendering the protagonist speechless; as with a kick to the groin, getting covered in gallons of some food product, or stammering out a rambling monologue when the guy/girl should really just shut up, etc.  Somebody, somewhere, must find these things funny.  If you see such a person, please smack them, and if you are such a person, what on earth is wrong with you?There are about three genuinely funny moments in ""Notting Hill,"" and the rest of the film features various Brits making asses of themselves.  I wasn't laughing, I was cringing.  This is entertainment?Not a single character in the film is particularly nice-- note how Thacker tries to impress the girl by calling his roommate a ""pea-brained idiot."" (Well, maybe he is, but guys don't usually impress girls by insulting people, do they?).  Anna Scott is remarkably shallow and is given about 3 lines of character development in the whole film, all of which occur during the birthday party scene.  Why is Thacker interested in her, other than because she's famous?  Why is Anna interested in Thacker, other than he looks like Hugh Grant?  These questions are ones we loud Americans are apparently not allowed to ask, we're just supposed to point and laugh and actually believe this couple actually has a shot at a real life.  The characters barely talk after they meet; character development is replaced with pop songs.  Note to director: it's NOT THE SAME THING!!Shallow characters, shallow writing, and it seems to be shallow directing, too, as the actors really do their best with the material given, which is really just Generic Sitcom Plot #7 stretched to feature-length, with better cinematography.  5/10.",Notting Hill
93,Brian-272,A Great Romantic Comedy. It Just Proves Lifetime Love Happens By Chance And When You Least Expect It.,5,27 June 2000,"Notting Hill happens to be one of the surprise romantic hit comedies of 1999. When I first saw it last May I was impressed. Though many argue that Notting Hill has fairy tale written all over it they have a point based on the story of a Hollywood screen goddess(Julia Roberts) falling for an unassuming British bookstore owner(Hugh Grant) while in London to promote her latest film. Yet still Julia Roberts gives such a good performance that she makes this love story seem so real. Julia has really earned the reputation as Hollywood's leading lady. This movie gave me the message that love is based on chance and happens unexpectedly and when it happens it is generally between two opposites as in this films case fame and fortune(Julia Roberts) and the down to earth everyday average citizen(Hugh Grant). Remember the old adage opposites attract. Finally the soundtrack to this film is available on Island records and I must mention the songs (When You Say Nothing At All) by Ronan Keating as played throughout the movie and (No Matter What) by Boyzone as played at the ending during the credits, both are truly uplifting songs that will uplift anybody's spirit I highly suggest you purchase the soundtrack if you liked the movie. This film and the music on the soundtrack are both simply soul touching.",Notting Hill

With me as well being a hopeless romantic of sorts, this is what I like.Can a famous female movie star and an ordinary man just get it along together? You will be surprised how it progressed. Julia Roberts as this famous movie actress in the movie happened to be in a Notting Hill bookstore which is owned by Hugh Grant's character. Then everything just happened.As this film is almost very British, watch out for some of the mannerisms. Maybe some of the lines can be cheesy and corny but then hey, it's love we are looking at here.Overall, it's just magic that both of among all my favourite celebrities are part of the cast. The whole thing just worked out for me and there is nothing more I can ask for.",Notting Hill
95,Silverzero,Sharp clever brit-flick with a verbal wit like no other.,6,3 May 2003,"A welcome change from your average `chick flick of the week', `Notting Hill' leaves a satisfying taste in the mouth. But there are a few nagging flaws. While the film opens brilliantly and maintains that pace up until about half way through the duration, after that the comedy becomes more sporadic, unsuccessfully mixing dry wit with needless sentimentality.
But the presence of Hugh Grant really lifts this one off the ground. His bumbling act never fails to amuse and is always right on the mark. On the other hand, Julia Roberts does little to outdo her reputation for being shallow and the love at first sight aspect of her character isn't all that believable. Rhys Ifans more erratic style of humour is equally welcome and the one-liners he uses are classic. The film loses a lot of momentum near the end but what has gone before erases a good amount of the minor drivel that followed. So, with a nice cast, a great script and a pleasant overall effect, `Notting Hill' is a success. 6.8/10.",Notting Hill
96,the amorphousmachine,Enjoyable...,7,24 August 2000,"Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts compliment each other so well in this film. Hugh Grant plays the bumbling travel-book store owner who leads a simple life well, while Julia Roberts plays a celebrity with character in an almost self-analytical role. Considering she already is a celebrity with character, she certainly makes Anna Scott extremely appealing.(WARNING: mild spoilers) What I liked about this film the most is that it is totally from William Thacker's (Hugh Grant) perspective. The audience never gets to see Anna Scott's glamourised world unless William is present. Essentially we're all stuck in Notting Hill with him, but on the other hand, in reality, would we ever see how celebrities live unless it is through the media. Thacker's perspective relates to the audience very well because we could all wonder about what it would be like for a normal person to become involved with a celebrity. This factor plays well in the film for comic value without being slapstick such as when William takes Anna to his sister's birthday celebrations, the humour revolves around the friends and family's behaviour towards Anna! Great performances from Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, and the supporting cast. Predictable but fun, and a great balance of analysis of celebrity hype and normal everyday life and romantic comedy. ***1/2 out of *****!",Notting Hill
97,macpherr,I liked it!,10,17 February 2000,"One of the best romantic comedies since ""You've got Mail."" I just got the tape and I keep watching it. The music is very inducing and intuitive which sticks to one's brain. She!  bla, bla, bla. Ups! I think I need the CD next. . . ""William Thacker"" Hugh Grant (Sirens) is a such a down-to-earth,  polite, nice guy and nice looking too. Always wearing his casual everyday kind of clothes. Sort of ""The Gap, L.L.Bean, Eddie Bauer"" commercial type of guy. The wilderness in the city, casual but sophisticated. Neat! Somewhat reminds me of my husband.  I think it is interesting that the part is for a man and not a woman. He is the one waiting for her, getting dumped, feeling left out, depressed, the entire family knows about it. This is a stereotypical female role. Hugh did a great job and received awards for his acting.The famous actress played by Julia Roberts (Something to Talk About, Sleeping with the Enemy) ""Anna Scott"" is also down to earth trying so hard to just be herself. Julia is always so likable. I think I have the tape of every movie she has made. We love her smile around here. To be that famous is just not good. It is just not healthy. Now the roommate ""Spike"" Rhys Ifans(Dancing at Lughnasa) is funny. At first I thought I couldn't stand this guy as a roommate. I still think their house is too messy, and because Thacker is so neat looking and Spike is weird I assumed that Spike was the one messing up everything.  But I crack up with ""Spike."" He is a lot of fun. Since when does yogurt taste like mayonnaise? It must be spoiled. Duh! Thacker just has the ideal family, although they are a little bit dysfunctional. There is unity in that family. I recommend the movie. I would not watch this movie trying to let the little slips in the actor's personal lives influence my judgment. Just think about their acting and about how well they are playing that particular role. That is what I try to do with everyone in the business. Everything else is history or just ""story."" My favorite scenes: Thacker walking down that street and the street turns into every season: Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring  meaning all this time without Anna. It is a very nice scene.If I lived close to that street my house would be ""in the spring."" I liked Hugh Grants performance. Spike in front of the blue-door posing for the press.

99,dommercaldi,A Cute 90's Rom-Com Bolstered By Hugh Grant And Julia Roberts Especially,6,22 March 2021,"Pros:
1. There is electric chemistry, not just between Hugh Grant (William Thacker) and Julia Roberts (Anna Scott), but between all of the main and co-main actors and actresses.
2. The character of Spike (Rhys Ifans) serves as excellent comic relief to break the monotony of the romance-drama fuelled story.
3. Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts deliver brilliant performances, particularly Julia Roberts who adds so much depth to her character by just her facial expressions and vocal intonations.
4. The soundtrack is both cozy and comforting, fitted with classics and modern classics (Bill Withers - 'Ain't No Sunshine' and Ronan Keating - 'When You Say Nothing At All') thus helping to imbue the film with an easy-going vibe.
5. The movie highlights the importance of empathising with differing perspectives in a grounded and non-patronising manner.
6. The quick-cut edits are used sparingly but effectively to add dynamism.Cons:
1. The score, especially the guitar strumming and piano playing, is overbearing and way too cheesy.
2. Somehow Anna Scott is able to walk around London almost entirely unnoticed, whether it be in a crowded street or restaurant. This is somewhat unbelievable.
3. There are a few scenes needlessly added in order to inculcate pointless drama. For example, when William Thacker walks over to the men in the restaurant for loudly discussing their lust for Anna Scott.
4. At the end, the writing clearly got a little lazy as both the Ritz Concierge (Henry Goodman) and Savoy Concierge (Patrick Barlow) decide to break their oaths of silence - which were taken to safeguard the security of Anna Scott - in order to set up the final get-together scene.",Notting Hill
100,refresh_daemon,A serviceable romantic comedy,7,3 October 2006,"One of my friends really likes this movie. So I decided to give it a try. Well, it was a pleasant, simple and mostly implausible romantic comedy about a famous fictional actress and the man that loves her.In terms of romantic comedy, this film basically gets the touchstones right. There are quirky, but fleshed out supporting characters. Silly scenarios and the like. It's cute enough to be smile-making funny, albeit nothing laugh-out-loud. But that's fine.It's likable. But it still has a few faults, some of which I'll describe here. The film takes a shortcut in developing the characters' relationship by use of montage. I generally dislike this practice, except if you need to get across a lot of information quickly. In this case, it was to skip past the hard work of showing these people get to like each other. And so it comes across to me as cheap and I have a hard time believing that they've come to like each other. Of course, I just bought it for the sake of not hating the film--but it would be nice it the story featured more of that and cut a little bit more of the not-as-funny comedy bits.The other thing is that the main characters are pretty flat. That is, both protagonists aren't very well developed (albiet the male protagonist is a little more developed than the actress) and so sometimes wasn't really caring about their trials and tribulations. But otherwise, they seem to be lifted from templates rather than having been thought through carefully. The supporting characters, on the other hand, have more depth than I expected. Unfortunately, it's not their story.Still, it does its got as a serviceable romantic comedy just fine so I can say that you might enjoy it. I enjoyed it at least, even if at times I was throwing crumpled paper at the screen. 7/10.Another note: I really didn't like the overuse of pop music in the film, especially the overblown music used to bookend the film. It felt a little tacked on or inorganic to the soul of the film and almost seems to try to ""sell"" the scene as emotionally related to the piece of selected music. Perhaps with more carefully selected tunes, it wouldn't have been so bad, but the choices were either overly melodramatic or just too well-known.",Notting Hill

'Steel Magnolias' is a film, I will forever carry a special place in my heart, however, this comes as a close second.

It's a fun, flirtatious little movie, that keeps you in store for laughs, tears (depending on how emotional you tend to get with films like these), and plenty of embarrassments. It's a great film that deserves all the credibility and recognition that it has already received...and then some.Don't pass this film up. It's one of the greatest romances of all time, and will stay a favorite of mine for a long time to come. A keeper, and definitely an excellent 10!",Notting Hill
102,coombsstephen,Has the ultimate RomCom stood the the rest of time? Without doubt,9,14 February 2019,"Just been to a 20th anniversary valentines screening of Notting Hill. I was worried that such a classic film might actually be a bit of a let down after so long.I need not have worried,it was superb and perhaps even better knowing what was coming and just enjoying the film.Watching again on the big screen it really comes across just how brilliant Julia Roberts is in this. She basically is playing herself, I guess, but even so her performance is flawless. Compare her to Andi McDowell in 4 weddings and it shows why Roberts is still A list.Hugh Grant is great as Hugh Grant as he usually is and the supporting cast really make the comedy and add realism to the film. On top of this the soundtrack still stands up.Still the ultimate RomCom, a classic.",Notting Hill
103,MarioB,Hollywood tries to make a British comedy,5,21 May 2000,"Except for a few rare exceptions, Hollywood movies don't innovate, aren't creative or original. It's just formula movies. We saw movies likeNotting Hill a hundred times (for example, Bombshell, in the early 1930's with Jean Harlow, or Roman Holiday, in the early 1950's, with Audrey Hepburn. Same type of films.) What saves this one from Hollywood boredom formula movies is that it's set in England. In fact, they try very hard to make it as brillant as English comedies of the 1990's, but miss the point. I enjoy the movie because of the great talent of Hugh Grant. Remove 20 minutes of it and I will say it is a very good film. I'm saying that it's just OK. which means that it's a little bit better than most romance formula comedies set in the US. It's also got a bit of French Vie Privée, of Louis Malle, in the early 1960's, with Brigitte Bardot.",Notting Hill
104,MAYESY-44,A great love story that can't be missed,8,29 December 2020,This is a classic love story with twist and turns but ends up good in the end. This film gives a bit more in terms of a comedy value which I believe adds to the story.,Notting Hill
105,MovieQween-33622,Classic,10,12 November 2019,"I love this movie so. I'm still not sure which is my favorite part of this movie... The soundtrack, the insanely quirky roommate-Rhys Ifans, Hugh Grant's amazingly funny friends, Julia Roberts or Hugh Grant himself. I'm gonna go with all of the above because I don't have to choose!! One thing I didn't love was how Julia Robert's character was kind of mean to Hugh Grant's character too many times. I wouldn't have stuck around for all of that crapshoot behavior but I guess she was guarded and cautious? I'll give her the benefit of the doubt because she's got trust issues from the paparazzi and the Hollywood life.",Notting Hill
106,ThomasColquith,I really liked this film!,10,30 May 2021,"I hadn't watched Notting Hill in many years, but upon re-watching it I was pleased by just how good it was! It was better than I remembered. I gave it a 10/10 as I feel it is one of the best films in its genre.What makes this a great romantic comedy is its strong leads, good acting and cinematography, good supporting cast, well written, simple (not overly complex), and most of all the film just has a comfortable vibe. You the viewer feel as if you're there, lounging around London, hanging out in a quaint bookshop and flat, unexpectedly hitting it off with a movie star. The film just has a familiar feel, like an old shoe, in a good way. I would recommend it the next time you're looking for a Rom Com to watch.",Notting Hill
107,lyubitelfilmov,An incident in a store or an unexpected love of an actress and an ordinary guy,8,14 December 2020,"Melodrama. The picture that interested me was that the script for it was written by Richard Curtis - the scriptwriter and director of such good and touching films as ""Love Actually"" and ""Boyfriend from the Future"". Here he was not yet entrusted with the director's chair, but this was corrected in the future hit - ""Love Actually"". Plus, I also wanted to look at young Hugh Grant (39 years old at the time of the release of the picture) and Julia Roberts (32 years old) - and did not regret the time and desire spent. And here's my brief opinion - the unexpected love of an actress and an ordinary guy. And no matter how I try to close my eyes to the shortcomings of the picture - they are here, and they stick out, so I simply have no right to remain silent about them, but I will also tell you about the merits, so that you can decide for yourself whether this melodrama is worth your attention. Then let your humble servant stop pouring water and get down to the point.
So, the advantages:
1. Scenario - the film tells about an unexpected meeting of a celebrity from the world of cinema Anna Scott and an ordinary guy from Notting Hill - one of the districts of London, William Tucker, which grew into an unusually magical word ""love"", although the heroes try to deny it to the last. The script is full of interesting and funny moments, deep and thoughtful dialogues and many more small details that make the viewer look at this picture very carefully and gradually imbued with the characters, both the first and the second plan. The ending is obvious here, as the choice of the heir to the throne in Saudi Arabia, nevertheless, it is a working cliche that wanders from one melodrama to another, as well as from one romantic comedy to another. If you take my general impression of the story told, I really liked it, and Richard Curtis did a good job!
2. Humor - some jokes here are clearly passable, but they cause a smile. Some are blatant blunders, but one joke and even a whole awkward scene gave me a lot of pleasure. He laughed without stopping for several minutes, because he simply could not stop. Richard - my compliments! If you crave to laugh and at the same time see romance - then you definitely come here.
3. References - to the movies, basically, which you and I watched in childhood, and are revising now, to celebrities. To the literature, which is on everyone's lips (well, at that time, so for sure). Moreover, additional comments are not required here, because everything is clear and so.
4. Dialogues - Curtis is certainly not Dostoevsky, and not Tolstoy and Chekhov, but he was able to reveal the inner world of the heroes of the picture. There is no falsehood in this. Awkwardness, indecision - this good is enough here, but it is even necessary. In just a few simple words, we will learn everything about the heroes that is needed in order to understand their motives and actions.
5. Entourage - the picture was filmed in Notting Hill - and I fell in love with this area of London, with its typical small apartments and English aesthetics. When watching, I literally found myself there, and I didn't really want to return, but the harsh reality is the harsh reality.
6. Music - selected well, and within the framework of the picture - sounds good, but you definitely won't want to listen to it separately.
So the disadvantages:
1. Dish - it is enough here, and it spoiled the overall impression a little. Considering that there are no explicit scenes here, this very vulgarity hit the ears and perception. If her concentration dropped by about seventy percent, it would be great. Something similar was in the picture ""Love Actually"".
2. Logical miscalculations - there are only two of them for the entire timekeeping time - which is simply surprising. An attentive viewer will find them without straining at all. Moreover, they are striking. They could have been safely removed, but no one did.
A little about the main characters:
1. William Tucker, played by Hugh Grant, is the owner of a small travel guide store, and a famous actress comes to life, which will be the beginning of a great feeling. Hugh brilliantly played a closed, awkward and real master of improvisation of a man who has lost all hope of meeting happiness. Bravo Hugh!
2. Anna Scott performed by Julia Roberts - the famous ""Pretty Woman"" Roberts plays here herself - a Hollywood celebrity who fled to London from the ubiquitous cameras and gloss, where she meets the awkward and modest William. From her lips we learn about the unpleasant seamy side of this world. Julia is extremely happy here. Clever girl!
3. Spike performed by Rhys Ivans - William's roommate and eccentric friend. Looks disgusting, behaves - even worse, talks - wow, but shows concern and helps William more than once. Rhys coped with the role quite well.
Several other famous faces appeared in the episodes, including Emily Mortimer.
Something else came to light. Richard was responsible for the script for the first two parts of Bridget Jones. Okay, I'll see! Persuaded Richard.
As a result, we have a good and soulful melodrama, with an excellent script, good music, good humor, not without flaws and excellent acting, especially Grant and Roberts.

Grant and Roberts had great chemistry together which made a great and cute story. There are a few kinks and overall; I didn't quite find Julia Roberts's character to be super likeable... but overall, I really liked this movie! It was sweet, romantic, and made for a cozy Friday evening.",Notting Hill
111,standardmetal,overcomes reality successfully!,8,24 January 2007,"Notting Hill is in the rather familiar genre where a royal personage (in this case, an American movie star which is much the same thing!) meets a commoner (Hugh runs a travel bookstore in the Notting Hill section of London.). In most other cases, (the Student Prince or Roman Holiday for example), the protagonists are forced by class differences, to separate, but not here. (Perhaps because the real Hugh is famous in his own right.:-)) As a romantic comedy it is quite standard. Boy meets, boy loses, boy gets-repeat ad infinitum. Famous girl meets your obligatory supporting cast of ""unforgettable characters"" who are friends of the hero and they interact warmly with the famous girl in a not entirely predictable manner.But Hugh bumbles charmingly, Julia smiles winningly; they are both experts on what they do best. The supporting cast is charming, especially Rhys Ifans as Hugh's roommate Spike, and the lines, often consisting of the usual 4 letter words (a deleted scene included on the DVD shows Julia using the compound word most often used to describe Oedipus Rex. If you don't know what I mean, see the Oedipus scene in Mel Brooks' ""History of the World Part 1"" are sharp and funny for the most part. And I can appreciate the honesty with which the movie-star personality is treated.Though the contrived happy ending is pure moonshine, car stunts and all, I think this film has taken its place among the classics of the genre, Sleepless, Harry-Sally etc. all of which have an equally tenuous relationship with reality. Like those other films, this one overcomes reality quite successfully!",Notting Hill

I know it is unfair to base a movie's payoff on the expectations I had going in, but I had heard that it was fantastic, but I only saw it as another You've Got Mail.I love Julia Roberts and I think Hugh Grant was more than adequate as a leading man. It's just that I didn't feel like the movie took control of me the way some romantic comedies do.Still, I can't specifically think of any criticism of it that is worth mentioning.

113,danielll_rs,Very funny comedy about serious subjects,8,11 September 1999,"""Notting Hill"" is one of the 10 year's best in my opinion. It is a very intelligent romantic comedy about some matters of life.Julia Roberts (great and wonderful) plays Anna Scott, the most famous film star in the world, who is in England to promote her new film. Hugh Grant is William Thacker, an ordinary man, who owns a book shop in Notting Hill, London, and is not very lucky with love. One day Anna comes into William's shop and... Well, it seems to be one more romantic comedy, and just that. But it is not. As in ""As Good as it Gets"" the director uses humor to discuss some serious subjects. Here each character has his/her own problem and his/her own joy.1-Anna Scott: she's the most famous woman in the world and seems to be happy. But as she says ""this thing of fame is not real"". She needs something more...2-William Thacker: he doesn't have much money and is not lucky with women, although he's handsome and a nice person. He also needs something more.3-Will's friend and his wife (on the wheelchair): they seem to be happy and, even with some problems, they try to live their life like everybody else.4-Will's sister and his roommate: he is silly and unusual; she is quite strange and also unusual. Also need something else.Well, we can see that even a comedy can be a complex film. In short, ""Notting Hill"" is a film about the celebrity life, but we have to pay attention at the supporting roles.Julia Roberts shows that she can be a great actress if she wants to. She also proved this in ""Stepmom"". Hugh Grant doesn't surprise me; we've already known he is a good actor. The writers and the producers are the same of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and here, once more, they show the value of their work.It is impossible not to love ""Notting Hill""!",Notting Hill
114,yasir619,Unexpectedly beautiful.,9,22 January 2020,"Let me get through it, how i became so obsessed with this movie, i was just rolling channels on my home TV and i was just checking out same TV channels with the different programs and eventually, i got myself at HBO, there was a scene when a random woman which i considered at that time, walked-in in some kind of book store and was looking for the guy (William Wacker) and then he came and struck up with the most deep proposal conversation. I listened that and watched that scene so desperately and i loved it, As the movie went ahead, there came a most beautiful scene i have ever seen on TV when the William Wacker and Anna Scott sitting on the bench and William reading a book while holding a hand of her and there is baby in her womb. I figured that scene and that moment in the movie as one of the most beautiful and charming scene. I really felt so much in that scene and learnt many of things that i can enhance in myselfAfter a week, i searched for this film and download it so i can see it from the very beginning. So, here i am, finished the movie just now and reviewing it at last. The whole movie is mixed with the Drama, Romance, Family typed, and hilarious. The acting of Hugh Grant, Oh, my goodness, he is such a brilliant actor. He has beautiful face, acting skills and really good acting behavior. I have now just considered this movie as my favourite one. It has such a great plot, characters, sets and beautiful alleys of London. I found Hugh Grant so much talented actor as for his authentic acting skills. He's really great hairstyle. The character of William Wacker is so naive and respectable to me.Movie has very logically and sensing making scenes that i have adored the most. Love Notting Hill forever.",Notting Hill
115,Phroggy,Britain versus the US ?,2,8 December 1999,"As Mr Stuart Brown summed it up - though I don't know him -maybe you have to be a British expatriate to love this one. I'mnot, but Notting Hill is one of my favourite place in London. Infact, the best parts of this movie includes Hugh ""Hmmmmmm-hawwwwww- Grant's family + roommate and seems to belong to another movie - an english one. The rest is aHollywoodian love story, where characters fall in love forunfathomable reason and keeps on acting unfathomably stupidbefore the ""Happily-ever-after"" ending. No doubt, the secondarycharcaters are great, but no one can believe in Robertts/Grantcharacters and actions. The most beautiful scene in the movie,the one to decipher again and again, shows a passing of seasonsthrough Notting Hill in one (apparent) sequence.

I mean believing that Marsians exist is easier.Julia Roberts is gorgeous this true and Hugh Grant is handsome this is too factual but this doesn't give the movie makers the right to gather them in such a silly movie while relying on their charm as if that alone would do!

117,Jakemcclake,More of A Good Romantic Movie Than A Comedy,9,22 September 2009,"SpoilersI have read the negative reviews and I agree with most of the comments, made, but I still love this movie. This movie has a (somewhat) ground breaking premise of a famous and very attractive movie star getting involved with a person of no fame and no notoriety. It seems like a logical choice of movie scripts for Julia Roberts, considering Julia's prior marriage to Lyle Lovitt. The movie goes on about the conflicts that cause this couple to stay apart. In that sense it is not very funny and I agree with those people that critique it on its lack of humor. This series of conflicts cause the movie to drag on in a serious, un-entertaining way. However, the character Spike tends to add tremendous comedy to most of the scenes that involve him, so it does not drag too much. After all of the conflict, the movie suddenly focuses in on one of Julia's lines, regarding the issue of a famous movie actress wanting to be involved with a not so famous man. This fame thing is just an illusion, well, what you really have here ""is a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her."" It was a very powerful line if it stood by itself, but then it gets repeated later on, which they did not need to do. The ending was powerful also, but the music messed it up, as they used the song ""She"" by Elvis Costello for the climax. Nonetheless, still a powerful ending showing that the famous and the not so famous can be together. I give the movie 9 stars. I have watched the ending of this movie a dozen or more times, sort of ignoring the the repeating of Julia's line and ignoring climactic song ""She"" and just watching the actions on the screen.",Notting Hill
118,Starbuck-13,"Nice, but...",6,15 January 2001,"...nowhere as nice and wonderful as ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" was. Okay, the movie certainly had a hard life from the beginning, always being compared to Hugh Grants splendid Top Ten Ever Romantic Comedy. But even with a lot of good will, Notting Hills just pales in front of its great predecessor.The characters are often blunt, one-dimensional and sometimes boring. Hugh Grant gives his clumsy nice guy routine. Julia Roberts gives her frog smile. And the friends of the Grant character try to achieve the level of sheer beauty and real life feeling that Grants peer group in ""Four Weddings"" had, but fail to reach it - they are just some british stereotypes, most of them that is.So this is a nice movie, but far from big. Nice happy ending though. Very unrealistic...",Notting Hill
119,vasco_cid,Cheesy love story.,5,3 May 2001,"First of all, I think that this movie was a bit overrated , in my opinion, it is not that good , and doesn't deserve the stamp of  `Perfect' on it, just `Normal'. Obviously the greatest triumph of this film, is of course Julia Roberts which is one of the most perfect and talented actresses nowadays. Of course, but that's me, in the opposite extreme is the most annoying than ever Hugh Grant. His lines (except one or two), his acting and his accent are unbearable, he plays a character that is supposed to be so normal', but centralized himself how center of everyone's attentions he is. Please better casting next time (Joseph/ Ralph Fiennes, Jude Law, Liam Neeson) The supporting cast, on the other hand is good and deserve praise for their work and for the way they acted their lines. Once more, what blew up the whole movie was Hugh Grant, and the inevitable perfect love story with almost nothing that stands on their way. CHEESY, but ENTERTAINING, BORING but  SOMEHOW INTERESTING.5/10",Notting Hill
120,Dodger-9,A sublime carnival,9,14 October 2000,"Richard Curtis penned one of the most successful British comedies ever to grace the silver screen, and in 1999, that really nice bloke who brought the world Black Adder, The Vicar of Dibley and probably saved millions through Comic Relief went and did it again.  Against all odds, Curtis reworked the Four Weddings formula, re-teamed with producer Duncan Kenworthy and star Hugh Grant to deliver one of the most likeable comedies since, well, Four Weddings.      Many of the press picked up on the Curtis formula for making hit movies and you can see their point - to a degree. Admittedly, as with Four Weddings, there is Hugh Grant (playing bookshop owner William Thacker), likeable, unsure of himself, stumbling through life without a steady partner, blessed by a close circle of friends who are all very loveable; yes there is a character with a disability, this time around it's Gina McKee in a wheelchair.    Emma Chambers - a very good, intelligent actress if you're ever lucky enough to spend half an hour in her company - plays Thacker's colurful sister; a role which in a previous incarnation would have been played by Charlotte Coleman (Scarlett from that Weddings movie). Thacker has a scummy Welsh flatmate in the form of Spike (Rhys Ifans from Twin Towns) who wears really dirty pants and even dirtier T shirts - but has a heart of gold, which comes as no surprise to anyone. So, into this happy throng comes the most famous actress on the planet - Anna (Julia Roberts). In probably her best role to date, Roberts gets a rare chance to prove that yes, she really is quite good at this thesping lark. Never for a minute do you think that, no - wait a minute - she could never be the most successful actress in the world. It's for this reason that a dinner party in honour of Thacker and his sister reveals Roberts to be really rather more than the sum of her extraordinary lips and eyes that make most normal blokes feel like they've just lost a couple of weeks in a darkened theatre - when in fact it's been about 10 seconds. Budding screenwriters should take note of Curtis' script. Six years ago he wrote an article in The Observer which was a definitive guide for any poor hack trying to make his screenplay real and come alive both on the page and on screen. It was reprinted in the really rather good Four Weddings script book (available for about a quid from all good discount book shops).   Now Curtis is quite lucky to have, as his wife, Emma Freud (also a very nice sort if you're lucky enough to chat to her for a bit). Her name pops up as script editor and you get the feeling it should have been in the main credits for if a gag works in Notting Hill, it's probably because Freud sat there till the early hours telling Curtis why he should plump for that one and not the inferior one which ended up in one of his waste paper baskets.   There are some occasionally moving scenes too. Tim McInnery helping his disabled wife into the car for that inevitable, race against time finale is something rarely seen - nor played with such throwaway conviction. Good support comes from James Dreyfus from Gimme, Gimme Gimme and The Thin Blue Line; Henry Goodman (from not bad Beeb sitcom Unfinished Business and the London stage production of Chicago), while John Shrapnel (101 Dalmatians; Gladiator) is superb as Roberts' press officer. The soundtrack is a little dubious but Elvis Costello's version of the old Charles Aznavour hit, She, works well and the score keeps things ticking over.One of the best films of 1999 which ensures you could do far worse than spend a couple of hours at this Notting Hill carnival.",Notting Hill
121,jacksisjax,Very Enjoyable,8,27 October 2020,"Who knew that young Julia Roberts was such a cutie? I didn't know. I do now. Looks like I have a little crush :)This movie is very funny, I found myself busting out laughing on multiple occasions. And I usually do not laugh out loud at a movie. Hugh grant is especially hilarious! Not only is it hilarious, but it's rather sweet as well. It's a warm hearted feel good movie with a rather good message hidden underneath.I honestly felt like this movie could have been a 9, but there were some minor setbacks that made me think otherwise. The biggest being the foley, overexcited, tone breaking ending. Too many movies blow it in the last 15 minutes or so... this wasn't too bad.

122,DanB-4,Mixed Feelings,6,29 August 2002,"WARNING: MILD SPOILERSI have mixed feelings about this movie. I'll say that I liked it and was disappointed at the same time.On one hand, there is a very touching tale about the high cost of fame. As cool as it may seem to be a movie star, I can't help but strongly believe that Tom Cruise or Julia Roberts long for a simple walk in the park. Maybe not, but having every move monitored by the world must grow tiresome. This side of the story, told through Julia Roberts autobiographical character Ana Scott is told well and poignantly.The love story is mishandled at every step. This film exists in that annoying parallel universe that Roger Ebert describes as the world ""where Julia Roberts can't get a date."" When Hugh Grant turns down Julia Roberts, I did not admire his integrity, I questioned his sanity.The love story portion of this film plays out exactly as you expect and takes forever to get there.That said, Hugh's friends and family provide some good chuckles, Alec Baldwin's cameo is wonderful and the movie gets a mild recommendation from me. Good date flick.  **1/2 out of ****.",Notting Hill
123,K-Slicer,Even the Little Folk Have A Chance,10,9 March 2003,"I watched this movie at first to see Julia Roberts and then I realized that Hugh Grant was an actor who had talent too.  Casting them together was a stroke of genius and giving them a tightly written script that bites the hand that feeds it gives the awesome film ""Notting Hill"" (spoilers contained herein).  Here are the reasons: (1) Julia Roberts gives her best post-""My Best Friend's Wedding"" performance and (2) Hugh Grant gives his best pre-""About A Boy"" performance. (3) Rhys Ifans was hilarious as the Hugh Grant's roommate. (4) The best scenes had Hugh Grant pretending to be a reporter from a well-known British magazine. (5) The script was unbelieveably well-written. (6) The ""walking down the street"" scene was great statement about how as time moves on, everything changes either for the better or worse. (7) Several lines are definitely quoteworthy. (8) The jabs that Hollywood sustained came in the form of creative dialogue. (9) The onscreen romance between Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant was great in it's own right. (10) I like the idea of a common man falling in love with a movie starlet and she fell in love with him too.  Ten reasons give a score of 10!Combining two great talents with a few nice whacks at the hand that feeds them works nicely for me.  It is too bad that the combination of two or even three great performers usually sometimes leaves a bad stench behind but that is sometimes the way the cards fall.  Overall, ""Notting Hill"" is noteworthy, quoteworthy and definitely a good dramedy.  Here ends my rant!",Notting Hill
124,clydestuff,Everyone's romantic fantasy,9,3 February 2004,"Just about any Romantic film that comes out of Hollywood is practically pure fantasy.  Knowing that doesn't deter us from watching films like Casablanca and wishing we could be either Bogart or Bergman, seeing Gone With The Wind for the millionth time and viewing ourselves as Gable or Leigh or sailed on the Titanic as DiCaprio or Winslet.  Who hasn't gone through adolescence and at some point daydreamed about the possibilities of meeting and falling in love with your favorite film star?  It is this fantasy that Notting Hill fulfills for us in a wonderful romantic comedy starring Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts.As William Thacker, Hugh Grant plays the average everyday sort of guy who owns and operates a travel book store in the Notting Hill section of London. On a day that starts out as any other, famous film star Anna Scott(Roberts) wanders into his book shop.  After Anna has some juice spilled on her, William offers to let her use her flat to clean up.  She seems to be appreciative of William's help, even if he is quite the bungler who hardly knows what to say in her presence.  When she leaves his apartment, William is sure his brief brush with a star has come and gone, but surprisingly Anna calls and invites him to a press junket at her hotel.  From here, the romance begins but it is not going to be an easy path to love.  There are plenty of pitfalls and hurdles on the path to true love in any romance, but they are magnified ten times over in a relationship such as this.Hugh Grant may not be every person's cup of tea but in Notting Hill he truly shines.  He plays William as an ordinary everyday kind of guy, who loves has family no matter how strange and quirky they may be, is willing to put up with his very strange roommate Spike (Rhys Ifans), and though well aware of Anna's stardom is still able to see she is  a person who has emotions just as you or I or he does.  He enables us to believe that he is falling in love with the person and not the name.  As for Julia Roberts, I have no idea how much of her character is based on her own real personality, but it wouldn't be a stretch to say she has included at least some of her own self into her role as Anna.  There are times when she seems truly vulnerable, and at other times she seems unable to let the real person of Anna show for fear of being compromised in some manner.  In one of the film's best moments, at a dinner with Williams family, Anna gives a speech about stardom and how sometimes it's not what it's cracked up to be.  It's a revealing moment, and there is no doubt that she could easily be talking about Julia Roberts and not just Anna Scott.The supporting cast in this film is also remarkable.  Rhys Ifan's Spike is about as dingy a character as one would ever want to meet and simply hilarious.  There is also a touching sub-story beautifully played out about William's friend Max (Tim McInnery)and his wheelchair bound wife Bell(Gina Mckee).  They have several moments together in this film that will easily touch your heart.  As William's sister Honey(Emma Chambers)is almost as quirky as Spike, but shows a bit more emotional depth.  Alec Baldwin makes a brief appearance as Anna's boyfriend, and handles the part of your basic ""too big of a star jerk"" quite well.  Director Roger Michell gives us some wonderfully staged scenes in this film and each one is played out with perfection.  When William goes to meet Anna for the first time at her hotel, he is mistaken for a writer and is made to interview the other stars from Anna's film.  Later, when he takes Anna to meet his family and friends, it is a birthday party you won't soon forget.Yes, like all romantic comedies, Notting Hill is a fantasy film, but it shares and fulfills a certain kind of romantic fantasy we have all wished for at some time in our life. A truly wonderful film.My Grade: A",Notting Hill
125,samyaksambuddha,A simple and beautiful romantic story,9,8 November 2018,"A popular model falls for a common Book Seller at the Notting Hills owing out his innocence.
What to say about Julia Roberts- a Goddess on Earth!! Same is played in the movie itself. Huge Grant plays the character of a innocent guy who is not much involved in complex equations.
The emotional scenes are really touchy which are introduced at the prefect timing. The romantic scenes are breathtaking while the comedy scenes are hilarious. Bella does good on the modest part and spike on the comic part.
The chemistry of a popular actress and a simple boy is really amazing. The deeper intricacies of such mismatched relations are well discussed here and there.
A touching story that will sweep you completely into itself and the innocent love is worth feeling. Lovely watch.",Notting Hill
126,robert-259-28954,Classic Julia.,10,5 November 2016,"While this film certainly doesn't pull anything new, it still satisfied my romantic heart as only Julia Roberts can do. Think of it as ""Pretty Woman"" in reverse, this time with Julia as the wealthy one. But what makes this bit of cinematic romance really take flight is the superb cast, consisting of the best English actors available. Hugh Grant, always excellent with his self-effacing grace, was the perfect foil for Roberts, with special mention for an amazing Rhys Ifans as Grant's scruffy roommate, nearly stealing the show. Having finally seen this movie in 2016, one of the more interesting asides was a minor role played by Hugh Bonneville, who later became the iconic male lead in ""Downton Abbey,"" quite a younger man when this film was made. Music always makes the movie, and this one succeeded quite well, with the theme song ""She"" performed memorably by Elvis Costello, this hit song originally made famous by Charles Aznavour, the great French crooner. If you're looking for an uplifting romantic fantasy to take you away for a couple of hours, I recommend it.",Notting Hill
127,BB-15,Nice Guy Finishes First,8,21 November 1999,"Notting Hill tries a few changes with the Romantic comedy formula which made things interesting. Interwoven with the romance are discussions about the pressures of fame, being a movie star and tabloid journalism. Then there is a role reversal. The woman is rich and powerful and the man is poor, acting almost like a saint. When does such a nice guy, well played by Hugh Grant, meet the girl? (Macho Alec Baldwin briefly shows up and frankly he would usually get Julia.) And Julia Roberts' character, half of the time I understood her problems and the rest of the time I thought she was a jerk. A difference from recent romantic comedies is that ending a relationship isn't just shaking hands and wishing each other luck. Part of the reason why it all works is because this is set in England. Politeness is more common there. Also the odd ball supporting characters are different just because they are English. Sometimes they didn't feel that natural but then again I don't live in London. There is some attempt to talk about our problems not being so important in the big scheme of things. I liked this but I got tired of Hugh Grant's character becoming a door mat after awhile. But then that gets straightened out too. My only complaint was that the ending (with too many close ups and songs) and its prediction of the future of our lovers, went on and on showing too much. A perfect ending is like As Good As It Gets where the couple finally kiss and go eat a pastry, leaving the rest to our imagination. Despite that complaint, I really enjoyed this film. I rooted for the nice guy, Hugh Grant, and he finished first.",Notting Hill

(loved the cartoon aliases and how the Japanese thought a simple exuberant gesture of gratitude was a common greeting, LOL)Alec Baldwin was effective in his cameo as the slovenly soon-to-be ex-lover of Julia...Julia was not as effective as I thought she could be, there was no ""Pretty Woman"" spark... Yet the passage of a year with just the duration of Bill Withers' ""Ain't No Sunshine"" as Hugh walked through the Notting Hill Market more than made up for it - a true cinematographic gem worthy of the classification of ""classic!""The chase scene at the end was also magnificent punctuated by Stevie Winwood's ""Gimme Some Lovin'"" (You gotta admit the his character was DUMB! HellOOOoooo? A woman spends money to buy an ORIGINAL Chagall as a way of saying ""Sorry"" and you say ""NO?"" Are you on peyote, man?)The end was beautiful, I never thought something as simple as a park bench could be so romantic?",Notting Hill
130,bjones,Definitely worth the admission,8,22 July 2003,"Originally written 14 June 1999; account moved.I expected to see another mediocre romantic comedy like You've Got Mail, but I was surprised that enough was different here to make it interesting. The London neighborhood and the characters entertained (although hearing the starring flat originally went for $500K was a bit much.). Especially entertaining was Rhys Ifans as the flatmate ""Spike"". I had to resist feeling insulted at such a portrayal of a Welshman in order to admire the performance though. He was very good, even down to the recent cultural shift among some Celts to revert to the pre-British spellings of their names; that I applaud.The sets and locations lent an air of realism, too; lots of small details. The Camera work took great advantage of these and gave us a visually rich film without it being ""in-your-face"" - it caressed.The remaining performances surprised too. This was the best I had Seen Hugh Grant. He was perfect in the role. Just enough modest loveability for the ladies in the party. Then there was Julia Roberts. I do not know when I have enjoyed her more in a film. It wasn't the part, the script or her character. She just seemed ""on"" for this in a very engaging way. It was a delight to drink in the different looks and degrees of costume. She looked very fetching in the scenes where it appeared as though she were sans makeup; just basic glowing beauty.The only negative aspect of the film for me was the multiple breakups. I would have preferred seeing a slow maturation of their relationship. Still, that wasn't enough to spoil the overall effect. It was refreshing and entertaining to feel good at the end of a movie after some recent things I've seen. Oh, there's room for all those dastardly realistic, rend-your-heart-to-shreds kind of things, but sometimes I just want to go to a movie to feel good. Most telling was at the end of the film, the audience spontaneously applauded; a real rarity. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. So much so I hated to see it end. Bravo.",Notting Hill

133,cutter-12,Has its moments but nothing special.,6,12 December 2001,"Hugh Grant bats his eyelids too much.  Julia Roberts, well this is pretty much her most likeable performance since Pretty Woman.  Rhys Ifans as Spike steals a couple scenes out from under both.  A better than average British romantic comedy which deteriorates due to a familiar mad chase to fix the relationship ending.  The Brits own the copyright on this type of ending. But the press conference climax was completely unbelievable.  In fact, making Julia Roberts a world renowned movie star wasn't the best idea. Perhaps if she was more low key like a an Author, or an Heiress, or a Cellist, it would have made the story easier to swallow.  A big time Hollywood goddess falling for a book salesman in some seedy London district for more than a diversion is a fairy-tale at best.Not the worst comedy romance you'll ever see, and not the best.  I've not much against it.  It was entertaining enough and serves its purpose. It just falls short.",Notting Hill
134,nzpedals,Delightful,9,9 November 2015,"The best Julia Roberts film? OK, so I've only seen two others. Here, her character is a famous film star, so it shouldn't be too hard to do? But the acting is superb throughout, and the writing is clever and funny. The support cast are great. Easily a ten.Anna (Roberts) is in London and goes to a street market, there, she gets clumsily bumped into by William (Grant) and he offers to try and clean the orange juice from her T-shirt. And friendship proceeds of course.There is an outstanding performance by Gina McKee as the wheelchair bound wife of Williams friend and other great acting by the publicist and others. But... Rhys Ifans plays Spike, the flatmate of William. Ifans is a great actor, but here, his character is primo-jerk and this reflects badly on Ifans? I don't know why the writers have made him so unlikeable.Something really different and really good is the mini-essay on the subject of why western males are so infatuated by women's breasts. Of course there are plenty of movies that flash a bit of flesh, but nobody ever discusses the matter in a serious way? Here, they do, briefly, and very cleverly. Well done!",Notting Hill

136,shimenpf,A very high level romcom,7,12 October 2019,"This is a great example of how a romantic comedy can stick to the formula and yet feel inspired and original. The characters are great and I found myself very soon empathizing with them. Even the supporting ones get their chance to shine and don't disappoint. The relationships between them is very good. The diner scene in Thacker's sisters' birthday was particularly tender and endearing. The main conflict of the movie is driven by the on/off relationship between the protagonists, as well as some external situations like the arrival of Anna Scott's bf, her leaked photos or the paparazzis. Aside from the natural dialogue scenes where the romance is built, the story keeps moving forward. And even then, the dialogue felt inspired. The third act was exciting and thrilling. We've seen car chases scenes before, but this one was filled with tense, perhaps product of the great connection the movie made us built with the protagonist. I could feel the urge and tension, which is what it's all about.
Notting Hill is one of the best, sweetest romcoms out there, hands down. No wonder it was the magnificent Richard Curtis who wrote it.",Notting Hill
137,Rumples,"Cute, simple, harmless, unchallenging, unremarkable",6,21 June 1999,"This film is nice and moderately pleasant. It allows Hugh Grant to act like Hugh Grant (almost intolerable for my liking), and trots out the old boy meets girl, loses girl, gets girl back, routine in a pleasant way for such a well-worn formula. The supporting cast is fairly good but is really only there for cheap laughs or a bit of sympathy. Julia Roberts is tolerable and the situation passingly interesting (every man's fantasy really) but just didn't do much for me. Part of the problem may have been that I'd just been to see 'Life is Beautiful' the evening before and this just pales into insignificance in comparison. Undoubtedly most of the viewing public will enjoy this because it does nothing more than deliver some low-brow chuckles and soppy sentiment - a perfect recipe for success today it seems. In any case, I'd suggest you at least leave it for video. My vote 6/10 (and a dang sight more realistic that the 7.9 or so its currently running at).",Notting Hill

It is a fairytale. Classical Hollywood movie. It's very romantic and unreal in-fact. JR is very elegant. Hugh Grant was quite famous in that days. They were perfectly fits for a romantic comedy. The movie reflects lots of relationships and their results. William Thacker's (Hugh Grand) ex-girlfriend and his best friend got married. His sister and his eccentric room-mate be lovers. So the message is; its not important how beautiful or handsome you are perfect mate finds you and you be loved. Also there are some good quotes; ""Immortals not involved with goddes."" Or ""I live in Notting Hill. You live in Beverly Hills. "" I have to mention, further years good for Rhys Ifans (Room-mate) he proves he is really good actor. My favorite act is Mycroft Holmes in Elementary. At last but the best the soundtrack is marvellous and even stunning today.",Notting Hill

140,wayno-6,brutally borish british film...,1,23 September 1999,"I saw Notting Hill as in inflight movie - which addmittedly is NOT the best place to watch much of anything. (Prior to the movie, we were ""treated"" to an epidose of ""Frasier"" (no thanks, I'd rather have hemmeroids!)  Then the first epidose of ""I Dream of Jeanie"" (in living black and white)What the heck I had 2 hours to kill.They managed to make a brutally boorish, British film starring Hugh Grant, and Julia Roberts.  Bad Dialogue, Bad plot (plot?  what plot?), bad acting - all combined to make this 2 hour movie, seem like 10 hours long.

141,VikiLauda,Nothing Hill!,1,31 March 2021,"People who watch this have to be reasonably familier with writer Richard Curtis' work, to really undertand what Notting Hill is really about, Curtis who also brought us the equally vapid ""Bridget Jones Diary"" is a socialist who deplores British values & culture. I think once you understand this, it becomes clear what this movie is all about, & it is certainly not about a cute movie star romance with an idotic book store owner. Worse still are Hugh Grant & Julia Roberts in the duo leads, because they have absolutely no chemistry & the script is incedibly weak, which does not explain why they fall in love with each other. Why are they attracted to each other? What do they like about each? Etc. Grants character is horribly unbelieveable. He is a baffoon, dim witted character of little substance, who calls his friends nasty names to impress his movie star love interest. To be fair some of the supporting characters/actors are much better & indeed colourful, but Curtis writing really lets this film down. Richard Curtis wants the whole world to believe that the English, in particular white middle class Londoners are toffy nosed hooray Henry's, obsessed with dinner parties & practically tripping over their stiff-upper-lip, which makes them comical charactures riddled with English clichés so bad it is cringe worthy! I am a British northern born working class woman, & I have never met any fellow English person who is anywhere near as bad as they are protrayed in Notting Hill. Any decent famous American actress would run a mile when faced with Thacker & his crew of jolly hockey-sticks, Ohkay YAH! Do gooders.The plot goes like this: WilliamThacker (Grant) owns a travel book shop in Notting Hill & one day world famous American actress Anna Scott (Roberts) enters incognito, but later they meet in the street & he spills his drink over her. There is some shenanigans with her changing clothes at his place. She invites him to her suite at a posh hotel where he is mistaken for a reporter. They go scramblining over fences & end up at his sisters for a birthday dinner party....""Oh-Kay YAHhh!"" hooting commences!They only two characters I felt any warmth for were ""Spike"" (Rhys Ifans) & the dizzy ""Honey"" Thacker played beautifully by Emma Chambers, but dispite some solid efforts by the rest of the cast, there the warmth ended. The only other good aspect of this movie I did enjoy was the excellent soundtrack & I remember it was hugely popular at the time. But as a supposed star of British RomCom, for me this failed. Notting Hill also presents a wholly fairy-tale, rose tinted vision of London, which is actually one of the worlds most dangerous cities for women & girls so it is very unrealistic. It also failed to give a fair diverse, relaistic demographic of the area of London where it was filmed which did not truely represent the ethnic Afro-Carribean community & this aspect was criticised in the Independant newspaper at the time saying ""only Curtis could write a movie about Notting Hill, London's most diverse borough, and not feature a single black face in it.""In short Notting Hill was empty, vapid & it's comedy was as outdated as a Carry On movie from the 1960's. Curtis simply can't hide his contempt for British culture & while he was considered to be a top comedy writer of the 1980's, by 1999 his writing was very outdated as well as racist & sexist. I honestly hope we have seen the last of his writing. If you like basic romcoms this could still please. But I wont waste my time with it again!",Notting Hill

The story moves right along, and just when you might be getting bored, Roberts smiles, or Grant gets that hurt puppy dog look in his eyes. That's the kind of film this is.

Hugh Grant does not help this hackneyed situation at all. I don't know what Roberts is going to do now that she's getting too over-the-hill to play the ""All-American Ingenue"" character she's beaten into the ground like a dead horse (no pun intended).

149,ToldYaSo,Not bad for a film I didn't want to go to,8,17 June 1999,"I must say that like most guys with a wife or girlfriend, I live in the fear of the dreaded chick flick. Some women find this distinction of a film insulting, but it's actually something they should be proud of. Some filmmakers have gone to the trouble to make films just for women that will be of no interest whatsoever to men, and therefore providing an appropriate penance to subject their man to if he is in need of discipline or punishment.How does one identify a chick flick on sight? It's very simple for a man to peg one. Perhaps it's an innate ability given to most men at birth. Not unlike the kind that bestows the sole responsibility of killing small insects in the home and lighting the barbecue. A man doesn't need to have it classified for him, and he knows to avoid it at all costs. But a man must also learn to develop something of an immunity to tolerate them in small dosages. One day he may be required to view one, being unable to summon the veto power required to get him out of it. Or perhaps it's simply to negate any comment such as ""We NEVER pick what I want to watch!""Some women gravitate to the chick flick like a boat to a lighthouse beacon in a tempest. ""Oh, that looks good,"" she might exclaim. While the man thinks, ""That bloody well sounds like a chick flick, better make myself scarce."" Case in point, a preview for ""Step Mom"" manages to pass one minute and thirty seconds without uttering a single word as to what the story is about, and still women flock to it on the strength of the title and actresses alone. Now that's a chick flick if I ever avoided one.The main reason guys avoid chick flicks is it seems that the melodrama is specifically intended to make people cry, which ten times out of ten doesn't work on the fellas. At the very start of the melodrama, we are alerted to a high level reading on the sob-o-meter and tune out immediately. We are wise to their transparent little ploy and none too impressed at their pathetic attempt to win us over.Now why all this grandstanding about chick flicks? Is ""Notting Hill"" a chick flick? Sort of. Is it like most films starring Julia Roberts? No, not really. Do we have a full fledged ""Beaches-Alert"" warning in effect? Certainly not. The fact is, if you're a man and looking for a date movie with some male appeal, you'll be hard pressed to find a better one that this. It has strong writing, good acting and was executed quite well. The film's female star, Julia Roberts, didn't really have much acting to do as I recall, and now that I think of it, there was absolutely no female nudity or 'splosions of any kind. Can't figure out why I liked it, on second thought.",Notting Hill
150,~AleXa~,Charming and fulfilling in an unexpected way that reaffirms faith in true love,8,2 May 2021,"The concept of meeting a celebrity is one nary a single person in the world has not fantasized about at some point of their lives, and then the idea of that person kissing you, falling in love with you... Well that is the stuff fairy tales are made of. However, Notting Hill (2001) manages to find a way to make the fantasy a reality in a holistic and believable way that even the biggest cynics would melt for.A chance encounter finds Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), an American actress visiting England for a press tour, in a local travel book shop in Notting Hill, much to the surprise of the store owner, William Thacker (Hugh Grant). Their interactions feel natural, with Grant so effortlessly portraying a humble, considerate, every-day Joe. There is something quite endearing about a man who has every right to be star-struck, but still able to treat her like a human being, something I have always imagined means more to celebrities than the fame. Most do not take the time to think of what it must be like to be in their shoes, having to live every moment of their lives publicly, unable to do the simplest of tasks without a bodyguard or being mobbed by fans. There is a palpable chemistry between Roberts and Grant that is a vision to watch, though I would contend there has never been more chemistry than that between Roberts and Gere (i.e. Pretty Woman and Runaway Bride).The film succeeds in shining a light on this sort of life, and conveying the weight of relief and appreciation for the ability to spend even just one day as a normal person. This is shown the night Anna attends William's baby sister's birthday dinner. Other than of course his sister's momentary gushing, she comes out relatively unscathed. William is ever the charmer, always working to deescalate potentially embarrassing moments with his sly commentary. Afterwards, at Anna's behest, Anna and William scale an iron gate to break into a garden courtyard. Some beautiful moments ensue, the pinnacle of which when they sit on a bench with an inscribed dedication that read: ""For June who loved this garden, from Joseph who always sat beside her."" This one simple statement represented the type of love that both our protagonists were searching for.Perhaps part of the success of the film is that despite its far-fetched premise, it is still grounded in reality. The story feels very honest and pure, other than perhaps the predictable complication of Anna not only having a boyfriend, but him coming to town unexpectedly, conveniently timed with the precise moment she decided to have William up to her hotel room. This particular plot point seems to be unseemly on Anna's part, in effect souring their sweet romance. The writing could have been a bit more favorable, with him being her ex that just wouldn't take no for an answer and came to visit as a romantic gesture to win her back, but I'll digress. That being said, William trudges on, searching for a way to retain some semblance of dignity after taking a blow to the gut.Roberts does a spectacular job making Anna feel real and independent of herself despite how closely the role mirrors her own life, conveying the dichotomy of turmoil at her fame and desire to find some semblance of normalcy. Her overreaction to being discovered at Thacker's flat (apartment) seemed over the top from a writing perspective, but well-acted.The direction was brilliant, choosing the precise moments to slow zoom in and out, and the time lapse walk through the market was breathtaking and visionary. Filming in Notting Hill lent the film an organic quality that could not be achieved through traditional studio-filmmaking, also setting it apart from most rom-com themed endeavors. The ending in the garden on the bench symbolizing eternal love, coupled with the perfectly chosen pieces of music leaves the audience with feelings of contentment and harmony, and more importantly, serves to reaffirm the hope that anything is possible.FINAL VERDICT: The film is brilliant in its simplicity. This is the film that all romantic comedies should aspire to be, reaffirming hope, love, and that happiness is possible for anyone.",Notting Hill

But I wanted something more from the love story. More scenes together, more memories together, just more of them together.

153,Rhino Rover,Charming,8,18 July 1999,"When this movie first came out I wasn't sure if I was interested in seeing it, hence I stayed away from it for quite a while. Having nothing to do last night, I decided to go see it and I have to say that I found this movie to be incredibly charming.The story is about how a major movie star (Roberts) wanders into an obscure little travel book shop in Notting Hill one day and becomes somewhat intrigued by the shop owner (Grant) and vice versa. Through some intelligent writing, the two meet again the same day by chance and the story takes off from there. The relationship does not develop instantly as Roberts' character has to deal with her status as a major celebrity and keeps her guard up but little by little she opens up to Grant. The story continues throughout the movie showing the on again off again relationship and the awkwardness that exists as Grant tries to deal with this situation. The ending is predictable, as it is with most romantic comedies, but the journey that the audience goes through is amazingly more entertaining than the other romantic comedies that I've seen. As with other movies of this genre, it is endearing and humorous, but what separates this movie from the others, is the incredible witt of the writing. The humor is laced throughout very frequently and when you're not laughing, you're truely caught up in the emotions that the characters feel as they try to work out the awkward situation that they feel. The only criticism that I can state is that the ending seems to be wrapped up a little too neatly and hastily but that may more to do with time constraints than anything.Overall, I found this movie to be a pleasant surprise that women will definately like but men will also enjoy very much....8/10.",Notting Hill
154,terraplane,"Ah, the romance of it all...",9,29 September 2006,"Do you like a bit of romance? A bit of comedy? A bit of simple feel-good entertainment? Then look no further than Notting Hill. Here's Hugh Grant in the movie that is the perfect vehicle for his awfully-nice-but-a-bit-dim Englishman. And it works beautifully. His character lives in a little world of awfully nice people that never quite make a success of anything but they don't really care much. It's a small world of good friends, enjoying their lives, smiling at misfortune...very British. In fact, it's really quite a small movie, an ensemble piece that Hugh Grant uses to demonstrate his great talent for comedy acting. His characterisation of William is perfectly presented thanks to his natural talent for this kind of role. Of course he has played the same role many times but if that's what the director wants, then Hugh is your man. The supporting cast play their roles to perfection, some of the little cameo parts are as good as you will see anywhere. James Dreyfuss as the effete and just-a-little-bit-dim Martin is hilarious but tinged with the same resignation of failure as all the rest. Rhys Ifans plays the slightly unhinged Welshman perfectly, an extension of the part he played as one of the psychotic, drug fuelled Lewis brothers, bent on revenge in ""Twin Town"" And what of Julia Roberts? Well, she plays along with all these warm hearted British types, looking a little bit bemused but all she has to do is play herself, a Hollywood star who falls for an ordinary mortal. Which is what she did when she married Danny Moder in real life. Notting Hill is a perfect piece of romantic escapism, watch it with your loved one and enjoy the romance of it all. And when Elvis Costello sings 'She' at the end of the film, well, it brings a tear of happiness to even the most cynical of eyes. Ah, isn't it lovely!One day I'll watch it with Annushka, but I hope she doesn't fall asleep half way through it :)Ya tebya lyublu.",Notting Hill
155,Minofed,Making the Unbelievable Believable,9,25 December 2000,"It's a measure of how good this film is that it can take an unbelievable concept-a Hollywood star falls in love with a broke British bookstore owner whose wife has left him for a man who looks like Harrison Ford-and makes it believable.Julia Roberts stars as a Hollywood star who has made a series of wrong romantic choices in her life.  Part of the fun of watching ""Notting Hill"" is trying to determine whether Julia Roberts is or isn't playing Julia Roberts.Hugh Grant plays the bookstore owner, who constantly has to swallow hurt with a smile on his face. Grant works hard at making his part look easy. The fine supporting cast is led by Rhys Ifans as Grant's catastrophe of a flat mate, and Gina McKee as a former love of Grant's character's, now confined to a wheelchair.But what makes the movie is the wonderful dialog by Richard Curtis.  His writing helped make Grant a star in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral.""  Here he puts Grant on the A-list of actors.",Notting Hill

157,SamRag,Wonderful Fantasythough at times a bit too sentimental,8,23 August 2002,"What characterizes this film is good vibration and easiness in storytelling. Surprisingly fast paced for romantic comedy, with concentration on being humorous, while allowing the lead characters to build up the romance through pure chemistry.  Though it is not a downside, we have both Hugh Grant and Julie Roberts in well known parts, not displaying anything new.  What makes this film special are the extras, mostly British diamonds, similarly cast to add flavor to the story as in `Four Weddings and a Funeral'.  I especially enjoyed Rhys Ifans in the part of Spike, leaving me in stitches every time he was on screen.  If it wouldn't have been for the out of character, over sentimentally, over dramatized line from Julie Roberts close to the end of the movie, I would have considered this film worth 9/10.  However, that line was just too much.  8/10",Notting Hill

Brilliant performances with a beautifully written script. This is basically every man's fantasy to meet a beautiful woman that is out of his league, and fall in love with her.

162,consortpinguin,My Wife made me watch it.,5,12 March 2001,"""Notting Hill"" is the ultimate ""Chick Flick.""  This could have been a really good movie, but it wasn't.  What this film lacked was a plot, a script, and good acting.  The basic premise that a movie star can fall in love with an average guy is a real stretch.  I could not believe that superstar Anna Scott would fall in love with an un-rich, un-famous man, not even a handsome Englishman with that British accent and manners that Americans love.  Even if you could buy that premise, it still didn't work.  As Don Adams used to say on ""Get Smart"" -- ""Missed it by thaaaat much!""  They almost had a story line -- ""the poor little rich girl,"" i.e. that Anna Scott is famous, but fame possesses her. They almost made the point that everything in Anna's life is controlled almost down to the minute.  She has no freedom, thanks to the demands of movie making, and no private life, thanks to the tabloids.  She can't even eat a decent meal, thanks to Hollywood's obsession with thin.I'm not a particular fan of Julia Roberts, but I have seen ""Steel Magnolias,"" an excellent movie in which she proved that she can act.  And people tell me ""Erin Brockovich"" is a good movie.  However, both she and Hugh Grant slept through ""Notting Hill.""  It was really a ""star vehicle"" for Julia Roberts.  The movie was way too long, with endless close-ups of her. It was as ""heroine-worshipping"" as a Barbara Streisand star vehicle.The ""characters"" in this movie add a welcome comic relief to a dull story, especially Spike, Will's Welsh roommate.  Along with Will's family, Spike is a scream. I hope we see Rhys Ifans in more films. My wife rented this movie, and at least she liked it.  One out of two ain't bad.",Notting Hill

First, I had to suffer through the gag inducing introductory song, then had to try and make the worst pairing of leads ever work in my head (Roberts and Grant have zero chemistry), and the writing was excruciatingly boring. All I can say is I'm glad I didn't bother to waste my time watching the entire movie. If the opening scenes were that bad, it doesn't bode well for the rest. Ugh.",Notting Hill

But face it, this movie was made for a mostly American and Canadian audience ""first"" then the rest of the world.

165,benm-41751,A very enjoyable romcom with a very big flaw,6,5 May 2020,"I'm not big into romcoms but I found this one a lot more entertaining and engaging than the usual. The lead male is a very lovable guy and the lead girl is fascinating and surprises you many times. The film skips a lot of the usual ""missed connection"" and wooing portion and instead you get to enjoy a strange spark between the characters and a very funny script. The strange supporting characters that fill out a romcom can often be annoying to me, but these ones were also likeable and also have their own surprises along the way.Unfortunately, the second half of the film is premised on the lead lady's very toxic way of dealing with their relationship. And it seemed like the film was setting itself up for a very interesting end where the lead male, who up until then had been a pushover, would confront the lead lady about what she had done and evolve their relationship. Instead, the film suddenly loses all its unique charm and falls into a very standard scene of the lead male hectically running back to beg for the lead lady's hand once again. Everything the movie had built up suddenly dripped into a pile of syrup that tastes just like Love Actually or, you name it, any other bad romcom.I also have to say that for a romcom which seemed very self-aware and witty most of the way (except for the disappointing ending), the licensed music was noticeably bad. It really pulled you away from what were supposed to be the most romantic moments.I enjoyed Notting Hill and definitely recommend it as a more interesting and funny romcom than most, but I lament the ways it was sabotaged from being a great movie.",Notting Hill

Extremely charming and amusing, he is.  Rhys Ifans comes as close to stealing a film as a supporting actor can, he was perfect.  Gee, did I mention Julia Roberts?  I'm not really a fan, but I thought she was very appealing in the role. The ensemble cast was also very well put together, the writing fresh and very funny.  Go ahead and see it, you'll like it.",Notting Hill
167,DesbUK,The least interesting of the Richard Curtis/Hugh Grant trilogy.,5,16 March 2011,"In its day (1999), the most successful British film ever. NOTTING HILL arrived in cinemas and on video in 1999 as the follow up to FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL: it featuring the same star (Hugh Grant), producers and screenwriter (Richard Curtis). The director this time is Roger Michell. It's the weakest of Curtis's trilogy of Hugh Grant/London comedies (the other being LOVE ACTUALLY).Grant plays William, a modest London bookseller who falls in love with Hollywood goddess Anna (Julia Roberts, really playing a version of herself) currently working in the capital. A better movie might have been made about the relationship between Grant his scruffy lodger Spike (Rhys Ifans) - a sort of contemporary odd couple since Spike steals every scene he appears in. Instead, we get a predictably clean, summertime and glossy London that is purged of any parochial references the Americans might not understand. When the film fails to interest us, it is kept alive by a good supporting cast including Gina Mckee, Emma Chambers and Hugh Bonneville. Best moment is a coup-de-cinema where the passage of six months is evoked by a single tracking shot of William walking through a street market whilst the climate turns from sun to rain to snow to sun and a pregnant woman at the start of the shot is a mother at the end of it. It's a quite wonderful and utterly cinematic moment in a film which is never more than acceptable from a screenplay designed to appeal and charm.",Notting Hill
168,jackcwelch23,A Rom com that works because it's actually romantic and runny,8,30 August 2017,"The simplicity and the earnestness make up for the occasional finger in mouth moments. Richard Curtis just likes it light, but the film stands up above other love movies because it has genuine heart rather than manufactured sap. You just feel the difference while watching. Gets high marks for making Anna Scott an indecisive and confused person trying her best rather than a perfect manic pixie dream girl. This is also Hugh Grant's best performance, while many would rather say about a boy I think he just gets every beat and moment right here, we just like him from the get go because he's just some bloke who wants love, with obstacles both big and small getting in the way. It manages to make us care about these two, which was the only goal it really needed to accomplish. It also supplies us with really likable and witty supporting characters who make the film even funnier than it needs to be, although Notting Hill isn't as whimsical a neighbourhood as portrayed here it's a charming name so why not set it there? Escapism what this movie gives us, and i was more than happy to spend 2 hours with Will and Anna.",Notting Hill
169,obiwan2005,Works on so many levels,9,17 November 2003,"""Notting Hill"" is actually a very funny movie in it's own right. But that's not what it's about. Julia Roberts plays Anna Scott, a huge celebrity that can't get any privacy. This is perfect casting, because if you want someone to pull off acting and getting treated like a celebrity, cast a celebrity. It really makes the movie seem believable. She meets a funny Englishman named Will Thacker (Hugh Grant) and the two spark a romance. The scenes where they are supossed to be in love with each other are very convincing (at least on Roberts' end). And it didn't fall into the stereotype of a movie about a celebrity. Sure, we see the papparazzi chase her and stress her out. But the movie isn't about that. It's about the way an average ordinary man who can get the pretty popular girl, which in turn shows the audience that social status means nothing. And if you let it, love can help you find your perfect mate. At least that's what I got out of it. Writer Richard Curtis is a gift from the movie gods. His writing is so fresh and funny. He combines the 2 things that make life worth living (Comedy and Love) and puts it on the screen. It's hard to be funny. Try writing a funny screenplay! But he makes it look so easy. Britain should really import more movies state side.RATING: *** out of ****",Notting Hill
170,DrewAlexanderR1,One of the Best,9,27 August 2015,"Notting Hill is one of the best romantic comedies out there. The reason for its status is the well written story, the dialogue, and the actors.The film tells the story of a simple travel bookshop owner (Hugh Grant) who meets a famous movie star (Julia Roberts) when she walks in his shop. And it goes on to show the resulting relationship that starts from this point. The story follows the guidelines of most romantic comedies but it does so with its own flair. The dialogue is very sharp and the characters' conversations with each other are either thought provoking or laugh inducing.The chemistry between the actors on this film was perfect. Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant dazzled in the lead roles. They make the audience care for each of the character's storyline no matter where the story takes them. The supporting cast compliments the main characters immensely. Rhys Ifans as Spike, Hugh Grant's flatmate, is comedic genius. Notting Hill is one of the best romantic comedies because it is so much more than just that label. The film sucks in the audience and at the end gives the viewer something more than just laughs and a happy ending. It gives the viewer insight and hope. I don't want to explain why because you should watch the film and find out for yourself.",Notting Hill
171,Euphorbia,"Redeemed by Roberts, but might have been much better",9,16 February 2003,"Part of what defines Julia Roberts as a star, is that her presence in a deeply flawed movie can make it worth watching. This is true of Erin Brockovich, of Conspiracy Theory, and most especially of Notting Hill.
The director of Notting Hill hopes we will buy the transformation of his supporting players from two-dimensional slapstick loser-clowns to real people, but this lazy device can never work, at least not for me (this same flaw weakens Clint Eastwood's 'Heartbreak Ridge'). Let the characters be 'real' from the beginning. We will get their flaws, and their inner strength, without being whacked over the head. If Notting Hill were to have been made with the same two stars (Roberts & Grant), but with the realistic supporting characters and London atmosphere of 'Wonderland' (1999, a weak movie with only supporting roles, but no center), along with the skillful romantic direction that Sidney Lumet brought to 'Running on Empty' (1988, an infinitely better movie, with a similar romantic plot to Notting Hill), this could have been a great film.
As made, Notting Hill is still worth watching, although the flaws severely weaken the romantic effect -- like sardine frosting on a chocolate cake. 7.4/10",Notting Hill
172,Euphorbia,Take 2 (Take 1 Date: 16 February 2003),9,2 October 2004,"I have since purchased this movie on DVD, and watched it several more times. The supporting characters who make up William Thacker's (Hugh Grant's) world seem a bit less freakish with greater familiarity. Moreover I now ""get the point"" that Thacker's genuine love for, and patient acceptance of, all these zany people -- even the shoplifter -- is precisely what Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) finds so appealing about him. He is that rare sort of guy who would love her and accept her, no matter what changes fate and time should bring. He would also love their children with equal if not greater devotion, not just because they are his, but because that is how he treats everyone in his life. Perhaps this was a type of love that Scott had not realized was possible for her, something she had not even known to want until her chance meetings with Thacker. And this explains why she took such reckless risks to woo him.Now that I ""get it,"" I really like it. *Directors, even more than writers, confront a paradox of timing. They spend endless hours, weeks, and months planning, shooting, cutting, and tweaking a film, growing deeply intimate with every detail, including the ones left out. But they must ultimately release their movie in a form that is perfectly comprehensible and engaging to the audience, so that people for whom it is all brand new can still get the whole thing in one unbroken take (there ain't no pause buttons in the multiplex). At least with a book (and now with DVDs) the consumer can re-read a passage or replay a line that did not connect the first time. But movies are still made for theaters, and must work there the first time, in real time. The best movies do work the first time, but also reward repeat viewing with enhanced pleasure and deeper insight. But some very good movies, including this one, can only be fully appreciated after several viewings. This is yet another reason to be grateful for DVDs. 9/10",Notting Hill
173,kbouck,"Very predicaable and not too ""charming"" or funny.",6,15 November 1999,I was overall not too impressed with this movie. I found it to be very predictable and not too funny as well. Julia Roberts plays an actress- Anna Scott- who is filming a movie in London and meets a normal Joe named William and they develop a romance. I didnt think the love story between William and Anna was well developed at all. She was a total bitch to him and any normal guy would have dropped her like a bad habit instead of being such a chump. Spike the roommate was funny but hard to believe a guy could be that big of a dork in real life. The ending was typical and very predictable. I give this movie 6/10.,Notting Hill
174,blade-21,Light and Amusing,8,30 May 1999,"The movie is a light and amusing romantic comedy. A thoroughly enjoyable modern fairytale! It transports the viewer into a world where love overcomes. There is little point in looking for deep meanings in the movie - it is simply but effectively, a light hearted acting out of the archetypal situation in which a member of the public falls in love with a celebrity. The lines ""This fame thing isn't real..."" ""I'm just a girl looking at a boy and asking him to love her"", as spoken by Julia Roberts did seem to come from the heart though. I wonder if she really believes this herself ? Mmmmm maybe there's hope for me yet.....!",Notting Hill
175,Big O-7,What can I say? JULIA is back,8,11 November 1999,"This film is really quite special.  It is a film that promises only one thing, and delivers.  Not many films can actually claim that.  This one promises a funny, snuggly kind of romantic-comedy, and it does deliver. Julia Roberts is perfectly cast as a superstar trying to deal with the aspect of fame.  I have a theory that in any movie starring Ms. Roberts, the co-stars take 5th seat and back, because Ms. Roberts is a genuine superstar (one of those special people that only walk on the earth every few decades or so) in the Marilyn Monroe tradition, one who just becomes so charismatic that no mere mortal stands a chance (look what happened to Richard Gere in RUNAWAY BRIDE).  She is wonderful in this movie.  But does all this mean that the rest of the cast does not matter ... well, almost.  But the always game Mr. Grant and his co-conspirators all do add to the film, and with Ms. Roberts leading the way, they bring this one home solid.",Notting Hill
176,ashi-lance,Notting Hill'99,7,7 February 2013,"It was a pleasant, simple and mostly implausible romantic comedy about a famous fictional actress and the man that loves her. A romantic comedy starring Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts is not normally my sort of thing but sometimes, a good girlie film such as ""Notting Hill"" can be just what the doctor ordered. ""Notting Hill"" is one of those movies for people who appreciate the particular British sense of humor. British humor is a full plate, let's face it. This movie, when it comes to humor, romance and simplicity, is at the same level of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Bridget Jones Diary"", which makes it a good alternative to these movies. Although it contains some vocabulary of discussable taste, it isn't profane at all and doesn't contain dirty humor which makes this a much more intelligent movie.The characters here are interesting and humorous, without being great (in fact they deliver an ordinary performance especially Julia Roberts). The supporting characters, on the other hand, have more depth than I expected. Unfortunately, it's not their story. Nevertheless, the actor who portrays Spike is who makes this movie so hilarious. Spike is so goofy, so silly and so humorous - congratulations to the actor (Rhys Ifans) who played him, 'cause he did a perfect job for this kind of role. I really didn't like the overuse of pop music in the film, especially the overblown music used to bookend the film. It felt a little tacked on or inorganic to the soul of the film and almost seems to try to ""sell"" the scene as emotionally related to the piece of selected music. In terms of romantic comedy, this film basically gets the touchstones right. There are quirky, but fleshed out supporting characters. Silly scenarios are quite good. It's cute enough to be smile- making funny, albeit nothing laugh-out-loud. It's likable.My Rating - 7/10",Notting Hill

The relationships share an inner warmth and a very wholesome humour.  I am not much of a fan of Julia Roberts (a fair actress but too many teeth and too artificially emaciated for my taste) but she is good in this, even ideal for the role. The Hugh Grant character is similar to that in 4WF, though his emotional range seems stilted somehow.  More anger would certainly have been justified in a number of scenes.  And the climactic press conference scene is a bit cliched, though it works well.  But this is nit-picking.  The film is very enjoyable and extremely funny in places.  Definitely a must see.",Notting Hill
179,MundaneNoodle,Incredibly beautiful Roberts is a distraction,8,18 April 2000,"Let's face it. Julia is naturally stunning. Yet I am sure the producers took extra effort to make her look goddess-like in every single frame and camera angle. The lighting is always optimal on her, her outfits are flattering and perfect. Makeup, hairstyle, yaddah yaddah yaddah. Well, I found it distracting to the story. Was all this lookism so absolutely crucial to the film? It seems like the film depends on Roberts looking like Helen of Troy to make the viewer care about her and Grant's character.It was a funny film though, Thacker's flatmate Spike, is wonderful comic relief, in an otherwise predictable film. Yes, I said predictable. *SPOILER* (not really though) Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy marries girl. As if there was any doubt. The lesson? Don't ignore true love. Ho-hum. I would have preferred it that Thacker goes with his decision to not stay with the movie star, that their lives are just too different, rather than drive willy-nilly all over town to get her back. Again, how many times have we seen that before? I will say that Robert's and Grant's chemistry is great.

She's just sweet enough and moody enough here to be believeable. Of course this vehicle is designed specifically for Hugh Grant, and enough time has passed since the unfortunate ""LA hooker"" episode for everyone to forget and forgive.

At any rate, a first rate little comedy.When you listen to the DVD commentary you find out that most of the exposition on the other characters (the friends) has been cut out - I wish the filmmakers would rerelease a version with this put back in (assuming it was shot and not cut from the script itself).

187,Movieguy-47,Charming and Enjoyable,7,6 August 1999,"Roger Michell's ""Notting Hill,"" from a screenplay by Richard (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"") Curtis is a charming, engaging little movie that fortunately gets saddled with two stars with real chemistry. Julie Roberts plays, somewhat ironically, a famous American movie star who, through a series of enjoyable contrivances, keeps running into a foppish, handsome travel bookstore owner (played by Hugh Grant). The screenplay is rather stereotypical, but Curtis doesn't write these two characters off; they are intelligent, literate, and we get a sense that they truly fall for one another. My major quip towards the film was that I did not care for the ending; it's the same old thing and, frankly, I'm getting a little tired of it. Rated PG-13. 123 minutes. 7 out of 10.",Notting Hill
188,alex-278,A warm and funny film,10,10 June 1999,"Some say it is a companion film to 4 weddings and a funeral and I suppose it is - it has the same wit and same gentleness.  Some parts are predictable, where the Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts break up and then make up under the scrutiny of the world's media - this is typically American and like a ""Fish Called Wanda"" it needs to pander to this market.  This aspect was missing from ""4 Weddings....""  nonetheless it is a very funny film and has the appropriate ending to make us feel really good.  Go see it..I will be seeing it again.",Notting Hill

190,Boris-57,"Art can break your heart; or, I'm a softie",9,21 March 2004,"What can I say? Despite the fact that my brother, an outgoing fitness-instructor drooling at Mel Gibson films, thinks I belong, seemingly voluntarily, to the group of slightly socially inhibited self-proclaimed intellectuals requiring a cerebrally sound reason for loving a film (or anything else for that matter), and cannot appreciate anything not directed by an Uzbekistani with one leg off, I actually like this film to bits.Technically this film isn't 'great' when it comes to images, so it falls short there. But, despite me always telling that films should be about images and only books should involve stories, I have no problem completely ignoring any of my own gibberish and cry out that this is, and you bl***y well believe it, one of the greatest films ever made.Never have the seemingly superficial emotions that well up from the Deep Good been so efficiently shoved down our throats. I saw it only fairly recently for the first time and was immediately hooked, by the lines, the story, the flow, and the absolutely nuclear power that flows from the faces of the Grant and Roberts. I wasn't really pro-Roberts and still think she invariably stars in the wrong pictures, but here she's nothing less than grand. I won't comment on Hugh Grant since, probably to balance out my love for Werner Herzog films, my brain has decided to like him to bits as an actor. My girlfriend keeps suggesting I might have a queer spark there, but she shouldn't complain, since I've been with her for 11 years.The fact that they can shine though, is, apart from their dialogue, entirely due to the exquisite cast surrounding them. I like Tim McInnerny a lot, but Gina McKee is a real treat here. Not only does she beam the love that Grant lacks, but she's a stunningly gorgeous woman as well.Romance, love, sunny London, it all smells of the profoundly bizarre or utterly impossible, but it all works. This is the film that Joyce would have ended Ulysses with: Yes!",Notting Hill
191,ProperCharlie,A cross between Close Encounters and Jean de Florette.,6,16 February 2002,"As a thirty-something male, I don't expect I was in the key demographic the producers were thinking of when they made this movie.  I'm supposed to be the guns, cars and action brigade.  I do have my sensitive side and I do like to indulge it occasionally.  Besides I do see a niche for films to take women I fancy to.  This all might explain how I've come to see this film on three separate occasions.And lovely it is.  Julia Roberts has fun playing herself.  Hugh Grant has fun playing Hugh Grant again.  Richard Curtis has fun writing for Hugh Grant again.  The plot meanders its gentle way to the conclusion you paid for when you bought the ticket.  Everyone smiles and thinks how wonderful true love is as the credits roll.  Warm feelings inside all round.That's just it though.  This film sticks to an established formula and rakes in the cash.  It does so in a stylish manner with well-rounded corners and lots of polish.  It's the rom-com equivalent of Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven. It does exactly what it says on the tin, no more, no less.  Maybe I'm being picky for pickiness sake.  If I am, so be it.I'm glad to see that Hugh Grant is moving on to less Hugh-Granty roles.  I'm really looking forward to seeing him in About A Boy soon.  I hope Richard Curtis can move on to, he can be brilliant (cf Blackadder) and I would hate to see him stuck in a rut.Go and see for smiles, romance and Rhys Ifans in his pants.",Notting Hill

193,J. Ryan,"Surprisingly, not that bad.",8,28 December 1999,"I have seen enough films to recognize formula.  Notting Hill is completely formula, right down to the contrived ending.  For those who expect me to begin my verbal assault on the shortcomings of this film, all I can say is: It's really not that bad.That being said, the architects of Notting Hill anchor the film on 2 points -- the chemistry of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, and the charm of Hugh's supportive friends.  Fortunately, this approach seems to have succeeded.Roberts deserves special mention.  While Grant cruises through the film on his self-effacing demeanor, Roberts does and exceptional job of portraying a vulnerable Hollywood superactress.  The scene of her at dinner describing the fleeting nature fame and celebrity comes across uncomfortably sincere and incredibly believable.  Roberts sells the film.I realize that the minute I buy a ticket for a film, I am essentially allowing myself to sit through a familiar ride.  Notting Hill is a ride that yields no surprises, but because of its innocent charm, it is actually very pleasant to watch.  You'll be impressed.",Notting Hill
194,Liedzeit,Blitzsieg,10,13 August 1999,"One of the songs I hated most in the seventies was ""She"" by Charles Aznavour. And now hearing this at the beginning of Notting Hill with the image of Anna Scott/Julia Roberts makes me nearly faint. It is incredible beautiful. It sets the mood. I knew after 20 seconds that I would love the movie. That is something that only happened once before with ""Trading places"" and there the music was by Mozart. Why did it happen again with Aznavour? I don«t know. It is magic.If there is something wrong with the film it is that it is too perfect. There is not one bad scene in it. Never too slow never too fast. At first viewing I thought that the young ladies William«s friend introduce to him were a little off. But at second time I found that even these scenes worked. So it is a little bit synthetic. They tried to take everything from Four Weddings without really repeating themselves. All clichs are avoided. And that is something you feel and it made me just a little bit uncomfortable. But if it is done as brilliantly as that I do not mind at all.Although I do not like Julia Roberts that much Notting Hill was in a way even better than Four Weddings. And not because of Spike but because the character Hugh plays is better developed. Playing a young man who is shy (and polite) and at the same time witty he is totally believable. This is something only Hugh Grant can do. Along with Cary he is the only actor who really gets away with the fact that he is handsome (from a male point of view). Robert Redford for example or Clint Eastwood just seem to be too much in love with themselves to be endured. If I were a woman I would probably fall in love with someone like Jimmy Stuart but if the man had to be handsome only the Grants would be eligible. Others like Paul Newman or Gregory Peck look great without being annoying but they are too much like gods. You would not really want to be with them.One thing Notting Hill has adopted from Four Weddings is that the female character is not as pure, ""good"" as the male and that one can still understand why our hero loves her. And when Julia makes her ""I am just a girl"" speech I had tears in my eye. Rule of thumb: Any film that makes me cry gets a 10.I had the good luck to watch the film in the original at first time. Normally a film does not loose much being dubbed. (Woody Allen is supposed to have said that the German voice fits his character better than his own and I certainly agree, same would be true for Robert deNero for example.) But Hugh«s timing is so exact that in this case the original is twice as good. But even the German version would get a 10 easily.",Notting Hill
195,Artêmis,Why is Notting Hill so special?,10,2 November 1999,"If you ask me why I've given 10 for Notting Hill I'll not be able explain. Is Notting Hill a masterpiece? No, for sure no. Is Notting Hill genial? No. Is Notting Hill a different style of romantic-comedy? No. New style? No. But even thinking that Notting Hill is only another romantic-comedy, I've given it a 10. And there are some movies that I've given 9 that are better than Notting Hill...!Well, I think that the ""problem"" is that you don't see anything bad in it, it's very hard to find something that could make you give a lower rate to this movie. First of all, the cast is great. Julia Roberts is in her best performance, Hugh Grant is very nice and Emma Chambers and Rhys Ifans are VERY funny. The screenplay is good too, and romantic (I love romance). But in fact, I think that the ""problem"" is that Notting Hill is English! Before watching it, I was thinking: ""My God! Another American romantic-comedy with Julia Roberts. I've already watched My Best Friend Wedding and I don't want to watch the same style of story again and again"". But when I discovered that NH is an English movie I started to think about it in a different way. I love English movies! But that's unfair. No, that's not the ""problem"" too.
In fact, what I think is that Notting Hill is one fun, relaxing and beauty movie that you watch and stop thinking about your problems. While you're watching it you forget everything and pay attention only in the story. You know, it's very hard to happen in movies nowadays, make the spectator pay attention. When the movie ends, you want to give it a 10, it's like magic. In summary, NH is the kind of movie which you say: Watch it and have fun!",Notting Hill

199,shevaunhodge,British films are the best,10,5 April 2019,"Such a heart warming film. Yes the story line is cheesy, but you end up loving it. This is probably because Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts are so talented and pull of their rolls so well . They also have two other very famous actors that are brilliant. These people being Emma Chamber and Rys Ifan. Also, from what I can read on google most of the other actors are very famous and talented also which probably also adds the how good the film is. The meaning behind the story is that just because someone is famous doesn't mean they are not normal like everyone else. Like Anna Scott states in the film, she says something like ""The whole fame thing is fake really. I'm just a girl who likes a boy"". This film will send a much needed message to young people these days that famous people are just normal people and are no different to anybody else. Yes there are benefits to being famous making lots of money, meeting other famous people, doing all the things you dreamed of. However, the down falls can have dramatic effects on the person. I mean if you were famous you could't just go out for a casual stroll with your hair a mess and no makeup on because you would probably end up with your face plastered all over some silly magazine and this film highlights this. This film is heart warming with also a good humor all the way through. You must see it.",Notting Hill
200,suze-4,Plodding direction spoils this otherwise sweet film,5,17 January 2000,"This movie has realistic and cozy apartment and shop sets. A lot of care was taken with the details of the background. And some of the supporting characters are good. Those are the best things I can say about Notting Hill.Overall experience: disappointing, but I blame the director most of all. With two stars of proven charm and talent, and a fairly cute storyline, there is no other explanation for the fact that this movie moves slowly and is boring nearly all the way through. The slow pacing was completely wrong. It should have been a vibrant screwball comedy with touches of pathos, and  dialogue whipping by a mile a minute instead of spoken like it was War and Peace.You keep hoping for something to happen but only get a few interesting scenes and a lot of filler. Also, much of the dialogue is mumbled.The premise needed to be set up properly to be believable:  a famous movie star meets an ordinary guy and they fall in love. It could have worked if it had been done right. It just seemed like no one really tried.If this is the biggest star in the world she would not have that flat, dark hair dye. It's about all you can focus on during the whole movie as it stands out like a sore thumb. Actresses move heaven and earth to get a shine in their hair even if they have to dye it for a role. You don't see movie stars with fake looking, dull hair. But except for the brief scenes from her movies and the newspaper photos, ""Anna"" has the same matte, straight, lank hair you would expect in a gritty drama about prison. She also has almost no makeup on.  Therefore it is impossible to suspend disbelief and accept her as a movie star even though it's Julia Roberts! The thing about Julia is she doesn't look like a movie star. It takes a lot of makeup to make her look that way and they did not try. Take Pretty Woman. It was a truly unbelievable plot, yet you could suspend disbelief, get into it and enjoy it, because it was played so intensely. They had fun making that movie and it showed. Both Julia and Hugh have been hilarious and charming in other films so there is no excuse for the flatness of this movie. It all comes down to poor direction, inadequate dialogue and lack of any real character development.The only fresh and funny characters were in supporting roles, but these were all too brief, just interludes and relief from the somber romance/non-romance that was supposed to be going on.Over an hour of plodding, predictable events - then suddenly it comes to life like a Pink Panther movie. There's a spark of emotion and some action! But it fizzles out into a standard Hollywood sunset.I thought for sure this would be better than Runaway Bride, which I felt was average. But no, it is not even as good. You never can tell.Julia and Hugh deserve better movies than this. Put unknowns in their roles and it would have sunk like a stone. People went just to see them, and tried to find something good to say about it. But the emperor has no clothes!
No originality, no charisma displayed by either star, in a story that never moves you, except for five minutes near the end (Did they get a guest director for that segment? It doesn't fit in with the rest).",Notting Hill
201,niteman,"Startingly original, nicely familiar Romantic Comedy.",9,7 June 1999,"Unlike soft-focus confections like ""You've Got Mail"" (which was more about the love between a consumer and large corporations than Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan), Notting Hill has a bit of an edge to it which serves the movie well. Grant and Roberts get to zing each other with all sorts of wonderfully hilarious dialog before the inevitable happens, and the cast of supporting characters (including a wheelchair-bound first love and a sad-sack stockbroker) keep the movie grounded and the sap quotient to a minimum. Perhaps the most astonishing thing, however, is the camerawork.  The director takes some chances -- jump cuts, one exceptional scene in which four seasons swirl around Grant's character as he walks down a London street -- that pay off big time.  This is a movie that was basically presold. Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts are huge box-office draws, and the words 'romantic comedy' and Julia Roberts together are pure gold.  It is refreshing, therefore, to find a well-written script, great performances from all involved, and some creative risk-taking.All in all, an excellent romantic comedy, a great date movie, and if you're single like me, another great excuse to stare at the bottle of sleeping pills and wonder how many it would take.",Notting Hill

204,49235781,Sweet Film,10,7 August 1999,"Notting Hill proves one thing -- jokes lie in the oddest places.  This film is an excellent vehicle for Julia Roberts to put her own life as an actress under the microscope.  While Roberts' ""Anna Scott"" character isn't an autobiographical figure, the Scott character allows for some biting satire at the life of Roberts herself.  Need I mention some excellent one liners in the film like the sister of Hugh Grant... ""I feel like we are sisters"", an excellent throw-back to ""My Best Friend's Wedding""...  or my favourite, a discussion about nude body doubles just before a nude Julia Roberts (or a Julia Roberts body double) crosses the screen.Apart from the small bit of satire, Grant's character plays on the emotions of every guy who has ever unexplainably fell in to, threw orange juice-on, lost out on, and fell back in to love.  Roberts character can only help us understand how such a relationship as the one her and Grant share in the movie, could be ""Surreal, but nice.""A sweet film surely not to be missed!",Notting Hill
205,cemk-2,"Usual romantic comedy, but great screenplay.",8,6 January 2000,"""Notting Hill"" is an interesting romantic comedy, with two nice differences: Firstly, it is very well written, nearly as cleverly and as good as ""Analyze This"" and ""As Good As It Gets."" The relationships in the film are usual (half-witted but nice young man, beautiful and rich and clever but down-to-earth young woman, interesting but clueless bunch of friends, odd flatmate, close bond among a group of losers, funny helper at the shop...) to see in a romantic comedy (e.g., Pillow Talk had such interesting and actually non-existing but believable people), and the formula is pretty straightforward: Impossible love becomes possible after a series of strange events. Yet, the relationship between the people in the film and the lines they are delivering (Hugh Grant's ""Surreal but nice"" was a gem, so was the story about honey-soaked apricots and every word off of the mouth of Spike the subtenant) are wonderfully planned. The texture of the story is really wonderfully woven and fits together enormously well. You believe the story the screenwriter tells you, because it is easy to believe that such a story might actually have taken place. Secondly, the acting is brilliant. Hugh Grant is really believable as the half-witted holiday-bookshop owner and Julia Roberts shines in this performance (well, she sort of plays her real self, the international superstar, does she not?), yet the supporting cast, most from favourite TV series of Britain (from ""Thin Blue Line"" to ""the Vicar of Dibley"") are excellent. At the end, because of these two reasons, a film which tells you a run-of-the-mill fairytale becomes a real gem of a story to watch. It is easy and fun to watch, it is believable, and it is really funny nearly all the time. ""Notting Hill"" is a must see and I really mean it.",Notting Hill
206,rwncopeland,Beauty,10,21 November 2020,"Wow this was amazing. I think this could easily be one of my favourite romantic comedies. The comedy was hilarious and the romance was beautiful.Like with Pretty Woman, it had that class difference and it's such a strong element in these films. William is a bookseller, barely making any money to keep the store open. Anna is an actress and made $15 million in her last film. However, money doesn't stop them from falling in love. In fact, Anna makes all this money and couldn't find happiness, and William without her was stuck in an endless loop of living with no meaning. However, their paths cross and their lives are changed forever.I need to mention how good these ending scenes are in these romantic comedies. They all have the same premise with the one chasing after the other, but every time it's very special and takes your heart away.Normally this genre doesn't do anything special in cinematography but I think this film did a great job, having a lot of rememberable scenes. There were a few continuity errors, however the editor always prioritised emotion and there couldn't be nothing more important.After watching this I've realised that romance/ romantic comedies are my favourite type of film.

Very intimidated and scared out of his mind.Every time he was around Julia - he seemed so intimidated by her - it was very very sweet.Even after she told him she loved him - he was the same way. Couldn't make up his mind.The ending was perfect. Very high strung and at the same time very low key.

209,microbonnie,Entertaining...ok for a chick flick,6,6 June 1999,"As I said to my friend as I left Notting Hill, I tend to like Julia Roberts movies, despite the fact that she plays the same character in every one. The same indignant stare and the same hurt-about-to-cry gulp, for example. Her revelatory, heartwrenching speeches all strike the same chord in my mind.  But that's okay, because I like her style for some reason, and I almost always enjoy watching her films, at least while they are taking place.  Notting Hill was no different.  I laughed hard, I enjoyed the plot for the most part, and the eccentric characters.  But I left thinking, ""mediocre.""  Why?  Well, the cheese factor, for one.  I know this is a love story, but PLEASE.  They concentrated WAY too much on that, and way too little on what I thought would be the interesting part.  They should have put more media hassle in there.  There was this one cool artistic scene with Hugh Grant walking through the streets and the seasons.  That was neat. Also, I mean, the characters were pretty good.  It may have been more effective NOT to use a real high name actress to play the part, but then again, it was easy to relate.

212,ReviewingHistory,"A sweet--overly sweet, perhaps--funny and endearing experience",7,13 July 2020,"Notting Hill offers a sweet and endearing experience to viewers. At times, an experience that feels overly sweet, and excessively endearing, but sweet regardless. The film portrays the classic story of a wealthy, famous, and hard-to-reach damsel (Anna Scott, played by Julia Roberts), sought after by a mortal, common plebeian (William Thacker, played by Hugh Grant). And despite the themed cliché, the narrative offers some twists and turns, some overly dramatized, while others unusual, that play with the heart of the viewer, offers some smiles from time to time, and some unbelief as well.But still, all expectations aside, viewers will know, pretty much, what they will witness at the end of the film, and will wonder if that was really the most realistic picture that could have been. Most interestingly, the film could have offered a deeper and more substantial exploration of the characters was warranted: who really was Anna Scott, and who really was William Thacker remained as elusive as Anna's smiles and William's chase thereafter. Certainly, it could have offered a more endearing experience, and a more memorable one, too, if more conversations as that of William's sister's birthday party were featured. That way, one wouldn't end the film knowing almost as little about the characters as one knew in the beginning.Regardless, perhaps that was not the point of the writers and directors. Perhaps the capturing of viewer's attention with the looks of the characters was meant to drive sales and story. But still, to those looking for a change of scenery from mostly U.S. based films, Notting Hill offers a nice peak into neighborhoods and sceneries of England.",Notting Hill

His dialogue is authentic, witty, charming, and brisk. His writing is deceptively brilliant. Read through the screenplay and you will see what I'm talking about. This is British comedy and romance at its best. Curtis' other films are among my favorites, too, including ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" ""Bridget Jones' Diary,"" and ""Love Actually.""How else do you explain a little British film that makes you understand, love, and want to be among the Brits?

Hugh Grant with his bewildered blue eyes and Julia Roberts with her smile etc etc (and Rhys ""Spike"" with his utter lack of hygiene). Anyway, there was too much of the staring thing and not enough acceleration although I guess they had to hide the fact that it was really just ""together apart together apart together"" the whole time.

He's the kind of flatmate you wouldn't want to have and that's what makes him so endearing.The film is full of hilarious, and quotable, lines, especially from Spike. His scenes are so laugh out funny it hurts! However, the best line is at the end when William and his family are chasing down Anna, and Max exclaims 'James Bond never has to put up with this sort of s**t!' The only part of the film I didn't enjoy was when William does several interviews while posing as a magazine editor; it simply isn't funny and just drags on. Despite that, Notting Hill is a very enjoyable romantic comedy and one that can still make me laugh on repeated viewings.",Notting Hill
219,snaunton,"Predictable, witty, charming, super cast - Oh... and English!",7,7 November 1999,"I enjoyed this film from first to last.  But then, I would.  An English expatriate watching his city, watching all those amusing, articulate, silly ass, Brits, that give Americans such a strange notion of us.  And that one stunning American, Julia Roberts, liking our city and its people, too.  How could I not enjoy it.  Hmmm....Well, from the moment Anna Scott walks into the bookshop, the plot is predictable.  We are given very little data to explain why the two leading characters are as they are, and not much to explain their attraction to each other.  Indeed, there is not much explanation of anything; part of its English charm are the long silences, the pauses in the rhythm of the action, as in Grant's manner of speech.  Perhaps with such an obvious plot, explanation or any attempt at elaboration would have been banal.  Perhaps that is why the real glory of the film (after, that is, Miss Roberts' radiant smile) is the eccentric collection of supporting roles, each perfectly played, although Rhys Evans's Spike deserves to be singled out as impeccably offbeat.  Miss Roberts, too, deserves appreciation for a precision in phrasing that turns the rather stock character she plays into something more interesting.  Grant, though, really does need to lift himself from that English middle class bemusement that seems his only manner, whether he is in contemporary London, in Jane Austen's West Country, or Norman Lindsay's early 20th century Australia.Certainly a well-made and enjoyable film, but the principal protagonists should go on and do more and better things, as I sense they can.",Notting Hill
220,PJ-52,"It's Good, not your typical romantic comedy!",7,23 June 1999,"Notting Hill packs some surprises. The lead (Hugh Grant) goes through a lot of turmoil to finally, get the girl (Julia Roberts). On one hand, I liked the way his character, William, acted toward, Anna Scott. He didn't go all gooey over her star status. I thought is was good at first. But, when he finally realises that she likes to be with him, he doesn't go out of his way to keep her.There isn't a whole lot of chemistry going on between the two of them either. It's like ""Okay, let's have dinner. Or Okay let's jump this fence."" Not much passion there.The supporting cast is great, I especially like Bella, William's wheelchair bound ex-lover. His welsh flatmate was at times too far-fetched. (Jar Jar-esque)Overall it was a good movie, with character and plot something that's missing in most films these days!",Notting Hill

The plots are almost always the same but good dialogue and chemistry between the actors make all the difference, and the actors here have great chemistry, from Grant & Roberts, down to the Hotel Manager. The screenwriters here deserve a lot of credit for creating the interesting characters and providing the actors with dialogue that works on all levels. I know that a lot of people will say this type of movie has been done before, but if it's done well people should still enjoy it.
I gave this movie 8 of 10 stars.",Notting Hill

Real life Roberts fits the character, but this wasn't one of her better performances.  Romantic it wasn't.  Comedy?  A few funny moments. (the T shirts being the best).   Writers tend to get away with murder in sequels.  Perhaps they don't need to try so hard once they've made it.   The soundtrack was the best part of this tedious film.",Notting Hill
226,rock_rishab,Somthings are better left Unexplained,10,3 February 2009,"Well there are many people asking questions like, ""Why would someone like Hugh like Julia, in this movie"", well that's the beauty of it, when someone falls in love, it doesn't matter how bad or good the other person is. It only matters what the other person is to you. Sometimes they are cruel, sometimes sweet, but who likes whom, how can we define?The jokes in this movie aren't all perfectly timed, and that's what that makes it more realistic. OK not all parts were realistic, but this is a very sweet and heart warming story. Its a story of hope, which we lately need a lot of. Hugh grant was the best thing in this film, his weird way of saying things and strangely accepting every unintentional crap his roommate threw at him, and the way he dealt with it (like the glasses scene) was hilarious. All in all this is one of my all time favorite Romantic Comedies. Especially the bench scene in the park, where Julia says ""Sit with me"", with Ronan Keiting singing in the back, ""When you say nothing at all"", was truly the scene to remember.....First, truly fall in love then try this again.....",Notting Hill
227,buff-18,"Hip, funny, romantic, refreshing!",9,27 July 1999,"I love Notting Hill. Hugh Grant is by far one of my least favorite actors but I love him in this romantic comedy. It was a refreshing movie to see and I enjoyed every minute of it. Dynamic dialogue, interesting situations, lots a laughs, and lots of love. Julia Roberts is awesome and i can tolerate and even enjoy hugh grant in this flick. Go see this with your girlfriend, guys. It's romantic like they want and hilarious too!

The story is plain simple, but the good script, charming romance and strong and interesting supporting cast, it enriched the simple plot. The sound track and musical score is also pretty good. Compare to Pretty Woman and My Best Friend Wedding this film is better.The film may lack of Hype of Titanic or awards, but the romance is better and more unique, more solid cast, smoother acting and more interesting script.",Notting Hill
229,Romano-3,"Humorous, light and fun.",8,29 June 1999,"A film that works.  Not as funny or as memorable, in its entirety, as Four Weddings and a Funeral (the comparison is inevitable given the film's background).  However, the passage of time sequence in which Hugh Grant walks through the seasons is a magical touch, and Rhys Ifans, playing Hugh Grant's house-mate Spike, is a standout.",Notting Hill

Notting Hill is probably one of the best written romantic comedies of all time, The dialogue is excellent and I've found myself quoting several lines from the film in my daily life. Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts are terrific and their on screen chemistry is undeniable. The romance in this film feels genuine and believable and there is something so organic about how the relationship develops throughout the film. The soundtrack is phenomenal and I always sing along to the songs that pop up in the film. I also adore the British charm this film has and I love the book store setting. Notting Hill is one of the best romantic comedies ever made and most of my issues with the film are nit-picks.",Notting Hill

But what everybody seems to miss is the fact that the direction is absolutely delightful. Just watch the birthday dinner ""brownie"" scene - one of my all-time favourites on screen - and you'll see what I mean.
Roger Michell deserves so much more attention than he's got. He really added something extra, very rarely seen, to the great material he had to work with. That in itself is quite an accomplishment.",Notting Hill

Yes, a lot of it is formulaic, and there are plot holes aplenty, but the script allows Hugh Grant's quiet, understated comic style to shine big-time. The British have an absolute embarrassment of riches when it comes to acting talent, and this movie just proves the point - the supporting cast was great.I don't generally care for Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts, or romantic comedies in general, but I really enjoyed this one. 8/10.",Notting Hill
233,Julie-53,"Delightful, uplifting and enjoyable",8,4 June 1999,"I truly enjoyed this film.  I was not a big fan of either Julia Roberts or Hugh Grant.  However, after seeing this film, I am a believer.  Miss Roberts did a creditable job of being an inscrutable, self-centered actress who wishes that she could be ""like everyone else"" (whatever that means) yet is in love with fame.  Hugh Grant was delightful and delectable.  He plays the sad, rejected and misused man beautifully.  He can be vulnerable and funny at the same time. The chemistry between these two is touching and totally believable.The moment that truly stands out in this movie, for me, is the scene in which he is walking down the street while the song ""Ain't No Sunshine When She's Gone"" is playing.  The effect used to show time passage was well used and totally caught me by surprise.My friend and I walked out of this movie feeling great!  This is like summer lemonade: refreshing, sweet, tart and irresistible.",Notting Hill

236,MetaLark,One amusing quip in two hours,1,19 November 2001,"It is not enough to populate a film with beautiful and talented actors; a good script is wanted above all. ""Notting Hill"" fails the script test.I had tried once before to watch this movie, but had abandoned the attempt early on, when it became apparent that the female lead possessed neither cleverness nor goodness, nor indeed any virtue to speak of. I could see no basis for the hero's infatuation with a woman who did nothing but occupy space on the screen. But I forced myself to persevere in a second viewing for two reasons: 1) I'd recently heard an amusing quote (concerning actor Mel Gibson) from a later scene, so figured I might have given up on it before the good part started; and 2) I had not been much impressed with another Richard Curtis screenplay--""Bridget Jones's Diary""--on the first viewing, but had completely reversed my estimate after seeing it a second time--so perhaps ""Notting Hill"" was another such one.Alas, the Mel Gibson crack was the only funny line in the entire flick. And aside from pretty faces and physiques, was there anything to be found in the protagonists to justify their interest in each other? The Julia Roberts character displayed nothing but beauty, stardom, and wealth, and appeared to exist in a gently-smiling vacuous state most of the time; in the one scene where she came alive, it was only to display an ungracious temper--quite a nasty piece of business really. The Hugh Grant character was marginally more sympathetic, but basically insipid.The plot movement was slow and unconnected, with little sense of development.Hugh Grant is of course past master at portraying the awkwardly shy Brit twit--give him credit there--but the writing was so shallow that no mere actor could have rescued it.Don't bother with this one unless you're an MTV fan, i.e., you just like to pass time in front of a screen.1/10",Notting Hill
237,rbatty,Not up to its hype.,6,30 May 1999,"Not nearly as great as its hype, but not too bad.  It takes Hugh Grant an agonizingly long time to complete a sentence -- and those fluttering eyelashes of his CAN get annoying.  Julia Roberts spent too much of the movie smiling waiting for Hugh to complete his thoughts (which explains the slowness of the film).  But the movie is worth seeing just to observe Grant's roommate-from-hell, Spike; he steals many a scene.  Best scene: Hugh Grant walking through a British open market thinking of his lost love as the seasons change from fall to winter to spring.  Great scene, so don't let your date fall asleep.",Notting Hill
238,will-75,Tedium.,1,11 December 1999,"It is quite possible for this film to wash over you and leave absolutely no trace of passing.There are about three or four lines in this effort which are funny however the tedium in-between does not make them worth the wait. If you take a few of the scenes from Four weddings and also Pretty woman add a quaint little London bookshop you basically have it. Also make sure you have a wacky girl with daft hair, the disabled ex-girlfriend, the failing stockbroker, a dreadful cook and a smelly flat mate with a Welsh accent and you have the total depth of the characters. All committed to each other as lifelong friends who share each other's highs and lows in life.Attention to detail is important in a film. Hugh Grant`s character lives in a flat with hundreds of LPs on the shelves, suggesting that he is a music enthusiast. However, the record player in his flat is a piece of junk with it's equalisation settings set to screaming treble. Obviously nobody in the production team has the first idea about audio, or perhaps they were all too bored to care.In order to prevent this getting the U certificate it richly deserves a few carefully crafted swear words were added to the script. A ploy often used to suggest that a film actually has something in it worth sitting through.Unfortunately this is the type of film Hollywood loves and will continue to fund. A dreadful sure fire box office success with multimillion dollar marketing opportunities for years to come.",Notting Hill

Nothing to hold my attention, nothing to make me care one bit about the main characters.  I enjoyed all of Hugh Grant's friends and family in the film, but it didn't take long for me to want to smack him off the screen.  And all Julia Robert's character did was again make me wonder why people want to hold celebrities in such high esteem.Don't get me wrong - this is far from the worst movie I've ever seen.

Julia Roberts is what makes this believable. I've never seen her in a movie where appears more sincere or attractive. The just a girl/just a boy speech is classic. I love the supporting cast.

245,rowe-4,Lightweight rehash of four weddings,3,15 April 2000,"I fail to understand why anyone liked this film, even if they haven't seen FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, which the writer clearly modeled it after (same writer, I guess he thought he could make a quick buck). The chief difference: four weddings was wonderful and comedic, this was lightweight fluff with a couple of cheap unfunny gags aimed at shock effect (e.g. who could confuse mayo with yogurt??, give us a break!).*SPOILERS COMING UP, I GUESS*The writer didn't even try to make it different from FOUR WEDDINGS. look at the similarities:US girl with southern accent goes to england and experiences mutual love at first sight with hugh grant. hugh grant surrounded by motley support group, including one quirky funky girl with weird hair and bizarre wardrobe and heart of gold. quirky funky girl ends up with tall blond foreigner and dances with him at wedding by his picking her up off the ground. girlfriendless friend of hugh grant meets girl in last scene. hugh and love interest go back and forth on the relationship issue. hugh says 'bugger' throughout the movie. boy gets girl and vice versa in climactic final scene.the main (and only) essential difference between the two movies is substance. in FOUR WEDDINGS, there is character depth and development. in notting hill, not. why don't we get to see julia's relationship with her career and her past? either that, or let her act and show something of the star's personality so we can see what hugh sees in her. in FOUR WEDDINGS we didn't know much about carrie, but she was a mystery and played it off well, with no explanations. in notting hill, there was a little tinkering around with the notion but it ultimately went nowhere. I mean, here is a movie star who is constantly on the verge of tears, always dresses down, and never wears makeup and never washes and styles her hair- there has to be a story in there somewhere, right? and we got nothing about hugh grant's character, though hugh played it as best he could with such a poor script and no real plot.it's as if the writer just meandered down a path picking posies and then finally picked a predictable ending and went with it. come on, scriptwriter, don't get hung up on an earlier success! go out there and do something different, would ya!I gave this a 3 because I was feeling generous and I like hugh grant. don't waste your money on it, not even on video, that's my best advice.",Notting Hill

252,atandt,"not romantic, not comic, not good",1,5 December 2007,"I had no preconceptions before watching this-- i just wanted a bit of fun diversion for the evening. Instead, what i ended up with was a nearly-unwatchable steaming pile of scenes that failed to achieve the basic requirements of story or characterisation. It occurred to me early on that perhaps the goal of the film was to take the highest-paid, biggest-name actors the producers could find & make the worst movie possible out of their contributions. What made the subject/story/believability of characters even harder to choke down were two additional crimes: 1) the underlying theme of ""ooh celebrities have it so rough here's a feature-length PSA examining their plight""; 2) the under-use of at least 2 truly brilliant comedic actors (the picaresque Dylan Moran & the luminous Julian Rhind-Tutt), who put art before ego & therefore do the job of acting better.I still could not figure out, at the end of the film, what drew the 2 main characters together. If their feelings were so compelling, the audience should at least have the remotest inkling as to _why_, surely.The constant fawning over the fictional starlet was nauseating and demeaning-- surely, a single celebrity can not be held in the same degree of spluttering fascination by all who encounter her-- not every ""famous"" person resonates in the same way by all those little people who behold their greatness... and, amazingly enough, some people even don't even care about celebrities!There was a great deal of discontinuity between threads which started & then disappeared with no resolution, the uncomfortable clash of comic with tragic (even in the same scene), and the mix of UK & US slang.The soundtrack was also way off base... not sure whether there was a single UK cover/artist in the lineup. Considering the whole film was set in the UK, the usage of so many United Statesian artists felt confused & displacing.With plot twists you can spot a mile away, unconvincing ""romance"", an ill-fitting jumble of predictably kooky characters, and an intolerable repetition of self-effacing British stereotype ""sorry's"" & other self-deprecations, this movie is entirely missable.",Notting Hill

Knowing the basic setup of the movie, you don't expect the characters to be realistic, but they are. Each and every character is likeable- even the hero's roommate.

Some might complain about the ending but I think it fitted in with the story about a Hollywood actress. The best character for me was not the major stars but Spike, whose ""different"" view on life will remind many of past flatmates. Although unbelievable in some places (could a major star really wander round Notting Hill without being spotted and where were the tramps in the park?!), this is a wonderful feel-good movie.",Notting Hill

I think any movie with Julia Roberts fits to me. She's such a great actress. So I think the movie owes its success mainly to the outstanding act of Julia Roberts. I think the type of movies for Julia Roberts should be romantic comedies. She's very successful in those. ""The Runaway Bride"" is another evidence of my assertion. So I think ""Notting Hill"" was one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever watched and of course we shouldn't forget the theme song ""She"" of Elvis Costello. It was a magnificient song especially accompanied by the scenes of Julia Roberts at the beginning of the movie.",Notting Hill

This movie reminded me of why I fell in love with rom-coms and romantic movies in the first place. There IS something that tugs at your heart strings with this movie and the narrative and events that unfold could maybe just one day happen. This movie isn't a disgrace to this genre and reminds audiences about the lure of a good romantic movie. Of course Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts are two stellar actors and were truly great in the film. Notting Hill doesn't feel rushed at the climax as if the director/writer was just trying to wrap up the story, the filmmakers put their heart into this film and took their time to develop the continuity and fluidity of the film.

Hugh Grant was good, he still played 'Hugh Grant', but as a shy person rather than suave. I however hated Anna's character. I found her to be self centred and bitchy. She walked all over people and expected people to swoon over her. I found it interesting the idea of the press taking so much interest in one person and the fact that Anna said gossip wouldn't die down. I'm not sure if it's just film talk, or it shows that famous people tended to be famous longer then, rather than famous 5 minutes and then has beens the next minute. Most celebrities nowadays would just brush the incident that Anna had under the carpet, or not even care. I enjoyed the party scenes too. They had a vary stereotypical British film feel about them. All together, nice, easy watch, family film.",Notting Hill

262,DocHobbs,sparkling romantic comedy & hilarious crowd-pleaser,8,27 May 1999,"""Notting Hill""  is that rarest of animals...not only is it a sparkling romantic comedy, but also a hilarious crowd-pleaser.  Very similar in tone to Hugh Grant's own ""Four Weddings And A Funeral"" (written and produced by the very same people)   & even Julia Roberts' ""My Best Friends Wedding""; which ought to assure you that the stars are once again at their best.Besides the occasional cliche, necessary to move it's story along I suppose, the screenplay is smart, sexy, and witty.  Hugh Grant has never been better. Julia is becoming more and more luminous at a somewhat alarming rate.All in all...a completely charming must see.",Notting Hill

I think it's predictable and quite boring and the main actors are not on their best: Hugh Grant is always the same again and Julia is not brilliant as -quite-always. 6/10..thanks to London.",Notting Hill
264,Nigel-26,A fine fairy tale romance,8,28 December 1999,"Just delightful.  This is one of the few movies where you can let your heart escape with Hugh Grant and dream and live the impossible dream.  A humble, if not quirky, bookseller falling in love with a high profile beautiful actress.  Has all the hall marks of one of those great English movies, not falling into true comic proportions, never a drama.  It is what one could call a ""nice"" movie that was thoroughly entertaining and delightful.",Notting Hill
265,brett-donald,"Lots of heart, but not perfect",7,7 March 2018,"An entertaining and touching film about relationships by master writer Richard Curtis. In particular, the film explores how regular people relate to big celebrities, poorly for the most part, and the isolation and even alienation which a celebrity might feel as a result.Julia Roberts is superb, bringing bucketloads of emotion and vulnerability to her portrayal of the movie star, Anna. The supporting cast are wonderful too. Rhys Ifans is so funny and so perfect in his role of William's flatmate, Spike, that he almost steals the show. But the scenes with William's family are the true heart of the movie, full of quirkiness, honesty, tragedy and unconditional love.And yet, there is something missing. This film doesn't approach perfection, as Four Weddings and Love Actually do. What is wrong? What holds this film back? Is Hugh Grant too reserved in the role of William? Is he in fact playing William, or just being Hugh Grant? I understand why he was cast in that role, but I'm not sure he was the right choice. Are we fully convinced that a big star could be as down-to-earth as Anna? But my main gripe is that the climax and conclusion of the film are too contrived (the press conference at the Savoy) and too rushed. William never properly declares his love for Anna. All he says is ""I made a mistake"" turning you down, she smiles and says she'll stay indefinitely, then we get visuals of a wedding and sitting together on a park bench with a baby bump. The resolution of their relationship deserved more attention.I generally prefer British movies over Hollywood ones, but in this case I prefer the book store romance You've Got Mail from the previous year, starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.",Notting Hill
266,dfc-london10,I honestly cannot understand what all the fuss is about,3,19 January 2013,"I honestly cannot understand what all the fuss is about this movie. It took me three days to watch it (granted I was tired and fell asleep through them), but when I got to the end of it, I could still not understand what all the fuss is about. If you want a truly admirable performance from either Julia or Hugh, search elsewhere. I'm glad this movie did work, because of all the tourists it now brings to Notting Hill, but I'm sure the residents would maybe think otherwise. The girl in the wheelchair and Ifans (Hugh's flatmate) give the best performances of the movie in my opinion and they have minimal roles. The plot is far-fetched at best and somewhat predictable too.. I saw it because apparently everyone loves it, but I certainly did not.",Notting Hill

I honestly don't know who was worse, Ms Roberts or Mr Grant. They both became so grating on the nerves that I couldn't wait for the movie to end.  The most enjoyable part of the film (aside from it being over) were the trailers they showed before it.  Even the one for the snack bar had better acting than this waste of film.  Aside from shamelessly borrowing from ""Roman Holiday"", this film lacks a plot or characters worth caring about.  Ms Roberts' character is not worthy of pity for the situations she finds herself in as she is shallow and self-indulgent--perhaps it wasn't a stretch for her to play this part.  Mr Grant's constant stuttering and eye-blinking made me more sick than the motion sequences of ""Blair Witch Project"".  Not worth seeing or renting.  Save the money for something better... it shouldn't be that hard.",Notting Hill
268,Brad-61,"Lots and lots of charm, if nothing else",7,29 May 1999,"This is a fairy-tale, with a twist, as it is a romantic comedy that will stimulate the cortex of men everywhere who fantasize about being the normal guy who wins the princess. It's about as realistic as Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, but Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant ooze so much charm that it was tough to resist. Just sit back, smile and go with it, and ignore it's predictable, creaky construction. At least Hugh Grant doesn't stammer",Notting Hill
269,karma185,Awesome,10,5 June 1999,"I thought this movie was Julia's Best.  There was not one part of this movie that I didn't enjoy.  I thought that the script was refreshing, it was the kind of movie that had the whole audience laughing and crying and hugging at the end.  The whole cast worked so well as an ensemble, with the roomate standing out, but with all the others standing out as well.  I thought some moments were just beautiful, such as Grant's lengthy stroll down the street and the park scenes.  The way that the movie combined comedy, romance, and drama together in one film was not at all cynical, it was so believable. Okay so maybe I'm a sap, but I thought that parts of this movie could have been biographical.  I loved the soundtrack, with exception to the song that plays in the opening scenes.  The music was effective at capturing the basic tone of the film.  One more important thing- I like Hugh Grant as an actor again!  He's so good in this that I want to see him act again. This is nothing like ""Four Weddings. . .,"" which I thought was boring and hard to follow.",Notting Hill
270,rollo-7,Worthy and hilarious follow-up to Four Weddings,8,7 May 1999,"Very close copy of Four Weddings with writer, Richard Curtis exploiting the success of the previous film's character types.Hugh Grant does his usual bumbling bit, Julia Roberts smiles sweetly and is endearing. The film is made by the supporting cast.Rhys Ifans steals the show as a 'masturbating Welshman' who wanders round in his Y-fronts all the time. He has the best lines by far.The film is unthreatening and there are possibly too many slushy bits, but the viewer is quickly brought back into laughter mode.Many people will say this is a carbon copy of Four Weddings. So what if it is? It isn't actually. It's very funny and well worth the ticket fee. Go see!",Notting Hill

Enter Julia Roberts, who basically plays... herself, A movie star, looking to escape the media at any possible chance. Together they turn subtle, silent moments, into romantic exchanges of fairy tale dreams, as the underachiever knows deep down inside, that the glass slipper does not fit. Ah, but in fairy tales, dreams do come true and the movie star is after all, just a girl that loves a boy. Hugh Grant's simpatico overflows in this lovely, simple, charming love story and Roberts is as beautiful as always, with just enough humility to give the audience enough hope for our Cinderella.",Notting Hill

Like Pretty Woman, Notting Hill stars Julia Roberts, who is maybe not the most beautiful girl in the world, but her presence fills the screen completely, and Hugh Grant does a fantastic job by being a rock covered by a silk scarf and a nail to hold on to.This great romantic comedy is ageing very well, and every time I see it, it's a couple of hours well spent.The inclusion of Al Green's How Can You Mend A Broken Heart in a pivotal moment was the right thing to do. And the long take resembling the one who made Theo Angelopoulos in his Le regard d'Ulysse was magnificent.A modern classic.",Notting Hill

I think the ladies will swoon over him and his body, but other than that, the film is oh so predictable and boring",Notting Hill
276,Ebo,A romantic comedy that really works,8,28 May 1999,"This movie is a kind of scrambled clone of Richard Curtis's other great romantic comedy, Four Weddings and a Funeral.  The nice thing is that for Curtis this is apparently one of his specialties, like Robert B. Parker writing a detective book, rather than something he did because his last comedy-romance fared so well at the box office.  He is not feeding off his last work; he is simply doing a variation on a favorite theme.  Which is to say that while Notting Hill shares many elements with Four Weddings and a Funeral, this in no way diminishes either movie, and both are quite good.In fact, of the two, I think I might prefer this one.  Julia Roberts's star power exceeds Andie MacDowell's, and Roberts is given more time to develop her character, so the romance works better here than in Four Weddings.The one rehash of the Four Weddings format that didn't work on any level was the attempt to find another rock and roll oldie to revamp for the soundtrack and turn into a big hit.  In the attempt to find what would be for Notting Hill what Wet Wet Wet's version of ""Love is All Around"" was for Four Weddings, we are taken through a tiresome and intrusive series of oldies and covers of oldies, the best of which (though that's not saying much) is Elvis Costello's far too faithful cover of ""She.""",Notting Hill

I have never been a big fan of Roberts or Grant, but now I see different..This film is so fresh, and is romantic, funny, even makes me think. I was not bored for one second. It even made me act: From laying back laughing and shaking, to feel romantic.. The screenplay is excellent as the rest that was needed to complete this film.

At the very begining, I thought ""it would be cool if..."" well I don't want to spoil much. But just what I thought would be cool, HAPPENED.

279,Chris-448,The Best Movie Ever?,9,11 June 1999,"Notting Hill is one of those few sequel movies that is actually BETTER than its original. Living in Britain, I remember well the hype that surrounded the launch of Four Weddings (it was labelled ""The Rebirth of British Cinema), but this movie was by far and away better. Many films nowadays are labelled ""romantic comedies"" - but most of the time, they're either not funny or they're not romantic (take ""You've Got Mail"", for example). Notting Hill was a true romantic comedy - very funny and perfectly romantic, without becoming too corny.Hugh Grant fits Richard Curtis's script brilliantly - those ""uhhs"" and ""ummms"" that litter his speech make the film twice as funny - just listen to that little squeal he gives out before resorting to pretending he's a journalist from House & Hound magazine. Julia Roberts shines marvellously too - a pretty good insight into the life of a movie star. And whoever it is who plays Hugh Grant's flatmate Spike - it was an hilarious performance - my favourite line was, ""well chosen pair of briefs, if I must say"".The day after seeing the film, I woke up and actually wanted there to be a real-life saga unfolding in the media about an ordinary man in the street & a movie star - and thats what I now think makes a real film. One where you actually want it to come true. This is real entertainment.",Notting Hill
280,cameo-5,Julia is pleasant; the movie is slow and we've already seen it,4,8 June 1999,"This movie is an attempt at a cross between Four Weddings and a Funeral and Pretty Woman -- and not just because of the overlapping cast members. Like Pretty Woman, it involves a potential relationship across a big cultural (and economic) divide.  Like Four Weddings, we see the beautiful American who comes to Britain, meets the same good looking guy, leaves, returns, leaves, returns, leaves, returns . . . .Unfortunately, Notting Hill doesn't live up to the standards set by either of those movies.  Although neither was brilliant cinema, I enjoyed both of them immensely.  Notting Hill, in contrast, mainly just bugged me.  For one thing, it's much too slow; half an hour could have been cut.  Second, I didn't care much about these characters.  Maybe that's because of a third problem -- this movie was so much like Four Weddings that I felt I had already seen it.  And it wasn't just Roberts and Grant that I didn't care about.  The supporting cast members, although occasionally mildly amusing, were mainly just silly.  The Four Weddings supporting characters were much funnier, much more real, and much more talented.I'm not saying Notting Hill was terrible.  I just think it was a mediocre movie that I could happily have skipped.  Of course, then I would have missed Roberts who, at least by the end of the movie, showed some of the radiance and charm we too rarely see.",Notting Hill
281,meechiganman,"Something nice to see, meets expectations.",7,30 May 1999,"Notting Hill very nicely meets the expectations for a romantic-comedy. Julia basically plays herself, a charismatic leading lady with understated grace. Hugh makes his trademark performance as an everyman(-brit) seem natural and almost too easy. Together, they have enough chemistry to be believable as a romantic couple. In the end, I felt like Notting Hill fulfilled my requirements; an enjoyable, charming love-story with lots of laughs and a plausible(if somewhat fantastic) story-line. A great date movie that you can see on your own.",Notting Hill

Well, he sugar-coated it and it was called Some Like It Hot.Notting Hill has some serious things to say, but it is not going to bore us by stating them seriously.  Instead it sugar coats them, for the fun of one and all.  But pay attention in the middle of the movie, when Julia Robert's character is complaining about the price of fame, and Hugh Grant's character mentions that 18 months ago his best friend slipped while coming down some stairs, and now will never walk again.Screenwriter Richard Curtis has taken his experience from the great success of Four Weddings and a Funeral and used it to fuel this movie with wiry and witty comment on all that he experienced.  I can hardly wait for his next screenplay, and if it makes use of actors with the charm and chemistry of Roberts and Grant, we'll be in for another treat.",Notting Hill

Yes, this is a romance but that doesn't mean you can't appreciate it. There are a lot of laughs and a very plausible story-line, which steers clear of the saccharine.

286,yes_i_am84,Funny and uplifting... and I don't usually like romantic comedies,8,29 August 2005,"The simplest story you could ever think of... and quite unrealistic at the same time, isn't it? Nice but anonymous guy meeting by chance the most famous actress in the world, and a relationship - somehow - starts. Romantic comedies aren't my thing, usually, so when a friend asked me, a few years ago, to go to the cinema with her and watch *this*, I was very skeptical. Two hours later, I got out of the séance with a smile on my face, feeling refreshed and uplifted. As regards romantic comedies, and comedies in general, you'll hardly find anything better than ""Notting Hill"", at least in the last twenty years.The simple and unrealistic story - yes, that one - turns out to be handled with such skill and talent from screenwriter Richard Curtis that, very early in the movie, you find yourself *captured* already. From the ""Rufus-the-thief"" scene on, you smile, you laugh (softly - the humour of the many memorable quotes in this movie is too nice and... well, British, to laugh out loud), you smile again, until the press conference climax is reached. You care for every single character, just because they are making you smile. Julia Roberts' Anna and Hugh Grant's William, despite their being a representation of two categories of stereotypes, turn out to be someone you want a good final of the story for, and the two actors are perhaps the two more suitable actors for their respective roles (Grant in particular, even if he can be irritating in some other roles, he is really created for this one). But the honorable mention is actually deserved by the supporting cast, William's circle of friends, everyone of them would deserve a screenplay for his own character only. Very enjoyable.""Notting Hill"" isn't a masterpiece, neither has it any deep meaning... but come on, don't be snob.

I was not sure and would like to meet people who gave it such a poor rating and understand and inquire what else do they consider to be a great movie. This movie has everything you can ask for. Great story (i agree its a rich girl poor guy love story plot but put up beautifully), great direction, great performance, subtle but again great humor and it makes u feel so good watching it. Entertains you all along, with a perfect touch of romance, humor, sorrow and backed up with some beautiful dialogues. I guess every single person who has seen this movie(despite the fact what he/she might rate this movie as), still can never forget that scene where Julia says these lines to Hugh grant: ""I am just a girl standing before a boy, asking him to lover her!""I became a fan of Hugh Grant after watching this movie and what do you say about Julia Roberts.

288,pravinsaw124,unexpected ending,9,4 March 2018,"This is a movie you will think that you can guess the next scene but the writer has written it in very different way. This love story between a famous person with a normal person is like a fantasy of every normal or might be some famous people. important scenes appear when she comes back after her every departure in the movie with some emotional drama and when she comes back the situation is turned into a positive way every time while the watcher is thinking of a negative response & there is a positive response from each of them. At many scenes you think that this is not going to work between them and it works out again. 
The situation showed in this motion picture has hardly happened with any famous person i think. If happened, could turn out this way , that is what this story is about. 
Julia Roberts has played her role very well actually and showed a mean and self conscious side of a rich and famous person who is afraid of loosing his fame. The other side of a successful side of an actress is also described by her.
Hugh Grant has played a very attractive but emotional guy who is always good to every person in this movie. She broke his heart and every time she comes back he comforts her.

Hollywood meets Notting Hill and it's all very predictable.  The supporting cast of kooky characters are not enough to add substance to the film which ultimately is not much more than an innocuous trifle.

""Normal"" people spend their lives reading about the lives of the famous, on posters, in magazines, knowing more about the lovelives of celebrities than their families. Wanting to be famous, wanting to be with someone famous. The self-referential irony is delivered with a deft touch, Hugh Grant playing what he does so well, the diffident, slightly awkward, but immaculately enunciated and perfectly quiffed English upper-middle class gent. Stuttery, self-effacing, but don't Americans just love that. And that's the key here. Four Weddings, part II. England for an American market, neatly packaged. It couldn't be anywhere, it had to be England. It couldn't be anyone, it had to be Hugh. (Again.) That's not to say it's not a very well produced movie. It is. A great ensemble of British comic actors. Plenty of well known London landmarks for the locals to point at and empathise with. And a tight script that carries you through the two hours rather than dragging. Two hours is brave in this day an age, but why rush?  Julia Roberts continues to be a revelation. She isn't just a pretty face. She plays the part to its fullest - I did want to be William Thacker. I want to go buy a bookshop and have her visit. Isn't that what movies are about? Showing you the world as it could be, not how it is. Sometimes that's dark and scary, sometimes it's light and happy.

295,bjones-2,Definitely worth the admission,10,14 June 1999,"I expected to see another mediocre romantic comedy like You've Got Mail, but I was surprised that enough was different here to make it interesting. The London neighborhood and the characters entertained (although hearing the starring flat originally went for $500K was a bit much.). Especially entertaining was Rhys Ifans as the flatmate ""Spike"". I had to resist feeling insulted at such a portrayal of a Welshman in order to admire the performance though. He was very good, even down to the recent cultural shift among some Celts to revert to the pre-British spellings of their names; that I applaud.The sets and locations lent an air of realism, too; lots of small details. The Camera work took great advantage of these and gave us a visually rich film without it being ""in-your-face"" - it caressed.The remaining performances surprised too. This was the best I had Seen Hugh Grant. He was perfect in the role. Just enough modest loveability for the ladies in the party. Then there was Julia Roberts. I do not know when I have enjoyed her more in a film. It wasn't the part, the script or her character. She just seemed ""on"" for this in a very engaging way. It was a delight to drink in the different looks and degrees of costume. She looked very fetching in the scenes where it appeared as though she were sans makeup; just basic glowing beauty.The only negative aspect of the film for me was the multiple breakups. I would have preferred seeing a slow maturation of their relationship. Still, that wasn't enough to spoil the overall effect. It was refreshing and entertaining to feel good at the end of a movie after some recent things I've seen. Oh, there's room for all those dastardly realistic, rend-your-heart-to-shreds kind of things, but sometimes I just want to go to a movie to feel good. Most telling was at the end of the film, the audience spontaneously applauded; a real rarity. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. So much so I hated to see it end. Bravo.",Notting Hill

It seemed as if the writers of the film had written a sad and quite realistic ending, took a poll, and decided to change it.  The existing ending seems spliced on and does not fit the established characters in the film at all.All in all, its a funny movie, but the ending totally ruined it for me.",Notting Hill
297,JJ-111,Great Film:,9,13 June 1999,"Notting Hill Plot: William meets Anna. Fall in love. Anna has significant other already- Split up. When problems arise Anna runs to William, draw closer, Argument -Split up. Anna realises she really loves William and attempts to get him back .... William realises he really loves Anna and attempts to get her back ... The conclusion I will leaveAfter reading the reviews, and the comments, I'm wondering if we all saw the same film! Notting hill is a romantic comedy in the Doris Day Genre, in that the plot can only be ridiculous in the far fetched way. But still enables the viewer to suspend reality for a couple of hours to believe in the characters and the story.The cast British cast I found wonderful in their eccentricities, Bringing their own individual views to the situation. Sometimes comic and other sad. Hugh Grant has lost his idiot act (Not quite all though.) Julia Roberts may not be the worlds greatest beauty, (eye of the beholder) but acts the part of the star well. Scratching away at the gloss and hype of the film I found myself  thinking that Richard Curtis the writer has been very cleaver in combining comedy with something to say (Four Weddings did not appear to have a second layer). The best way to get a point across is to make you audience laugh, as the audience I saw NH with did. When I started to think about what  were laughing for, I saw a depth of social commentary. How the public View stardom, and all that entails. How Richard views the press view media personality's.",Notting Hill

I was amazed by how this film from 1999 is still relevant today. It definitely stands the test of time!",Notting Hill
302,SteveReed007,Sparkling romance at a deliberate British pace,10,9 February 2000,"It may be a paradox to say that a film can sparkle slowly, yet that's the only way I can describe this charming romantic comedy. The star(dom)-crossed lovers don't know that they are Meant For Each Other ... yes, this is the standard RomCom setup. But the -way- they don't know? That is put across in a most British and deliberate pace and setting. And it makes the ending that we all know is coming gather color and charm.""Notting Hill"" takes over a third of its running time to show William (Hugh Grant) as he is immersed in his daily life, wanting to be supportive of his friends, yet searching for his own inner life. The five closest friends all show something he lacks: ""happy"" conformity, a loving marriage transcending obstacles, a sister who takes bold risks for finding love, and a roommate that sees through pretense and says so (and, yes, is delightfully vulgar).That very British character-in-a-wry-setting pattern borrows from ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" but the only friends there that I could consistently believe -mattered- to Grant's character were the gay couple, one comic, the other showing profound emotion. Here, all of the lead character's circle deeply cares about him, as he does about them. This makes all the difference.Where it matters most is in giving him support when the American film beauty (Julia Roberts) comes into his life, then out, then in, then ... and all in ways that are believable for such dissimilar lovers. The romantic turns are more plausible because Grant's character has such support and a place for sharing his emotional roller-coaster ride. He isn't crushed by the down moments, but picks up his individuality and moves on. And his friends tell him, sometimes with only searching looks, just when he's picked up -too much- of being on his own. (Okay, the moment towards the end when Spike puts his exasperation into three pointed, even vulgar, words is a refreshing change. Sometimes, when a friend lets loose with the pithy truth, it hits the needed spot.)All this backstory, character richness, and pointed use of the ""right"" words are British qualities that we don't get with the standard American RomCom setup.Gina McKee's turn here as Grant's wheelchair-bound female friend is of someone with deeply felt individuality and unique perceptiveness, including her own tender perspective on loves past and present - especially her husband. It's a glimpse into a woman with distinctive qualities that -she- has chosen. This makes her both appealing to all her friends, and forceful by quiet understatement. She also ends up being much funnier, when you've rewound the tape and end up thinking about the story. (Listen for her spoken turn on ""standing up."" No, it's not a cheap play on her limitations. Not in context. And that's subtle comic acting.)Richard Curtis's inventive screenplay is one of the best in years, and would reward a look in book form as well. He takes this backdrop of supportive friends, puts in the sparkle of Roberts invading and shaking up their world, and creates a skein of personal truths and imposed celebrity nonsense.Grant and Roberts are both passionate and bemused observers of the absurdities of fame that end up surrounding them, but they act this out in comic byplay and inventive responses. This isn't an American breakneck-pace (or ""screwball"") comedy, and their subtle discovery of each other's -minds- and substance wouldn't work in such a setting.Roberts has both the easy familiarity with and the hair-trigger of frustration from fame, both coming out to undermine her when she least expects it. But she shows that she can grow and learn from her mistakes. (Unlike her well-acted but overexplained realization at the end of ""Runaway Bride."") She even has one scene -sans- makeup that is a genuine romantic turning point. I don't see many other actresses being willing to try that.Grant shows an astonishing inner strength and self-awareness, not being willing to hide how -he- sees reality. (He did the same realistic turn in ""Four Weddings,"" but didn't try nearly as effectively to figure himself out.)The photography and settings show off London beautifully, and the story's interior scenes make highly imaginative use of a narrow, stacked-up Notting Hill mini-townhouse.I do feel the director fails to take up some opportunities to build on the comic or dramatic moments in the screenplay. He coasts on the words. They're excellent words, but they need a twist at times.My only take-off-a-point[*] quibble is with the music. It's mostly popular tunes that underscore the action. One of these is luminous, and frames the story perfectly - Elvis Costello's cover of ""She."" Others, though, use their lyrics to overstress plot points. Some are performed too high in volume, sometimes lapping against dialogue.(The two original themes by Trevor Jones are beautiful, lushly written, and quite fitting to the main characters. We should have had more of his work, but they're less than a fourth of the film's music.)The British often put more creativity below the narrative surface and into the setting than Americans do, and often get beyond formula. To discover this in a film is joyous. You'll feel this when you find yourself compelled to see this deeply felt, yet very funny, film twice, thrice, or more. For me, it's still delightful after nine months and nine viewings.[* Edited on 21 April 2011: After another decade and another ten viewings, this love story has only become more resonant and beautiful. The pop-song choices feel notably less obtrusive. The acting of both Roberts and Grant has evinced more depth. And I see no reason to not give it a full 10 rating.]",Notting Hill
303,arm,A British comedy that is NOT depressing!,10,3 June 1999,"I don't like Hugh Grant much, as he always plays the same character, but I liked this movie. It's refreshing to have a British comedy that doesn't leave you feeling depressed, like Full Monty did. And like any Richard Curtis script, it gets funnier the more you see it. I often see a trailer and feel that the movie didn't add anything to the trailer: in fact comedies often put all the good jokes in the trailer. Now, Notting Hill puts good jokes in the trailer but you laugh at them again in the movie and you laugh the second time you see it. This is Blackadder quality stuff.",Notting Hill

Julia Roberts just shows how you can play a perfect cast, even if you do not have that much dialog.

Hugh Grant in reality is a fairly boring and very type cast actor and so, unfortunately, is the plot.So, the real test for this film,for me, was always going to be if it could rise above these obvious shortcomings, and in general it does seemed to do so.  The script, which has to be the main star, is brilliant.  Better than 4 Weddings and a Funeral, Richard Curtis inserts many more ""Blackadder"" moments, which will have many in stitches.  Julia Roberts is as engaging as ever and revels in the apparent auto-biographical nature of her part.The support cast is universally brilliant, although stand outs include: Rhys Ifans who is hilarious as Spike, Hugh Grant's flat mate;  Tim (Darling) McInnerny and Gina McKee both excel making a touching couple, and Dylan Moran is unforgettable in his tiny part as the shop lifter.I was a sceptical viewer, but I was pleasantly surprised, it is better than 4 Weddings, so worth seeing for all those, like me, who initially refused to just see a rehash of the same film.",Notting Hill
310,primodanielelori,Cute but Empty,6,26 January 2008,"Julia Roberts playing a famous American movie star wasn't quite a stretch and yet it felt unconvincing. The humor works the second you're seeing it but then it vanishes into thin air. It feels self conscious and forced. Once all that is said, ""Notting Hill"" emerges as a pleasant enough improbable romantic comedy in the ""Four Weddings And A Funeral"" mold without ever reaching the smart, disarming charm of its model. Hugh Grant is lovely in a part destined to seem Hugh Grantish with all the clipped bit of nonsense that have made Grant a household name. The quirky friends and bizarre room mates are the questionable salt and pepper of this romantic tale. I found myself smiling, getting impatient and enjoying it, all at the same time. I'm too much of a Preston Sturgess fan to be able to sit through a modern comedy in the way I did with ""The Lady Eve"" for instance. My favorite moment: The Horse and Hound sequence. Very funny. If you've never seen a Preston Sturgess, Ernst Lubitch or Billy Wilder comedy, you may like ""Notting Hill"" much more than I did.",Notting Hill

This is the movies, so  despite the chasm between them  they fall in love. It's a path fraught with obstacles and misunderstandings, most of them comic. Richard Curtis' canny follow up to Four Weddings is in no way a sequel though it is very similar  a sentimental fairy-tale romance that's all froth and no body. Nonetheless, it's diverting entertainment and the sheer class of the stars seems to lend it substance, certainly as the story unfolds (which is basically Roman Holiday for the 1990s, with better jokes and a happier ending). Grant's patented stuttering diffidence is thrown into sharp relief by Roberts' easy radiance. She's already proved a dab hand at self-effacing comedy and she brings a scary conviction to her tantrum scenes here. Grant's gaggle of friends are a less impressive bunch, though Rhys Ifans has fun as his disgusting flatmate Spike.",Notting Hill

Trite humour (grungy, eclectic flatmate; big feet/shoes). No insight, no questions, no credibility (why did she kiss him?) Huge plot holes - where did the fantastic Mr Ifans go during most of her stay? Why did he take the call from his mother? And yet another group of charming chums who are all SO supportive with not a twang of angst in sight despite disability/redundancy/business failure. By the second hour I was urging Hugh to hurry every one of those oh, so, faltering, foppish syllables. The plot was an obstacle course of devices which served only to titillate (goggles/guinea fowl/her from accounts and so many others).

Gormless main lead bumbles through life.  Standard storyline of ""boy/girl meet, fall in love, split, then finally reunite"".The difference from ""Four Weddings"" is more romance, less comedy.  Hugh Grant plays standard Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts appears to play, well... probably Julia Roberts.  The overall acting standard is uninspiring, the best moments come from the zany supporting cast.So what does all that leave us?

But Hugh gets the shock of his life when Andie (now played by Julie Roberts) waltzes back into his bookshop one day and announces grandly that she's now a big-shot hollywood actress. Hugh is speechless and we are then treated to fully 20 minutes of ""ums"" ""ahs"" and ""the thing is..."" from Hugh.But then the action really gets going as Hugh and Julia find themselves falling in love all over again.

Fans of Scarlet will be shocked to discover that she's had a sex change and is now a man and is calling herself Spike.

317,sharonm1972,Still love this film after 20 years,10,18 January 2020,"After the huge success of Four Weddings, Richard Curtis struck gold again with Nothing Hill. I think I actually prefer this to Four Weddings. The characters aren't quite as OTT quirky as Four Weddings and seem far more grounded and realistic. The warmth of William's friends who surround him is lovely and you can see why someone like Anna would find his life appealing. I like the little nods to Julia Roberts previous films (""we'll have you spick and span and back on the street in no time... In a non prostitute way of course""). I like how she shows she's just a vulnerable person under the sheen of being Hollywood's biggest filmstar.Notting Hill of course is a gorgeous setting before it got ridiculously gentrified, and humble book shop owners could afford to rent with a jobless Welshman in a flat in Portobello Road. I can't believe this film is 20 years old, but in my mind is a timeless, sweet, romantic comedy.",Notting Hill

319,newjerseymoviefanrob,A perfect romantic comedy,10,25 May 2006,"A wonderful movie about celebrity meeting normality. Nothing Hill stars Hugh Grant, as a book store owner, whose life is changed when an international movie star, Anna, played by Julia Roberts, walks into his book store. By fate, William collides into Anna knocking his lunch all over her. William offers Anna the opportunity to clean up in his flat across the way. Anna agrees.Suddenly William has an international celebrity in his house. He desperately tries to keep her there by offering everything in his refrigerator. Anna leaves, but comes back and they kiss. Seems a bit Hollywood, am I right? No, I'm wrong. Nothing Hill's a wonderful film from start to finish. William tracks Anna down, and they start dating.The movie basically has the same premise as Woody Allen's wonderful Purple rose of Cairo, even though Purple rose leans more towards fantasy than reality. Both movies contain quiet, humble, perfectly normal people confronted by celebrities.Nothing Hill perfectly nails the relationship between celebrity and normality. Not just on a romantic level, but on a general level as well. In a wonderful scene, Anna's invited to William's sisters Birthday party. At the table, she's filled with happiness and joy by how happy, and simple it is to be normal. Opposed to living the false life of celebrity. I'm sure 98 percent of society would love to be in Anna's position, but maybe being a celebrity is not what is appears to be. Not everyone thrives off celebrity, getting a great deal of pleasure out of the shallowness of fame and fortune. Not everyone worships their own celebrity status like the Paris Hilton's of the world.But on a romantic level, Nothing Hill succeeds amazingly as well. Just seeing William and Anna walk down the road, sit together, in a restaurant together, has amazingly wonderful charm to it. It's easy to put your self in William's shoes and feel his pleasure and excitement, basically why I loved this movie so much. I felt William's excitement the same way Cecilia felt everyone's on screen in the Purple Rose of Cairo. I escaped my own normal existence through William's wonderful situation with Anna.It must be every man's dream, especially a humble man like William's, to have a beautiful superstar walk into their life and fall in love with them. Oh, how'd I love for Natalie Portman to walk into my bookstore and kiss me. It won't happen, because A) I don't have a book store, and B) because reality bites. But why not dream? Anyway, William and Anna fall in love, share intimate moments, and the shallowness of celebrity mixes in. Anna pisses me off towards the end of the movie when the paparazzi show up at Williams's door snapping a photo of him in his boxers with her upstairs. Anna suddenly puts her career before the likes of William. Anna leaves, William mopes around, but his flat mate and sister track down Anna for him.Of course, William tracks Anna down on a movie set a few months later after she wins an academy award, which Roberts would win in reality a year later for Erin Brockovich, but mistakenly hears her say a rather rude remark about him. Little does he know it was in character. But Anna, once again, returns to Williams's book store, confesses her love for him, he turns her down, his friends make him realize how dumb of a mistake it was, and then he tracks her down at a press conference. And they live happily ever after.Of course, in reality, this probably wouldn't happen. But why couldn't it? Why can't celebrities and every day people fall in love? Like Anna says, she's just a small town girl. Nothing Hill's a wonderful movie no matter how you look at it. Everything about it's perfect. Julia Robert's and Hugh Grants best work. 10-10",Notting Hill

It does in fact have a lot of clichés but I think that just adds to the wonderfully sweet story. At the end of the day, it's just the typical movie about the poor guy falling in love with the rich girl, however little elements like the dinner with his family, the quirky roommate, etc. Help elevate the plot.

They don't talk about anything and don't seem to have anything in common. It comes off as him being starstruck and her enjoying the fact that some posh Brit is all over her.
In fact everyone in this movie is annoyingly and constantly starstruck by Julia Roberts. I mean, sure, you'd get over the fact that she's famous after some time? No? Okay...Generally, I don't mind Hugh Grant's hughgrantisms, but he was literally unwatchable in this movie. It took him 10 hours to finish each sentence and if he just talked like any normal person the movie would only be 25 minutes long. We understand - you're quirky and cute.

322,Taed,A decent movie with some impressive cinematography.,6,13 June 1999,"While this movie is decent overall, there were two scenes that make it particularly interesting for movie buffs.As a movie buff, there are some scenes in movies which I'll probably never forget.  Some of them are the opening scene in _Touch of Evil_, and Glen Close crying in the shower in _The Big Chill_.The ""passage of time / change of seasons"" scene in _Notting Hill_ is now among those.  I was amazed with this scene, and the choice of music (""Ain't no sunshine"" by Bill Withers) was perfect.  The cuts blend perfectly together -- at least I'm assuming they were filmed separately, since it required clothing changes for some of the participants.  Aside from the obvious change of seasons, the passage of time is shown to have an effect on other characters, such as the pregnancy/baby of one woman and the sister's meeting/breaking up with a man.There is a second scene, that while not as awe-inspiring, it was certainly technically well-done, and again reminds me of a similar technical feat in _Touch of Evil_.  In the park scene, the camera pulls up and angles down. At first, I thought that was a sweet touch, showing how they are just two people in their own little world.  But as the camera continued to pull up to somewhere around 75 feet above the ground, I recognized the engineering that went behind it.  My guess is that they mounted a camera via wires and remotely controlled the angles and focus.  I think putting a person up there would have been a bit too much.  Does anyone actually know how it was done?So while this movie is sweet enough to see, I feel it's a must-see for anyone who likes well-constructed cinematography.",Notting Hill

For years they have been romantic and, in some cases, comic. But not intelligent. Richard Curtis seems to be the remedy. Four Weddings and a Funeral was his first shot at the title as Champion of Intelligent Romantic Comedy Screenwriting. Now Notting Hill proves that ""...Weddings..."" wasn't just a coincidence. God direction from Roger Michell helps as well, but what makes it really great (apart from the script) is the acting. Everybody, and that means everybody, are great. But the one who really stands out is Tim McInnerny as Max. Just looking at his eyes moving about, suggesting all kinds of things, is really an example of great acting with very small means. He has a tendency too steal all the scenes in witch he participates. The British romantic comedy is here to stay. Only two things can prevent that. 1; American film companies swallowing the British and letting the American scriptwriters rule again. 2; The British try to make them too fast (and too many). Great Britain; Keep up the good work. Good Show.",Notting Hill
325,Leon-40,A great feelgood film.,8,12 June 1999,"This movie had one of the most clever, funny and witty scripts I have seen in a long time. I found myself enjoying this film so much. Hugh Grant's sense of timing with his lines was done very well, and who could forget Julia Roberts natural beauty. Definitely left me with a smile on my face as I walked out of the cinema, and it stayed there for a long time.",Notting Hill
326,Don-147,Too much Hollywood,8,3 September 1999,"It squints for ""Four Weddings And A Funeral"", but in fact it is a ""Pretty Woman""-flick with swapped roles. The story (beautiful actress falls in love with a clumsy but smart english bookseller) is merely unbelievable - e.g. in the scene where Julia kisses Hugh right out of the blue. This does not necessarily disqualify the movie, if it's made well. But only in a few scenes it reaches the quality of humor that ""Four Weddings"" had. And were Hugh's friends all of the ""weird english""? Speaking of Hugh Grant brings me to the weakest part of the movie: himself. While Julia Roberts at least does her best to look nice, Hugh is a wooden carbon-copy of his greatest roles. Thank god the supporting cast is very good, but, as I said, it gets not enough space to show it.",Notting Hill
327,mjblake,liable to give you tooth-ache.....,7,1 June 1999,"""Notting Hill"" has an attractive leading couple, an interesting supporting cast, and more laughs than your average romantic comedy, but overall it makes ""Four Weddings..."" look like gritty social drama.  Sweet, sweet, sweet. After a decent set-up, thought-provoking even, (how would YOU react if your friend brought a mega-movie-star along as a date to your dinner party?) at every juncture thereafter the film leaves all sense of reality behind and heads off on flights of fancies...... If you want to disengage your brain as the lights dim, and enter a fantasy world where movie stars and mortals meet, mix, and fall in love inside 10 minutes, then this is the film for you. If, however, you're hoping for some sort of realism, and any insights at all into relationships in the 90's, try somewhere else, sorry. Where you might expect to hear the sorts of conversations which might explain why Julia should fall in love with Hugh, you'll only get lingering views of beautiful faces and soft music....... .....And how come Hugh demonstrated that he lived on planet earth by recognising ""Anna Scott"" but somehow didn't know who Leonardo Dicaprio was?",Notting Hill

The story starts when Anna one fine day comes to William's shop to buy a book. If you watch this movie don't expect anything.It's just a feel good movie and does'nt provoke you to think .The best part of the movie is that it's a simple story with simple performances by both the leading actors. Worth mentioning is William's room-mate Spike(Rhys Ifans) who adds some elements of fun to the story every now and then. The story spans both William's and Anna's lives after they meet each other (a cake of life with some problems between the two to serve as toppings !!!). You watch the whole film in one mood so it seems rather monotonous yet you would like it as there has got an appeal in simplicity too which makes this movie click. But the problem in this film is that it does'nt have anything unusual. You can give this movie a miss like any other simple movie.Nothing to watch for. The role of William and Anna could have been done by any other actor, so can say that actors of such caliber have been not used upto the mark. The story is predictable and ending is rather too flat.It could have been better had it not taken the usual path as to strive you got to be different. Yet the main motive of the movie seems to be making a routine film rather than trying to be different. Overall : a simple,feel good,romantic movie.",Notting Hill

I found myself really rooting for this couple. Altogether, this was a joyous experience.",Notting Hill

I was very pleasantly surprised by its charm and humour, and left the theatre smiling.  Hugh Grant was his usual endearing ""everyman"" character -- stumbling and self-conscious, and Julia Roberts broke my heart with her ""I'm just a girl..."" bit near the end.  I've never been a Julia fan, but Stepmom and Notting Hill have pretty much won me over.  Yes, the plotline and cast of characters bear a strong resemblance to Four Weddings and a Funeral, but as far as I'm concerned, that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Both are wonderful, lighthearted feel-good tales that are well worth the price of admission or rental.",Notting Hill

This was a romance that felt like it was real, like it could happen to you, one of those one in a million films that completely engrosses you.  Julia Roberts plays a famous movie star who falls for an English shopkeeper (Hugh Grant), and the complicated, up-and-down romance that ensues.  This is the first film I ever saw in which the audience clapped through the end credits.  Roberts is stunning as the vulnerable and open actress, and Grant is superb as the reserved, bookish man confronted with the love of his dreams.  There is just enough English humor to keep the pathos from crushing you, and an ending that leaves everyone satisfied.  The direction is great, the Notting Hill / Portabello Road setting is quaintly beautiful.  This is _the_ great romance of 1999.",Notting Hill

There are some genuinely funny moments (Grant's zany roommate is the source of most of them), along with some emotionally moving situations.I've seen a lot of Julia Roberts' work, and she is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful actresses working today.  However, I have never seen her as beautiful (radiant!) as she is in this movie.  She also does a fine acting job, playing someone who is reluctant to let strangers get too close while also longing to meet Mr. Right.See Notting Hill with someone you love.  It's one of the good ones.  Score: 9",Notting Hill

The opening song--""She,"" by Elvis Costello, for those who are interested--gives me goosebumps every time I hear it; just fits the movie so amazingly well. This is a truly lively, soul-wrenching tale that even the sternest of people will not be able to watch without feeling something. I'm a guy who NEVER cries, and I came very, very close watching this movie. It has joyous ups and heart-wrenching downs...but as in all Curtis films, ends on a brilliantly happy note. Love it. Hugh Grant is gold: quirky, funny, dry, his best performance outside of the comically cruel ""About a Boy."" And Julia Roberts is spellbinding in her role as Anna Scott...just an amazing match.I always struggle to pick my favorite movies, but this one makes the top 3 easily. It's just that good. See it no matter what. You won't regret it.",Notting Hill
345,Typonaut2000,Rent it if you subscribe to the National Enquirer.,4,28 January 2001,"I kept thinking it seemed odd at the beginning of the movie that Hugh Grant should be surprised by the attentions of this famous movie starlet. After all, he is surely one of the leading heart-throbs on the screen these days. Oh yeah, I remembered, he is pretending to be a nobody, not an actor. But even as a nobody, I had trouble believing he would be shy and unable to get a date. And I had a heck of a time identifying with him.And then there is Julia Roberts, famous actress, pretending she can't find true love, except in a book shopkeeper. Huh??? OK, accepting that stretch, lets say she was not a famous actress and just a girl who comes on to Grant. I doubt someone looking like Hugh Grant would pay much attention to such a mousy chick. So the logic that there is true love in Grant's heart for the person, not the actress is hard to accept.If only there had been a climatic love scene - no not sex, but an intelligent conversation. I mean here are two people who decide not just to marry, but to make radical changes in their lives and they have done nothing deeper than take a walk in a park at night. I mean, she comes in to his book store to buy a book about travel; he owns a book store with nothing but books about travel. I am sitting there just waiting for a conversation about how they love to travel and would like to run away to some tropical isle together, or something. Not just a few quick name droppings of authors and painters.The weird collection of people in Grant's family resembles the Addams Family, with Grant the only normal one. But then it began to make sense: this movie is not aimed at intellectuals, but at air heads who read People magazine and the tabloids, and whose very being hangs vicariously on reading about the lives of celebrities. The family represents the demographics of the tabloid readers, providing one of each type so they can identify with someone in the movie.This could have been a profound movie about love transcending all, etc. Instead it is a superficial romance aimed at people whose idea of romance consists of a famous person taking one look at them and then falling madly in love with them. If you read People magazine, you will probably enjoy it. If you read Scientific American, forget it.One other thing, this is another one of those videos where the box bears no resemblance to the movie. Why is Julia Roberts in pearls with a goofy grin? I mean she spends most of the movie in T-shirt. It makes it look like she is some rich person who lives in a mansion in Notting Hill. When the package doesn't match the contents you know something's wrong.",Notting Hill
346,hellsbells75,Meh,3,24 June 2021,"I hated this first time around but rewatched recently to see if my opinion had changed.I love Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. I'm a huge fan of Pretty Woman and Four Weddings - 2 of my favourite films. Putting them together like this fell short.Aside from the ridiculous fairy tale plot of them meeting in the first place, the chemistry between them just wasn't there. Ever.The only reason for William to even care about Anna was her beauty and being star struck. He knew who she was but there was no indication he was an admirer of her or her work previously. She was rude, closed and standoffish from the start. She seems to revel in his awkwardness whilst shutting him down with one word answers. Then leaving his flat culminates in an inexplicable kiss.She then proceeds to lead him on and dump him when already in a relationship, sleep with him then treat him appallingly. Throughout she's either rude, monosyllabic or openly hostile.The only time she shows any emotion is when she's wallowing in self pity over media stories about her - she's totally self obsessed. Yet she states later that ""fame isn't real"" when she's apparently ""just a girl""...oh really? That's not what she was saying when she was regretting the whole affair with him because of her image.I see no reason for her to love him either. He's wet, unsuccessful, they have nothing in common, there are no real moments of connection on any level. So again, it boils down to looks. Are they both that shallow? She could have anyone she wanted. What made him different? If there was something, the film makers forgot to share that with the audience.When he turns her down due to having his heart broken too often (and reasonable fear she'd do it again) it was actually the only part of the film that made any sense. I cheered for him then for finally not being such a drip. Sadly he reneges and they get together, so he can live in her shadow forever more and not need to worry about that failing bookshop business.His friends advised him badly. I guess being famous and beautiful excuse all bad behaviour.",Notting Hill

348,djwdoc,Creating the Green World,10,15 June 2018,"Romantic comedy is, at its essence, the creation of a new couple, and literally, a new community a new society, out of refugees from dysfunctional social orders. Very commonly, it is a narrative of different social orders, of high culture and low culture, rich and poor, this culture and that culture. It is the creation of a dream world of possiblilities created in opposition to a real world of limitations and cruel, casual savagery. To make a good romantic comedy, you need to show realistic worlds of experience. You need to treat them realistically, with all of their depth and pain and logic. And you need your actors and authoring principals to commit to the Green World of possibility with all of their sincere hopes and dreams, and personal experience, coupled with their professional abilities
If you can obtain all of that-which is a rare attainment in an era of irony and unearned cynicism-then a film such as this may result. The screenwriter, Richard Curtis is a little dismissive of his own efforts, and commonly people who like Curtis's films like Four WedDings and a Funeral, and dismiss Notting Hill as a simpler, more derivative film. But the focus on the romantic leads is fuller in Notting Hill, and in a comedy in which the hidden world of interior journeys is essential, I think this helps. The film is easily Julia Roberts' best. The range of vulnerability and longing her Anna Scott projects, followed by cynicism and brittleness in the next moment, amusement, pain, callousness, fear, a range of complexity from moment to moment as her character progresses through the narrative, is as fine a work as any actress in comedy ever has achieved, in my opinion. Why she did not receive more professional acclaim for this role is a mystery to me, unless it were that she seemed to be playing herself. Hugh Grant's William Thacker is more the sounding board for Roberts' Anna, though his wistful, neurotic passiveness, mixed with a depth of reticent knowledge and unexpressed feeling is precisely the alternative to the narcissistic aggressiveness and expressiveness of Anna Scott's peers. Together, they balance in a centered life is shared experience that, in the film's world, neither can find separately in their own social world. 
There are other great romantic comedies. There are other touching dramas, and films and television worth watching. But there are few great romantic comedies that sincerely present feelings, and that suggest that love means sharing the self one can never become without a partner. This is one of those few.",Notting Hill

Mind you, Julia Roberts was so so so captivating here.rest of the story is probably guessable but the dynamics between the two lead are adorable. sometimes I feel myself blushing while watching.all in all, this movie is pretty good and enjoyable. kinda similar vibe as Love, Actually but with minimum characters",Notting Hill

Slightly pathetic, floppy-haired middle-class Englishman falls for glamorous American who rejects him them gets back together with him and has a group of friends suffering from various disabilities (though being black or Asian was clearly thought too severe a disability to be shown in a PG film).The rest of the problem I had with Notting Hill was that it wasn't very good. Not even as good as Four Weddings, which at least had some funny lines about relationships and marriage in the modern world and had the neat device of dividing the film into: four weddings and a funeral. No neat devices here - though there is a nice tracking shot showing Grant walking through Portobello Road as the seasons pass. Still no sign of any black people though (though last time I went there they made up about 40% of the population).Meanwhile, Hugh Grant plays Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts plays Julia Roberts, some Welsh guy plays Grant's Welsh flatmate who is only funny if you think that one-dimensional caricatures who are unfeasibly idiotic are deeply witty.",Notting Hill
353,Brandy_Alexandre,Notting Hill is Nothing but Joy,10,18 July 2000,"As a ""celebrity"" of sorts, Notting Hill has a special appeal for me.  I was just starting a relationship with a ""commoner"" when the movie released, and since we lived 2500 miles apart we were each going to see it in our own cities and discuss it later.  But in a bid for romance he flew down to take me to the movie and then flew back again that evening.  Awww!I could definitely feel Anna Scott's turmoil in dealing with image and celebrity, and my boyfriend that of William Thacker.  The conversation in the morning about Rita Hayworth is a lot more truth than poetry.  Do people go to bed with ""Brandy Alexandre the porn star"" and become disappointed when they discover it's just me?  It's a tough task for a commoner to overcome being judged as just another fan and earn the trust of the celebrity. Kudos to those who try.  But the instant you hit a bump the celebrity guard goes up, be it Will's ""masturbating Welshman"" spilling the beans on Anna's whereabouts, or (well, that's personal).All in all, Notting Hill was a joy to see and fresh enough to see several times.  The music was new and unique enough to prompt me to buy the CD, which I rarely ever do.  I also bought the video when it came out, which is another rarity.  Like all romantic comedies there is a meeting of the minds and a melting of the hearts in this film.  I thought I, too, had a happy ending, but as it turns out, real life isn't like Hollywood or the many streets named Kensington in the corner of London known as Notting Hill. But having watched the video for the first time after the fact of my failed attempt at bliss with a commoner, the appeal and message still held up. My faith was once again renewed that I still might one day enjoy the often elusive ""happy ending.""",Notting Hill

Garry Marshall made a story about a prostitute lighthearted and romantic, but these guys take an actually good premise and turn it into a two-hour mope-fest.  I was uncomfortable feasting my eyes on the glorious Julia and Hugh when the message of the movie was that fame and public adoration are poisonous and ruinous to their objects.

Hugh Grant's character of William Thacker was brilliant as too was the attractive Julia Roberts playing Anna Scott. I thought Julia's acting in this movie was far more credible than Pretty Woman. I think this is probably due to the fact that she is a movie star so how hard can it be to act as one as opposed to playing a prostitute.There is no doubt that the support staff, namely Thacker's Londoner family are a hillarious and a lovable combination of people. Their presence in the movie adds a real touch of class acting.And finally, you could'nt go past Spike..Thacker's flatmate...I'll never share a house again.The plot is simple but also credible and fun. Go and see it if you want a change from repetitive action movies full of sex, swearing and violence (which I like also).

NH is much more of a romantic drama (although not without some brilliantly funny moments). Although I must confess I felt the urge to give Julia Roberts a good slap on a few occasions, the main attraction of this film is obviously the god-given absence of Andie ""fast-forward all her scenes"" McDowell. Hugh bumbles and Julia sparkles, and all things considered, it's a pretty good way to spend two hours.",Notting Hill

In that sense, it gets the audience on-side from the outset, and draws us deeper, from the initial meeting in the bookshop to its heartfelt and satisfying conclusion.  In between those two extremes however, the film takes us on a journey, one of discovery, comedy, sadness and joy. It is an emotional roller-coaster ride, cleverly manipulating the audience as we sit and ask the $64,000 question: ""Will they or won't they?"".Deep down we all know how it going to end, but what makes a lasting impression is not the conclusion, but how we get there. Roberts and Grant have a great on-screen chemistry; both were brilliantly cast as the 'star of stars' and the bumbling, ordinary guy off the street.  The second-tier characters were also great, adding depth and variety to the film.  Some of the lines are great, funny as, whilst others pull at your heart strings.A great feel-good movie - take your girl to this movie, sit back, and enjoy Notting Hill.

Then, to my surprise, in ten minutes I'm off the internet and watching this surprisingly funny and charming movie.Hugh Grant is typically Hugh Grant.  He is charming in a self-deprecating sort of way with a marvelous sense of comedic timing.  Julia Roberts plays a character that could easily be modeled after herself and does a good job if you can do a bad job playing yourself.

363,Muniba Mastani,Slightly better than AWFUL but only slightly,2,15 January 2002,"As bad as yesterday's bile still rising today. Robert's, the shining American star looks so damn ridiculous in front of unknown English actors who make up in pizzaz what they lack in beauty. Slow moving, stale script and blurred characterization do not a blockbuster make even though Roberts is headlining. Damn, even her smile looks fake in this film, and I never though that was possible. Miracles do happen. Hugh Grant doesn't look like a lemon tart and I didn't think that was possible either. Yes, miracles do happen, but this film is definitely not one of them.",Notting Hill

365,abelishka,Completely Vapid,3,30 July 2002,"That pretty much says it all. There are a few funny moments, but all in all, I think the quality of the movie can be summed up by Julia Roberts's teary line, ""I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her""(complete with long unnecessary faux-method pauses)--and as if the line on its own wasn't bad enough, it's repeated twice!  It's a formulaic and only mildly heartwarming romantic comedy.

366,marperra,Sci-fi romantic comedy,4,18 February 2003,"This is the kind of romantic comedy that seems set in a parallel universe where usual rules of romance don't apply.Here are the rules of 'Notting Hill' universe: a beautiful, stinking rich, famous, self realized actress can't find a decent date; she falls in love for the first ""normal"" guy who looks at her mouth-open and says nothing smart; ""normal"" people are all losers whose life has a meaning only if they meet a movie star; this is shown in the dinner between Robert and Grant's friends. Their chatting is covered by music, implicating that thay can't say nothing interesting.star and ""normal"" people belong to two separate castes, and their love raises more problems than Romeo and Juliet's.Apart from this absurd (and a bit insulting) premise, Roberts and Grant have no chemistry; they seem to be more in need of confidential friendship than love, and we see no solid reason for they should love each other.The script is pretty lame, characters are not well developed, and there's only one really good joke (about Mel Gibson). The supporting characters are nothing special, Rhys Ifans'character is there as a target for jokes, but has nothing to do with the story.Gets one point more for good visuals, the season-changing scene is fascinating.4/10",Notting Hill

371,revoltrightnow,Underneath this saccharine romantic-comedy-by-the-numbers lies an intriguing reflection of our celebrity culture.,6,2 November 2018,"On the surface Notting Hill may present itself as fast food for the broken heart: a harmless piece of feel-good cinema fluff that might double down a night with the Ben & Jerry's in pajama bottoms. However there's much more to this nineties formulaic screwball comedy than meets the eye.The far-fetched plot of Notting Hill draws its inspiration from previous fantasy driven screwball comedies such as Frank Capra's It Happened One Night (1934) and Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936). These pioneering films in screwball comedy capitalized on the glamorized fantasy of the average Joe (or average Jane) living the unthinkable: an actual romantic, meaningful relationship with a bona fide world-famous celebrity.Capra's timeless classics however, were developed in the shadow of the Great Depression, addressing the social issues of inequality amidst the fairytale-like courtship of its protagonists. This was a crucial element to those films; it gave context and grounding for a romance that would otherwise feel completely unreal to the audience. Notting Hill seems to allude to this fictionalized awareness, with both Grant and Roberts repeating the line ""it was surreal, but nice."" This line in particular felt like a wink to us in the audience, since the filmmakers of Notting Hill are unable to make their picture entirely believable. It's as if they are telling us that we should just go along for the ride.Capra's films on the other hand, fully immerse us in their world because the celebrity and ""everyman"" meeting scenarios are not entirely serendipitous. Quite the opposite, in fact, they meet through carefully developed character motivations and fully established locations. Notting Hill has us take an almost religious leap of faith into believing that one of the worlds largest superstars casually buys books without a chaperone or bodyguard in a working-class district of London. When Hugh Grant spills juice on her shirt it requires a second major leap of faith to believe that she would enter a strangers apartment, again without any sort of bodyguard or chaperone, to clean up. To that effect, Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston present a far more believable couple in the action romantic drama The Bodyguard (1992).However, I have no problem turning off my inner critic and push myself to enter the world of the film which isn't drawing me in on its own. I enjoy many cheesy romantic comedies and have no problem defending less believable plot lines like 2001's Serendipity with John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale. Notting Hill however, has far worse writing and a weaker supporting cast. Its comic timing is always a bit off, and even has Hugh Grant saying outlandish lines like ""Ill stabbed him to death later"", meant as a joke early in the film when his roommate doesn't pass along a message left by Julia Roberts (Anna Scott).The supporting cast in this film fulfill the role of a cliché group of British pub crawlers and middle-class domesticity. The one twist in this, which could have been a very interesting character, was a paraplegic woman named Bella played by Gina McKee. However, instead of fleshing out her dialogue she is left as the inspiration p**n for Grant and Roberts' hardships. What's worse, the director actually has her leveraging her disability in order to grant Grant (no pun interned) access to a press conference with Roberts. It seems that Gina McKee's character exists in the film only for this, which is a tragedy of filmmaking in and of itself.The worst aspects of Notting Hill lay in it's character development and completely unhealthy relationship dynamics. Julia Roberts plays an almost pathological narcissist: someone who lies and cheats on Hugh Grant and is completely incapable of any heartfelt apology. It's interesting to note that she never says once in the film that she loves Grant's character, William Thacker. Instead, after breaking his heart twice and lying to him, she asks for him to love her (after a little time has passed, of course).The film sells the relationship on the chemistry of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts and the celebrity fanaticism that it expects from its viewers. In fact, almost every character is enamored with movie stars (even if they don't know which film Anna Scott is in) and plays the everyman role as some sort of stupefied stooge drunk at the alter of celebrity worship. I couldn't help but feel somewhat offended, as if the filmmakers see the public as dribbling idiots who want nothing more than autographs. Even Grant's character, who perpetually ""plays it cool"" is shown in movie theaters gazing upon Roberts in a bizarre peeping-tom like obsession. Six months after she cheats on him he is still lost in his daydream of Roberts, replaying her films. Some of the scenes are a little reminiscent of Stockholm syndrome in the way that Hugh Grant is portrayed as the non-functioning sad sop who can't get over this femme fatal.Perhaps to combat this state of events, the producers of the film have laced every montage and establishing shot with the most unbelievably saccharine soundtrack I've heard in years. Once again, it's as if the filmmakers don't have confidence in the script they've made to draw us into a world of actual romanticism. They need to create that romanticism artificially with a score of Al Greene and other musicians that created songs which far surpass the material they are being used for.The most painful part of the ""Notting Hill experience"" has to be the way Hugh Grant's character is written. Obviously aimed at an unintelligent and emotionally stunted audience of People magazine readers, William Thatcher is portrayed as the ultimate non-believable hunk: He's handsome, charming, unassuming, self-effacing, and yet always has the first two buttons of his shirt open and just enough confidence to say the right thing. In addition to this, he's inexplicably lonely and unattractive to the outside world, despite his undeniable good looks and charm. As a character he has no depth, his past marriage is explained away in one sentence we can see no reason for him to be the suffering hunk that he is, aside from the necessary role that he plays in his ""accidental"" meeting with Anna Scott (Julia Roberts). The script reminds us that he was put on this earth to please her narcissism and ""treat her right"" while she is there to reap the rewards of an undiscovered handsome ball of charm.Ultimately this film was a commercial slam dunk and for somewhat obvious reasons. It gave a somewhat interesting peek into the life celebrities and lets us bask in the glow of our adoration for Julia Roberts, not unlike Busby Berkeley did for Ruby Keeler in his 1930's musicals. Julia Roberts was at the zenith of her career in the 1990's. She has always been a magnificent actor and a terrific beauty, so I was not spared from the spell myself. However, I cannot be sold entirely on a film based on respect and attraction to a single celebrity. The characters need more substance and definition, as well as motivations that extend beyond the codependent and unhealthy dynamic presented to us.While the film has an admirable switch in gender roles, it takes this too far in certain respects as well, with Julia Roberts trying to buy off Grant's character with an expensive painting. It hits all the right notes for the lonely middle America working woman. It has moments of defiance, gender reversal, and a completely submissive and buttery hunk, mastering in the art of spinelessness. The film ends with an ultimate montage of wish fulfillment, overlaid with sappy music to show the good life of marriage, pregnancy, and happily ever after. A final reminder that the script itself is void of any real identity.I can't recommend this movie as a good piece of screwball comedy fluff. However, it is a pretty fascinating look at our culture's fanaticism over celebrities, the way the movie industry views us within that fanaticism, and our skewed complexes for dating fantasies. it seems that we can find any romantic comedy decent enough when codependence and narcissism are normalized by attractive actors and a half-baked script. A forgettable, yet not wholly purposeless movie.",Notting Hill

373,gunga-2,$9.00 Canadian well wasted,1,29 June 1999,"I had already decided that I would give NH a miss in the theatre.  Even the applauded appearance of Twin Town's Rhys Ifans committed this film to the VCR for me.   I was swayed by the opinions of 5 friends and relatives to go.They are all in the movie-reviewer guillotine now. I have never seen a more poorly written film in my life.  The only thing that kept me in the seat, instead of demanding my money back was Mr. Ifans (and even his part wore a little thin toward the end)  Not only was the film poorly written, there was not a shred of character development On the technical front, some of the editing actually made me wince. SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!  There are much better films out there, including better ones made by these film-makers and actors.

Admittedly Julia Roberts' character wasn't much of a stretch but there is some frank insight into the life of anyone ever caught in a British tabloid.Hugh Grant has this uncanny ability of always looking uncomfortable, like a penitent child. Still charming as ever though.I must say, that at first glance, Julia Roberts' character was distant, cool, definitively unlikeable--but that just goes with the territory. You don't truly appreciate her until the very end.Comedy made this film, and for that Rhys Ifans must be commended!

379,ridsa1,I Know its Good BUT...,8,14 February 2000,"Firstly I have to say that I would have seen this movie anyhow because it has Julia Roberts in it(She is one of the most beautiful people in the world!!) and because it was shot two minutes from my house in London.Having seen it I will admit that it is a good romantic comedy, better than many which have come out in the last few years but I still did not quite understand what all the fuss was about!!I mean the director still uses the same *group of friends* strategy and Hugh Grant still plays the only role he can play, that of a muttering, stuttering romantic. What I think gets this working is the performance by Julia Roberts, the one liners, London itself(the terraced houses with the square gardens), the speed with which the lovers get to meet and progress(unlike the American, Wham-Bam-Thank You Mam style!!). I will see it again just to see the sparkle in Roberts`s eyes and *that* smile!!!Many have complained about the music but I honestly think the song ""When You Say Nothing At All"" was just perfect for *that* moment.One thing this movie does though, like all the great romantic comedies do is make you believe in *Love* in Love at first sight and you come out thinking that there is still hope in this world. Its reaffirms this for the doubters and instills it in the non believers.I have never been a very big fan of romances(unless I had to take my girlfriend out or had tickets to the Premieres!!) but this I actually did enjoy watching.Worth the watch....even if its only for Julia Roberts!!!",Notting Hill

381,hannahb-56182,Not As Great As Anticipated,5,12 August 2020,"Today was the first time I ever watched this film (I'm 27) and it was pretty underwhelming to say the least. Did it serve it's purpose as entertainment? Yes, yes it did. But was it as good as I had heard? No, not really.Maybe I'm being nit-picky, and spoilers ahead if you haven't watched this film, but the love interest really irked me. First off, Anna Scott presumptuously kisses Will without asking if he's single or much less interested. All she's going off of is 20 minutes of chemistry they shared before she very clearly pursues him, leads him on and so on, just for him to find out she has had a boyfriend all along. I mean, really? How unfair of her to do that to both of those men regardless of how bad her relationship may be?To further my point on her carelessness, she then goes back to Will and sleeps with him without mentioning if she broke up with her boyfriend at this point. And of all their conversations and arguments, Will never calls her out for her actions or for making him an unwilling participant in an affair.If this movie was switched, and Anna's character was portrayed as a man who had a girlfriend that was going around kissing another girl, it would not be nearly as liked. And in order for his character to be even slightly redeemable, he'd have to be held accountable. But since Anna is such a pretty girl, it's all apparently fine...I mean her behavior really left me wondering why Will wanted her at all? She didn't do anything that was worthy of his feelings.",Notting Hill

384,bacooda,A modern Cinderella tale with English charm and humour,9,20 February 2007,"Can lightning strike twice? Well with writer Richard Curtis it has! I understand he wrote this screenplay and completed it before he realised just how similar it was to his previous hit, Four Weddings and a Funeral.Let's examine this a second: Hugh Grant is the hero; There's an elusive and glamorous American that he falls for; He has a circle of friends, each in their own way a success AND a failure in life, and yet Hugh's character (William Thacker) is somehow trailing them all; there's the kooky yet endearing sister; the character with a tragic disability; a complete buffoon of a sidekick; and several near-misses.Yet it's all so thoroughly entertaining, AGAIN. It's like a delicious dish, and its recipe for success is cooked up time and again by Curtis as Jamie Oliver's older and wiser brother.As a single bloke in this day and age I AM William Thacker, and I AM Charles in Four Weddings. So on the one hand you'll have parts of the audience identifying with the hero, and parts of the audience wanting the hero to be their real-life partner. Yet character empathy alone is not enough to carry a film.The path that the hero follows needs to be a roller-coaster ride. Sometimes it's up, sometimes it's down, but it's never boring. In fact, the pacing is assuredly steady just as, in one excellent scene, we see the indication of time passing in an extremely effective way. I feel that Curtis learnt from Four Weddings and tightened the strings on the time line in this movie. Where Four Weddings very occasionally crawls, Notting Hill paces along assuredly.In addition, our hero's roller-coaster ride must be believable. Could this really happen? Why not? Do movie stars ALWAYS fall for other celebrities? So what of the performances? Well Hugh Grant is really Hugh Grant (again) in this role. But isn't that why we go to see Hugh Grant movies? He's funny yet tragic, vulnerable yet assured, and I can't imagine anyone else playing William.Julia Roberts is one of those stars who, love her or hate her, delivers in every role. She's very believable as Anna Scott, showing the resolute public charm of a movie star, whilst exposing the hidden human frailty behind Hollywood's finest. And this despite the undoubted (and wholly false) criticism that she's simply playing a movie star like she in fact is. She perhaps COULD have leaned back and simply ambled through the movie expecting it to be an easy role for her, but in a truly professional manner, she's sought to add depth and weight to her character.The rest of the cast sparkle in their roles, most notably Rhys Ifans as Spike. But even without the requisite comedy set pieces that Rhys revels in, actors of class such as Tim McInnerny, James Dreyfus, Gina McKee, Emma Chambers and Hugh Bonneville expertly fill in the no-less important landscape of this joyous and warm piece of art.Watch out, too, for memorable cameos by Alec Baldwin, Mischa Barton and Matthew Modine.So who is Cinderella and who is the Prince? At first glance William is the hopeful nobody. But really, as the story develops, we'll see that there are two character's dreams unfolding in Notting Hill.Why then not 10 out of 10? Well, full marks would have been ME starring as William Thacker... ;)",Notting Hill

386,hessa-almasoud,My all time favorite!,9,29 July 2016,"This is my all time favorite romcom. It just manages to touch ur heart, make you laugh and lift you up all at the same time. I watched it in the cinema when it first came out with my mom and sister, but I cant forget how much we laughed and just fell in love with the characters at the time.I decided to revisit it today and it was as hilarious and cute as I remember! Quite honestly I can say its my favorite Romcom of all time. William is a bookstore owner from Notting Hill, London .. an area he obviously loves living at as you can see from the way he describes it at the start. Although he owns a bookstore it is not doing that well when he meets Anna; a glamorous award winning actress from America who is on the way to more and more success, a contrast from the way his life is going. Although in that respect they are different there is a kindness, a genuineness, and a sense of humour in William that is hard to miss, and he is the perfect gentleman to Anna.Certain events bring them together and William seems to have a real connection with Anna and gives her the normalcy that her life as an actress truly misses. With a few twists you get this will they or wont they feeling and you can't help but think please god get them together!Being a guy who is definitely not the groopie / stalker type.. even after an intimate moment William does not get his hopes up and doesn't try to pursue her.However, Anna calls his flat because she wants to meet with him. In fact if it weren't for Anna's initiative I don't think they would have ended up together at all because she's this movie star from a completely different world. Eventually, you see the negative side of him being involved with an incredibly famous woman and how testing that is for him.Spike is a character I must comment on. I don't know how to describe him, but his idiocy added many more giggles to this deeply romantic movie.With all of William and Anna's trials this movie has the most beautiful ending that just lifts you up every time you see it!",Notting Hill

396,vishnu77,One of my favorites....,10,20 May 1999,"I had the chance to see this movie last year at the test screening. I went in only knowing that Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant were in it. That's all. I walked out loving it. Now that it is being advertised, I can say that the commercials don't even begin to scrape the surface of this film. There have been so few genuine love stories lately that this is sure to take its rightful place among the great romantic comedies. It does answer a question sometimes wondered by non-celebrity and celebrity alike: How do you find someone out there who wants you for you? How do know when someone wants you simply because you're famous instead of for the person underneath? And how do keep the media away? It's a funny movie, with that dry British wit and the American savviness. It's a wonderful look at love and the battle to make a relationship work under extraordinary circumstances. There's nothing I would change about this movie. In particular, I loved the roommate, Spike. But this movie will endear its way into your heart if you've ever fallen in love, with someone who knew or someone who never knew.",Notting Hill

I wanted to yell at him up on screen ""DON'T DO IT!"" (sorry if that is too specific)However, this is a second opinion, and obviously is different... First, to sell the film they obviously had to tie things up - so to speak (had to??? hmmmmm). Yet I saw more reasons for the ending the second time around. It really held up, I wasn't bored, I still laughed a lot (espec. at the flatmate and sister!) and I came out pleased.One big beef though, both times around: are we theater-goers so unintelligent or so banal that they have to THROW the happy-ending, wrap-it-all-up, garbage in our faces??? Why did they not end at the press conference??? Why do we have to see all that extra junk at the end. I could figure that out myself, thanks.All in all enjoyed it, and it was actually worth the money.",Notting Hill
399,Dan-153,Charming,8,25 May 1999,"A charming and frequently funny film which remind you what a great comic actor Hugh Grant is, as well as how beautiful Julia Roberts can be.  There is no doubting the similarities to Four Weddings (Hugh Grant effectively plays the same character minus stutter, his character also has the same bunch of loser-ish, cuddly friends) but that isn't necessarily a bad thing because it is also every bit as polished, warm and well acted as the original.If you are a girl, go and see it.  If you are a boy, take your girlfriend (it will put her in a good mood, even if it doesn't do the same to you, you old cynic).",Notting Hill
400,mrb-2,A Movie for Everyone,8,2 April 2000,"This was a great romantic movie. Although I was never a big fan of Ms.Roberts, she was great, showing a much larger range of emotion than I thought she had.Hugh Grant was his usual lovable self, this part was made for him and both he and Roberts had chemistry that was quite noticeable on the screen.This was also a very funny film. I saw it in the theater and I laughed out load several time as did the rest of the audience. Grant's crazy roommate Spike was a riot and the actor playing him was brilliant. The rest of the supporting cast were also good due in part to the writing which developed the characters so you cared about each one.This is a movie for everyone who likes a love story with humor and I recommend you see it.",Notting Hill
401,D_Smith,"More equal, not sequel",7,7 June 1999,"This film is over-long.  A dull 45 minutes could have been edited from the second half and none of us would have been any the wiser for it.  So very formulaic: Boy and girl meet, fall in love, break up due to misunderstanding(s), and you can guess the last bit.  But you're not watching for the plot (I hope).The script is sharp, but could be trimmed, as mentioned above.  Funnier than Four Weddings, with a better cast.  Hugh Grant has suddenly gained a smidgen of acting ability, since I found his character quite likeable and amusing.  Julia Roberts was as charming as she's ever been.  Rhys Ifans was brilliant.As for the direction - two great moments spring to mind, a change-of-seasons stroll through a market, and a splendid ascending top-down shot of a park. Nicely done, Roger Michell.Overall - funny, charming, but a little too stereotyped and over-long.  At times I wished I was watching the space film Julia Roberts's character was promoting, but then again, you are bound to see plenty of films this year worse than Notting Hill.",Notting Hill
402,Breyner,Opportunistic and harmless little film,1,2 June 1999,"""Notting Hill"" is destined to be the hype of the year in Britain and, as usually, what you get is a lot less than all the hype made you expect. The attempt to cash in on ""Four Weddings.."" is really obvious, but at least the latter had some rhythm. In ""Notting Hill"", the storyline is just an excuse for yet another artificial joke. Another problem is that the image the fime wants to portray is so clean, that it ends up having no relation to the actual neighbourhood it tries to portray. A total waste of money, which should be compensated by all unwarned movie-goers.",Notting Hill
403,Redshoes,A movie that my 13 year old daughter and I could both enjoy.,8,29 May 1999,"I went to this movie with my 13 year old daughter and we both loved it.  It has all the old fashioned elements of a great romance plus the sharp edged humour of a great modern comedy. Julia Roberts appears to play herself in this movie but that's OK since her character could be her in real life. The other characters look like real people right down to their crooked teeth and blemished skin.  In other words, we can all imagine ourselves in their places.Highly enjoyable!",Notting Hill
404,RWB99,"A Terrific film, Julia Roberts is superb.",9,30 May 1999,"It may be easy to discard Julia Roberts performance in ""Notting Hill"", since she is playing a very highly paid, world famous American actress.  But this truly is one of her best performances.  ""Notting Hill"" is a terrific romantic comedy.  Julia is great, and so is Hugh Grant, as the common man that catches Julia's eye.  Hugh and Julia do get overshadowed sometimes by Hugh's friends and family crazy antics, much like in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral.""  This is a simply romantic movie definitely worth seeing.",Notting Hill
405,sannent,Why cry??,6,29 August 1999,"When it came to my attention that many women and even men I know cried during this movie I wanted to see it ASAP. What a disappointment! Both Julia and Hugh can be pretty cute and a love story of the two is not unthinkable. But why cry?? Nothing really sad happened except for the woman in the wheelchair which I do not think is the thing they cried about. The story then.... , so very very superficial and such an easy plot, was unable to bring tears to my eyes for any moment during the whole film. I guess the makers just thought seeing Julia and Hugh on the big screen together would make people not pay attention to the story anymore. Since the movie was a success I guess they were right, it is exactly what happened.Though watching this film is a sweet way to spend some time don't expect to feel anything more than amazement about the tears of your fellow viewers. That is if you don't get hypnotized by the stars as well...",Notting Hill
406,Dblchery,"My Eyes were full of hearts and stars while taking in the view of ""Knotting Hill.""",8,3 January 2000,"I have passed this film sitting on the shelf in the local video store many times.  Sometimes, I guess, you're just not ready for a film at some points in your life.  Then one day there you are with it in yer hand waiting in line to rent it. For me, it was just that.  It was beautiful and very endearing.  The chemistry between Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant reminded me of Doris Day and Rock Hudson in ""Pillow Talk."" It's been along time since I've yelled at the TV screen, ""Kiss her already!!"" Julia Roberts was very dignified and her timing was brilliant.  Hugh Grant...well, I think I see the brillance in him as when I saw ""Four Weddings and a Funeral.""  The story was like a modern day, ""As You Like It"" with many characters in the gallery pulling lines and sight gags.  I can't say or compare much more because I don't want to spoil it for anyone else who would love to feel their heart swell and look at the world with stars in their eyes as so many of us need to.  Cheesy, Huh?  Well, I'm a lollipop for a good romantic movie with giggles galore.  I would like to be sneaky and mention there was a brilliant transition of seasons in the film that left me in awe.  There are still good surprises in cracker jack boxes after all!",Notting Hill
407,slsmith2,I absolutely loved this movie,10,10 November 1999,"I absolutely loved this movie!  I saw it in the theater 4 times!  Julia Roberts is one of my favorite actresses, and her performance as Anna is outstanding.  Hugh Grant also does a wonderful job as William.The movie combines romance with humor to create some fantastic lines.  Two of my favorite segments are the apricots soaked in honey and when William and Anna go to the private garden. (whoopsidaisies!)  Practically every scene incorporates humor, and it's all fresh; nothing cliche.The supporting characters complete the cast and also create humorous moments of their own.  Every scene that involves Spike, William's disgusting flatmate, involves some type of oddity, even if only Spike himself. Notting Hill is a fantastic movie that I can't wait to watch again and again.  Without a doubt one of my favorites.  I give it a 10!",Notting Hill
408,google eye,Hugh plays it again.,6,25 November 1999,"It never ceases to amaze me that Hugh Grant succeeds in navigating through his movie career playing the same character over and over again.  I admit to finding this character likable in his earlier films, however now I just find it irritating.  In saying this, Notting Hill is a relatively enjoyable (although somewhat bland) production, and probably worth a viewing if you have nothing better to do (i.e. wash your hair).",Notting Hill
409,Mandi02,I liked it! I really did.,9,17 January 2000,"I found this movie touching. It kind of leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling inside, like you just want to run out and fall in love right then. The music, especially She, by Elvis Costello, just creates a mood that everything is so perfectly RIGHT for them. It is beautiful.  I didn't find it boring or dull (in response to the other comments)but maybe that's because this is sort of a ""chick flick"" and well, I'm a ""chick"", so those chick flicks appeal to me. But really, it was not just a romance.. it was funny. I laughed (and cried) straight through it, and I would consider it a worthwhile rental (and totally the 6 bucks i paid to see it in the theater!)",Notting Hill
410,david.farthing,A pleasure to watch again and again,9,4 September 2000,"This film is one of those where you can relate some of the characters actions to people you know. Spike plays his part perfectly and does exactly what you would expect. As usual Julia plays her part with both grace and style. She is so varied in her films, for those of you who have seen Erin Brockovich her role is a total contrast. The setting of Notting Hill was great, it is a location of contrasts and people and allowed the story to flow very well. This is a romantics film, which most of us are at heart. The plot is simple, easy to follow and this is one of those films you can watch again and again. Each time you can get something different out of it. I laughed more the third time, even though I knew what was coming. An excellent evenings entertainment. Highly recommended.",Notting Hill

412,Papa_Legba,solid and enjoyable,8,10 February 2002,"I don't normally enjoy this type of movie, both for their predictable outcomes and their sappy content. My enjoyment of this one though, is unique in that it meets my criteria for such a film to be enjoyable. The acting is solid and though you generally know whats about, the journey is quite interesting. The humor is an odd combo of over the top and understated, typically British, and well done. The themes, better to have loved, the strength of family and loneliness in our world are all nicely explored. Ten minutes into the movie I was enjoying myself and thats really the final deciding factor. 8/10",Notting Hill
413,egiray,I loved Julia Roberts,9,9 April 2002,The film is very enjoyable. Can be watched with family. I loved Julia Roberts after this film. She was so impressive while asking his lover to love him again. I think nobody can refuse that woman like that. The movie was excellent,Notting Hill
414,nikkik1600,"a whimsical, fun first half, that only gets worse",6,24 June 2002,"From the start, the movie is engaging and enjoyable, with Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant perfectly cast.  The acting is strong throughout, but the writing often leaves much to be desired.  In the second half, the plot seems to completely lose itself, and the characters are expected to keep the movie going through sheer likeableness, and no actor, even if it is Hugh Grant, can be expected to pull that off.  The touching ending redeems it a bit, but on the whole, I'm stuck with the lasting memory of the thoroughly boring middle section.",Notting Hill
415,ddeckerblast,My all time favorite,10,23 September 2003,"If there was ever a story that touched your heart and had you cheering for the underdog, it's Notting Hill. Julia Roberts did a fantastic job of playing 'herself' really and Hugh Grant was just perfect. I loved Spike the roommate - he was a wonderful touch to a wonderful film. Truly enjoyable and something I could watch again and again.",Notting Hill

418,raulkulkarni,"..How love should be, floating through a dark blue sky- with a goat playing a violin!",9,4 May 2012,"Notting Hill is an exceptional Rom-Com flick, and one of the very few which actually take your breath away.William Thacker, a divorced gentleman from London, who stays with a quite tolerable Welsh room-mate, strangely meets the gorgeous American Actress Anna Scott in his tiny not-so-profit making Travel Book Shop. When a non-affordable Orange juice is spilled all over Ms Scott, the plot begins to unfold in a series of emotionally complicated twists and turns as we dig deep into the lives of this made-for-each-other couple with a constant Fate (sometimes spelled as Scott's Annoying Boyfriend) Intervention.All praises for the cast of this film. Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts play two totally contrasting characters; Roberts- the foul-tempered, moody, controversy-phobic girl and Grant- the humble, charming, and at times a reality-struck lad. Also, apart from the brilliant supporting crew, a person of interest to me was Dylan Moran, as Rufus the Book Thief, who ironically goes on to create and host a Book related Popular TV Series later on.At times of depression, Roger Michell beautifully uses Hugh Grant's subtle sense of humor to get the momentum back on track. Some real intelligent use of comedy, some intentional puns (Robert's Big Feet, Large Shoes) and some British Classics (Whoopsidaisies!) make this movie a thoroughly enjoyable film.A predictable end is expected, however, Julia's beautiful smile and Elvis Costello's 'She' makes your heart pump up with unexpected Love hormones. I enjoyed the entire 124 minutes and can definitely watch it numerous times. If only Julia's interpretation of Chagall's work was true, the quest for Love would be simple, or would it?I give it a well-deserved 9 out of 10.",Notting Hill

Did not see it when it was shown on TV. It would be nice to have a sequel based on how Anna and Will are getting on. Actually the photography was lovely. also the tunes. Maybe Ms. Roberts may consider doing the sequel maybe down the road, but at this time is a bit busy with family congrates .. well done.. Maybe they can bring back the original cast Spike was a ""gas"" so funny and so was ""Honey"" they make a cute item. Or maybe a movie on them or Bella and her mate. They were a good match also.

We all watched it regularly, knew quotes (I basically know this film word for word), and owned the soundtrack. Its funny, its mesmerizing, and its intriguing. It follows the life of William Thacker though his relationship with Anna Scott, as an unlikely love blossoms. Julia Robert's and Hugh Grant complement each other immensely, causing us to smile uncontrollably and feel like you are the one who has fallen in love. Not only is this film amazing but unforgettable, you will find yourself quoting it, and listening to the soundtrack on repeat. Not including the 'Im just a girl' scene, which will melt your inner core. I can guarantee that you will love the film and will be re-watching clips and scenes, for weeks after. Its defiantly not a film you will forget soon.",Notting Hill

The characters feel real, down-to-earth, reachable though a bit predictable at the end. The climax is not much of hype. I mean the audience can feel how this gonna end. However, the story is engaging. I like the press scene. Some parts seems a bit hurried, like, Julia Roberts' sudden departure to USA. This could have been synchronized with Hunt's changing seasons scene. At the end, this movie is all about simplicity, families, relations, easiness of life. Reminds me of freshness of Roman Holiday.",Notting Hill
423,chiku2se,Irritating movie,4,16 October 2005,"Notting Hill is a very simple and ordinary movie. The movie will be liked by those who watch it without needing explanations for the happenings. Right from the beginning it leaves holes in the script. A famous actress comes to a book store and goes unnoticed by the crowd of that town!! Several characters in the movie find themselves proud to have lunch or talk with the celebrity but knew nothing about the movies she acted in!! The character of Anna Scott (Julio Roberts) is half-baked. In the initial half of the movie she is portrayed as a simple, straightforward person with an unassuming personality. She fells in love with an ordinary man William (Hugh Grant) who owns a book-store. The sequence in which she stays overnight with William and shares bed with him indicates her willingness of a long term relationship with him. In the very next frame when she is exposed by the media, she lambastes the same person and considers him responsible for all the mess and leaves him. William seems to be an absolute draft in this sequence. Why the hack he could not prevent Anna and then his eccentric house-mate from going out of the apartment when he knew that there is a huge crowd of media waiting outside. Six months later for no reason explained in the movie Anna comes back and ""begs"" William to love her. Six months of abstention from a person could actually subdue any feelings William if at all she had any. However in the movie it happened differently. There are so many sequences which will leave you in awe due to missing conversations which you would normally expect. For example when Williams's sister reveals that she is engaged to someone William expresses his surprise. But to my surprise he didn't bothered to ask who she got engaged to.This movie could be viewed without getting irritated only if you overlook all these holes in the script. If you view with a normal mind set it will start getting on your nerves very soon. The only intelligent sequence was when William declines Anna when she returns to him for the second time. I love suspense thrillers specially Alfred Hitchcock's' movies. Give it a miss if you carry a critical view point while watching a movie. I will give it 4/10.",Notting Hill

It offered nothing new, and nothing that hasn't been done better. You could see the end coming from before you even sat down in the cinema, and this twinned with the fact that it wasn't in the slightest bit believable ruined what could have been an okay film. Oh well.",Notting Hill
426,un,The romance always sells,7,16 June 1999,"It is just one of its kind movie, following pretty much of the romantic-comedy pattern.  However, it's pretty good in catching the mood, and its overall elements seems to be smooth.  Therefore, the romance sells again.",Notting Hill

There is also romance, in huge quanities. Don't miss it!",Notting Hill

I would see the movie again for that scene alone!",Notting Hill

A 7 of 10.",7,28 May 1999,"Notting Hill will be remembered for its title (interesting on the tongue for the strictly American) and most likely for little else.  It is more or less the typical boy meets girl loses girl meets girl loses girl meets girl loses girl gets girl story with the twist that the girl is the world's most famous movie star and the boy has an amusing sister and an idiotic roommate.  The beauty of the rich woman loves normal guy and visa versa plot is the dialogue -- or lack thereof, to be more exact;  Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts communicate so much through his ever-expressive eyes and her center-of-attention mouth whether smiling or smirking.",Notting Hill
432,jeem-2,Hugh Grant in familiar surroundings with better results.,9,30 May 1999,"It works for me.  I doubted that this scenario would get me into the movie, but the characters were quickly in place allowing for an enjoyable visit. It works better than Four Weddings because the Julia is much better written than Andie. I've read elsewhere that Hugh Grant reminds people of Cary Grant and I heartily agree with that.  Hugh shows himself to be a victim, commentator and survivor of the situation without falling out of his character. Julia Roberts is a wonderfully complex person complete with flaws that humanize the role. The supporting cast contributed greatly to elevating the whole piece.  They may look a bit familiar, but then its always nice to see old friends. On a personal note, I wish that the opening credits were on top of the screen because the guy in front of me was really big. Go see it.",Notting Hill
433,vesna,just lovely,9,2 June 1999,"I know this might not be the best movie i the world, but I just loved it. It's not intense, it's warm, it's optimistic. Yeah, I know, it's also not very likely that something like ""movie super star walks into small book store on the edge of survival and falls for the owner forever"" could happen in the real world, but this is the movie, and that's what I like about it - takes us into surreal realm. I've seen ""Four weddings and a funeral"" and I liked it a lot, ""Notting Hill"" has some of that same atmosphere (probably because of Hugh Grant), but I liked ""Notting Hill"" better. Don't ask me why, I just don't know, it's just my general impression upon first seeing that was better here. Definitely worth seeing. Relaxing. Enjoy.",Notting Hill

436,valenti,"Flawed, but likeable",8,20 June 1999,"Like nearly all ""romantic comedies, this one is somewhat flawed. Julia Roberts, for all her acting prowess, seems a tad flat--like she'd been drinking a bit too much decaf tea. Her character is incredibly subdued, albeit charming (most of the time). Hugh Grant's character is seems socially inept, a strange trait for a guy that handsome. One would think he'd have the entire city banging at his door.The dialog between the two never gets down to a lot of the ""real"" nitty-gritty"" things one would normally hear in a developing relationship (we never hear him ask HER if she is married or has a boyfriend), and they spend little time talking about things they have in common.All of the characters, including the supporting cast, are imperfect, which I believe is a plus. It adds an element of realism to this sometimes fairy-tale-esque story.Still, in spite of these flaws and a sometimes predictable plotline, I liked it. There was a nice ambiance to the film, and I especially enjoyed the seasonal transitions at the end of the movie when he's walking down the street. Nice touch.Compared to the recent ""You've Got Mail,"" this movie is less predictable, less ""American"", often more realistic, and generally funnier. You wouldn't want to make an entire meal of this movie, but it's still a tasty dessert!",Notting Hill

Roberts sparkles as what can't be a big stretch for her- playing the biggest film star in the world. Grant does a good turn as the bumbling bookseller who can't help but fall madly in love with her, and the supporting cast is brilliant (especially the woman who plays Grant's best friend). While Notting Hill was at times predictable, it's a great example of light summer fare that will be equally enjoyed by your date, your siblings, or your parents.",Notting Hill
438,Tris-3,Absolutely Brilliant,10,3 December 1999,"When this film came out at my cinema last summer I didn't go to see it because i had it in my mind that this was just gonna be another one of those boring romances. However when i got it on video and watched it for the first time i thought it was on of the best films i had ever seen. It is one of the only films i have seen that has brought me close to tears. The acting from Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant was excellent and there were times when this film really made me laugh out loud. The actor in it had to be Williams (Hugh Grants) lodger Spike. He was absolutely brilliant and really had me laughing. I just loved the way he talked the truth. Near the end when William tells his friends he has turned down Anna Scott they all agree with him but inside they want to tell him he is wrong. Then Spike walks in and his first reaction is 'You stupid prick'. I thought this was a classic. Julia looked beautiful as ever and if there is one thing that i walk away from and remember about this film is the line she says in Williams bookstore. It goes 'The fame thing isn't real you know. And don't forget, i'm still just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her'. This line will stick in my mind forever as i think it is so moving. It reminds us no matter how famous these actors and actresses are they are still just ordinary people at heart. I loved this film so much i didn't stop watching it for 2 weeks. It is a crime if you don't see this film so either BUY IT OR RENT IT NOW. Seriously you will love it. 10/10",Notting Hill
439,janeq,Well worth seeing.,10,2 June 1999,"From the start, we were transported to Notting Hill, London, where we embarked on a fairytale reality of life.  Notting Hill, the home of William the bookseller, who was leading the 'quiet' life in his bookshop, when in walks a famous hollywood star.His life is turned upside down.  The story is very unbelievable, but it is great entertainment, and well worth watching.  Julia Roberts plays a famous actress to a tee. Her character cool and calm in the scariest of situations, battling with the fact that she is underneath all of the painted glitz, a normal person, with normal needs.  Grant plays his usual British Bumbling Bloke with great effect in the movie.  For my money, it was the actor who played Spike, in those disgusting underpants that should, at least be awarded a comedy award for his hilarious performance.",Notting Hill
440,R Krah,Saved by supporting actresses/actors,5,13 July 1999,"Notting Hill has very funny and great solemn scenes - almost always due to the supporting cast.

However, 'Notting Hill' definitely lived up to my expectations, proving to be a leading contender, at least in my mind, for one of this summer's best movies.Perhaps I'm just a hopeless romantic, but I found the premise of the movie, and the way in which it was carried out, to be absolutely wonderful.  Sure, the general idea is rather implausible - a world-famous movie icon falling in love with an average-Joe - but it was romantic nonetheless.The characters were truly believable and well-developed, making it very easy to lose yourself in the goings-on between them and feeling the very feelings they feel.  And William and Anna were ideally cast with Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, both talented performers in their own right who absolutely sparkle when paired.I would, without a doubt, recommend this film to anyone who believes in the magic and power of love.  It gives an always-welcome message of hope that sometimes you may not be able to find what you're looking for - but it could find you, in the most unimaginable way.I know I will definitely be going back to see 'Notting Hill' for a second time - and quite possibly for a second, third... well, you get the picture.",Notting Hill
443,griff-30,FOUR WEDDINGS meets THE YOUNG ONES,7,30 May 1999,Very funny.  Rhys Ifans steals the show.  The rest is a watered down version of FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL.,Notting Hill
444,loxwood,Pretty unimpressed,1,31 May 1999,"Did not look forward to this film and was not disappointed. Not a patch on 4 Weddings.  Really difficult to find much to laugh about. Grant's habit of saying ""Right"" about 500 times was infuriating. Nobody, including the Welshman, had any good lines. Again lack of colour in the street scenes by leaving out the West Indian contingent was an error. Roberts did look younger and prettier but perhaps she benefited from lack of make up? All in all a film to quickly forget.",Notting Hill
445,mikey-101,Excellent romantic comedy.,9,4 June 1999,"Okay, so there are similarities with Four Weddings which may give the film a formulaic feel, but hold on, it's a romantic comedy.  Of course it follows a formula.  So did Midsummer Night's Dream.  It's no less of an entertainment for that.The Notting Hill of the title is presented as a pleasant place to live which many of its residents might disagree with.  However its no more idealised than New York (or wherever it was)in You've Got Mail.Hugh Grant is at his bumbling best.  Yes, it's his stock character, but he does it very well.  Julia Roberts is gorgeous.  There is a central speech in the film(You'll spot it!) which she pulls off beautifully.Great support from the ensemble cast including all sorts of people from British television.  The romantic bits are really romantic and most of the comedy works.The soundtrack's not bad either.  In particular Elvis Costello's version of She is brilliant.",Notting Hill
446,Kate-117,This movie made me believe that true love actually can exist between anyone.,10,17 June 1999,"I watched this movie in the theater not once, but twice. One thing is for sure- it gets better with time. I loved the film even more the second time. Wildly entertaining and sweetly romantic, Notting Hill was the best of both worlds. It was definitely worth the money!",Notting Hill
447,Dizzley,Yet another exported view of England,6,31 March 2000,"Look. I did enjoy the film but it is not great. I get the impression that a group of Brits want to impress the US with a certain British ""coolness"" and yet don't take themselves too seriously. The whole thing feels like a cynical way of making money. I don't find this very funny. It's worth a giggle but that's it. The US produces refined comedy in the mould (mold) of Frasier and that is something we could do well in England, but don't bother. The US also make comedies like Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) and they are a real hoot. England could produce those too.I don't live like the Notting Hill-ites and yet I see true humour every week. Perhaps I should write something? I just might.So - the English can be funny and English but not a caricature like this. Try some of the Ealing comedies of the 50's - look at ""The Lavender Hill Mob"" or basically the feel of ""The Pink Panther"".Anyway, enough wibble. This is all the fault of two beers and waiting for some process to end at work.Enjoy it. It's OK but in a cynical way.",Notting Hill

I think he is so charming in everything he does.  He and his ensemble friends just made the movie for me. Go see it, for Grant will keep you rolling in the aisles.P.S. For anyone who read the message about the positive representation of those with disabilities, I totally agree with what was written, except that Honey was Will's(Hugh Grants) sister.",Notting Hill
450,Pesch,One of the many movies without any depth.,4,25 July 2000,Hugh Grant needs to learn how to act in another role. He's always playing this clumsy fool who gets the fancy babes in the end. Too bad the other English actors didn't have a larger part in this movie because they know how to act (e.g.: Spikey was quite funny).,Notting Hill
451,jesterchris-2,Bravo!,10,27 November 1999,"This was, in my opinion, the best romantic comedy I have ever seen!!! The whole plot was very believable, and the reactions of everyone meeting her were simply hilarious.  The comedy was intertwined very well into the serious nature of the subject of true love.  I greatly enjoyed the ending and the way they had the time pass by.  We saw more than just the two main characters lives and we saw the personality of each of the co-stars. Terrific performances all around!!!",Notting Hill
452,mosher.jf,An excellent movie,10,22 December 1999,"This movie was great because of its versatility-- it is an excellent date movie, but is funny enough to watch by yourself or with friends.  Hugh Grant is hilarious and relateable as a bumbling average Joe.  The cinematography is really good, too.  The final shot is perfect, down to every last detail-- the picture of true happiness.  Go see this movie.",Notting Hill
453,sx70nk,oh boy,1,18 October 2000,"As much admiration as I have for david Snouffers well written appraisal for this movie, I thought it was with ""The Jackal"" the worst movie I had seen in years. There is a point where predictable well-manufactured emotional plot-twists kill any kind of compassion because all of a sudden it hits you: You are being toyed with by a well-working romance machine and every character is a caricature of themselves (or simply jumped out of ""4 weddings and a funeral"" into this one...), none of this would ever happen, none of it feels real, and most importantly: nobody cares anyway, because he is such a wimp and she such an annoying primadonna. Julia Roberts is decent as always in her performance as Anna Scott and that just about sums up everything positive I have to say about this tremendous bore and insult on any critical mind.",Notting Hill
454,mledinh,Tripe,6,28 July 2002,"Julia Roberts delivers the same sort of schtick again -- a movie star! But oh SO down to earth.  She failed to sell it because she is utterly without charm.  And you can't tell me that she was actually acting in this movie -- it's not much of a stretch when she is, in essence, just playing HERSELF.The script and plot were overly sentimental and unimaginative.  Julia's immortal utterance of ""I'm just a girl...standing before a boy...asking him to love her""  will live on in my mind as the most nauseating and cringe-inducing line of all time.  I shudder at the memory.Only Hugh Grant managed to save this movie from being completely intolerable.",Notting Hill
455,peskat,"Nice sweet movie, but...",8,26 November 2001,"In all a nice and very enjoyable movie, Notting Hill missed my perfect 10 on the little details. Julia Roberts was as always fabulous and Hugh Grant definately can play the typical englishman but... I hated the moments were he stuck his foot in his mouth. I don't know if other people like it but it's not my favorite thing in a love film. And that's what it is: a nice and enjoyable love movie.P.S. :There is nothing better in the movie than the happy ending.",Notting Hill

457,johnnymyo,More middle-class tossers with implausible speech patterns from Dick Curtis,1,2 August 2006,"Having been underwhelmed by Four Weddings and nauseated by Love, Actually, what was I doing submitting myself to around two hours of Notting Hell? You might well ask.Richard Curtis is a New Zealand-born writer who seems to have a love affair with the duller end of the British bourgeoisie. Except that they have the ""endearingly eccentric"" habit of swearing in linguistic constructions unknown to anyone in this country (I was born and bred in London, and I don't recognise any of these people). It's a bit squirm-making to think people outside the UK might imagine this is what we're like and, goodness knows, Curtis's feeble-minded films are commercially successful enough domestically, so I can only take comfort from the thought that most intelligent moviegoers will have noticed that all of his subsidiary characters are essentially the same, whatever the film, and serve only as baffle-boards for the main characters' lame one-liners, while they also oil the lurching from each dull conflict to the next insipid resolution. Anyway, you can read the other reviews to get an idea of the plot  and there's a f**cking awesome twist (only kidding). I just hope Julia Roberts got a good cut of the (depressingly inevitable) profits  she acts very well in a film that's otherwise rather like an extended, self-satisfied British sit-com.But I will stop to waste a little more bile on the notorious ""brownie"" scene, in which assorted dullard characters with not one iota of self-awareness between them compete as to who is the more hard-done-by for a morsel of cake, albeit in a ostensibly comedic way  let's just say you don't want to be eating for this. Unless, possibly, the hour or so that's gone before has driven you to a chosen snack of 100 temazepam.",Notting Hill
458,dcbusiness-1,How On Earth Is This Film Only Rated 6.9,9,21 March 2012,"At least when I write this review, this wonderful film is rated only a 6.9. Largely speaking I avoid most films that fall under the magic 7 out of 10 rating. However, there are hundreds of films on this site that, in my opinion, are far inferior to this gem. I am not a fan of romantic comedies in general, as the vast majority are so much shallow pond water - full of rather tasteless odds and ends and leaving a bad taste in the mouth. There are some exceptions, and this is one. Julia Roberts plays the part of the flawed but beautiful film star, and Hugh Grant plays his diffident best as the understated dry humored Englishman. But what makes this film great is the whole cast, from the effeminate book shop assistant, to William's quirky sister, Rhys Ifan's delightful gently crude and socially inept Welshman, Bernie the failed stock market trader (Played immaculately by the now famous Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville), I could go on!The genuine and realistic relationships that the group of friends has contrasts with the world of fame represented in a somewhat satirical fashion. This only serves to leave you feeling warm and fuzzy with the thought of ordinary well-meaning people who love and appreciate each other and stand together through life's vagaries. How anyone cannot be moved by the response of Anna (Julia Roberts) at the end smiling like 'a little girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her' and what's more to a stirring rendition of 'She' by Elvis Costello; Come on, there is enough cynicism in the world not to delight in this gem of a film that oozes happy endings and feel good lives! This is probably the 5th time I have watched it and I admit unashamedly to tears welling up at the end.Give it another viewing, you won't be disappointed",Notting Hill
459,rie-music,I love Notting Hill,10,27 November 2006,"I watched this movie when I was 14. There are three reason why I love it so much. First of all, The climax of this movie is moving. It is very romantic scene where He proposed to her in front of the journalist.He is very wonderful!! Secondly, Actor's character is very funny. Especially, Spike! He is an eccentric. But in reality he is kindly. He is a key person in this movie. And, Thacker (Hugh Grant). He is cool. But He is comic actor. Very cute! The third reason why I would like to introduce this cinema to you is its music. Very famous song.The title is ""She"". Singing by Elvis Costello. I do love this song. This music can be heard by a good scene. It is drew tears. And in other scenes, used oldies songs. I love Oldies very much.This movie still makes me impressed. And will never forget forever...",Notting Hill
460,frenchy-64339,Cute Film,8,17 September 2021,"From the beginning it is an enticing movie, a famous actress meeting an ordinary bookseller. Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant have excellent on-screen chemistry. Roberts is elegant and Grant has a nice charm. They both have a witty humor. Spike works as a great comedic relief character. Overall an excellent rom com and it has a nice setting in London.",Notting Hill
461,scubapro32,Top-shelve Crap,1,8 June 2002,"Everything stinks here! There's absolutely no chemistry between Hugh and Julia, in fact, Julias acting is awful.

This is a movie I would only watch once.",Notting Hill
463,GuidoNordini,I loved it,10,9 January 2005,"This movie me made me smile. That's about all I can say. Let's forget all of this Four Weddings and a Funeral crap because this movie was a better movie. Each individual storyline added something to the film. The almost seamless transitions from scene to scene make it quite easy to follow for a film with such a complex plot. I was unbelievably touched by the interaction between Liam Neeson and his stepson. The development of their relationship could have been a movie in itself. However, blended with the them ""Love actually is all around,"" their interaction strengthens this argument. I think some of the users have read too much into Hugh Grant being Hugh Grant because it fits what Curtis wants to do. he wanted Grant to be eccentric and odd around Natalie because although he was a powerful man he was uncomfortable in the dating setting. Knightly puts forth a stellar performance in her limited roll, and Rown Atkinson and Alan Rickman both are tremendous.this movie is a careful reminder that we are able to see love in our daily life as long as we look for it. In our troubled world, that idea has been lost. We are reminded to cherish friendship, act on love, and allow others to act on their love for us.SEE THIS MOVIE. BUY THIS MOVIE. LOVE THIS MOVIE. as I have and do",Notting Hill
464,kenr-6,wonderful update of a classical theme,10,21 November 2004,"A classical theme of fairy-tale romances has been commoner meets prince. Think Cinderella, for example. Well there aren't too many royals left around these days, and those that still have titles mostly fill ceremonial roles instead of wielding real power.There is a modern class of people that have taken their place in being well-known and out of the reach of the average joe. These are celebrities. Whether they be pop idols, models, or movie stars, the idea of a celebrity dating an average joe seems as unlikely as a prince dating a commoner must have seen in an earlier era.Hence this movie can first be seen as updated fairy tale. Add to that brilliant acting by Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, some great cinematography such as the scene where he walks down the street and through the seasons, and you have a delightful package.",Notting Hill

466,dzamaia-1,Sopyisticated Humor,8,29 August 2006,"lot's of humor and funny dialogs which are deep and not at all silly or stupid. You want to remember them and use them. I immediately understood that it was British made. The acting was great, only nothing can help Julia Roberts, she simply cannot act but the filmmakers did their best to make her look OK and they should be given credit for that.Probably they had two cameras shooting both people at the same time and the conversation did not look false (cut and paste). This was everywhere, I did not feel that each character was shot separately without anyone to speak to.The ending is borrowed from other movies, like Roman Holidays. But it is OK, because it is not always easy to make a good ending. I would like to see it again.",Notting Hill
467,somehappytoast,Undeniably brilliant,10,3 July 2018,"The setting, the characters, the writing. Absolutely everything in this movie is done to such a high standard, and is presented so fantasically, you simply feel as if you are in this world. Sitting in Notting hill, sipping tea with Hugh Grant. 
Who, by the way, is in his prime here and carries the movie with ease. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is about this movie that I love so much, but every single time I watch it, I find myself fully pulled in, completely unable to pull myself away. 
I love it, beyond rhyme or reason.Perhaps it is the characters, in how each and every one of them is so brilliantly memorable. You come to love each and every one of them, and just want them to succeed in their endevours. 
Or perhaps it is the writing, which grips you like the best book would, and never, ever lets up. All in all, this is one of my favourite things to watch. It's one of those simple things that just makes me happy. 
I like to say it is Britain represented at it's finest.",Notting Hill

I normally like her just fine, but she doesn't get much to work with in this one. She's either a complete boor or she's standing around staring at people in what is probably supposed to be a ""meaningful way"". But it doesn't work. She's supposed to be the romantic lead girl, and she's not particularly lovable or endearing, and it really stretches one's ability to suspend belief to buy the plot line. Poor Anna - she could have been worth loving, I'm sure. Eventually, I guess.There's a lot good about this movie, and it's worth a rent. The only really glaringly annoying thing was the soundtrack, which threw the mood of the entire movie, and seemed complete unassociated with anything going on it. Nothing wrong with it by itself, but simply not right in this movie.",Notting Hill
471,Thorp,"A cute, if somewhat standardized, love story.",8,5 July 1999,"The story is timeless: Boy meets girl and falls in love. They come from different parts of society, and this difference poses some serious problems that they must overcome if their romance is to be, for lack of a more romantic word, successful.I am somewhat tired of Hugh Grant with his stuttering and nervous/clumsy sense of humor, but in this movie he gives an amusing performance as William Thacker, an as-common-as-they-get bookstore keeper in Notting Hill in London. One day he has a very special customer: Anna Scott, the most famous actress in the world, played by Julia Roberts. She buys a few books and leaves. An overwhelmed William goes to buy a drink, which he manages to spill all over Anna when they collide in the street. To soothe the now enraged movie star, he invites her home to his apartment to wash and change her clothes.And the rest you will have to see for yourselves.This is a very standard love story, but it was very cute and quite touching. I don't know any actress that can look so close to tears like Julia Roberts, and Grant's verbal mistakes made the entire audience laugh. The comic side-kicks could easily fit in a Disney movie, and the movie had just the right combination of romance and humor. The dinner discussion about ""who is the greatest loser"" is one of the higher marks.I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",Notting Hill
472,AnnaScott,A romantic comedy that shouldn't be missed,10,10 July 2000,"I found Notting Hill one of the best romantic comedies.  The writing was phenomenal--humorous comments about the differences between England and the U.S. as well as clever remarks that many movies are lacking.  The movie kept my attention and also left me feeling as if it were real, something that I had lived with the actors.  Whether or not you like Julia Roberts or Hugh Grant, you should see this movie.  See it with an open mind and let yourself fall in love with Anna and William.  Not only is the movie one of the best, but the soundtrack is also unforgettable.

Julia and Hugh have some humorous moments that will make you laugh, but there are some very meaningful moments in this film as well.

Hugh is gorgeous but still only able to play 'Hugh Grant', Julie Roberts puts in a good solid performance, and the rest of the cast reads like a Who's Who of the best of British TV comedy acting.  Spike is a hoot too. It really is a case of spot the sitcom actor!  2 flaws - the voice-over at the beginning setting the scene (I suspect put in there for the American audience) but completely unnecessary.  And the ending - too over the top - again for the Americans who like their Ts crossed and Is dotted?  Funny, marvellous - it made me feel very happy!",Notting Hill
476,W.,Notting Hill was an enjoyable romantic comedy,10,16 May 1999,"Being a Julia Roberts fan I was destined to enjoy this movie but I found it to be a whole lot better than even I expected. For one thing it was absolutely hilarious. The humor in it reminded me a lot of Four Weddings and a Funeral, so if you liked that movie, you will probably enjoy Notting Hill. The movie is about a man (Hugh Grant) who owns a little travel bookstore in Notting Hill. He has a simple life until one day this major Hollywood star (Julia Roberts) pops into his store and through a series of events the two become friends. Julia's character enjoys being with the man because it brings her back to reality and he seems to be the only one that treats her like a real person, not just a film star. The two become romantically involved but as well all know ""the course of true love never did run smooth"" and the two find out it's not all that easy for them to be together.

It was refreshing to see a funny, upbeat movie for a change- one without violence, excessive profanity or graphic sex.  So all you teenagers will probably hate it, but anyone else had better rush to see it so that Hollywood gets the message that we go to the movies also, and we like to see something other than guns blasting and cars (or airplanes or whatever)blowing up.",Notting Hill
479,MadameW,A Must See for Hugh Grant fans only,7,2 June 1999,"Slow, plodding, with a wooden performance by Julia Roberts and an engaging one by Hugh Grant.  There are some nice moments, such as a tracking shot through time and the ending montage,  but in every romantic scene with Hugh, Julia looks as if she just smelled something strange - her flared nostrils do all the emoting. Usually Roberts is effusive and entertaining on screen, but this time she is anything but.It is Grant's best performance ever.  Very touching.  See it for him.",Notting Hill

I was pleasantly amazed at how funny this movie turned out to be.  I laughed from beginning to end, and even shed a tear once or twice.Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant have great on-screen chemistry.  They provide a great atmosphere for any audience and leave you with warm thoughts after the movie.  It's the perfect movie for taking a date, best friend or spouse to. You'll even enjoy it if you see it alone.",Notting Hill
481,Arse,Nice Is what nice does,8,23 May 1999,"It will not change your life, and with the amount of big laughs you will not have to change your pants, but still this is a nice film about nice people generally being nice to each other in a nice part of London. Whilst it's by no means a sequel to Four weddings it can probably only be compared to it. A formula has been found and it was obviously the intention to follow it to the letter, but don't write the film off on this alone. Some of the greatest films of our time follow a pre-determined formula and still manage to delight.I'd like to say something witty and obtuse about this film but sadly I'm just going to say what everyone will say...Spike makes the film and without him it would be barren and flat.",Notting Hill
482,dukeu,Rave review,10,7 June 1999,A total delight!  One of the most enjoyable films ever--on a par with Roman Holiday.  Every nuance is just perfect.  I am eager to see it again and again.  All the London locations rang very true.  The two leads couldn't be better and the supporting cast is truly outstanding.,Notting Hill
483,Ked-2,Comedy of the year? No!,1,31 May 1999,"I've always had a problem with 'Romantic Comedies'. What this term usually means is that there is no plot, no jokes and that you will leave the cinema feeling nauseous. If that didn't scare me away then the names at the top of the poster definitely should have, Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. But for some reason I saw it anyway, partly because of Rhys Ifans who was brilliant in Twin Town and secondly because it was free. My worst fears were confirmed, weak plot, predictable jokes and Hugh Grant playing his one character (bumbling, annoying, pathetic.)Rhys Ifans' character seemed to be tagged on as the comic relief (why does a 'comedy' need a comic relief?) and was underused. Julia Roberts was just dull and unconvincing. Also when will comedy writers learn that Middle Class people aren't interesting. They have responsible jobs, live in nice houses, drive 'reliable' cars, have dinner parties, go ski-ing, listen to Phil Collins & Celine Dion, drink wine and have children that are good at science. They are not good subjects for comedy. All the best sitcoms and films have been born out of squalor. Steptoe & Son, The Young Ones, Only Fools & Horses and even Father Ted are all based around the fact that the charcters haven't got two pound notes to rub together. Richard Curtis seems to have been seduced by the dark side of the comedy force, that of the affluent American sitcom. Where everyone is rich, clever and pretty and get into a series of ""hilarious mishaps and misunderstandings"". An air of pomposity can sometimes overcome the affluence problems sometimes (Basil Fawlty, Captain Mainwaring etc.) but Notting Hill doesn't have this either. All the characters seem apologetic for their own existence which just leads to more tedium. Overall a thoroughly over-rated and boring film. Little Voice was more touching and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrells was funnier. After watching this film I think you will be able to tell that it was Ben Elton who wrote the funny bits in Blackadder.",Notting Hill
484,mattc-5,Absolutely fan-f**king-tastic!!!,10,24 May 1999,"Saw a preview last night (23/5), and was blown away. Really funny, even more than 4 Weddings, and Hugh and Julia shine. Curtis gets better and better, and Roger Michell's direction was great - there's one incredible scene where Grant walks through Portobello Road Market as the seasons change around him (it starts with a shot of a heavily pregnant woman, and ends with the same woman cradling her baby). Sublime.",Notting Hill
485,flowers-2,A Highly Entertaining Film,10,30 May 1999,For years being a fan of both Roberts and Grant I had been anticipating this film for months.  After I saw the film I realized why. This movie was one of the best romantic comidies of the decade. This film will make you laugh and cry all at the same time.,Notting Hill
486,lc_rufy,A beautiful romance for anyone with an open heart,10,6 June 1999,"Notting Hill is a great movie blending a lot of comedy with my personal reason for living: love. This movie along with ""City of Angels"" has touched my heart and strengthened my hope. Listening to the song ""When you say nothing at all"" always makes my heart skip a beat just thinking about the scene it goes along with it (Anna and Will in the park). Not only is the plot, the actors, and the music all great, but the cinematography was superb. When Will walks downtown and the time passes around him, I was amazed. If you need a little inspiration in your life, want to ask that special someone to a date, or just have a free weekend, I urge you to take 2 hours out of your day to watch this movie.",Notting Hill
487,tammy-15,the best ever,10,31 May 1999,i thought the chemistry between hugh grant and julia roberts was unbelievable.  the movie was not only a great romance but also side-splittingly funny.  i have seen the movie twice and could see it 1000 more.  the romance between bella and max was just as enchanting. and to top it all off the music was great. i loved this movie more than any movie i have seen in a long,Notting Hill
488,Scully-31,An appalling film.,1,22 June 1999,"Whoever wrote the pitching line was right to say that 'Notting Hill' is 'Four Weddings and a Pretty woman', but he or she would have been more right to say that this film is a 'wanna-be Four Weddings and a Pretty Woman'. The script I thought  was appalling. It reminds me of those teenage fantasies I used to have about being a very famous actress and being admired by the man I secretly wanted to impress in real life. There's nothing wrong with these fantasies, but there's cleverer ways of exploring them. Dialogues were dreadful, the plot absurd, the acting appalling and the directing very poor. But what most worries me is the fact that people like it and that companies invest in it.  Sad indeed!!",Notting Hill
489,RichG-3,must see film!!,10,2 June 1999,"I saw this last night and what a film! O.k so it has its downside - like the ethnic cleansing of Notting Hill and its similarity to Four Weddings - but this is a really enjoyable night out.It's all about how we find Mr or Mrs Right. OK so some people say that it's an implausible plot but as Anna says in the film ""Its just a girl standing in front of a boy ands asking him to love her."" Richard Curtis socks it to us about the way we perceive movie stars as idols and not humans.Anyone who says that Julia Roberts can't act needs to see this film - she's great - but the real star is Rhys Ifans - I can see him reaping a number of awards for this performance.I grade my films by the number of times I glance at my watch and the average is two. This film got a zero!!!So great film - go and see it.",Notting Hill
490,Slp3,"Supurb film, funny and touching",10,26 July 1999,"This film will leave anyone leaving the cinema with a smile on there face, with a great cast and this film I hope, will show a lot of people that it dosen't take millions of pounds (or dollars) to make a truely great film.",Notting Hill
491,CMC-7,"Serene, but nice....",10,3 June 1999,"Notting Hill is a cute movie.  A wonderful romantic comedy.  Very, very sweet.  The flatmate is absolutely fabulous.  Great flick!",Notting Hill
492,rainbow-11,Fresh & lovely!,10,30 May 1999,"This movie was so delightful!  The acting was top rate and the plot, although predictable, was very entertaining.  The character of Spike added hilarity amidst the interchanging heartbreak and ecstasy of William.  I will be buying this one when it comes out on video!",Notting Hill
493,Will-94,"Cute and predictable, but there's plenty there",8,17 May 1999,"With the same producers, writers and star, much has been made of this as the 'new Four Weddings' - don't be fooled. The similarities are there - Hugh Grant, an American star, and lots of 'typically British' humour, but the focus is much more on the romance in this film. As usual with most romantic comedies, the outcome is predictable, but getting there is enjoyable, and there are plenty of neat directorial tricks to keep you interested. The scene conveying the passing of time as Grant walks through a market is a gem. The story is highly implausible, but at the same time believable enough, and this is much to do with the genuine chemistry between Grant and Julia Roberts. I hate to say it, but I did enjoy both of their performances. This film deserves to be, and probably will be, as big as Four Weddings.",Notting Hill
494,Bayliss,great fun,9,16 May 1999,"A highly entertaining romantic comedy.  Julia Roberts shines, Hugh Grant is his usual stammering self, and Rhys Ifans steals the show as Spike, Grant's ""daft prick"" of a flat mate.  Predictable, yet thoroughly enjoyable comedy.",Notting Hill
495,MAChary,"Largely innocuous, but entertaining in some ways",7,16 May 1999,"It seems lately that people expect every movie to either be an action fest or an Oscar winner. ""Notting Hill"" is neither. In a way it is ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" revisited. Hugh Grant's character has an agreeable group of friends including the kookie houseguest and the sibling. Andie MacDowell's character has been replaced by Julia Roberts's movie star. MacDowell is more beautiful than Julia Roberts, but Roberts is a better actress, though she really plays herself in this movie. Actually, I don't know Julia Roberts from Eve, so maybe she's playing a woman who just happens to be a world famous movie star as well. I gave it a 7 because it was entertaining and fun and above average in many respects and I expect other people to hover around 3 and 4 so I wanted to throw up the average. The honest ranking is probably 6.Oh, despite three years between pictures, Hugh Grant turns in a strong performance as a slightly disaffected, normal Englishman whose life is turned upside down because he happened to fall in love with the most famous woman in the world.",Notting Hill
496,alf-29,A common fantasy comes to life,10,31 May 1999,"Haven't we all had that one fantasy where we fall in love with someone famous?  A fantasy such as this is one of the delightful treasures Notting hill gives us, a chance to live a true romantic fantasy of fame and fortune. Julia Robert's is ""fabulous,"" her giant smile shines bright with charisma throughout the film.  Hugh Grant gives a performance you fall in love with--sweet and charming.  Notting Hill gives you that clique quality you wish to find in a steaming Romance novel that many love stories lack.",Notting Hill
497,JennR,A great romantic movie.,10,30 May 1999,"I believe Notting Hill is a very good movie, and I think everyone should see it if they have the chance. It is so hilarious, especially with William's room mate and William's sister. The movie is about half US English, and about half UK English, so it is kind of hard for Americans to understand UK English, and vice versa, but anyways, it is a great movie.",Notting Hill
498,Rose-67,Outstanding,10,29 May 1999,This is the best movie I have seen in a long time.  Not since The Nutty Professor have I laughed so much.  There was even a moment that was heartbreaking enough to make me cry.  Much better than Four Weddings and a Funeral.  I work for a UK company and recognized some of the same characteristics that I see daily at work.  The entire audience applauded at the end.  This is definitely one that I would buy.,Notting Hill
499,katie-50,Best Movie you will ever see! Roberts and Grant are pure magic on screen together!,10,29 May 1999,"I just got back from seeing ""Notting Hill"" and I have to say it is the best romance-comedy I have ever seen!  Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant are pure magic together on the big screen.  I would see EVERY movie of them together if they made 1 for each year for the next 50 years!  Julia Roberts is THE perfect person to play Anna Scott! NOBODY could've done a better job than her, or even CLOSE to the magnificent acting Julia did in this film. Hugh Grant was truly wonderful playing William Thacker!  He was so genuine. There are no better two people to play those roles than Roberts and Grant! I can't stop thinking about how great the movie was!  It's trully one of the greatest movies you will EVER see!  If you haven't seen it, go see it and if you've already seen it, go see it again like I'm going to!",Notting Hill
500,Kim-90,Great movie. See it. You won't be sorry.,9,29 May 1999,"Great movie!  Wouldn't mind seeing it again.  Both Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant were wonderful.  I agree with a previous poster about the line about the girl and a boy, just asking him to love her.  Definitely brought tears to my eyes.  It's a very heartwarming movie.",Notting Hill
501,garygary-2,This was a great film!!!,10,29 May 1999,"I've always been mediocre on Julia even though she's done some great films. This was by far her best!Hugh always plays someone a little bit spacey although he managed to do it even better than ever!If this movie interests you even a little, I guarantee you'll love it!",Notting Hill
502,lls-3,"For once, I actually like a romantic comedy!",8,30 May 1999,"Excellent acting, good characters, a good romantic comedy. No slapstick and no sappiness, well maybe a little at the end but not too much. It also has a message about the Media, but check the movie out for yourself. Hugh Grant, Julie Roberts and the rest of the cast are all good.",Notting Hill
503,sweets-5,One of the best of 1999,10,30 May 1999,"This was definitely one of the best roles Julia Roberts has played in since Pretty Women. Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant are one of the best on screen matches I have ever seen. It was worth my money and I may even go back a second time. This however was not the mushy drama I was first expecting. There are some  very, very funny parts in this film mostly involving Hugh's disgusting and crude roommate Spike. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time and I highly recommend it to just about anyone.",Notting Hill
504,DM101,Great movie for everyone!!,10,10 June 1999,"I think this movie was done exceptionally well. It is a love story that is funny, sad and keeps you interested all the time.  The movie could have done with out some of the language, but otherwise this movie is great for all ages and types of people.  Julia Roberts was as expected, a good job--not an oscar, and Hugh Grant did better than in his recent films.  I highly recommend this movie!",Notting Hill
505,jp-71,"Made Me ""Feel Good""",9,5 June 1999,"A good Film which is one of the best romantic and funny I have seen for a while. It was well paced, and did not flag at any point. I am not a big fan of Miss Roberts but have been converted by this film. - Go Laugh,Cry and have a good night out.",Notting Hill
506,groovie,Surreal,10,8 June 1999,"Movies are supposed to make you feel good and this one does.  Who cares that the improbability of the story is about 1000% - you walk through that park, walk through the seasons, walk through the family and one just smiles at the enchantment of the whole thing.  You can have Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, the Philadelphia Story ad nauseum - all those realistic movies that people think are so wonderful and make you feel so bad.  Notting Hill puts a smile on your face and that's what movies are supposed to do. Perhaps the most truthful moment in the film is when his mother calls at the most important moment in his life and will not take no for an answer. There was a true situation and a tribute to the millions of self centered mothers in the world.  I really liked this movie.",Notting Hill
507,Moocho,Best film I've seen in a long time,10,11 June 1999,"I've seen this movie 6 times since its been out in the theatre, and well what can I say, I loved it very much. I can't really say what I really liked, but just that the movie is absolutely excellent. I'm all for comedy, and it was a very different type of romance, a type that does not limit it to a typical ""chick flick""",Notting Hill
508,Hanpal,"The ultimate feel-good movie, with that X factor there all the way!",10,9 June 1999,"Any movie that can make you walk out of the cinema with a megawatt smile on your face to rival Julia Roberts' has to be worth seeing. This one has it all - the story line is fascinating and easy to identify with - who hasn't wondered what would happen if a celebrity waltzed into their life? I know I have. The leads are absolutely brilliant - my faith in Hugh Grant has been restored a thousand times over -  (my faith in Julia Roberts hadn't wavered since her best career move ever, My Best Friend's Wedding. If you haven't seen it, see it.) The special thing (just one of many) about Notting Hill is that there are no weak links in the acting. With the ensemble cast it is, hmmm, a case of ""which superlative should I use?"" Gina Mckee, especially is a stand out as William's (Grant's) wheelchair bound, quietly serene friend. She adds a great deal to the already super-strong line-up. The humour had us in absolute stitches (you know, that feeling you get when you just CAN'T stop laughing and you're choking!) (especially my father!) But aside from everything else, there's something, another component to this film that I just can't put my finger on. It's the thing that will have me going back to see it again, and maybe again.....and have me recommending it to everyone I see. It's the thing that has you coming home from the film happy,  going to bed happy, and still thinking about it in the morning - and you're still happy. When it comes down to it, it may only be pure, light entertainment, but isn't that what it's meant to be? Any film that can make me feel that good gets my vote. Eleven out of ten.",Notting Hill
509,Gary-124,Great first date film..,10,14 June 1999,"This film was great. Spike was awesome. The dialogue was well thought out and with excellent timing. I was never bored and wished it had gone a bit longer. I have never seen so many visual and oral jokes in a romantic comedy. My stomach never churned as there were no corny predicable jokes that typically make up American romantic comedies. This movie was an order of magnitude better than ""You have mail"".",Notting Hill
510,Person-6,Brilliant!,10,29 June 1999,It was the funniest movie that I have seen in a long time. Everyone was constantly laughing at the humour. The British reserve and their amazing ability to understate the obvious was excellently caught on screen. Julia Roberts lit up the screen with her smile and made everyone feel so much better.,Notting Hill
511,marycala,"What's wrong with ""Happily-ever-after""?",10,10 July 1999,"Ok, so it's not a shootem-up bang,action adventure; and yes maybe it's a little unrealistic. what's wrong with a little happily ever after???  in this day and age of uni-bombers and serial killers; we need a little bit of happily-ever-after, from time to time. Notting Hill has filled the bill.  this movie is truly delightful. If you have become a bit of a bah-humbug person, this movie will surely restore your faith in mankind, at least for a little while. Personally, I left the theater feeling good. The script was well written, and character development quick, and interesting; as was the cinematography. Julia was radiant, as always; Hugh was charmingly humble, delivering every line with his usual perfect timing; the supporting cast was well chosen, each one adding their own special little touch to the film, especially Rhys Ifam, ""Spike"", who somehow managed to steal every scene he was in. My thanks and appreciation to the cast, the crew, and the powers that be, who made this film possible. If you haven't already seen this movie, I highly recommend that you do. I have seen it more than once, and each time it gets better. I'm ready to move to Notting Hill, and hopefully bump into William Thacker.",Notting Hill
512,Leeloo-20,Loved it!!!,9,10 July 1999,"I've just seen ""Notting Hill"" at the cinema. When I first heard of this film, I thought ""Nothing special"". But now I've changed my opinion. It was a really great film. Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant were wonderful and made you feel with them. But I especially enjoyed the people who played William's family. I laughed a lot - there are many funny scenes in the film. Perhaps I'll go and see it again - I gave the film a vote of 9. See it and love it!!!",Notting Hill
513,R2D2-12,I have already seen it three times and I'm still not bored.,10,15 July 1999,"Normally if I see a good movie in the cinema I will buy or rent it, when it becomes available on video.  Not with Notting Hill.  After the first time I watched it in the cinema, I did not have the patience to wait for the video. The impression Notting Hill made on me was so powerful, that I had to see it again.Now it is two weeks later I have already seen Notting Hill three times. I am still not bored by it. Every time I watched it, I discovered new elements and things in the movie. The realistic atmosphere director Roger Mitchell has created in the movie impresses me very much. You really get the idea that you are in a neighbourhood of London where everybody knows everybody. The story itself is maybe a bit simplistic, but realistic. A normal man, a London shopkeeper falls in love with famous film star. The problems that a created by such a relationship. You can really get into the story and see it happen in reality.Julia Roberts plays one of here best roles ever. She puts down an Anna Scott that on one hand has a charming and friendly character that always stays friendly against her fans. On the other hand, Anna Scott is also short-tempered when things go wrong. She acts on impulse and regrets her actions afterwards. But still you have to love Anna Scott an ordinary persons who happens to be a film star and has to live with all the fame its positive sides both also the less amusing parts of it. I had not seen any other parts of Hugh Grant, but his excellent acting impressed me. He created an ordinary English gentleman, who happens to fall in love with an American film star and does not know how to handle it exactly. Above all, he stays a gentleman. You could really imagine being him and you feel pity for him, when another problem arises. The combination Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant is one of the best actor-actress combinations I have ever seen. You get the feeling that it really works and the put down a superb performance. The rest of the cast (William Thackers friends and family) give the movie that extra ingredient to create an atmosphere in which such a story can unfold.In the cinema, many other people and I where disappointed when the film ended.  We wanted to see more and did not realise that it was already two hours later. You get so involved in the movie that it seems that time stops. You become curios about how goes it further. You want more.I have seen Titanic, but I found it nice but noting special. Notting Hill is one of the best (maybe even the best) romantic movies I have ever seen. The combination of story, actor, actress, supporting cast, etc. give it something Titanic lacked. I think its combination of all.I can advise you to see Notting Hill. It is on the top of my personal list of good movies.  Sit back and enjoy it.",Notting Hill
514,spirit-18,Yawn!,5,9 July 1999,"I really don't understand all the fuss about this movie. Okay, I really don't like Hugh Grant, 'cause he always acts the same way in every movie he's in: the dopey guy, big deal! About the movie itself: terrible slow, loose ends, highly predictable and utterly boring, that about sums it up.If you liked ""Pretty Woman"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", you're about to like this movie as well.",Notting Hill
515,Crawl890,Well done!,9,25 July 1999,"While I was watching the movie I had that question in my head: ""can a movie make you feel like you are not in a movie?"". Sounds like a pretty abstract question, doesn't it? But, at least for me, the answer is yes. Besides some lengthy ""warming-up"" scenes and the ""a little bit to happy ending"" (the last seconds before the final fade out) the movie was fascinating. Especially the funny and realistic acting of the two main characters (Anna Scott, Julia Roberts and William Thacker, Hugh Grant) who played their parts, the one of a prominent actress who is besides the business life ""just a girl which stands there in front of someone to ask him to love her"" and the one of a not at all known bookshop owner with a crazy fellow occupant and a bunch of ordinary friends very convincing. The viewer doesn't realize at any time that the whole thing is in fact just acted.My overall rating is ""very good"".",Notting Hill
516,03872,Julia Roberts,9,20 August 1999,"Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl but anyhow a wonderful screenplay. Julia Roberts' ever best performance.Perhaps the neighborhood of Notting Hill could be more displayed to better outline the character played by Hugh Grant.The actor who plays ""Spike"" is absolutely superb.",Notting Hill
517,turtle-42,splendid little diddy,10,14 September 1999,"I thought it was very fun and entertaining.....but then again I'm a sucker for romantic comedies.  I thought Julia Roberts was terrific and Hugh Grant fit his part well.....hell, the whole cast was great.  Basically, I was very tickled by this film.",Notting Hill
518,Legato-2,Great Romantic Comedy,9,3 October 1999,"Just a great movie, the kind of movie that makes you all warm inside. Nothing more needs to be said just go and see it for yourself... Perfect to bring girlfriend. It is a girls movie, but you (if you is a guy =) ) will love it too.",Notting Hill
519,stubrown,You have to be an expatriate British person to love this film.,9,24 November 1999,"After three years living in Prague, I returned to UK to see this film with my children. Never before has a film succeeded in making me feel both HOMESICK and PROUD TO BE BRITISH! The real hero of the film is SPIKE - who else gets away with being so maddeningly Welsh and ordinary, while seeming a hero? High point: his visit to bathroom, while bath inhabited by Julia Roberts.",Notting Hill
520,marije,On of the best in this kind.,8,27 November 1999,"This is what you call a 'feel good movie'. Because it sure made me feel good. Personally I like a good drama better, but I have seen a lot of romantic comedies. And looking at Notting Hill from this perspective I must say: it is one of the best in this genre.Julia Roberts, queen of romantic comedies is great as ever, and Hugh Grant plays his part like always, but it is still adorable. And the British humor in this one, makes it a little better than the rest of the romantic comedies.  It is a great story, one which we all dream about sometime in our life: meeting a celebrity and falling in love..... even when we are 'just' a salesman or woman in a bookstore.",Notting Hill
521,XPhile-Conspirator,Julia and Hugh = great chemistry and this movie Kicks A$$,10,27 December 1999,"Hello Hello I am here finally and I can now give you my commentary on this FABULOUS flick!!!!!!!!! Now Julia Roberts + Hugh Grant = REALLY GOOD STUFF. Absolutely the best couple on the movie screen since...well probably Titanic. These two make the best couple and I luv them both. Both have fantastic features, qualities, personalities, and they both can act! Finally, a pair of ppl who REALLY REALLY communicate well and have awesome chemistry. The movie was OUTSTANDING. If you are looking for a magnificiant movie with comedy, romance, and intensity(sort of) well this is yur movie. Im telling you it rocks. It is unbelievable I mean like, just the thought of this actually happening to me is just wild. I'd die. I luv Julia Roberts and she is definitely the most popular actress in the biz and the highest paid I bet. Her last about 25 movies have all been great. And along with her is the gorgeous, sensitive Hugh. He's an english hunk. I swear I've never seen ne1 quite as sexy as him. Really. Like sure you have yur Brad Pitts and Jennifer love Hewitts, but they are all the same. Here you have a nice good  looking sensible man (excusing the prostitute incident)who isn't the most popular or the best looking man, but he actually is if u look close enough. Now not only do we have two awesome and fabulous main stars, but the co-stars in this movie really make it great. i mean they are the perfect ppl for each role in the movie and if it were anyone else playing the role of one of the characters besides the person now, the film would probably suck. But hey, IT DOESNT!!!!!!!!!! So as I said before, if u r looking for a great movie, this is it. It will totally make you cry at the one seen and when you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about.",Notting Hill
522,stjohnson,Spike Was Excellent!,10,2 January 2000,The entire movie was engaging. The characters were all well developed and interesting and the various plot-lines drew in the audience. One stand-out performance was noted by Spike. What a hilarious character -- just couldn't wait till he appeared again as the movie progressed.,Notting Hill
523,holst-3,best romantic comedy in years,9,5 January 2000,"This is the best romantic comedy in years. It is not as funny as ""Four weddings and a funeral"", but it is better anyway. Julia Roberts is better than ever. Hugh Grant is Hugh Grant, nothing is new there. The supporting actors are not as interesting as in ""Four Weddings..."" except for ""Spike"" who is rather funny. Still the scenes with Julia and Hugh are great, so see this one.",Notting Hill
524,andreas-66,"Even better than ""Four Weddings and a Funeral""!!!",10,22 January 2000,"Take ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and triple it and you´ve got ""Notting Hill"". It´s the best film I´ve seen in this film category and it made my heart jump with love & joy. This is a really great movie and I will certainly recommend it to all my friends.Cheers,Andreas",Notting Hill
525,bisera,Believe it. Feel it.,10,27 January 2000,"I haven`t seen such a movie in a years (hey, I`m not that old, but still). Julia and Hugh have managed to catch the magic of .. I don`t know..of the thing we should someday experience. You know, I saw this film after it had been translated into my native language (Macedonian) and the title it had been given was ""I Believe In Love"". Maybe that was the smarter solution. This movie is about the profound belief in love each of us has it. I was almost persuaded that the noun LOVE was too..abstract and rare when all of a sudden this film appeared. And you know what? I finally started believing that it may be true, that love actually exists. That we are just a tiny part of the world Anna Scott and William Thacker created. And, don`t forget: ""I`m just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.""Start believing.",Notting Hill
526,dolchang,Very fresh love story and impressive scene treatment,9,8 March 2000,"It is amazing to make a movie interesting with very common plot. What is interesting is that the number of starring actors is small. I got to know why Julia Roberts is a extant big star.  I also like Hugh Grant. His romantic mood is suitable for this movie. His good looking face with Rambo style eyebrows and his smile from his eyes couldn't be better for the character of this movie. In fact, this movie was not as popular in Korea as in Europe.I love the fresh mood and organised plot. Modern love story is not focusing on motive of love, boring love scene. It flows fast. The customer's presence and his friend's dullness bring out natural laughs from viewers.I like to give a priority to ""fresh mood""for this movie. The talent of director, rather than writer is conspicuous.",Notting Hill
527,davesnouffer,"An enchanting, lovely, and humorously lively viewing experience.",10,4 March 2000,"Visually lovely, ""Notting Hill"" becomes an enchanting fairy tale.....a magical and endearing love story, from the opening credits to an afternoon of quiet sharing in a London park.  Being a romantic at heart, I was emotionally drawn to this well produced and entertaining motion picture, enticing me to view it a number of times more.Some friends have indicated that the ""plot"" is boring and in 2 hours and 4 minutes takes too long to come to an expected conclusion.  But the lyrical chemistry between William Thacker (Hugh Grant) and Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) give intimate glimpses into the human heart and spirit. As in Mary Poppins when Burt jumps into the chalk sidewalk drawing, I longed to join this tapestry of two people falling in love, among caring friends and relatives.  To longingly look into Anna's eyes and to see a reflection of your very own soul of hope and humanity may seem less than exciting to some people.....too involved in their fast paced, action world and who fail to see the beauty of life around them....to smell the roses.Watching the inflections of Julia Robert's face became a mesmerizing cinema experience.  And Hugh Grant's thoughtful and honest, yet quirky presence gave hope to what could be possible. Then wrap all this with a humorous, loving and insightful group of friends and family......WOW!After watching ""Notting Hill"" with my wife and giving her a big hug, I saw that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, wanting to be loved!What greater joy of meaning can be given by a film?""Teach me the Magic of Wonder, Give me the Spirit to Fly"" - John Denver",Notting Hill
528,aristide4,A film that reflects Hollywood's need of auto-celebration,5,21 April 2001,"I've just seen this film, and maybe it is too early to write something about it but it impressed me.In this film once again Hollywood dreams about itself: maybe, actors need to escape from their golden life, so these films come up, but they are surely unbelievable.I can't imagine the poor film star who needs a ""normal"" friend ( or maybe lover ). I do not like the choice of H.Grant, since I cannot imagine him being the normal person. I would have preferred the choice of a less-known actor, it would have been more believable, but, Hollywood has its rules, and, as usually, real life stays away from there! The famous,rich,beautiful actress cannot fall in love with a ugly, or at least not handsome man: she needs a normal, every-day prince!So that, I think that once again they've made up a newer version of ""The Prince and the poor"", of course a bit changed, just to prevent people from remembering it.Definitely, 5 is more than enough for a stupid, romantic film.",Notting Hill
529,hanna__lee,It made you feel happy.,10,22 June 2000,"I saw this movie three times and I paid $8.75 all three times. I loved that English accent! It sounds so funny but it is so beautiful.The pairing of Hugh and Julia was impeccable. Hugh's floppy charisma and Julia's bold charisma make a great charismatic couple!Notting Hill is a fairy tale like movie that brings out our childish imps. The hidden love Julia Roberts has for Hugh Grant and the way Hugh Grant gives his whole self with no masks or guard is poignant. And the hurt Hugh feels is the same type of hurt we've all once experienced: the one where we have no shell just bare heart, and a hurt causes us to create a shell. That and the overall wit and support of all of Hugh's family makes you feel happy. And that one line, that one line that is so famous but sounds so corny alone, comes alive when heard in context. ""I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her."" And the event that happens after that!! Everyone should see Notting Hill because life should turn out as ideal as the life seen in Notting Hill and movies are about escaping the real world into an ideal life where these happenings are also your happenings.",Notting Hill
530,MOVIEimBUFF,Great Romantic Comedy,9,6 November 2003,"In my opinion, I think that Notting Hill is one of the better romantic comedies to come out in some time.  Going into this movie I thought that it would fly under the radar and soon be forgotten, but I find myself adding this movie to my list of favorites.  The performances of Roberts and Grant are great, and they have a good chemistry on camera that shows and adds to the movie.  But they aren't what makes this movie great.  As good as those two are, I feel like the supporting cast, score, and direction is the icing on the cake.  The supporting cast is hilarious, the music is hip and uplifting, and the uniquely shot scenes (for example to pass time showing him walking through the seasons) are great.  Many would say Spike steals the show, but I feel the other members of Will's life are equally important to the story and makeup of the whole film.  A great date movie, but not to bad to just watch when you want to laugh, and feel good about the world.",Notting Hill
531,bernknow,Can a film star fall for Mr. Average?,10,5 September 2001,"I found Notting Hill to be a wonderful feel-good movie and the first time I saw it, it jumped straight into my personal top ten list.  Can a major film star really bump into Mr. Average  (Well, Mr. Handsome and charming average) and fall in love with him?  I`d like to think so (personally, I`m waiting for Liz Hurley to get tired of the shallow multi-millionaires she usually dates and ask me out - but thats another story)  Hugh Grant plays the owner of a small book shop who one day looks up to see one of the worlds top film stars browsing through his books. He is basically playing the same role he so often does - that of the witty but diffident Englishman - but he does do it well. Julia Roberts is often described as one of the worlds most beautiful women but I have never seen that in her, pretty yes, but not beautiful.  However, I have now changed my mind, for there is a scene in this film where her face lights up with a smile that I do consider truly beautiful. Watch this film and I can guarantee that you to will smile too.",Notting Hill
532,shirley-91,Deja vu (big spoilers here),3,9 June 2008,"If nothing else, movie goers are going to appreciate how the producers of 'Notting Hill' have come up with blotting paper that makes money. Humble Brit bookstore owner Hugh Grant meets big American movie star Julia Roberts. They cute meet, they get together, they break up, they get together, they break up, they get together. Lots of loud music. This is a film almost breathtaking in it's lack of any new take on anything.For example; in this movie you will run across: 1. Hugh Grant 'struggling' as bookstore/house owner in boho-posh Notting Hill. His assistant is wonky and lovable, and so are all his customers, his sister and his improbable friends. He is surrounded by eccentrics. Oh yes, he also has a wonky, lovable roommate. This roommate who isn't near as WL as Bill Nighy in Love Actually.2. He invites out said movie star and then giggle tee hee he sort of forgot that his sister's birthday was being celebrated. Movie star doesn't mind slumming, so you get to see her admire how he glows in the admiration of his WL friends. If you haven't seen Bridget Jones for a while, you might appreciate this.3. There is a hectic chase across town to last-minute get the girl with lots of doing things that would get you killed in real life. Oh, by the way, all Pretty Woman fans will appreciate the crusty, posh hotel clerk with the heart of gold.These are only some of the low points in this terrible film. Hugh and Julia sleepwalk through their parts, and even the wonky and lovable supporting cast isn't entirely wonky and lovable.In short, there is absolutely nothing in this film that hasn't been done or said before. Actually, I've seen quite a few films that fit that bill, but non of them are as charmless and unbelievable is this one. I am getting really tired of seeing films that cost millions to make and yet have really primitive scripts. They're too scared to show us anything we haven't seen and loved before and you know, maybe that's OK for a lot of us.",Notting Hill
533,damandaj,Poorly done; No chemistry,2,22 March 2001,"I was rather disappointed in the fact that two well-known and well liked actors could not produce any chemistry on the screen.  The dialog was less than childish and the musical score was heart-breaking.  The only bearable character in the movie was Grant's playfully annoying flat mate.  This movie had promise, but a very poor script.",Notting Hill
534,Sternchen999,This movie underwhelms,1,7 February 2007,"After I had heard good comments about this movie I decided to watch it together with my family. But afterward we thought this movie is really boring. The beginning was not bad but the story did not really work. Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant did their very best but I believe that they were miscast as a couple in love. They were unable to get into the plot. The movie is much too long, especially the last thirty minutes extends the movie in an unnecessary way. While watching the movie we hoped it would work up to a climax but we were disappointed. Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant have both starred in other romantic movies with a much stronger story. Altogether I cannot recommend this movie.",Notting Hill
535,katiesteeddesign,Awful Movie,1,14 September 2020,"I did not like this movie at all. Julia Roberts' character was extremely unlikeable and manipulative, I could not see any reason why Hugh Grant fell in love with her besides her beauty. I was glad when he told her no after her famous ""just a girl"" speech as she had treated him so badly, then facepalmed when he thought he had made a ""mistake"" and went after her. This movie is also extremely long; my husband and I kept hoping it was almost over, then being disappointed when we saw we still had an hour left. I want to run over the DVD with my car to save anyone else from having to watch it.",Notting Hill

538,alejandromadridconesa,The best romantic movie,10,10 February 2021,"The love story between Anna and William still feels bizarrely like something that might actually happen, particularly the farcical scenes at the press junket at the Ritz, where the hapless William has to pretend to be a magazine journalist for Horse & Hound, to provide cover for his being alone with her in a hotel suite.",Notting Hill
539,panupattansui,Personal review,10,3 March 2021,"Notting hill was the one of classic warm-hearted comedy movies. Hugh Grant performed as a William Thacker who is an ordinary person and had to deal with the problems when having a relationship with a famous actress like Anna Scott. The lies, social position, paparazzi, and news are the obstacle that William had to go through to get Anna Scott's love. This impossible love could be covey through each event that happens in the storyline.
After watching this movie for the first time, Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts express their character perfectly and create a lovely moment while watching. The outfit of both characters was amazing and convey their identity. If you have traveled to England before, you will enjoy the mood and tone of the movie due to the movie was filmed in England.
The plot of the movie is easy to understand and not too complex for the audience. Each event was run in the linear as a collective fragment of an impossible love to suggest the key concept of the movie realistically. The dialog wasn't boring and insert some joke to make the movie not too cheesy. The screenwriting of this movie completely did a great job because it sums up the whole story when William said to Anna "" I live in Notting Hill. You live in Beverly Hills"". At this point, it was touch and effective.
The best part of this movie is the soundtrack like When You Say Notting At All or Ain't No sunshine. Both songs are recognizable and easy to listen to. Moreover, The soundtrack was chosen to synchronize with the mood of each scene perfectly.
Overall, I like the movie and I prefer you to add this movie to your watching list. Notting Hill is worth watching and spending your free time on it. I rate this movie 10/10.",Notting Hill
540,brookekeys,Underrated,10,20 March 2021,"This is one of the most underrated movies of all time. If you're ever in a bad mood, or need a good ""dreams come true"" moment, Notting Hill is full of hilarious characters and those kind of awkward moments that have you feeling like you're right there with them.",Notting Hill

542,annieramirez79,Goof?,10,6 January 2007,"I have watched this movie several times as I just really, really like it. Perhaps it's just the whole rooting for the most ordinary person that has a once in a lifetime encounter with one of the world's biggest movie stars and actually getting the chance with her. There perhaps a goof that I've noticed and that was the part having to do with William Thacker's nick name in the movie. At the part where they were celebrating his little sister's birthday at Max's and Bella's home, it was said his nick name was Floppy. Then when he and Anna Scott snuck into the corner garden she said ""Come on Flopsy."" So what was it? Floppy or Flopsy?",Notting Hill
543,Piumie,Feel Good Inc.,10,8 January 2007,"I rate it as one of my all-time favourite romantic comedic movies. Hugh Grant & Julia Roberts are absolutely fantastic in their performances. Grant pulls off his character with just the right dash of conservatism, hopefulness, warmth and yes, even practicality, making his character very relatable and not at all unrealistic. Even though a female, throughout the film I kept putting myself in his shoes and imagining what it must be like to be him in those awkward situations.However at the same time, I kept putting myself in Roberts' character Anna and each time she laughed I laughed and each time she cried and felt hurt and lonely I felt hurt and lonely...At Honey's b'day dinner party, Scott has a go at winning the last brownie and surprisingly - I think even for her - she sees into the very deepest recesses of her own mind and sees what is most sorry about her life. She highlights the downside of being a famous actress who is at the peak of her career. Even the ugly head of eating disorders is lightly touched on when she innocently comments how she has been on a diet for the past decade.They each one defeats their personal obstacles they have themselves created about going ahead with a relationship with the other essentially ""live happily ever after""...Cliché, but we all need to have movies like these that are essentially Feel Good Inc., which give all of us simpletons a faint hope about our own lives....",Notting Hill
544,rohitspandey,Excellent Movie,9,5 March 2007,"It's very simple and sweet love story. Its perfect blend of romance,comedy and drama. Its same story boy meets girl & girl meets boy and they fall in love but the distinguishing fact is the way they express there love rather the way they say the magic words ""I L U"". Anna {Julia} ..I M JUST A GIRL STANDING IN FRONT OF A BOY ASKING HIM TO LOVE HER......Thacker {Hugh G.} ... I just wondered if Mr. Thacker realized he'd been a daft prick and got down on his knees and begged you to reconsider, whether you would reconsider...Julia and Hugh were stunning in the movie. Sound tracks are also very good. Flavor of comedy in the movie makes it more enjoyable. The movie should find a place in the list of all time best Romantic movies.",Notting Hill
545,fraserkatie,Beautiful film!,10,11 April 2021,One of my favourite films just a lovely film to watch even if youve seen it many times it captures the romance between an ordinary bookshop owner merting a celebrity for the first time. I love how the film is set and it has many heartbreaking yet emotional bits in it and some laughable bits in it. Coindentally my sisters friends appear as extras in the film you can see quite clearly a group of people standing around in a circle when William reaches the end of the snow and thats my sisters friends who were asked to appear in the film.,Notting Hill
546,secondaparte,I knew I was going to regret it,1,26 April 2007,"I watched it just because I need to improve my English, or my English from the UK because I have a test coming and movies and TV series are mainly from the USA, so that's why I chose this movie, we all deserve a chance and anyway I thought it could be at least a bit entertaining and even though I knew I wasn't going to love it because I don't like these kind of movies I thought: ""Alright, let's do it for the test, this might be less boring than the text books or watching the news""...But no,very boring, I didn't expect it to be that boring, I got very surprised when I realized I spent 2 hours watching that, it was too much and I don't really understand why some liked it, it had nothing new, so predictable...I think it was a waste of time.",Notting Hill
547,steven-broomfield,The best British film ever!,10,2 May 2007,"OK - I will keep this brief - this is my favourite film of all time. People laugh at me when I tell them as it's a ""chick flick"" but it is a perfect balance of comedy and romance, with Hugh Grant playing himself to a T! There are so many quotable lines from the film, from the ""Whoopsiedaisies"" to the ""I used to know a girl called Pandora - never got to see her box mind"". But there are also classic visual jokes, from the wearing of the prescription goggles in the cinema to the ""You are the most beautiful girl in the world"" T-Shirt with ""Fancy a ****"" on the back.Anyway, I love it. But then again I also think Love Actually is brilliant too - maybe I'm getting paid by Richard Curtis - actually, I'm not, but if you're reading this Richard my account number is .......",Notting Hill

You may expect the end but the course is up and down and makes you concentrate on it. It's true that it's a typical Hollywood movie but with good quality. The music, the pictures and the story create a sweet feeling.  I bet you won't get the same feelings from other movies.",Notting Hill
549,dweepydreamsinc,A great film with a great cast,10,21 November 2002,"This movie is all about love from a comical point of view. Making jokes about the different situations made this movie stole my heart. A great performance by the cast, especially Julia Roberts, gives the viewer a great feeling.How well movies have to be plotted and how well they have to be made, doesn't mean that a movie with a script of a less quality can have a very good result. Although this movie has it's flaws, it still stands firmly between all the other love stories that have been made. The chemistry between Ms. Roberts and Mr. Grant is, in my opinion, very real. And watching the scene where Ms. Scott pledges her love for Thacker in the book shop certainly does something to me.A strait ""A""",Notting Hill
550,chr-8,A must see movie!!!,10,21 May 2002,"Notting Hill is easily the best romantic comedy in years. It is unusual for a romantic comedy to be so smartly done. Yes, it is a fairy tale, but the performances of stars Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant are outstanding. They have great chemistry together and make you believe this romance is possible, against all odds. Roberts does an excellent job of showing how lonely life at the top can be, and Grant is charming as the shy but likeable ''ordinary man.'' This is also a very funny movie! It uses a combination of American and British humor, with great results. I found myself laughing out loud at least five times during the film. The supporting cast of British actors are superb. They compliment Roberts and Grant and really enhance Notting Hill. Especially good is the role of Grant's roommate. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie! It is a sweet and quite touching love story.",Notting Hill
551,jwftd158,Very Attractive Movie!!,9,17 June 2008,"This movie is natural and romantic love story set in Nottinghill, the city of London.Anna Scott played by Julia Roberts is a very promising actress. And the person loving with her is William Thacker, a bookseller, played by Hugh Grant. They are both attracted to each other, but the suffering of different position each other grip them. The day she has to leave UK, Anna makes a declaration of love to William as a last chance. He declines her offer there, but after talking about it to his friendsThe acting is very nice!! Especially Hugh Grant performs the part of an honest bookseller owner perfectly, I think. And a heart-warming movie helps viewers open our mind. The plot is not so good, because the scene of a casual meeting of two is incidental. I do not be touched at that scene.",Notting Hill
552,skerai,surprisingly bad,2,27 August 2009,"I was actually surprised by how bad this film was. First and foremost there is absolutely no chemistry between Grant and Roberts whatsoever. If there had been it just might have carried the absurdly thin plot line. But I don't know how far as the characters lacked emotional depth, they could not make the attraction look believable, they looked like actors playing parts instead of people falling in love and half the time I felt Roberts was just there to provide the grist for Grant's one liners (humourous though they may be). Roberts' character is an actress hounded by the media, desperately needing some privacy, an escape, some normality. She bumps into William Thacker and really, it should have ended there.",Notting Hill
553,kotoi-etoile-114,Notting Hill,9,11 July 2010,"This is so nice movie. I thought that it is good to fall in love with a man such as Hugh Grant. He is so cool.And it is important not to give up when I fall in love with a famous and rich people like Julia Roberts in this movie. She was so beautiful and good for this roll. And Rhys Ifans was so nice. He was so funny man in this movie,but he was also good friend of Hugh Grant. He played the important roll too. I like this type of person. It was interesting to watch his funny action. Notting Hill is so wonderful place I think, and I have visited there,so I enjoyed watching this movie with seeing the view of Notting Hill. The story of this movie is so interesting and heart warming.",Notting Hill
554,Crusader_03,The greatest romantic comedy of all time,10,28 May 2009,"I remember graduating from 8th grade and there was this girl who was just so beautiful, I couldn't breathe around her, talk, walk, etc. She was just so gorgeous and still is. I finally reconnected with her and yet she still scares me the same way she did when we were kids. This film came out a few days after we parted ways but I had seen the previews and realized she was exactly the same as Julia Roberts and I was exactly like Hugh Grant. She was a million, million miles from the world that I live in. How can two people from different worlds fall in love? Richard Curtis captivated the entire world with this film. It has often been described as the greatest love story captured on film. I have my favorite films, some of which are Oscar winners like The Godfather, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, Lord Of The Rings, etc. This one was so much more real to me because it embodied my story. I still love the girl and she has no clue, call me a loser, but it broadened my love for film, my love for love. Guys, if you have never been interested in the so called 'chick flicks' watch this one. I visited Notting Hill, the Travel Book Store, Portobello Road, the gardens. I loved it all. I highly recommend the film and highly recommend going there if you truly love this film. Thank you, Richard Curtis, for giving the world love.",Notting Hill

Rest 24 times, I have seen this movie during my Engineering. And every time, I find this movie more and more beautiful. Every character in this movie is unique and top-drawer. Dialogs are splendid, and everything is overridden by the act of William Thacker, Anna Scott, and SPIKE. Marvelous music, howling storyline+direction, and so on...

Sometimes one of the songs will pop into my head and then I get out the movie and watch it again. The story is also good, from start to finish, and the supporting characters (Honey, Spike, Max, Bella, Bernie, that annoying bookstore customer, the concierge of the Ritz) are all a charm. Hugh Grant is a 10 and Julia Roberts is a 9 or an 8. My favorite movie of both of theirs. Way better than Two Weeks Notice and My Best Friend's Wedding.

561,cab31,The Perfect Romantic Comedy,10,12 July 2005,"When it comes to romantic comedies, you just can't seem to go past something with Hugh Grant in it. Notting Hill features Grant at a high point, as his bumbling, but undoubtedly charming self opposite screen goddess Julia Roberts. The first time you watch the film, you will most likely be pre-occupied with how Julia Roberts can look so beautiful in every scene without ever looking over the top made up. Believe me, don't only watch this film once, because the second time you will discover more of its charm and be swept away by the depth of the characters. Hugh Grant is your classic nobody. The most remarkable thing about his life is the fact that he lives in a house with a blue door! His slob of a room mate will make you laugh no matter how many times you see the film, and Roberts is captivating as the beautiful movie star who knows that her looks rather than her acting talent are the key to her privileged life. The film, with its easy going sound track, captures the beauty of London's Notting Hill and actually makes you believe that you would run into these people if you were to take a stroll down its busy main street. Essentially Notting Hill is a modern day fairytale that honestly makes you believe that it is possible for a movie star to walk into your life and fall in love with you. Excellent Film",Notting Hill

That is something I dig about this film I have seen so many times. She is simple and complete. The kind of girl that a simple guy that owns a travel book shop on the outskirts of London would love to hold in his arms--and did--so she was ""just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her"". When she stood looking at him without makeup, it made it complete. That is the award winning part, to me, of this movie. You can see the complete Julia Roberts...nothing but pure.",Notting Hill

The story is a work done in the tried-and-true style of a romance movie. So if you like romance movie,you might like it.The heroine is an actress and the hero is an ordinary guy,so it could say the opposite of the Cinderella story.The scene of the first meeting of the heroine and hero is little bit unnatural and too unrealistic.Though the heroine is a big star actress,she can often go out alone. And why she loves him,that reason isn't described on screen.So I couldn't see how her feeling will develop.But,this movie has good music that works on a romantic story.Also,you can enjoy other humorous characters.Sometimes they make funny scenes on screen. I like the heroine,who is not perfect even though she is an actress and has gorgeous looks.Everyone has a weakness and defect,but we are looking for the person who accepts us as ourselves.If you watch this,you could feel a romantic and impractical world.",Notting Hill

They meet again and again accidentally. I don't have enough experiences to tell about love, but after watching this movie I can tell that lovers have to understand each other and be honest, and the most important thing when people love is their serious mind, not other people's thinking.Even though this movie is old one for me, the story made me be touched. At first, main characters have different opinions from different jobs, lifestyle, environment, private things and others. As most people think, it is hard to get into a relationship for a famous actress. But we can know that the actress is also person who wants to love a man like normal person by this movie. In this movie, she said that ""I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her"". When I heard this line, I could feel she is serious. Supporting actors' stories are also nice. Even though wife can't walk anymore, they looks so happy and love each other so much. And thanks for them, this movie can get a happy ending. When main actor has a problem, they give advice and help him. As a result, this movie made my heart flutter and want to fall in love.In addition, I like songs of this movie too.",Notting Hill

575,martinmazechen,"Notting Hill, The favorite Romantic Movie",8,9 August 2017,"Two years ago when I first had access to watch Casablanca, I was obsessed with Romantic film series. In contrast to the contemporary Chinese works, the charm of the pure feeling flowing across the protagonists' dialogues far exceeds to the aforementioned domestic movies, as a result of which I follow the tide to find the old and classic.To be called favorite does have a reason. Casablanca, indeed, owns continuous emotional scenes and conversations but I am fond of the eventual saying of William to beg Anna to reconsider. It involves a humorous sense but it doesn't cover the true flame burning and jumping in their hearts. It is more acceptable for the nowadays audience owing to its mature recording techniques and equipment which made it look better compared to Gone with the Wind. It doesn't mix any supernatural elements like About time and Passengers or the War stuffs as Allied since it is a real Romantic work.I remembered each time when the plot developed at the climax; the performers always behaved such distinctive. You maybe regard those words like the legacy of the last century. But you would discover it is a silent way to express the deepest feeling shortly afterwards when you watch it again and again. When Anna's American boyfriend came to her hotel and kissed her in front of William, he didn't behave angrily or sadly. He said I think goodbye is traditional. When William came to Anna's press conference and begged her to reconsider, Anna used another journalist to throw out a question that is how much you are going to stay in Notting hill. She gave a word that I consider the best word meaning forever: indefinitely. For June who loved this garden, From Joseph who always sat beside her.Linger_Kindness",Notting Hill
576,swanttolearn,Charming,7,23 May 2020,I watched this on Sky as it was branded a feel good film but I have no idea why. Watching Anna pick and drop William when ever she felt fit got upsetting after as the film went on. However the film overall is still one a would recommend. It has many striking and quotable lines and interesting characters that despite seeing themselves as a sad bunch are entertaining and well suited for each other. As the title tells you the film is charming with well known songs that are perfectly placed to suit the story.,Notting Hill

579,olavelg,Wonderful comedy about love and belonging,10,27 January 2013,"This is a movie I never expected to like, being a romantic comedy and all. But now I've seen the movie four times, and it is still growing on me. Every time I see it I begin to cry (which I seldom do). This is one of the very few movies that has stuck with me. I have it with me, in the back of my head, whenever I try to work out love, when I'm thinking about life, etc. It's one of the very few movies that has had this effect on me (to name some of the others: The Iron Giant, Hannah and her Sisters, Fanny and Alexander, We all loved each other so much, My night at Maud's...). I know I am not the only one who feels this way about this movie. Some of my closest friends absolutely adore it, like me, and have seen it ten times or more. Others, however, think that is merely a nice romantic comedy, that's pacing along sometimes too slow. Why do people react so differently? I'll try to explain what I think is so amazing about it.The love story: First thing, of course, is the love story. It's based on the very old story about people who can 't have each other because of difficult circumstances (think Romeo and Juliet). Here it is about social class - a normal bloke from London and a Hollywood film star. But it is also about much more. What made me see this movie in the first place was that it was mentioned in a book about introversion that I was reading (myself being a kind of sociable introvert that has experienced difficulties in relationships because girls didn't give me enough space). Both Anna (Julia Roberts) and William (Hugh Grant) are introverts. Both have a hard time just expressing their feelings or immediately doing what they feel like. But still, from the first moment there is a spark between them that they can't deny. I guess that people who love this movie identify with either Anna, William or both. It's a major part of the movie: Seeing their faces, their expressions, their conversation... if you identify with them and intensely hope them to find love, you get drawn in. If not, you will find it boring. For me, I have found that I identify with both Anna and William. Anna, of course, is every man's dream: The star and beauty that shows up from nowhere and becomes a part of your life. So far, as a guy, I'm all with William. But in terms of how they interact... I know that I'm more like Anna. She is afraid of getting hurt, she's afraid of giving away her heart, she has a temper. She is difficult. William, on the other hand, is the good guy. He knows that he loves her all from the start, and he never shies away from saying it. Some lines are especially poignant. Once, when she comes to his house in a state of confusion, he just says: ""This is the place"". This line always gives me the shivers. So simple. So moving. And it says so much: No matter how difficult circumstances are, his place is the right place for her. I know that I, unfortunately being a bit Anna-like when it comes to being afraid of letting go and giving away my heart, long to meet a girl who will be like William: Who will just love me, in spite of my quirks and fears, and just be there, and not give up on me. The humor: This movie is not just about love, it is also very funny. Spike, the outspoken and vulgar roomie of William, provides constant comic relief. The humor is very British - dry, self- depreciating, semi-intellectual, at times surreal (but nice). The dialogue is sparkling all through the movie. love it. But I suspect that this is also a part of the film that some people will love, and others not so much.Place, friendship and belonging: Ultimately, however, i believe that the reason I and so many others see this movie time and time again is because it is about more than romantic love. It is about friendship, and ultimately about belonging. About finding a place in the world that is YOUR place, and then staying there. William's friends are always around, supporting him (and making fun of each other). The love between William's best friend Max and his wheel-chair bound wife Bella is very moving. And not to forget: The whole movie is called Notting Hill (an area in London). It 's not called ""William and Anna"", or something like that. Simply: Notting Hill. The area. The opening scene is about this area: William goes around explains that this is where he lives, and will continue to spend ""his hours and years"", and why he loves it so much. This is where William and his friends are grounded. It is their life, their area, their place in the world. And, the whole movie is about Anna coming to this place, and seeing the beauty in it, compared to the superficial world of Hollywood. Notting Hill/Williams's circle vs. Holllywood: 1-0. Summing it up, I guess this is why I keep coming back to this movie. If I feel lost, not sure about my place in the world, or wondering if I will ever find a girl to love who will love me back and that we'll be able to make it work - then I see this movie. It reminds me that life is ultimately about belonging somewhere, about having friends and family, and to dare to love. Not bad for a romantic comedy, eh? (and, of course - the acting of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts is superb. The filming is beautiful. The only annoying and dated thing is the music. But even that can't ruin a perfect movie)Highly recommended.",Notting Hill
